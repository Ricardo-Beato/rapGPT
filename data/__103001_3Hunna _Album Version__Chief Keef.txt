38 Contributors3Hunna (Album Version) Lyrics
Young Chop on the beat
Sosa baby, you know I'm rockin baby
GBE, O'block, bang bang
Nigga I'm three hunna, bang

I'm cooling wit my youngins
And what we smoke one hunna
But nigga I'm three hunna
Click clack pow, now he running
Don't be fuckin wit my youngins
Them niggas be drumming
They take ya ass down
Shit we need them bricks or something
Keep this shit one hunna
I keep this shit three hunna
I pull up in that Audi
You pull up in that Honda

A fuck nigga don't wanna be it (no)
No, no, I like my bitch conceited (my bitch conceited)

I'm cooling wit my young niggas (wit my young niggas)
A lot of kush, a lot of guns nigga (a lot of guns nigga)
You see you us you better run nigga (better run nigga)
Bullets hot like the sun nigga (pow)
She like Sosa, I'm a big fan (I'm a big fan)
Bitch I'm leaning like a kickstand (kickstand)

Fuck a Tooka gang bitch, I'm 3hunna (bang bang bang)

We got the hood locked worth a 100 mill
Need 250 more, Double M this shit for real
