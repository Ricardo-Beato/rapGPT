5 ContributorsHope For Tomorrow Lyrics
Yeah, ha

You ever given your all but it's still not enough
And then it builds up a lot of lust, but in God I trust
Cuz I'ma make it, the only option a nigga's got
I work for hours, and barely sleep, shit I deal a lot
Recording songs while in the area, triggers pop
They call him protege, next up, guess the kid is hot
Underappreciated, ahead of his time
Without even sketching a dime
Write the cleverest lines
I said we in mind
Anyways, I promise that I'll stop the bragging
Cuz that just leaves the envy and plus a lot of madness
That's why niggas is always broke, we just gots have it
Wearing this watch, that's platinum, but in the heart, that's plastic
And to be completely honest, it don't make no sense
Fucking cop in the chain before you pay your rent
Now the mindset of a dumb, average nigga
And the kids can't starve, he gotta grab the trigga
And it's funny cuz the same ones that's laughing witcha
Will stab you quicker with the pads of scriptures
If that makes them advance to richer
And the old heads pass the liquor
Drowning in sorrow, no hope for tomorrow but
You might also like
Uh oh, looks like the future's looking bright
I promised mama that we gon' make it through the night
Uh oh, tomorrow's always a better day
Tomorrow's always a better day
I'm saying that the future's looking bright
I promised mama that we gon' make it through the night
Uh oh, tomorrow's always a better day
Tomorrow's always a better day

Have you ever given your all, they see your conscious fall
Birth in my parents, through spirit, they see my mama crawl
You on your own, the feeling to know your truly grown
Struggling daily, gon' only have me to run my home
A transformation from hesitation to we gon' make it
Mind is enslaved, they took my patience and stripped me naked
Can't make excuses cuz niggas strive up for Harvard students
But crashing late in the statements, you know my people doing
Another day, another dollar, tryna pay the rent
Money never well spent
Shit ain't even making sense
I pray to God but knowing damn well he see my flaws
I only call on His name, when I'm just tryna ball
So I hope tomorrow, money just gon' end all my sorrow
So all my hopes and dreams I wanted, we gon' look to ball
I'm an investor in the past, never overnight
Promise mama it's gon' be alright because the future bright
Uh oh, looks like the future's looking bright
I promised mama that we gon' make it through the night
Uh oh, tomorrow's always a better day
Tomorrow's always a better day
I'm saying that the future's looking bright
I promised mama that we gon' make it through the night
Uh oh, tomorrow's always a better day
Tomorrow's always a better day

Now, throw your hands in the sky, if you fuck with it
Time to chill, just vibe and just get uplifted
Throw your hands in the sky, if you fuck with it
Time to chill, just vibe and just get uplifted
Throw your hands in the sky, if you fuck with it
Throw your hands in the sky, if you fuck with it
Time to chill, just vibe and just get uplifted
Now, throw your hands in the sky, if you fuck with it

Uh oh, looks like the future's looking bright
I promised mama that we gon' make it through the night
Uh oh, tomorrow's always a better day
Tomorrow's always a better day
I'm saying that the future's looking bright
I promised mama that we gon' make it through the night
Uh oh, tomorrow's always a better day
Tomorrow's always a better day1Embed
