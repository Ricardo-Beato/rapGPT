12 ContributorsWin, Lose or Draw Lyrics
(12-09, 12-09, 12-09)
(30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)
Huh?
Go

These bitch ass niggas act like they be on their period or somethin'
I don't play with niggas, period, get hit with the drum
Ain't no mystery, my heart black like Black History Month
I show no sympathy, I'll have them people searchin' for months
Cut off his legs, chopper hit it and it knocked off his knees
Cut off his head, cut it off, then bring that shit back to me
Cut off his dreads, heard they did it in the middle of the street
I made him famous, R.I.P., I put that boy on TV
11 Alive, Fox 5, Channel 2, BET
Why would Gucci pay you when he could do it for free?
I'm too rich for broke bitches, I ain't fuckin' for free
I don't need these borin' bitches, mane, these hoes need me
Born in Bessemer, Alabama, the worst place in the world
For a Black family to raise a lil' boy and girl
If you ain't talkin' 'bout money, then quit talkin' to me
Cash rules everything around 1017 (Gucci)

Okay, huh, yeah, been through it all
I gotta go hard, win, lose or draw
I cannot get caught up in the pen, years and thoughts
I cannot get throwed off, I just got to go off
Trips to the dealership, trips to the vault, uh
Checks in the mail, make it flip, summersault, uh
I gotta stay locked in, I cannot get throwed off, okay, okay

1017, it's a scary thing
13-17, take over everything
Now you hold weight beyond measuring
White chalk, tape, we murder every scene
Came from the trench, not the trap, though
Real music left, we brought it back, though
Gotta put the streets on our back more
Gotta put the city on the map more
QM and Guwop on attack mode
Ride on you niggas like a RAV4
Niggas talkin' down from the back, though
Tell 'em, "Take a picture, it'll last long"

I'm not no blue collar criminal, so I don't do subliminal (No)
I drop a check and board the jet, on to another M and M (Go)
I ain't got no spare time, I ain't on that square time (Huh?)
My Richard Millie a milli', really don't use it to tell time (Well damn)
My young hitters sharp, but treat big niggas like they small fries
MAC-11 with the chicken nuts and they super-sized
Guwop got a rare mind, people call him Einstein (Gucci)
I make money in my spare time, but I don't got no spare dimes (Guwop)

Huh, yeah, been through it all
I gotta go hard, win, lose or draw
I cannot get caught up in the pen, years and thoughts
I cannot get throwed off, I just got to go off
Trips to the dealership, trips to the vault, uh
Checks in the mail, make it flip, summersault, uh
I gotta stay locked in, I cannot get throwed off, okay2Embed
