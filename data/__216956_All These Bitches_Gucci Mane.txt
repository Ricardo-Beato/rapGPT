40 ContributorsAll These Bitches Lyrics
I got hard dick for all these bitches
I get all their numbers, I don’t call these bitches
No patience for relations, kiss my 'Rari bitches
Niggas don’t know us, we never saw these niggas

I got V12 sittin' on rims and I parked the bull back in my Benz
Got a FN with a seatbelt strapped on it 'cause it's my friend
Breaking bricks down in my den, I got bills stacked to my chin
Diamond jeans cost an M&M, why? So bright cut off a limb
Look at me then look at him
Hard top Bentley, Bentley rims
Fucked two sisters, wet the crib
In a drop top dunk, I broke the rims
Back to back bitch, call them twins
Got a hard top X and a drop top M
Call me Iceberg Slim, can’t fuck with him
2K on weed, hell, that’s a deal
5K on lean, I'm leanin' now
Drunk two whole pints, I'm dreaming now
Your girlfriends a semen demon
Big Guwop she screaming out
Drop top 'Rari showing cleavage, I'm on Cleveland, call it Bleveland
Knocked your bitch, don’t need no reason
Take my bitch then call it even
You might also like
I got hard dick for all these bitches
I get all their numbers, I don’t call these bitches
No patience for relations, kiss my 'Rari bitches
Niggas don’t know us, we never saw these niggas
You can hold this 30 out this 40 nigga
You die, you hit Forgis, that's on Shawty, nigga
We don’t trust these bitches or these niggas
Got the big face Rollies 40 pointers, nigga

Nigga tried to knock me off
But these niggas extra soft
How the hell you just start robbing? Come and try and test a boss
Played the hand that I was dealt
40 make you patty melt
I don’t send no niggas, dawg, I do that shit by myself
Co-defendant that's a no
Can’t have that shit fly in court
One thing about Young Juice, my niggas spot a pussy like a scope
Since you pussy, I'ma send these hollow tips down your throat
Killer-killer, murder-murder, flip that nigga like a burger
I don’t shoot for legs so you know ain't no 'tempted murder
And Young Juiceman stay with fire
Make me put you on a burner
Smoke you like a cancer stick
Make your mom them a loner
Talking all that tough talk but your ass know you baloney
Born to go to war, man you got me talking like I'm Kony
I got hard dick for all these bitches
I get all their numbers, I don’t call these bitches
No patience for relations, kiss my 'Rari bitches
Niggas don’t know us, we never saw these niggas
You can hold this 30 out this 40 nigga
You die, you hit Forgis, that's on Shawty, nigga
We don’t trust these bitches or these niggas
Got the big face Rollies 40 pointers, nigga10Embed
