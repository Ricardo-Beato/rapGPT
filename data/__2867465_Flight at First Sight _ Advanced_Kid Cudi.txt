Mmm, mmm, mmm

I like that, I'm into it (I like that)
She's a hypnotist (I like that)
And I'm on the list (Right up top)
Looks I can't resist
(We can no longer, we can no longer, wait, wait)
Flight at first sight, flight at first sight, flight at first sight
Oh my, my, my, oh my, my, my
(We can no longer, we can no longer, wait, wait)
Mmm, mmm, mmm, I like that
I'm into it, I like that
She's a hypnotist, I like that
And I'm on the list (Right up top)
(We can no longer, we can no longer, wait, wait)
Looks I can't resist
Flight at first sight, flight at first sight, flight at first sight
Oh my, my, my, oh my, my, my
(We can no longer, we can no longer, wait, wait)

One look what it took, one look what it took
One look I was took, one look at this crook
Taking flight at first site, mmm, talking flight at first sight
Flight at first sight, mmm, taking flight at first sight
Oh my, my, my
One look what it took, one look what it took
One look I was took, one look at this crook
(We can no longer, we can no longer, wait, wait)
Flight at first sight, mmm, talking flight at first sight
Talking light at first sight, mmm, taking flight at first sight
Oh my, my, my (We can no longer, we can no longer)
Cover me

Uh (Heh, Heh, Heh)
Mmm, hmm hmm, uh huh, uh huh

Hey you, so tell me, what's the low down? (Uh, say what?)
What's the hassle, tell me what's the low down? (Uh, say what?)
Come on, I know you're sexy, come on, let's take off
The seance, it's no cost to get lost and be found in the sound
I came through to throw down (Uh, say what?)
I ask who came for the show down (Uh, say what?)
Yeah, so exclusive, I don't mean to be a loser
Just go on let your hair down
Let down little hunny, she cuttin' to it, through it, through it
I'm on now, come on, knew it, knew it, knew it
Seem to be strange, now I'm barricaded in women
That's a given, I'm in heaven on Mars so you're now
Head over heels when I slide in them (Yes)
That shit, I wanna see you (Yes)
Really love the good in this bitch (Yes)
With a nigga so advanced
Bmm bmm bmm, bmm bmm bmm (Uh, say what?)
Bmm bmm bmm, bmm bmm bmm (Yeah)
Bmm bmm bmm, bmm bmm bmm
Bmm bmm bmm, bmm bmm bmm
Bmm bmm bmm, bmm bmm bmm
Bmm bmm bmm, bmm bmm bmm
Are you advanced, I'd love to advance with you (With you)
Yes I am entranced, so damn entranced with you (With you)
Yes, are you advanced, I'd love to advance with you (With you)
Yes I am entranced, I'm so damn entranced with you (With you)
Yes I am entranced, I am entranced with you (With you)
Yes I am entranced, I am entranced with you (With you)
Yes I am entranced, I am entranced with you (With you)
Yes I am entranced, I am entranced with you (With you)
With you, with you, with you

Tell me what else can I say
I'm feelin' okay, without the devil on my case today, aye
I does it, does it, does it, does it
Does it, does it does it
Does it
Tell me what else can I say
I'm feelin' okay, without the devil on my case today, aye
I does it, does it, does it
I does it, does it, does it, does it, does it
I does it, does it, does it, does it, does it
I does it, does it, does it, does it, does it
I does it, does it, does it, does it, does it
Boom boom, Boom boom
Boom boom, Boom boom
Boom boom, Boom boom
