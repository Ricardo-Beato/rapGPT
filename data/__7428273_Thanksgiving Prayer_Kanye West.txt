4 ContributorsThanksgiving Prayer Lyrics
Boom boom boom Westside
Kanye West, Conway West Side
You never noticed that, did you?
The, uh
Hello my name is Ye
And this is my super super super super super long Thanksgiving prayer
On this Thanksgiving, I'm so thankful for family
My blood family, my fans and our haters
We love you too
On Thanksgiving on Christmas morning
Not the night before or the day, just the morning
We're thankful for our current civilization of eight billion people
Our ancestors and our children
I'm writing this prayer on my way back from taking my mini me to his first football game
Saint got to play catch with Tom Brady before the game
This is a God's dream
My mini me is a mix of two of my favorite things
Me and my wife's face
All I think about every day is how I get my family back together
And how I heal the pain that I've caused
I take accountability for my actions
New word alert, misactions
The one thing that all my successes and failures have in common is me
Let's start with A alcohol
I would drink to take the stress away and knock the edge off
Drinking affected my health and the health of people around me, around me
Because I already had a hair-trigger temper and this just heightened it
B episodes, I went into a manic episode in 2016 and I was placed under heavy medication
since then I went on and off the medication which left me susceptible to other episodes
Which my wife and family and fans have had to endure
Ego, my ego has a tendency to go past the threshold of being motivating and entertaining to just being overbearing
There are ways to show confidence without arrogance
Temper, now I know none of y'all would ever picture this but
Sometimes I scream, ha
And that screaming might have helped me tell off everyone who doubted me in music
But that screaming did not help me keep my family together
Religion, self-righteous Christian behavior
When I got saved, it did not immediately make me a better person
It made me a self-righteous Christian
Mix that with being rich, famous and very very very very very very attractive
And you got a Molotov cocktail ready to be thrown through the window of anyone who ever disagreed with me
I was arrogant with my Jesus
Like I just got me some Jesus at the Gucci store with a stimulus check
Let's go with politics here
Good Lord, my wife did not like me wearing the red hat
Being a good wife, she just wanted to protect me and our family
I made me and our family a target by not aligning with Hollywood's political stance
And that was hard for our marriage
Then I ran for president without proper preparation
and no allies on either side
I embarrassed my wife in the way I presented information about our family during the one and thank God only press conference
All my dad had to say afterwards was
"Write your speech next time son"
F is for finances
I spent money like crazy
I mean, it's the craziest thing I've done
And I've done a lot of crazy things
As the priest of my home I must watch my own money and secure our finances
This is America, so people don't consider stealing to be stealing
They just chalk it up to greed, consumerism and capitalism
I've let people use me, I've had giant entourages
People around me, just to make me feel good about myself
I've had to learn that I had to take accountability
We always judge and tell other people what they should do
But we can only take accountability for ourselves and our children
This Thanksgiving, I'm thankful for the family that my wife has given me
I'm thankful for the life that God has given me
And I'm thankful for your time, attention and patience
In Jesus name, AmenEmbed
