(Zaytoven)
Now the bitch she wants a tissue and she thought it was a tissue
She say she got some issues and she thought I was gon' listen
This bitch thought it was a Fisker, ayy
Unofficial, ayy
Boy, you unofficial, smoking loud, you smoking whisper
Went and got your bitch, I rolled up, thought she was a Fisker
She went and got your bitch, I rolled up, thought it was a Fisker

Sat his ass down in my office, then dismissed him
He say he wanna smoke, I wanna fuck his sister
She think 'cause I'm a Leo that I'ma kiss her
Told the bitch, "Kiss my dick," then I had to dismiss her
Boy, you unofficial, I be smoking loud, you smoking whisper
Went and get your sister, rolled up, she thought it was a Fisker
Sosa, why you always shitting? I'm official, it's the tissue
Call the plug man up for the dope to dismiss her

Bitch say she got an issue and she think that I'ma listen
My wrist look like I'm whipping in the kitchen with the chickens
Put the pounds in the trap back and Olinda do the dishes
I got straight hot shit, a nigga come up in the kitchen
My sister gonna be a lawyer, so her ass gon' go to college
Just in case I get in trouble, run into some fucking problems
Riding in the passenger seat is a rocket launcher
I'ma serve a nigga up, Benihana's right in front 'em
I'm cooling, counting money, getting top, smoking Aiki
I pull up, get the money, yeah, bitch, more than likely
The bitch hit me, say she got her friends and they dikey
Like a new toy, these hoes wanna try me
Pull up, riding fast, now I'm running from the Aiki
Always talkin' 'bout pull up 'cause I pull up daily
Come get your bitch, come get your sister 'cause they hot like Sosa saying
I'ma take this shit back, bitch, call me Sosa Baby
What's up in the chopper? Bitch, it's Jojo and K-Ci
'Cause it sing like an opera, twenty shots leave me eighty
Since I got these Benjis, I swear I been going crazy
Bitch, I'm grown as fuck, I act like I was born up in the '80s
I got shooters in LA and I got some up in the Little Haiti
We got choppers like Nigeria, choppers like Jamaica
I'm a dread shaker, you would think Chief Sosa was Jamaican
Let me roll up this Tooka because I been tripping lately
You might also like
Sat his ass down in my office, then dismissed him
He say he wanna smoke, I wanna fuck his sister
She think 'cause I'm a Leo that I'ma kiss her
Told the bitch, "Kiss my dick," then I had to dismiss her
Boy, you unofficial, I be smoking loud, you smoking whisper
Went and get your sister, rolled up, she thought it was a Fisker
Sosa, why you always shitting? I'm official, it's the tissue
Call the plug man up for the dope to dismiss her

Send some niggas down your chimney like Santa Claus with gifts
When it comes to the chopper, bitch, all about the giving
Lighting shit up like Christmas, what the fuck is on your wish list?
Up gloing be the money, downfall be the bitches
I'm a Christian, fuck with Buddha, you a Jew, that's religion
Balmains when I'm on some baller shit, I'm true to my religion
My dick explaining the story, he say, "That bitch ain't tried to kiss me"
I'm like, "That bitch did kiss you, why the fuck you got the hickey?"
I'm counting on the fetty and I'm smoking on the pissy
I have my i8 sports car fucking on your hemi
I'm smoking Christmas trees, this bitch had thought it was a fucking fifty
I'm doing 12 o'clock on Banshees if I'm slidin' up to Philly
If you ain't know her, man, she is a stunt four-wheeler
Hop out my car, look at how I'm stunting on niggas
I'ma count this money, can't be counting on niggas
Look at all this money, it's just pouting on a nigga
Sat his ass down in my office, then dismissed him
He say he wanna smoke, I wanna fuck his sister
She think 'cause I'm a Leo that I'ma kiss her
Told the bitch, "Kiss my dick," then I had to dismiss her
Boy, you unofficial, I be smoking loud, you smoking whisper
Went and get your sister, rolled up, she thought it was a Fisker
Sosa, why you always shitting? I'm official, it's the tissue
Call the plug man up for the dope to dismiss her3Embed
