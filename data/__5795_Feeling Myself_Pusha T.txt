25 ContributorsFeeling Myself Lyrics
I’m feelin myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I’ma tell them that they can get lost
Cause I’m feelin myself, it’s my world
I’m spending money like a rich white girl
I’m gon' ball like I’m 7 feet tall
I don’t know about y'all, but I’ma get off, cause I’m feelin myself

Oh, what a feelin, the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathed in them millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my Nino, smelling like a kilo
But I’m downy fresh soft white like my pillow
Feelin myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself

I’m feelin myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I’ma tell them that they can get lost
Cause I’m feelin myself, it’s my world
I’m spending money like a rich white girl
I’m gon' ball like I’m 7 feet tall
I don’t know about y'all, but I’ma get off, cause I’m feelin myself

Baby take your chance, never mind what you’re hearing
I can change your life tell me what are you comparing
Put you on the red carpet tell them what you’re wearing
Shop 'til you drop they say sharing is caring
More than my winnings, we can share opinions
Like baby steps, we can share beginnings
Walk before you run, but she so independent
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We so real, got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed, watching Deal or No Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself

I’m feelin myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I’ma tell them that they can get lost
Cause I’m feelin myself, it’s my world
I’m spending money like a rich white girl
I’m gon' ball like I’m 7 feet tall
I don’t know about y'all, but I’ma get off, cause I’m feelin myself

I propose a toast to every living kingpin
Smart enough to delegate their work to their wing man
Keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling hand
Play my cards right, now I’m looking at a dream hand
Yeah, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it, you can call me Smoking Ace
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself
I’m feelin myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I’ma tell them that they can get lost
Cause I’m feelin myself, it’s my world
I’m spending money like a rich white girl
I’m gon' ball like I’m 7 feet tall
I don’t know about y'all, but I’ma get off, cause I’m feelin myself3Embed
