Woo, zone (What, ayy, what)
DMX (What, what)
Ruff Ryders (What) here we go (What)
Yeah (What, what)

That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)

Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes (Yeah)

That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Bouncе) that's my dog, yeah (Bounce)
That's my dog, yeah (Bouncе) that's my dog, yeah (Dance)
That's my dog, yeah (Yeah) that's my dog, yeah (Woah)
That's my dog, yeah (Woo) that's my dog, yeah (Woo woo)

This is dog for life, somethin' you don't know about
No pot to piss in, no window to throw it out
You know what we do to bitch-ass niggas, we ho 'em out
You ain't gotta worry 'bout the score, we gon' blow 'em out
Earl, David, Jason, gotta be Sean
Gots to keep on keepin' up, I gotta get on
In the hood right now when the economy strong
These my niggas that I'm talkin' 'bout, follow the song (Listen)
Yeah, everybody wanna be down, they playin' spades
To me, all y'all niggas is clowns playin' charades (Clowns)
You hit a couple chicks in the town, playin' with AIDS
It's hot over there, my nigga, play in the shade
You see, we playin' with bullets, y'all playin' with blades
No handguns, we all playin' with Ks (Brrt)
For one of these niggas, I'll come with fuckin' grenades (Boom)
Exactly how many times do I have to say
You might also like
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go), ayo

We ain't cool like that, homie, we barely even talk (Facts)
Every rapper ain't close 'cause they comin' out New York
I ain't get a call from you when my mom was in the morgue
Or a nigga needed money, so how the fuck is you my dog?
Got a lil' older, seen shit for what it was
Yeah, I known you longer, but I like him for what he does
No talk, .38 revolver just because
Straight liquor, that cranberry fuckin' up my buzz
That's my dog, yeah, we done got it off the ground
Turned it to Ruff Ryders, gave niggas a new sound
You heard I was from Yonkers like it was a new town
I'm lookin' at these labels, like, "Who the fuck is these new clowns?"
Silverback, nigga, can't wait for me to fall
Same time, their bitches can't wait for me to call
These hatin' motherfuckers I be tryin' to avoid
Let's do it for Breonna, let's do this shit for Floyd

That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)
You can feel the love or all the evil that men do
Either playin' God or a dog that needs a menu
I was born a wolf, my nigga, let me continue
Come from a town where niggas fly out the window
Either they got thrown or the dust did it
Nah, the knife didn't kill him, but the rust did it
Lookin' at the new McLaren, need a clutch in it
That gun probably got a homi', but I fucks with it (I fucks with it)
All these niggas been my dogs since the lowlife days (My dogs)
Got a forty-five, shit'll probably blow like haze
You don't want a homi', you should let me go my way
I'm like Doughboy, you gon' wanna roll like Tre (Yeah)
All my niggas know the ticket on the heroin price
Every bar that I say is sort of like Klondike (Hah)
Yeah, that's cold motherfucker, get a hold motherfucker (Get a hold)
That's my dog, if he asked, I'll take your soul motherfucker

That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)

It just takes one shot from one gun by one dude
A reason to get it, what's up? Then fuck you
You know how a nigga move, it's how a nigga move
Fuckin' snake, you shoulda ate when your plate had food
I'ma say what the fuck I want, let it do what it do
And wherever the fuck you at, nigga, we comin' through
I ain't playin' with you niggas, I got kids your age
I ain't your father that shoulda stayed, too late, you shoulda prayed
You ain't know, motherfucker? I'm from the home of the brave
Where we played in the mountains 'cause we lived in a cave
When I came into the game, I crashed through the wave
I'm the best, somethin' that I'm takin' to the grave
Motherfuckers' jeans is too tight to be fuckin' with dog
So stop fuckin' with me, 'cause I ain't fuckin' with y'all
I might have dropped the ball, but I got it right back
My man dove for the out of bounds save and shot it right back
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)

Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes (Yeah)

That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Bounce), that's my dog, yeah (Bounce)
That's my dog, yeah (Bounce), that's my dog, yeah (Dance)
That's my dog, yeah (Yeah), that's my dog, yeah (Woah)
That's my dog, yeah (Woo), that's my dog, yeah (Woo woo)Embed
