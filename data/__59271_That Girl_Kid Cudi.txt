Ayy girl

Fine, as she wanna be, that girl
Gentle, as she wanna be, that girl
When I sleep at night
I think about, that girl
Where she come from?
She's beautiful, that girl

Ooo-ooo that girl
Ooo-ooo that girl

In my mind, I see her (My dream girl)
In my mind, I meet her (My dream girl)
Then, we dance, we dance, I wanna keep her (My dream girl)
Yeah yeah
That girl

Ayy, oh-oh
Ayy, oh-oh
You might also like
That girl, nice girl
I leave home to see you girl
Remember when I crept through the window (Yeah)
Remember when I crept through the window (Yeah)
Remember when I crept through the window (Yeah) girl
Remember when I snuck in your bedroom (Yeah)
Remember when I snuck in your bedroom (Yeah)
Remember when I snuck in your bedroom (Yeah) girl

Ooo-ooo that girl
Ooo-ooo that girl
