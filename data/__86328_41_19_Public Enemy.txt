6 Contributors41:19 Lyrics
I come out my crib
Walk out on the block its hot
(Yo there's a black car parked on the corner hot boys)
TNT be creepin'
While niggas be on the side of the soda machine sleeping
Word up kid, they seen what you did
In the car parked way down the block with binoculars
That's what they got
Helicopters parked out on the roof
10,000 disposable cameras taking pictures for proof
You know what this is
That all y'all, get on the wall y'all
Take your worth out ya ass in the stall y'all
Or you take a mean bad fall y'all
TNT, they be playin' for keeps
Wipe you off your teeth like cavity creep

Word is bond, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?
Yo its hot, what they got, (bratatat-tatat) 41 shots
Word is bond, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?
Yo its hot, what they got, (bratatat-tatat) 41 shots
You might also like
Bad boys bad boys what ya gonna do
If you get caught by our muthafuckin' crew?
Shot forty-one, only hit nineteen
They need target practice, that's what it seems to me
Allie-Al is Sharpton than a tack
I'ma be like Allie-Al and fight ya back
What, do you want to go to war, you want war?
Do you want to go to war, you want war?
Ill bury all you cocka-la-roaches for breakfast
Shit you out and throw you in the water for the next fish
Cause I can do that shit, G
F-L-A-V-O-R-F-L-A-V, see
To the highest degree times three
That's what you get fuckin' with my family

Word is bond, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?
Yo its hot, what they got, (bratatat-tatat) 41 shots
Word is bond, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?
Yo its hot, what they got, (bratatat-tatat) 41 shots

Shootin' at OJ, don't know if he did it
Racist motherfuckers mad cause they ain't with it
The police get out the cars searchin' for nuthin'
If you got sumthin', then they got you for sumthin'
That's fucked up, the way they play dirty
Lock em up in jail until he's past thirty
They don't give a fuck about you
They don't give a fuck about me, I'm past thirty three
Word is born, born is my word
I got you before my word fails
Fuck whatcha heard
I keep it real, you never catch me fakin'
When it comes down to money that's what im making
Dont try and take my shit yo, I know lex yo
Ill have a fit yo
Ill turn the whole mutherfuckin' block on you yo
And that leaves you with nowhere to go
Secretly by the police you was hired
You my favorite customer, I didn't know you was wired
A nik on the ground, covered by my feet
Ay yo rah get the heat
Word is bond, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?
Yo its hot, what they got, (bratatat-tatat) 41 shots
Word is bond, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?
Yo its hot, what they got, (bratatat-tatat) 41 shotsEmbed
