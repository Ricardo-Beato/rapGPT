39 ContributorsOut on Bail Lyrics
Oh, I posted bail?
I'm out this motherfucker? (Hahaha)
I can go? Ah, fuck y'all, ayy, fuck the judge
Fuck the motherfuckin' district attorney (Fuck you), the prosecutor (Fuck you)
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box (Fuck you)
Fuck all y'all, 'cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
Y'all ain't never gon' see me in this motherfucker again
Drop that shit, Em (Haha, yo)
Let these old punk-ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Niggas ain't goin' back to court, you stank-ass bitches

I'm stuck in jail, the DEA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail, if I had a good attorney
Want to label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up, I ain't trippin'
In the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk 'cause I'm rappin', they askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep, they takin' Polaroids
And I'm tryin' to use the phone, but they makin' noise
Man, I wish I had my Glock, 'cause it's major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastic in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone, that's my word
'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send more pictures, and make me some more riches
To all the suckers on the block, talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
'Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshit bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutter, I was saved from hell
And I'm a thug, I was raised in jail, now I'm out on bail
You might also like
Out on bail (Hahaha)
You know what fuckin' time it is
Thug life will never fail
I'm out on bail, thug life, nigga
Fifty-thousand, bitch, thug life, nigga
I'm out on bail
Out on bail
Ayy, hand me some motherfuckin' cold 40's in this bitch, nigga
Thug life will never fail
'Cause I'm out on bail, thug life, nigga
Ayy, pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex, thug life, nigga
Yes, bitch, that's a Presidential, come on

I'm stuck in jail, and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail, if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart 'cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark when I start shit
Rippin' up the scene, as a teen I was at it, hey
And sellin' product to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I got a lot of love
Hangin' out with the OG's, shootin' up the clubs
And momma told me, "Don't hang with the homies"
But they got me if they need me, then it's on, G
Got me sittin' in a cell, a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven?
Got my bitches on the outside, writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me, and that shit'll get better
I don't believe 'em cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your picture's on fire
I gotta be a player, so I stay strong
'Cause I know that I won't be away long (Hahaha)
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets, I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous, I'm on bail
Out on bail
Thug life will never fail
You see me? Out on bail, bitch, thug life, nigga
You know what time it is, thug life, nigga
I'm out on bail
Out on bail
Alright, ayy, y'all don't need to know about it, man, you know
Thug life will never fail
Out on bail, thug life, nigga
Y'all blow that shit, thug life, nigga
So motherfuckers know how we do this, thug life, nigga

Get me up out this, yo, get me up out this motherfucker, man
Out on bail
These motherfuckers tryin' to harass a player
Thug life will never fail
Man, I ain't goin' for this old crazy old shit, thug life, nigga
Dealin' with you scandalous bitches, thug life, nigga
Y'all niggas look like some of these crooked-ass motherfuckin' judges
Out on bail
But, until then, here go the motherfuckin' fetti, I'm out on bail
Thug life will never fail
I'll see you motherfuckers at the next show, thug life, nigga
By the way, where is my bitch? Thug life, nigga
Huh, huh
Out on bail
You know, that's that old real thug shit
Thug life will never fail
Real live thug shit, genuine, thug life, nigga
You know what I'm sayin'? Thug life, nigga
I wouldn't waste your motherfuckin' time with no bullshit, baby
Out on bail
Trust me, it's that real shit
Thug life will never fail
Talkin' 'bout that shit you can be tellin' your grandkids about, you know?
Thug life, nigga

This is for my fuckin' nigga 'em and the motherfuckin' boys
Out on bail
