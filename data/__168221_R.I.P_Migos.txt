38 ContributorsR.I.P Lyrics
Zaytoven
Yeah
I wanna take a minute to say rest in peace to all the OGs man
(Rest in peace man)
Know a young nigga learn from that shit
(Rest in peace Pimp C)
Anybody that's lost anybody, man this for you
(Rest in peace OG Dee man)
Takeoff, turn up

Two cups filled up with Easter pink (Lean)
Take a minute, rest in peace, to Pimp C (Damn)
Double G, Louis V all over me (Designer shit)
Take a minute, rest in peace, OG Dee (Damn man)
Two cups filled up with Easter pink (That lean)
Take a minute, R.I.P, to Pimp C (Pimp C)
Double G, Louis V all over me (Young rich nigga shit)
Take a minute, R.I.P, OG Dee (OG Dee)

Two cups filled up with actavis (Lean, drank)
Damn! rest in peace, to Pimp C (Pimp C)
Louis V all over me I'm living luxury (Louis V)
Take a minute, rest in peace, OG Dee (OG Dee)
I remember the last time when Double talked to me (What Double say?)
Told me "y'all the hottest niggas in the street" (Hot, hot)
He told me bout the dirty world and fucked up industry (It's crazy)
These niggas they don't love you and they want you for your currency (Guap)
So I go buy a pint of lean (Lean)
I'm thinking 'bout moving to Canada but I know they 'gon be still watching me (They watching)
I know that they're after me, but I won't let them capture me (Nah)
And everyday, and every night, I pray they won't shackle me (Yes)

Two cups filled up with Easter pink (Lean, lean)
Take a minute, rest in peace, to Pimp C (Damn)
Double G, Louis V all over me (Designer shit)
Take a minute, rest in peace, OG Dee (Damn man)
Two cups filled up with Easter pink (That lean, lean)
Take a minute, R.I.P, to Pimp C (Pimp C)
Double G, Louis V all over me (Two cups, two cups, two cups)
Take a minute, R.I.P (Woo), OG Dee

Lost my daddy young, nigga, I was only four (My daddy died)
Damn, now I gotta pour a four (Lean, lean)
Got my momma on my back, she really love me though (Momma)
Taking all this pressure so I had to pull a kick door (Kick door)
I understand I have committed a sin (I understand)
Double Dee said "Keep going hard on these fuck niggas"
Gotta know we 'gon win (Double Dee)
So I'm sitting in my room reading the Bible (Sitting)
Skip wiping down a dirty rifle (Skip)
Never know when it's your last supper, nigga (Nah)
So you gotta keep you some disciples, gone (Gone)

Two cups filled up with Easter pink (Lean, lean)
Take a minute, rest in peace, to Pimp C (Damn)
Double G, Louis V all over me (Designer shit)
Take a minute, rest in peace, OG Dee (Damn man)
Two cups filled up with Easter pink (That lean, lean)
Take a minute, R.I.P, to Pimp C (Pimp C)
Double G, Louis V all over me (Young rich nigga shit)
Take a minute, R.I.P, OG Dee (OG Dee)8Embed
