7 ContributorsNever Woulda Known Lyrics
I been gifted from the start to the finish
But as I've gotten older it's been harder to listen
Middle school is when I started resistin
My teachers' told my parents
Yeah as smart as this kid is, his heart isn't in it
Now they got me arguin with them
Cause Mom and Dad never thought I'd start a new mission
Had it all planned out like I be part of the system
Now I'm shaking things up like the Parkinsons syndrome
I wasn't made for that 9 to 5
I am not the same as you
I can see a difference between everything you say and do
I can tell you need somebody round
That's gonna state the truth
So basically I'm saying
You just talking while we making moves
And this is just the start of my life
I done came a long way from that Guitar Hero mic
And writing raps with Copeland
We recorded in the basement
Might've thought is was a phase
This is more than dedication

I never woulda known
I never woulda known
I be flipping switches got these bitches
That be fiendin' for a playa
Man they beggin for the bone
And my phone is always jumpin
Man they tryin to get a hold of me
But ain't nobody home
Cause they picked a mothafucka man
They picked a mothafucka
Like it's eeny miny moe
God damn God damn
No I never woulda known
You might also like
I been peeping what these people been saying
They being outrageous
I see they need a reason to hate it
Can't even debate it
They come in and they leave in amazement
Cause bitch I'm me
And my homies put your team in the pavement
She say you different yeah I know it
It don't need no explaining
I got music inside my mind
I know they eagerly waiting for me to create it
It's guaranteed to be on they playlist
I tell my teachers' bout my dreams
And they gon think that I'm playing, but nah
I'm really going for this shit
My parents talking College
I ain't going to that shit
I got people that's around me
And they know I'm bout to win
Don't expect me to respect you
We don't know about you kid
We don't know about you
You fiendin' for attention
And searching for a chance just a reason to get mentioned
And we got the whole neighborhood terrified
Before you ask me for a favor tell that  mine
I never woulda known
I never woulda known
I be flipping switches got these bitches
That be fiendin' for a playa
Man they beggin for the bone
And my phone is always jumpin
Man they tryin to get a hold of me
But ain't nobody home
Cause they picked a mothafucka man
They picked a mothafucka
Like it's eeny miny moe
God damn God damn
No I never woulda known

God damn God damn
No I never woulda known

I never woulda known
I never woulda known
I be flipping switches got these bitches
That be fiendin' for a playa
Man they beggin for the bone
And my phone is always jumpin
Man they tryin to get a hold of me
But ain't nobody home
Cause they picked a mothafucka man
They picked a mothafucka
Like it's eeny miny moe
God damn God damn
No I never woulda knownEmbed
