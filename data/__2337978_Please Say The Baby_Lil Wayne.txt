7 ContributorsPlease Say The Baby Lyrics
Weezy f baby
Baby please say the baby
I shouldn’t have to say that shit again
And you should never make me
Im a pimp, I even got a little swagger in my limp
See I was built for this shit
And now im riding around the city with a pretty young hottie
And size of the whip look like a human being body
Im a trip, ive been repping hollygrove ask skip
I ain't gotta front bout shit – on a nigga
Piss a gallon on a bitch
Im a handsome young guy with that all mac dick
Now can we split ?
Go to the tele not the crib, I ain't him
So hoe find another nigga
You won't find another nigga like this nigga lil weezy
If your friend tell you you right I bet I get her real easy
Like bitch, you know who im is
Now what it is
Mac maine holla at em

Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tee on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tee on you dog hoes 
You might also likeTake a seat while I spit it to the freaks
No time for lame shit
Rappers talking the same shit
Im just saying though
Trying to stack a lot of chips
Whenever the hate come I pack mo clips
It ain't nothing for me to mac a chick
But I ain't like that homie you can keep that trick
See im money over bitches for real
Yall trickin and lickin
Im big pimpin like nigga for real
Give a fuck Ima say what I feel
Anytime anywhere
Have fame before I got my deal
Still riding through the hood
Smoke blunts with my niggas and bitches
That be up to no good
Chi town what up your boy ain't left
Ain't shit changed stay dougie to death
Plus that cranberry range so sick
You ain't holla it then don’t holla now
Suck my dick

Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tee on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tee on you dog hoes 
Im beefing with a chick
My ex old lady
Always tryna fight a nigga when she see me in the club
Starting to get sick of it, thinking bout calling the polices
On this crazy make em put her in them cuffs
Why? Cause ive had enough of that broad
She won't learn her lesson until she end up in the cop car
Yeah but I don’t want to take it that far
But I know she sue me if she end up with a cracked jaw
Maine said her that will back her up
My mom said point her out she will smack her up
Truth be told I guess im with her
Talking all this shit I will probably end up right back with her

Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tee on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tee on you dog hoes 

Chea rest in peace yella boy man
You don’t know nothing bout that
That’s that new Orleans shit
Man so if you don’t understand this
You don’t feel this shit go to the next song man
Fuck you!
Rest in peace yella boy rest in peace soulja slim
But this my yella boy right now man
Hey I used to rap rap rap rap shit everyday
Another name of my rap is 3rd ward court day
Holla backEmbed
