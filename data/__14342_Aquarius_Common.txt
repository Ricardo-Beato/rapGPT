21 ContributorsAquarius Lyrics
Sevirra taht retaw eht
Dlrow eht yfirup ot
Thgin eht hguorht gniylf
Semoc eh ereh, tuo hctaw os
Yeah (Suirauqa, suirauqa, suirauqa, suirauqa)
Yeah

Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speaks
I'm keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seekin' it with 'em
I'm dope, the streets need me to hit 'em
With some of that (Revolutionary rap) revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guys pack heat, enough to bury June
On my feet, I'm getting married soon
Walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifthteens of the Jeep that you boom
Sonned so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Oshun, hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building, I'm the doorman
Opening doors, my blood I expose on the floors
Tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
A poster shines of me holding the blinds
Mixing goldenseal and wine, holding a nine
You might also like
The water that arrives (In the age of Aquarius, do-ba-ba, ba, ba)
To purify the world (Do-ba, ba, ba)
Flying through the night (Do-ba-ba, ba, ba)
So watch out, here he comes (Do do-ba-ba, ba)
Aquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)

Between churches and liquor stores, my mic meets
With raps all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy, Joe, remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over waters
That's as troubled as teens for the love of the team
Trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The Black pool of genius'll never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replenish the Earth
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods, from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
The water that arrives (We in the age of Aquarius, do-ba-ba, ba, ba)
To purify the world (Do-ba, ba, ba)
Flying through the night (Do-ba-ba, ba, ba)
So watch out, here he comes (Do do-ba-ba, ba)
Aquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)


The water that arrives (Do-ba-ba, ba, ba)

Flying through the night (Do-ba-ba, ba, ba)
So watch out, here he comes (Do do-ba-ba, ba)
