My nigga
Keep faith

Peace to every crease on your brain
Peace to who came before me in the game
We givin' praise and glory to your name, kid
We cellophane your story so it stays
Since birth, mama raised and burped me, I ain't changed
I'm a man, I'm just sayin' that I stayed imperfect
Earl is not my name, the world is my domain, kid
Air Max 97 Crepes on the pavement
Hair got knotty, let it settle on my face, I
I've been eatin' good, you can see it in my tummy
But I'm buggin', I've been spending more money than I'm making
Stuck in Trump Land, watchin' subtlety decayin'
I ain't touch a Xan, when it—
When it's time to put my burnt body in a case
Tell my momma, I said thank you
Tryna state facts, I'm tryna get through the day
I'ma play the back, I ain't into showin' face, kid

It's been a minute since I heard applause
It's been a minute since you seen or heard from me, I've been swervin' calls
It's been a minute since I heard applause

Sittin' on a star, thinkin' how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dog
Sometimes I feel like I wanna call it off
I can't call it, dog
Big dog, finna rip the collar off, uh
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dogs (Yeah, ayy)
Sittin' on a star, thinkin' how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dogs, ayy

Keep pace, my nigga (Eat paste, my nigga)
Be safe, seek sake my nigga
Keep faith, my nigga, (Yeah yeah) ah
Me safe, she safe, keep pace, my nigga (Keep faith)
Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dogs17Embed
