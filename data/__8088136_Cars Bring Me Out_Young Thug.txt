Wheezy outta here
Yeah

Woke up in a mansion
Silk Dior pinstriped couch
Call the car man, he told me meet him at the spot
Droppin' off some shit you ain't got
Ha, now I'm out
I done got so rich I think my cars bring me out
It ain't 'bout no thot, my cars bring me out
Bentley under the carport, shit got rained out
I done got so rich I think my cars bring me out

I was chillin' at the spot on a bedside's couch
I wasn't even gon' do nothin', don't care 'bout the sun out (Yeah)
Fuck you, lil' bitty, bitch, don't let my car bring me out (Yeah)
I done got so rich I think my car bring me out (Yeah)

I done got so rich, I let a foreign bring me out (Uh)
Fuck her in the car and told her, "At least it cost a housе" (Yeah)
I done got so lit, I promise I'll nеver see a drought (I promise)
I don't know the time, I know my watch two-hundred thousand (Two-hundred)
Changin' up the climate, whenever you get through, I'm ballin' (When you)
Change it up, my bitch down, my old bitch stalkin'
I don't go outside without a rifle and a forty (Pluto)
Takin' up the drip and the murder rate in Georgia (Yeah)
Mr. Have-His-Way, turn a dime to a quarter (Yeah)
Walkin' with a limp, I got racks all on me (Yeah)
Probably in the Royce with the stars in the sky (Ceilin')
This ain't 'bout a thot, I let my cars bring me out (Out)
Wrap the cash up and vacuum seal, it won't rot (Rot)
I can bag her, she want the dick 'cause I'm toxic (Toxic)
I can spazz out and throw my bitch in Givenchy (Yeah)
Her pressure, Baguettes, make everything iconic (Iconic)
Homicide, make sure you stick to the script
One of a kind, fallin' asleep on a pill (Pluto)
Top of the line art, gotta splash through the crib (Hit it)
Freestyle off the top and I can make me a M

Benz after Benz, I'm on my Maybach shit
My opp got this one so I done gave it to my bitch
Huh, got a Birkin on my motherfuckin' wrist
Think I'm lyin'? You can dive in this bitch just like a fish
If it still got the eyes, it's a perfect dish
Give it to my kid, I'm 'bout to eat this whole wig
Gave her nine racks like a motherfuckin' Sig
If you made some mills in the pandemic then you big
Take the Porsche away (Yeah), fillin' up a safe (Yeah)
Got the Bugatti (Yeah), fuck a pool party (Yeah)
Pourin' weed in her pussy like I'm Bob Marley (Yeah)
All my dawgs got it (Yeah), we don't do no barkin'
Nigga put me out, so I bought the shop (Yeah)
I put my cars in this bitch, now it's a parkin' spot
We had more oil in the city back when it was a drought
They thought I got rid of it, I had brang the Wraithy out
Livin' legitimate, I'm swervin' in a foreign car
Cheetah print, leather Goyard
It ain't 'bout a thot, I let this money do seducin'
I turn two-hundred on a dash to a movie
I done got so rich, fuck two bitches in a coupe
I'm paranoid, hundred rounds on me too
It ain't no cap in my rap, I got proof
Took me a nap and had on three mill' in jewels (Pluto)

Woke up in a mansion
Silk Dior pinstriped couch
Call the car man, he told me meet him at the spot
Droppin' off some shit you ain't got
Ha, now I'm out
I done got so rich I think my cars bring me out
It ain't 'bout no thot, my cars bring me out
Bentley under the carport, shit got rained out
I done got so rich I think my cars bring me out

It ain't 'bout no thot, my cars bring me out2Embed
