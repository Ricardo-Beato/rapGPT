9 ContributorsBreak Bread Lyrics
Last night, you tested my endurance (Damn)
Goddamn, what a good performance (Woo)
I'ma have to get some good insurance (Damn)
Damn near woke up all the children (Shh)
If you scared, tap out and holla, "red rock" (Red)
I slang Fred Flintstone, I make the bed rock (Rock)
Drippin' wet, Versace sheets, she left a wet spot (Woo)
I told her, "Let me put that lace front in a leg lock" (Well damn)
She got that water balloon, suck it 'til your head pop (Skrrt)
I'm the sugar daddy, Wop, I'm not the step-pop (Pop, pop)
Leavin' out the strip joint, I want some head now (Damn)
Drop the top now and I just put the head out (Wop)

I was dead broke, now I got that bread now (Damn)
I'm so impatient, I can't wait to bring that bread out (Woo)
I was dead broke, now I got that bread now (Damn)
I'm so impatient, man, can't wait to bring that bread out (Woo)
Rodeo Drive, Lambo', Gucci sped out (Damn)
I'm in my blue coupe, can't wait to bring the red out (Wop)
I make a call to Jamaica, fly them dreads out (Rasta)
I'm so impatient, I can't wait to bring that bread out

Money turn her on, it make her horny (Horny)
Bumblebee booty, my type of hornet (Mwah)
My business is boomin', I'm on a journey (Rackades)
I stumbled through London this early mornin' (London)
Money callin', call RiRi because it's pourin' (Ri)
Four different Rolls Royce umbrellas, man, I'm a tourist (Woo)
I'm so saditty and pretty, could be a florist
Have you looked at me recently? I look gorgeous (Mwah)
With my pretty saditty bitch, but really she innocent (Huh?)
But she the drug dealer, bitch get the pint and the benefits
In the backseat gettin' intimate, new Bentley, I tinted it
Jerk on the dick like a pogo stick, then eat nut like eggs benedict
You might also like
I was dead broke, now I got that bread now (Now)
I'm so impatient, I can't wait to bring that bread out (Woo)
I was dead broke, now I got that bread now (Damn)
I'm so impatient, man, can't wait to bring that bread out (Woo)
Rodeo Drive, Lambo', Gucci sped out (Damn)
I'm in my blue coupe, can't wait to bring the red out (Wop)
I make a call to Jamaica, fly them dreads out (Rasta)
I'm so impatient, I can't wait to bring that bread out

Last night, you tested my endurance (Damn)
Goddamn, what a good performance (Woo)
I'ma have to get some good insurance (Damn)
Damn near woke up all the children (Shh)Embed
