3 ContributorsIf U Leaving, Then Leave... Lyrics
Yeah, one-two, one-two, testing, I said one-two
(Bring it back, my shit)
Yeah, one-two, one-two, testing, I said one-two
One-two, one-two, y'all niggas know just how I do
Let's get more paper, more bread
It's grind time, I ain't fucking 'round, kid
Got a new case, D's ain't got no proof
Got a new Coupe, it ain't got no roof
Test me, see if I won't shoot
I'll cock that and bang that quick for the loot
Trey deuce, got it stashed in the boot
If there's a problem I get to the root
Go 'head get your ass shot being cute
You talk too much, boy, I'll put ya on mute
Beef with me you need more than a vest
And more than one strap I guess
You got me all fucked up
I might just get your whole clique stuck up
Then come back and sell your shit back
I'm known for grimy shit like that
Ask around, niggas know me good
Southside, nigga, this my hood

You called and told me
That you wanted to leave
(Well, if you're leaving then leave
On your way out leave my keys)
But it seems (well, if your leaving then leave)
That you don't (if you're leaving then leave) want to leave me
(Well, if your leaving then leave
Get to walking but leave my V)

Listen
We were so happy together
When we first met (so happy, huh? Yeah)
But you started acting crazy
Oh baby, what's happening?
(What happened, girl? What's happening?
Come on, come on)

'Cause all my love (haha)
Is what I'm giving (yeah)
If you want games
Well I'm not playing (come on, come on)
Let me know if you want to leave
Now baby (haha..), please don't call me with your lies

You called and told me
That you wanted to leave
(Well, if you're leaving then leave
On your way out leave my keys)
But it seems (well, if your leaving then leave)
That you don't (if you're leaving then leave) want to leave me
(Well, if your leaving then leave
Get to walking and leave my V)
I'm sorry that you're feeling this way (so sorry, I'm sorry)
You know I'm not to blame no no, no, no (no no..)
But that's you keeps on running (come on, come on)
And playing those simple games
(We gon' take it up a notch now, OH!)

Leaving me
You know can't let go (ha ha)
You're mistreating me, no, no, no, no (nana no nana no)
Let me know, if you want to leave
Baby, please just stop calling me with your lies

You called and told me
That you wanted to leave
(Well, if you're leaving then leave
But on your way out leave the keys)
But it seems (well, if your leaving then leave)
That you don't (if you're leaving then leave) want to leave me
(Well, if your leaving then leave
Get to walking and leave my V)

Ohh, calm down, baby
You're overreacting, haha
Oh, I got y'all back in Bentleys
Leaving me, oh, can't let go
Mistreating me (can't mistreat me baby), no-no-no-no-no
(I won't let you)
Let me know (nah), if you want to leave
But baby, please just stop calling me with your lies

You called and told me
(Quit lying to me
Tell me who you're trying to be)
That you wanted to leave
(You make me feel crazy
You know you my baby)
But it seems (you not going nowhere
Sit your ass down right here)
That you don't want to leave me
(Miss 50 come on, bounce with me, come on)

You keep on running from me
(Just makes me feel good, man)
I don't understand it
'Cause you love me (yeah), and I love you
(Yeah, next level shit) so don't leave me
(Uh uh uh uh, come on)

You called and told me
That you wanted to leave (well, if you're leaving then leave)
And I know you won't leave me, girl
But it seems
That you don't want to leave me
You can't leave me, baby (ha ha)
You called me and you told me
That you wanted me to be your man
You called and told me
That you wanted to leave (ha ha, you know you need me, girl)
But it seems
(I don't know why you're acting the way you're acting)
That you don't want to leave me
(Let me hear you say you love me
Oh, now you don't wanna say it 'cause everybody listening)

I love you, I love the way you walk
I love the way you talk, ooh yeah
(Ahh baby, you full of shit, man) ah ahhh
(It's cool, it's cool)
I love the way you move
Sure love the way you groove (you love me later)
Ahh baby (you love me long time, haha) ah ahhh, listen
