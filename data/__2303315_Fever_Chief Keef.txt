9 ContributorsFever Lyrics
Money, vehicles, thotties, reefer
Pour you lean up, T up
All these fucking niggas want to be us
I'm riding out with Nina like I'm legal
I hopped up swagging bitch I'm T'd up
Put the weed up on the scale, I'm smoking Libra
She ask why I'm sipping drink, I got a fever

Try me please don't, I'ma shot if he want
Nigga ain't no fucking snitching, I'll cop a plea though
That bitch want some frito, I am not a hero
I eat all the fritos to myself, I'm a Leo
How all these niggas copy me, I think I'm Sosa Kinkos
All these bitches spotting me, I think I'm Sosa Bingo
This nigga blocked me on the hit, I guess I'm Sosa free throw
I swear my life a fucking movie, you know Chief Sosa lead though

Money, vehicles, thotties, reefer
Pour you lean up, T up
All these fucking niggas want to be us
I'm riding out with Nina like I'm legal
I hopped up swagging bitch I'm T'd up
Put the weed up on the scale, I'm smoking Libra
She ask why I'm sipping drink, I got a fever

I got HKs, AKs, fuck days, pay days
She say her name is Lulu I just called her Lele
I got big lumps of the money on the way way
I was riding around spending money wait what's today's date
This nigga bitch just called my phone, I took her on a play date
In my motherfucking room, I fucked her then I made way
Chief Sosa a damn heavyweight, you pussy niggas lightweight
Chief Sosa got long money, swear I got parade cake
I hop out car bitches say I'm Fat Sosa Albert, hey hey
Then she send me her number, I hit that bitch some days later
Hits the blunt one time how the fuck you way way
I had a meeting today but I pulled up a day later

Money, vehicles, thotties, reefer
Pour you lean up, T up
All these fucking niggas want to be us
I'm riding out with Nina like I'm legal
I hopped up swagging bitch I'm T'd up
Put the weed up on the scale I'm smoking Libra
She ask why I'm sipping drink I got a fever3Embed
