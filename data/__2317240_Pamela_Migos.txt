11 ContributorsPamela Lyrics
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding 'round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom (trapping)
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding 'round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom (trapping)
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela

My money growing like a Chia Pet (Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia, Chia, Chia)
Young nigga still trapping off the Metro and Nokia
Play with the dough, pizzeria (play with it)
Takeoff just bought twenty seals (Takeoff!)
My nigga trapping and capping, we taking the plug off and land in Korea
I'm a OG in the hood, they calling me Wizard Quavo Bradley Beal (OG!)
I've been pushing off the back with no smell
Way before the vacuum seal (seal)
Niggas used to having bricks in the bell (bricks)
Most of you niggas gone tell (tell it)
Everything that I touch I can sell
I done sold water to a fish and a whale
You might also like
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding 'round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom (trapping)
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding 'round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom (trapping)
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela

Pamela, Pamela, my arm got stamina
Eat that dab up like a cannibal
July 31st, better mark that on your calendar
Drinking Act', double cup looking like lavender
Smoking on cookies, good medical cannabis
Black diamond medallion, don't call up the ambulance
Kim K, Christian Louboutins, Pamela Anderson
I got that steel on me, still like a mannequin
Once you go come place your order, then come cross the border, Pamela imported
Never extorted
My niggas important
I'm Takeoff Obama 'cause I get escorted
24 carat, can't shit on my toilet
Don't hit my phone if you know you can't afford it
What I pour in a twenty, I show mortgage
And my pinky ring is looking like an orbit
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding 'round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom (trapping)
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding 'round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom (trapping)
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela1Embed
