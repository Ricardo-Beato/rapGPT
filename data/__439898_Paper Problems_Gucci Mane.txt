21 ContributorsPaper Problems Lyrics
It's Guwop, what's happening baby, what's going on?
Yea, 1017 MPA with me
I got Thugger Peewee know what I mean
I ain't trippin' 'bout that shit, I'll pay for it
Hell yeah, rent it, how much it cost?
Turn up, yeah you and your buddy
Got a little something for ya
It's Guwop

I'll pay for it, I'll pay
I don't give a damn about
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it, I'll pay
I don't give a damn, I'll pay for it
If you work real late, I'll stay for it
No problem 'bout it, I'll pay for it
She been working all day, working all week
She wanna freak with me
Ain't no problem cause I'm not cheap
Got money all week I give her
I got the money, I'll buy somethin'
Call your friend, let's try somethin'
She like girls and boys, so she trisexual
She eat pussy, don't eat vegetables
That ass fat, it irregular
Is it an ass shot, or did God bless her?
She a bad student on the 10th semester
But she give good head like the damn professor
Red bottom pumps like Cinderella
Red bottom pumps like Cinderella
Butt naked on and some damn suspenders
Ain't gotta catch her out to impress her
Gucci Man, I'm getting money, got bad bitches on my itinerary
Born on the 12th of February
12 diamond chains and they all canary
And you're not a virgin, so don't act scary
Cause I'm not the one to bust your cherry
It's Gucci Man and I hip-hop
But I smoke guap like I got dreadlocks
You might also like
I ain't really have a paper problem
M-P-A in the building, I pay for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
If you workin' overnight then I stay for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
If I really, really, like it, I wait for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
I turn into a Christian like Ma$e for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
I ain't really have a paper problem
I ain't really have a paper problem
I ain't really have a paper problem

I ain't really have a paper problem
Rock this shit the long way I'm talkin' about U.S. currency
Hell yea, I give you two hunna, give your ass three
Just to make this shit a guarantee
Payin' for the pussy ain't a problem
Bitch, you finna get a beatin gone off the seeds and molly
I ain't really have a paper problem
I tote a FN if I'm short damn right I'm robbin
No ski-mask, I already look like a goblin
Take the guap, leave the work, boy give me the dollar
Load the cash up, smash off, in the Impala
Thugger, thugger, mad Max had to catch him a body
Wop, Pee, Guap, boy you know we having them dollars
480 drop, I'm talking about the fuckin' Ferrari
Forgiato feet you know we had to shit on them people
I'm 4 pockets full while I'm havin' monifa
Fuckin' up strip clubs, tryna lay on the skeezers
They know I'm havin' real paper, suck like a mosquito
Blowin' OG gas we don't smoke on Diesel
Give a bitch the whole bag got some more monifa
Got bricks stamped 1017 who wanna eat em
Place your order, we'll pull up, stash spot in the Regal
You're havin' paper nigga, make sure you're straight my nigga
Cause them young nigga toting Desert Eagle
I ain't really have a paper problem
M-P-A in the building, I pay for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
If you workin' overnight then I stay for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
If I really, really, like it, I wait for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
I turn into a Christian like Ma$e for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
I ain't really have a paper problem
I ain't really have a paper problem
I ain't really have a paper problem1Embed
