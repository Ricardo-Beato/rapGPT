9 ContributorsNo Regrets Lyrics
Fuck diss tracks, you get your shit splat
Before you ever heard me rap, I had to spit crack
Slimy rocks, CRASH thought they'd find me shot
But doing numbers like Def Jam in the '90s pot
Much to they surprise I'm the fuckin' flyest
In the Chevy nigga playin' Pac, nigga, "Still I Rise"
Blue rag around my forehead, code red
Slauson Ave. infiltrate rap to take more bread
Quote it how you want, I just rolled a blunt
I'm sippin' lean in first class gettin' my shoulders rubbed
Streets talkin' so I'm listening with a loaded gun
Still all I hear is niggas sayin' I'm the chosen one
Champagne open one, watch it over-run
I heard him say a drunk mind speak a sober tongue
We're still adjusting to the changes
I've been gettin' money but it's different when you famous
It been niggas famous but it's different when you bangin'
All these niggas hatin', all these police tryna hang you
What should you do? Decisions, your blood racing
Fresh out the county, tryna go platinum on probation
But no regrets, my nigga, just more bank
Just soak it all out, double back from both angles
Artists, their label, no favors, no thank you
And rap about it all just to lace you
Pull up in cars with blunts large like Jamaicans
Sticky from bell sells, white broads named Rachel
Never broke code and I never made statements
So the rules say, mute all false speculation
Greatness fooly, four words: self made, salute me
A lot of niggas watching now probably hate this movie, but fuck 'em
I'm so tired of the same discussion
I'm worth M's, niggas ain't made nothin'
You might also like
No regrets now, I got it off my chest now
Since the womb, mama know that I'm a special
That's probably why she don't want another level
Real never fall off, like fake bezels
Spirit over rebel, heart of a lion
All that's inside me, Is worth all this trying
Worth all this grindin'
'Cause I'm from the hood and we ain't scared about dying
Just want mine

Look, success, I just want my fair share in life
And live that self-made, I ain't tryna hear life
Still proud of what I look at in the mirror life
Hyde Park hustle, half-baked on a Paris flight
I'm sippin' hot tea before I hit the stage
Earl grey, mother of pearl face
Forever I'm the flyest, we fuck on Chanel sheets
Count cash after shows, I spazzed on the globe
I passed all my goals, then I mapped out some more
On this neverending road, I fix flats in the cold, boy
Respect how I master my role
And I made it all happen alone

No regrets now, I got it off my chest now
Since the womb, mama know I'm a special
That's probably why she don't want another level
Real never fall off, like fake bezels
Spirit over rebel, heart of a lion
All that's inside me, Is worth all this trying
Worth all this grindin'
'Cause I'm from the hood and we ain't scared about dying
Just want mine1Embed
