11 ContributorsR.I.P Slim Dunkin Lyrics
This for my nigga Dunk, he gone
The squad really miss you! Uh huh
What's up Jay

This for my nigga Dunk, he gone, I really miss you
When you died, man, a part of me died, too!
This for my nigga for you know, I really miss you!
You're locked up; I'm feeling like I'm doing time too!
It's for my momma, mom, you know I wanna kiss you
And every time I go to jail, she doing time, too (damn!)
This for my nigga, for you know, I really miss you
And every time you're doing time, I'm doing time too!
Aha, time too, time too
Time too, time too
Gucci Mane, time too, time too
Time too, time too
Time too, time too
And I tell that, play up, time too, time too!

And the rumor on the internet that Gucci locked up
Everybody got happy wanna see me fucked up
Soon as I touched down, my man got locked up
Gucci back on the ground and his money back up
When I pull up to the club, gotta bring a Brinks truck
Yeah, you're getting good money, but not balling like us
You can even see my Rolly, all these fifty pointers
Make them break that bitch down just to fix it back up
Man I miss my nigga Dunk so much I'd dig his ass up
If I could bring his ass back, I would dig his ass up
We would rarely go to sleep, we were balling so much
BSM and 1017, Dirt Gang, stand up
Remember Flocka was my goon, now he ran his mills up
I feel like  and pop my real brothers  them my big bros
I feel like Wooh and Quan my real brothers them my lil bros
I can't forget auntie and Coach K cause they kept it real bruh

And every time you're doing time, I'm doing time too
Aha, time too, time too
Time too, time too
Gucci Mane, time too, time too
Time too, time too

And I tell that, play up, time too, time too2Embed
