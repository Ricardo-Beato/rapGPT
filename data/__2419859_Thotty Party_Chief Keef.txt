7 ContributorsThotty Party Lyrics
Feel like I'm an old man
Feel like I'm a
DP on the beat

Feel like I'm an old man, ayy, ayy
I've been doing this shit a long time, ayy, ayy
I've been on my grind a long time, ayy (Bitch)
Don't know why I'm never on time (Never on time)
'Cause I got a watch, this bitch shining, ayy (Shining, bling blaow)
Tracked all the thotties (Tracked all the thotties, thotties)
Runners with the bodies, come on (Running with them)
I'm finna have a thotty party

My wrist, it look like potty, ayy
My chain, it look like potty, ayy
I'm sitting here looking at this thotty, ayy
Tryna see if I wanna pipe it, ayy
Turn my Bimmer to a Skittle, ayy
I think I need to cut my ceiling
Turn that bitch to a drop X6M
I see it and I'm copping it or them
Riding in that foreign, finna make a film
Finna make a movie, finna make some bands
Spend a couple bands on that Mercedes Benz
AMG kit, riding fast, tryna break the trans

I'm an old man, ayy, ayy
I've been doing this shit a long time, ayy, ayy
I've been on my grind a long time, ayy (Bitch)
Don't know why I'm never on time (Never on time)
'Cause I got a watch, this bitch shining, ayy (Shining, bling blaow)
Tracked all the thotties (Tracked all the thotties, thotties)
Runners with the bodies, come on (Running with them)
I'm finna have a thotty party1Embed
