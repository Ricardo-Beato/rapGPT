The sun.. and the moon
Ah uno enah a toha
Agitri gete ah lihi
Adola tee; Talhi; a Dalahi
Ah yeneaha; Anokya talahi
Adohawe niti; Nihi adoukahali
Kanati kalahati talha
Tihanuetah; He tel ha
Be nah ha tak ha
Oosof nehee
Your ways are similar, to the rays of the sun
Warm to many, but too strong for some
The more you are needed, the brighter you shine
Watch them for too long, your brilliance will blind
The eyes of mortal men, threaten you with doom
They regret to see you, set, but it is time, for the moonYou might also like1Embed
