Woo (Grrt)
Uh-uh, yeah (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Yeah (Badmon, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)

Brand new 911 off the lot, off the lot, uh (Skrrt)
It ain't even cost me a lot, yeah
Took that bitch back to the block, to the block, uh
Heard a nigga just got, uh
(Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)

The God within me won't allow these niggas to contempt me
I keep the piece, full squeeze until my clip is empty (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
They resent me 'cause I'm countin' all these blessings heaven sent me (Woo, ah)
I copped the 911 (Yeah), now I'm thinkin' 'bout the Bentley (Skrrt, right)
You get mе? I had to take this shit, nobody let me (Nobody)
Excеpt me (Uh), so I could give a fuck if you accept me (Yeah)
One thing that's for sure, bitch, you gon' respect me (Right)
Look, I'ma flex, do your best not to sweat the technique (Nope)
'Cause behind the smoke and mirrors, niggas all reflect me (They all)
And I would fuck with you bitches if my aura let me (At all)
Or if you all would just tune into my frequencies (Yeah)
We expose the secrecy, screamin', "Rest in peace to Steez" (Rest in peace)
If you don't got the power, you just gotta peek and see for yourself
'Cause when you stay connected to source, you won't need nothin' else
Still I went and copped me the Porsche just for my mental health
I guess I couldn't help myself (Skrrt), I'm screamin' out

Brand new 911 off the lot, off the lot (Skrrt)
It ain't even cost me a lot, uh, yeah (Woo)
Took that bitch back to the block, to the block
Heard a nigga just got, uh (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, oww)
Brand new 911 off the lot, off the lot (Skrrt)
It ain't even cost me a lot, yeah (Woo)
Took that bitch back to the block, to the block, uh
Heard a nigga just got got (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)

Ayo, you in Dior, bitches adore you
The first time I got knocked was on Madison
All my fiends chef and dope before you (Ah)
Body in the Bentley truck spoiled
All your base out of space, if I'm livin' then I'm loyal
911 with the wing, couple bodies on the scene (Skrrt)
That's when Naya had the face, but the body was Jeanine (Ah)
That's when Feds had that steam, just missed me by a second
Now my nigga locked, stressin', made his locker look like Precious
Shoot that chopper, send that message (Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot), it's our block now
(It's our block now, doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)
Shoot that chopper, send that message, this our block now
(This our block now, doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot, ah)
Ayo, watch how I aviate, Benz drive from '88 (Skrrt)
My nigga got thirty years left, he doin' day-for-day (Ah)
He don't give a fuck, he on his bunk drinkin' Ace of Spades
Sos just came home, we had our Timbs tailor-made (Tailor-made)2Embed
