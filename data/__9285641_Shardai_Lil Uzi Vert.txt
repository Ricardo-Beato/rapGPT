This that Uzi mixtape (Mixtape)
I been wearin' Rick, boy, you way too Ricky late (You Ricky late)
Work on fine china, ooh, that be a sticky plate (A sticky plate)
I made her cry, she fucked her makeup up, got sticky face (Got sticky)

Go, ooh, drop it low, ooh, go Shardai
Got FN on my side, this is shark day (Woah)
Whippin' up that glass, sharp plate (Huh?)
She gon' shake that ass, Shardai (Woah)
I stay with that bag, Shardai
I stay with that cash, just like Shardai

Yeah
Woah (Oh, woah)
Woah (Woah, woah, woah, Bugz Ronin, he gon' run it up)

Sometimes I scare myself (Yeah)
'Cause I'm far from normal (Woah)
See (Yeah)
I know I'm not the same
But then again, at the same time, I know I can't change (I know I can't)
Seriously, and I'm out of my brain (Yeah, I'm out of my brain)
Pop ecstasy and I bet I won't faint
I'm oversеas with a lil' Japan bae (Um, yeah)
I offerеd her just to buy her a booty (Ayy)
She don't need that 'cause she got real good coochie (Yeah)
In Harajuku, shoutout to Yuri (Shoutout to Yuri)
I think about you every day that I'm home (Every day)
She had no visa, but I try bring her home (You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
I can't feel my feet (Woah)
I can't feel my feet (Woah)
This ecstasy
I'm so high, I'm tryna phone home (Hello?)
I ain't 'posed to get high, I got a P-O (Yeah)
Supreme, my windbreaker, it say Geo (Geographic)
Been trappin' for three days, I smell like B-O (What?)
I ain't take no shower, bitch, I shower in dough (I shower in dough)
She sucked my dick and I just cummed on her nose
Fuck from the back, I make her walk on the nose (Huh?)
Her head so good, she made me talk with my toes
I'm curlin' my toes
