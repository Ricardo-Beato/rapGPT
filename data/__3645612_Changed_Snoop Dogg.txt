Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle
(Ladies and gentlemen!)
Came in the door like whoa
Pull up
Can't even see no more (no more, no more)
Somebody pull the wool up
Surround myself with loved ones
Later for them haters
And now I'm going up y'all
On a escalator

Y'all may think I'm acting brand new
Y'all need to hold up
I'm just tryna give you something new
I'm a different fella
Y'all keep holding me to what I used to do
Stop being judgmental
Had to make space between us
Stepping out the middle

I've changed
Was different when you found me
Changed everything around me
Now you're looking at a different me
Changed
Down for so long
Down for so long
But now I'm way up, way up
You might also likeI've changed
Was different when you found me (so different)
Changed everything around me (yeah, yeah)
Now you're looking at a different me
I'm not the same (I,I,I)
Down for so long
Down for so long
But now I'm way up, way up

Tried to do it my way
(That ain't work, that ain't work)
Excuses every Sunday
(That ain't work, that ain't work)
Turning up every weekend
(That ain't work, that ain't work)
Hanging with the wrong friends
(That ain't work, that ain't work)
(Jazze Phizzle)

Get on up out ya feelings
Come get down with the realest
I hear a train a'comin'
And you don't even need a ticket
You can't accuse me of nothin
Some people say that I did it
I've been acquitted
Put your hands up if you feel me
I represent it
Y'all know my praise is relentless


Coulda sworn that I was having the time of my life
I was turning up
I was turning up (Turn it! Turn it! Turn it!)
Had to turn it all around
Turn my wrongs into rights
Had to give it up
Had to give it up


Ladies and gentlemen
You are now tuned in
(Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle)
To the very best (to the very best)
Black Elvis
Phenzel
Ike, wassup dawg?!
Ayy!
(I changed but I ain't switching up!)
Hey! Got the praise going up!Embed
