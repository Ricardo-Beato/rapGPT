9 ContributorsPut That On Me Lyrics
(Trap DotCom)
Uh (Fuck it though), uh
Motherfuckers betterâ€”crackin'
'Cause I'll shoot up your block
Double-back and asked the cops, "What happened?" (Hahaha)
Check it out, look (Ayy, for real though, J Stone, I see you, hood)

Motherfuckers better duck when I get crackin'
'Cause I'll shoot up your block
Double-back and asked the cops, "What happened?"
I'm from the era of the yellow-tape barrier (Uh)
Double-homicide like a twelve-gauge barrel (Ooh)
Seen it all, done it all, but I ain't dead yet (Nah)
That's why I look at life like a Vietnam Vet' (Look)
Young nigga, selling work on the step (Check it out)
Work a smoker for his car, put in work for the set
I'm no longer only living for the purpose of the set (Huh)
Even though at that time my whole life was a mess
Look, this hood shit is like a bucket-head bitch (On God)
Yeah, you know she ain't shit, you still fuck on that bitch (Haha)
And to the naked eye, it's like you stuck on that bitch (What's up, cuh?)
But really how you see it, you just fucking that bitch (Yeah)
Truth be told, I really lost hope when I was sixteen
Like fuck life cuh (fuck all that), whatever nigga, this Sixty's

Man, I put that on me
Young nigga, really came from nothing
Everything I got came from hustlin'
Man, I put that on me
I was right there seven days a week (Uh-huh)
Four corners, one month, seven days a piece
Man, I put that on me
I really bang, shot niggas in they own street (Yeah)
New killin's in the city over old beef
Man, I put that on me
Streets won't let me breathe (Uh-huh)
Swear to God, I wish these streets would set me free
Man, I put that on me

Take away my Granny's blessings, I be history
The bullets, 'cuz shot through the 'Lac, wouldn't of missed me (Nah)
OT, on my way back home (Uh-huh)
Out in Vegas, nigga had to flush 'bout eight zones (Bring that shit my nigga)
Two burners in the stash, 10 West doin' ninety
Now what you think happened? Shit, Johnny got behind me
Eyes red from the smoke (Uh), Fats license revoked (Damn)
Said, "Y'all two are straight, but the car got to go"
I'm like, "Fuck"
'Cause I would just up, I ain't superstitious, but this is some bullshit luck (That's some bullshit, my nigga)
To make it worse, when we got dropped at the Truck Center (What?)
Two white boys, threw a bottle like, "Fuck niggas"
Hotels didn't want to give us a room
Two cars in their lot, they try to say that it's full (Yeah)
We musta' walked 'til we found Greyhound
Spent the last on the tickets, we was right downtown
Man, I put that on me
Young nigga, really came from nothing
Everything I got came from hustlin'
Man, I put that on me
I was right there seven days a week (Uh-huh)
Four corners, one month, seven days a piece
Man, I put that on me
I really bang, shot niggas in they own street (Yeah)
New killin's in the city over old beef
Man, I put that on me
Streets won't let me breathe (Uh-huh)
Swear to God, I wish these streets would set me free
Man, I put that on me1Embed
