I trust that everyone is enjoying the music
As the title of the album suggests
This was meant for your listening pleasure
While you are being done in

Call this evil intent, like me in a limo (Yeah)
Like the shade in these windows
Smoke gray, ladies go mental
But no way they can see in though (Nah)
OJ blade is a pencil (Yeah)
Propane tank in my cranium
Code-name Titanium Temple
I almost swallowed my car
I call my Mercedes a Benzo
Bitch, I ball like a baby
Ball like J, but not Jay as in
Jay-Z, J as in Leno
'Cause I got a huge mansion
No, huge man chin, new Manson, loose cannon
Too scandalous, Sue Atkins
The kinda crazy you can’t fix
I'm still the one that your parents hate
I'm in your house eating carrot cake
While I sit there and wait and I marinate
I’m irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate
And come home to find yourself starin' straight into a fuckin' barrel like Sharon Tate
Dre's on concerto while I narrate
Yeah, you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin' arrow shape
I be on a higher plane in aerospace
With so much leg-room and air space on this airplane
Unlike you 'cause you're on a flight too, but it’s a staircase
You might also like
Now, little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go
I’m losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick Roll, up the en-endo
Like a win-window
Little engine gone, little engine gone

I am the top-selling, who cares? (So what? You sound dumb)
Stop dwelling, then stop yelling (You sound like an idiot)
I’m not yelling, you're yelling (Shut up, Jesus Christ; guys, guys)
Smart-aleck, goddamn it (You sound like an idiot, oh my God)
Fuck is that? Stop hammering, goddamn (Guys, hey, stop arguing)
That's what it sounds like in my brain
Much as I fight to restrain
I have the right to remain violent
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Icicle veins, mics'll get slain
Like they were strangled with bicycle chains
You’re gonna have to come identify the remains
Wait, what?
I said my head is twisted like a bread tie (Yup)
Can't get a fuckin' word in edgewise (Shut up)
Success overnight like a red-eye (Bitch)
Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy on the Westside
I'm hot, dawg
No, you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar at Meijers
In appliances by the washers and dryers
Chick ran up like, "Marshall on fire"
I looked down and said, "No, I'm not, you're a liar"
She said, "No, your music
Heard you're back with the Doctor," then I heard
Now, little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go
I'm losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick Roll, up the en-endo
Like a win-window
Little engine gone, little engine gone (Dr. Dre)

(Psycho) Psycho killer, (Michael) Michael, Thriller
(My flow) My flow apeshit, (I, I go) I go-rilla
(My flow) My flow still a (Psycho) psycho killer (Killer)
(Nitro) Hi ho, Silver
Similes and idioms giddy up

I think I can, I think I can
I know I can, psycho I am
Michael, my knife go right hand
In my left hand, I hold mic stand (Yeah)
Little engine gone (Yeah)
Chicka-ch-ch-chill, I got z-z-zero, zero, zip, zip, zilch (Yeah)
Like Kaepernick, I got kn-kn-kneel (Nil)
Word to Goodwill-will, this must be how bein' hood rich feels
Was a ghetto boy, now I ball out like Bushwick Bill (Eyeball out)
Finna take you out like an outro
Bruce Wayne and Alfred, look out, ho
Blueface meets Albert DeSalvo
Balboa with a scalpel
Scoundrel hound with a mouth full of Alpo, now go
Little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go
I'm losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick Roll, up the en-endo
Like a win-window
Little engine gone, little engine gone65Embed
