3 ContributorsShed A Tear LyricsChorus: (x2)
Just cause I don't shed a tear fo my niggas that ain't here
It don't mean I ain't sincere
Just don't speak on how I feel
Let my clip cry for me bullets flying everywhere
As my chopper goes
As my chopper goes
Verse 1:
Look alot of niggas die young they never got to get old
Like two tall tiny sweez talkin n s dome
Like tomcat baby bow cap pilla n stone
Shout out to all my homeboys that's never coming home
Sup to all my niggas in prison, that's in the hole
I ain't forgot you, just out here trying to keep it going
Grinding to reach my goals n shit, what else do I know
Beside hustling gangbangin all us young niggas do
They got us stretched out
Wifey's flippin mama is stressed out
All for the crib we feel when, we yell the sets out (carip)
Now let's count, too many dead noggas got x'd out
It's chest now two to your head in front of your ex house
And just how did these street rappers get let down
Stand up niggas don't ever sit down, spit rounds
Eternally for my niggas that ain't gonna get out
Shoot up your block before I let a tear drip down

Just don't speak on how I feel
Let my clip cry for me bullets flying everywhere

As my chopper goes
