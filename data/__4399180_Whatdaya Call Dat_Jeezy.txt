5 ContributorsWhatdaya Call Dat Lyrics
If I ain't a coke boy, then what do you call that?
If I ain't a dope boy, then what do you call that?
If I ain't a coke boy, then what do you call that?
If I ain't a dope boy, then what do you call that?

I ain't no motherfuckin rapper, bitch I sell dope
 in your hood nigga, I can serve you coke
And right now I'm going for 8:50 and over
And if you're asking me to front ya, the anser's a no yeah
And we don't rerock playa, just thought you should know
 we whippin the blow
 you do the math
 for the half
And if you want the other 18, 
I can't count the money first, I ain't even with it
It's a motherfuckin drought, ain't  for sale
And my shit always propper, dawg bring a scale
 pleasure doing business
 holla back
Better have your money in them hundred dollar stacks

If you don't know by now, Kinky is all dope
You can find me in the hood,  crack smoke
Saying dope is all I know, 700 in O's
 hard white, some months I keep that blow
The streets is where I'm at, dressed in all black
Hustling in the trap, watching my paper stack
No discrimanating when it come to getting paper
Race, color or creed, I gotta get my cheese
Hustle in the streets till my hands bleed
 now that's 5 days a week
 now they cop it from me
Every hustler in the hood coppin work from me

If I ain't a coke boy, then what do you call that?
If I ain't a dope boy, then what do you call that?
If I ain't a coke boy, then what do you call that?
If I ain't a dope boy, then what do you call that?
