2 ContributorsIâ€™m Not Perfect Lyrics
We've been through things
Feels like we've been to hell and back
And the ones you've lost
I'd give my life if I could bring them back
(Bring them back, I'd give my life)
And your self esteem might be low from what people say
(Keep holding on)
Hold your head up high, I promise it's gonna be ok

I'm not perfect just like you (I'm not perfect)
So come on let me give you a hug (come on let me give you a hug)
I got problems just like you (I got problems)
So don't nobody sit here and judge (just like you)
I'm not perfect just like you (we're gonna stick together)
So come on let me give you a hug (let's stick together)
I got problems just like you (woo, ooh, yeah)
And everybody needs some love

When you're feeling bad, some friends they can't be found
(Look around, look around, be found)
Cause some people love it just to see you when you're down
But it's ok, pick yourself up, start over again
(That's what you gotta do)
If you try you will, you will succeed in the end
(The end, I know you will, oh yeah)
You might also like
I'm not perfect just like you (I'm not perfect)
So come on let me give you a hug (come on let me give you a hug)
I got problems just like you (I got problems)
So don't nobody sit here and judge (just like you)
I'm not perfect just like you (we're gonna stick together)
So come on let me give you a hug (let's stick together)
I got problems just like you (woo, ooh, yeah)
And everybody needs some love

Shake a hand, shake a hand y'all, come on
(oh shake somebody's hand)
To every woman, every man y'all, come on
(oh, to every woman, every man)
Tell a friend, tell a friend y'all (ooh, shake a hand with someone)
'Cause united we stand y'all (united we stand, divided we fall)

I'm not perfect just like you (I'm not perfect)
So come on let me give you a hug (come on let me give you a hug)
I got problems just like you (I got problems)
So don't nobody sit here and judge (just like you)
I'm not perfect just like you (we're gonna stick together)
So come on let me give you a hug (let's stick together)
I got problems just like you (woo, ooh, yeah)
And everybody needs some loveEmbed
