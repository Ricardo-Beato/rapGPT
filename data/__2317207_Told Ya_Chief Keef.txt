9 ContributorsTold Ya Lyrics
I be ballin, like I play for the Thunder
I was riding with his mama
Let her roll a blunt of ganja
She say I'm gnarly
Then I say cowabunga
I know why I love lil mama
See me pull up in that Tonka
I know I'm heavy like my ice
Got a lot of drink and ice
You say "Can you spend the night?"
No baby, that shit ain't right
She say "What's the hold up?"
I got these bands in my pants
I need hand on everything that I told ya

Money, get it up get it up get it up get it up
I smoke 93, you smoke 51
Pop out the truck, got the truck with the semi up
Lil nigga act up, Chief So hit em up
Snuck in the club with the snub, hit the DJ up
Made a million dollars from a motherfucking penny though
Pull us to the strip, hop out, what's the deal-io?
Fat ass Backwoods looking like a Philly Dog
Let his bitch hit the weed, she a silly hoe
She start talkin about being in my video
Pull up like a video, pop me a wheelie though
She started screaming, I got me a silly hoe
I don't talk bands bitch, I talk millions
I can be outside in the bity like Diddy though
Bitch then say she love me, really though?
So she like me for me, but bitch it's really gwau-
You might also like
I be ballin, like I play for the Thunder
I was riding with his mama
Let her roll a blunt of ganja
She say I'm gnarly
Then I say cowabunga
I know why I love lil mama
See me pull up in that Tonka
I know I'm heavy like my ice
Got a lot of drink and ice
You say "Can you spend the night?"
No baby, that shit ain't right
She say "What's the hold up?"
I got these bands in my pants
I need hand on everything that I told ya

Got the Ruger and the Ruger, hit your medulla up
Ain't gotta be on the radio, to turn it up
Pull to the party, know I'ma turn it up
When I start ballin, you know I'ma do it up
I was seeing so much money I done threw it up
Pull on a opp block, you know I blew it up
Came to the club, bitch you know that I'm toolied up
Dirty hoe act like she won't get her coochie up
Sosa Jefferson, bitch you know I'ma move it up
Hoes in all rooms, bitch you know that I'm bootied up
Ready for the war, I'm suited, I'm booted up
Bitch ain't tryna fuck, you know I root it up
I sip lean, nigga you can't brew it up
Don't like it too much if the shit ain't new enough
Say you got a background, fuck nigga pull it up
Talkin bout war, on money I'm pulling up
I be ballin, like I play for the Thunder
I was riding with his mama
Let her roll a blunt of ganja
She say I'm gnarly
Then I say cowabunga
I know why I love lil mama
See me pull up in that Tonka
I know I'm heavy like my ice
Got a lot of drink and ice
You say "Can you spend the night?"
No baby, that shit ain't right
She say "What's the hold up?"
I got these bands in my pants
I need hand on everything that I told ya1Embed
