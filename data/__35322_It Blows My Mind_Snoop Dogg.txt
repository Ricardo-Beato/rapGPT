13 ContributorsIt Blows My Mind Lyrics
You should smokes with me

The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
It blows my mind

Blowin' chronic to me, it's like a tradition to me
I got the pi-doun, so sit down and listen to me
Don't go against me, fool, go with me
We could blow it all together, like Bobby Brown and Whitney
Yeah, we got somethin' in common
They could search a nigga, but they never findin' my bomb
And I got the stash, spot, my cash got
Lot of motherfuckers pumpin' police shots
I'm not the one, nigga, you can call me the two
Bob Marley reincarnated, pupils dilated
Emancipated, concentrated, debated, rated, many times
You surprised how I made it, huh? You hate it, huh?
But you know, I ain't even trippin'
I'm splittin' that swisher up, plottin' on the come up (Yeah)
I'm livin' my life, and never putting my gun up
Drinkin' my drink, and I'ma smoke that blunt
You might also like
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
It blows my mind

The greener the tree, the better the bud
The strength of the branch will tell you how chronic it was
I'm buzzin' high, slidin', slippin'
Got you listenin' to Snoop, it make you feel like you Crippin'
It's all to the good, the dash is wood
You got some hoes in your truck and now you're ready to fuck
But, they're frontin' and fakin', and time is wastin'
She don't wanna give you her number, now she hollerin' at Jason
Now don't get mad, just roll to the pad
And keep a G on the bitch and roll another dub bag (My nigga)
Light that shit, hit that bitch
Then pass it to your homie like a player, pimp (Blaze that bitch)
And when you get dizzone (Dizzone)
Crack the door, and let me get a little snizzle
Cause ain't no fun, if the homies can't get none
Puff, puff, pass my nigga, one lizza

The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
It blows my mind
Do you want to smoke with me? (Do you want to?)
Come and keep me company
Baby, come and fuck with me
You should smokes with me
Do you want to smoke with me? (Do you want to?)
Come and keep me company
Baby, come and fuck with me
You should smokes with me

It's the diabolical, chronical, mythological
Psychological, make a model ho' fuck a G
Pre-medical, steady slow those, ready can get it
Teacher taught it to those inside, with mind apparatus
My status has been the baddest, ever since I intro'd
I'm that nigga that brought y'all the info (On what?)
On the Chucks, French braids, and endo
Big Snoop Dogg, with the fog on the window
Spell your name in it, put your face in it
And hang with the nigga with the gangbang spinach
Drag it, blunt wrap it, or zig-zag it
It don't really matter, even if it's in the package
Put it to the side, so when your boy hit the Eastside
I'm look for the firefied G5
Ayo Pharrell, gimme that VA discount
I'm tryna bounce wit the whole ounce (Smoke me out)
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin'
It blows my mind

Do you want to smoke with me? (Do you want to?)
Come and keep me company
Baby, come and fuck with me
You should smokes with me
Do you want to smoke with me? (Do you want to?)
Come and keep me company
Baby, come and fuck with me
You should smokes with me

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you?
Do you think that you could fuck with weed?
Yeah, Pharrell, this that shit right here
And BBC - nigga
It's some of that, that next level shit right here, nephew
Sure 'nough, sure 'nough, you know, I know I like that shit

The chronic's blowin' (I'm just stoned to be here)
The chronic's blowin' (Don't nobody smoke like me)
The chronic's blowin' (Real shit, haha)
The chronic's blowin' (Keep your chronic blowin')
The chronic's blowin' (Everywhere I'm goin')
The chronic's blowin' (And now you knowin', yeah)
The chronic's blowin'
The chronic's blowin' (We just smokin', they ain't countin' our bank)
It blows my mind

Drinkin' our drink, do you dig what I'm sayin'?
We ain't gon' never swim, we gon' stay afloat
Cause we always hit the right note (It blows my mind)
That's real shit, Pharrell, you my loc'
And that's for life, my nigga, haha
Gangsta Gumpo, Neptunes, Star Trak (It blows my mind)
Billionaire Boys Club, D.P.G, Doggystyle Records, ooh-wee
(It blows my mind)
