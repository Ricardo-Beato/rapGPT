Whoa
Whoa
Yeah
Look

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D’USSÉ
Oops, ayy, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in
Man, I got a blunt, can I get a light? Yeah
I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like, "You took the summer off? We couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it, somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it, ah!

Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean, we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (Aww, yeah)
Aww, yeah
I mean, besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (Huh)
What's the word these days?
Bunch of niggas chasing after all these women they don't even know (Wooo!)
Buncha' out of season women fuckin' off-season niggas
To get last season wardrobe (Woo!)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, nah (Woo)

OVO, Unruly
One shot to make it in a life
From the Six to the fucking 8-7-6

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'

On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', man ain't no tellin'

No tellin'
Yeah
Look

I gotta keep watchin' for oppers
'Cause anything's possible, yeah
There's no code of ethics out here
Anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got
Let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta
Then eat in the kitchen like I'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle, how much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please do not speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago
I'm at a higher place
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears
I go huntin', put heads on my fireplace, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'281Embed
