6 ContributorsDo You Wanna Go Our Way??? Lyrics
Now what, sound of my DJ cuts
Terminator's back on some old fool's track
Takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back
Flippin' disco raps used to be whack
Now what you hear is what you lack
Take a lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Who dropped the bomb on hip-hop
Who got Biggie, and who shot 2Pac
What's forgot? Ain't no Eazy, no Scott La Rock
Now what's rap gotta do with what you got
For whom the bell tolls, is that the way the story goes
85% believing all the videos
God knows who controls the radios
Some people chose the road to be hoes
And so I rose in the middle of all the woes
And Def Jam negroes turnin' up their nose
There's one way in, no way out
No doubt the body count
Gettin' headz checkin' out

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down (x4)

Time to make life shine again like glass
You know I'm sayin'?
Gotta make it shine like glass
You might also like
Outraged against the scene
Proofread the script
Flipped it back so I'm back in gang green
We interrupt this routine, I had a dream
The clean protein smacked the gangsta lean
Between the triple team, wiped 'em out like a drought
Damn, the rap's tetracycline
Them lips foretold these apocalypse
Everything had a shot and got hit with bullshit
Twisted politics tricks I couldn't get with
As one quits another nitwit hits
All the way crazy, shady
World turned upside down, I put it down
Why destroy what you love? Look around
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground, where the lost got found
Why it all come tumblin' down?
Why he and she gotta die, now how that sound?

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down (x4)

On and on to the break of dawn
Some the 100 meter dash, I'm the marathon
Been around a long time, but the rhyme the same
Sound remains insane, exchange the reign
Ain't that somethin'
Figure I smashed the pumpkin
So I parallel the brains of Cobain
Show no shame like the pain of Kane
Gettin' madd opposition, hip to the game
It's that gran' old PE ammo
Different time, different channel, funky piano
Here to witness get on up with a quickness
S1's in the house with the thickness that get this
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, attackin' they frat
Griff is back, got 5 on it Black
The track got X on the decks
Terminator's back cause a that is whack
On the 1 and 2, yeah, go Flavor
PE hit the road, gettin' set to explode
Fight the power for peace, can't forget the war mode
Overload, there she blows
Here we go, now you know
Damn another Alamo
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down (x4)Embed
