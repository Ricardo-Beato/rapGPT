7 ContributorsFalling Down Lyrics
Light done struck me, see I'm feelin' lucky like I know she'll fuck me
Life's a fickle bitch and there's no tellin' if she loves me
Sometimes she smiles on me, I could see her light shinin'
But when the light is gone, it's dark, it's cold before the diamonds
Life's about timin' it, and time, it waits for nobody
It's like a fuckin' drug controllin' your mind and your whole body
Burnin' from your soul, yearnin' for more in this, how come he
Livin' the life of royalty? I take what I want, naturally
You're the casualty as we casually take you tragically
Magically make you disappear, randomly cause calamity

Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up
Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up
I keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin' down (Stay down)
I keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin' down (Stay down)

This is the insanity, get this dose of anarchy
Soak in all of the vanity, devoid of all humanity, examine me
Break apart your family, randomly
'Cause what ahead of me? This is a rhapsody, a tragedy
Examine me, take a close look like a man, throwin' the ghost hook
Got you fuckin' shook, and now I close the book
As I'm walkin' through the park, got you scared of the dark
Frightened by the shadows, I'm the one that is behind
You might also like
Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up
Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up
I keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin' down (Stay down)
I keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin' down (Stay down)Embed
