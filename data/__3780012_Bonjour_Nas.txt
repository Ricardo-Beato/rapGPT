(Bonjour) I should be more mature, sure, I'm spoiled
Hit up the south of France after tour, bonjour (Bonjour)
How many girls pre-bate right before they date
So she can have restraint? She still get slayed (Bonjour)
That's ill behavior, want the whip matted
Want her ass the fattest, beat it: Thriller jacket
A street metaphor: if your dog piss on the floor
Put his nose in it, check these niggas from the door

Ooh ooh la la, oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous
Good day and best wishes
Comment allez-vous?
Bonjour

Eat at selective kitchens, speak on our next intentions
Over-creamy Polenta, it come chef recommended (Bonjour)
Come through the side entrance; I arrived, bitches
Crackheads still owe me from '89 fixes (Bonjour)
Havin' drinks in Vegas, my business
She didn't see me comin', now she's an eyewitness
Laissez le bon temps rouler
Say ahh so the kids could play
You might also like
Ooh ooh la la, oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous
Good day and best wishes
Comment allez-vous?
Bonjour

Vacation, twisted, whatever happened, missed it
Vacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip (Bonjour)
All these beautiful places, but the cities be poor
You wealthy when your kid's upbringin' better than yours
All this money we gettin' could be gone in a minute
If we don't invest itâ€”we long-term affected
Watch who you gettin' pregnant, that's long-term stressin'
I got a mill' for every bump on your face, that's what I call a blessin'
Flexin'

My head looks straight up
And I'm wonderin', "What did I do?" (Bonjour)
She looked at me like, "Damn, did I surprise you?"
Sure enough, as the sky's blue, she turned back around
And walked back down the avenue (Bonjour)
She's waitin' for the right cue (Bonjour)
I'm waitin' for the right clue (Bonjour)
(Ooh ooh la la, oui-oui amour)
She be leavin', still I smell of eau de parfum
She can't run 'cause I got Cinderella's right shoe
In that white gown that I be seein' right through
Crowd obscurin' my view
There's nothin' left to argue (Bonjour)
At least there's not from my view (Bonjour)18Embed
