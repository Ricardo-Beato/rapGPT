Holy spirit
When I look, I cannot see reflection in the mirror
I broke bread with the Judas and I think I see it clearer
These niggas want what's mine, but I'll be damned if I'ma give up
Stuck up in the hood, praying rap would get me out
Mama 'bout to lose her house, gotta figure this shit out
Used to catch the bus to 12th just to hustle for some Prada
In the kitchen with my uncle, beat the pot like a piñata
Baraka with the product, used to hide it in my closet
Type of shit that have a fiend crawling on his carpet
Walking over carcasses of artists in my garden
Nice with the bars, even the beat begs my pardon
Got me mistaken, Muslim salami bacon
Always on the defense, so it's no offense taken
I'm smokin' on them raisins from the bay, they taste amazing
Cajun, kicking flavor all the time, not on occasion
Would be amazed, all the time, I heard I wouldn't make it
I was writing shit that was so damn amazing
When half these little niggas was still watching That's So Raven
I was out there hustling, scrapin' up and saving
Just to catch a twelve hour bus to NY
Sleepin' on the floor in studios, asking God, "Why?"
But never got deterred from the voice I heard inside
Tell myself every day the greatest that's alive
You might also like
And I'ma give 'em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
For whatever it's worth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
Unless death come first, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
For whatever it's worth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell

'Cause we living in that
Actavis double cups, was addicted to that
Had them demons on my back, was escaping through that
Blamed everybody but myself, apologies for that
So they hold a nigga back for the way that I act
People scared of doing business, thinkin' I smoke crack
I react immature to anyone talkin' smack
'Cause where I'm from, respect the only thing that you have
Grew up virtually poor, realities unmasked
So my task is inspire your future with my past
I lived through that shit, so you don't have to go through it
Stepping stones in my life, hot coals, walk with me
Listen when I speak, every time, talk with me
Couple screws loose, you don't wanna start with me
Got it from Motown, feel David Ruffin pain
Wanna cry right now, so I'm wishing that it rain
'Cause I'm knowing I'm the best, they compare skills to sales
Tell myself everyday, know this shit ain't real
Radio don't make you ill, get a hit, they feel they self
Respect for lyricism in this game, ain't none left
Have a bitch like Iggy think she sicker than me
And that's so fucked up, that's just how this shit be
I just wanna make music, fuck bein' a celebrity
'Cause these songs that I write leave behind my legacy
And I'ma give 'em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
For whatever it's worth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
Unless death come first, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell for it
For whatever it's worth, my nigga, I'ma give 'em hell

I'ma give 'em hell10Embed
