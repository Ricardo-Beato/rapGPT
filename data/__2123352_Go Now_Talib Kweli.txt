Clowning these lames you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Brag it about the ride you're whipping, your soul is missing
Race it till your death to your holly celebration
God bless a lady if only accelerate you
Cause we're speeding when we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I'm staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, cause we got the same brain
We in the same change, work in the same fields
Now we're independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I low it past the procrastinators
Well fast, is bound to going backwards
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I'll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
They hate when I get it straight and they chase us
Have the little boys coming fast to the speed race
Pulling cables with my team best believe I'mma see paper
With extraordinary gena, trust me to lead lay you
Highway of life faster than a car
Rick it in the trunks of the rappers that got balls
Never rat out cause we lived through the battles, we got scars
Mr. international, half of the Black Star
It's the sound that you're missing I'm here with your air glisten
Play it loud at your wind when you're gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain't screaming
Just whisper and then we're leaving
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I'll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
When it's gone to the wire
I gotta win to the fire
You can't stop it
No, you can't stop it
Because I'm destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it's happening
At the time, get ready, set, go
On your mark, get set, when I thought the jet
Look how far I get, I'm not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don't exist, it's a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market's flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It's so ironic, it's beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don't get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you're tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That's why I'm leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it's all about the winning, it's never about the wait
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I'll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, goYou might also likeEmbed
