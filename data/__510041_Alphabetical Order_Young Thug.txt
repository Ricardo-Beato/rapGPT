29 ContributorsAlphabetical Order Lyrics

Hi, world
I see all of you
I'm on a private fuckin' jet, you idiots

They wanna fuck the Thugger
Alphabetical order
I chase that cash, thought I told you
Make that ass clap like Magnolia
Please don't waste no time
I wan' see you shine
Please don't waste no motherfucking time, ayy
I just wanna see it, I just want to beat it
Don't play

Oh, lil' mama got camel toe
You already know
I'ma spent a dub on her throat
Yeah, I'm tricking off these days
Cartiers, 25 hundred bucks
That's nothing to a fucking boss, bruh
Right wrist, Audemar, Brietling on the left
I'm a stoner child, aka Jeff
Scrabble board, too many choices
Molly or the Mary, fish scale 
I'm so in the air, I'm taller than your hair
You might also like
They wanna fuck the Thugger
Alphabetical order
I chase that cash, thought I told you
Make that ass clap like Magnolia
Please don't waste no time
I wan' see you shine
Please don't waste no motherfucking time, ayy
I just wanna see it, I just want to beat it
Don't play

Chrome Heart specs, they salute my face
Guwop a real nigga, he just beat my case
He know I got street ties, I came from that clay
I'm surrounded by M&Ms, doctor Thugger Dre
Get wicked 'bout them M&Ms just like Lil Wicced
MPA, my bitty, we count real digits
Hundred thousand pounds of midget
Seven, seven or eight, cooked up chickens
Powder, powder, powder
Put a grammy on the table and make that bitch snort it
And you know my dope is white as a towel
If you know you sweet, go take it 

They wanna fuck the Thugger
Alphabetical order
I chase that cash, thought I told you
Make that ass clap like Magnolia
Please don't waste no time
I wan' see you shine
Please don't waste no motherfucking time, ayy
I just wanna see it, I just want to beat it
Don't play7Embed
