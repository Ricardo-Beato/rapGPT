10 ContributorsMissing Lyrics
We drop a kilo on you head nigga
Fuck around and end up missing
Drop the top off the coupe the brains on this bitch missing
Drop some purple on yo head nigga (some syrup)
You fuck around and come up missing
Drive a brand new new Bugatti nigga
And my roof done came up missing

I ain’t seen it how you seen it
Hell nah he missing
Last time a nigga saw him he was on worldstar dissing
Heard he disrespect the fan, went against the mob
His momma said 730 was the last time she saw him
Heard they kidnapped the boy but it could but a rumor
Investigation crime scene they found the body by tumor
His partner down the road sending death threats and shots
Plugged in that system get ya stabbed for a dot
A 20 dollar card make a nigga go hard
But when the cell phone can get ya left on the yard
You gone fuck around and fuck around and fuck around and get missing
This the first and the last I wanna hear about this

We drop a kilo on you head nigga
Fuck around and end up missing
Drop the top off the coupe the brains on this bitch missing
Drop some purple on yo head nigga (some syrup)
You fuck around and come up missing
Drive a brand new new Bugatti nigga
And my roof done came up missing
You might also like
Hundred round that chopper, hundred round that chopper
Thirty six ounces and its loaded
Thirty six ounces get you smoked like a bag of dope
I give you something to keep run up cut your foot off
I give you this key gone flip em or gone fuck around and
Cut your hands off swipe
A half of gram of molly knock your man off
A whole brick off boy they knock the fam off
They turnt up round my way
They turnt up round my way
They pulling up they spraying everything
They pulling up they spraying everything
They gone flip yo top for a whole thang

We drop a kilo on you head nigga
Fuck around and end up missing
Drop the top off the coupe the brains on this bitch missing
Drop some purple on yo head nigga (some syrup)
You fuck around and come up missing
Drive a brand new new Bugatti nigga
And my roof done came up missing

I had to realize these niggas talking like hoes
Playing pussy nigga games gonna get they brain exposed
Nigga know like I know never cross family and folks
Or its off with your head we made them fuck niggas fold
Fuck nigga dissing think we ain’t paying attention
Future ain’t gotta respond just know we sending them killers
Drop the top on the coupe you wanna be in the loot
Just know the circle too tight we don’t fuck with niggas like you
A bag of that gas make a young nigga smash
For a brick and a half nigga wipe off your whole dam
So keep it cool lil nigga, what you do lil nigga, follow rules lil nigga
And salute lil nigga
We drop a kilo on you head nigga
Fuck around and end up missing
Drop the top off the coupe the brains on this bitch missing
Drop some purple on yo head nigga (some syrup)
You fuck around and come up missing
Drive a brand new new Bugatti nigga
And my roof done came up missingEmbed
