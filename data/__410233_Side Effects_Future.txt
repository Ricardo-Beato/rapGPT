You pay my ticket, hold down my crib
You wash my clothes, you buy my groceries
You stay up late, you say whatever, that's whatever it take
You a fucking superstar, it ain't hard to tell
Answer the door, it's FedEx, never read my mail
Baby I'm supposed to, I take you serious
Keep talking dirty, I love to hear it

'Cause I never take nothing from you, you deserve it all
Just tell me what it costs, ball 'til we fall
And we run to the finish, no screens no catches
If I die today, it's yours, if you want it all I give it to you
No side effects, no side effects, no side effects
I give it all to you
No side effects, no side effects, no side effects

My name stay tatted, across your heart
I give you plenty, you play your part
I smoke too much, say you don't mind
At least you make it, make good with your time
You fucking superstar, you fucking up
Ain't 'bout that talking, and girl you sure, you sure
You a little something, never take it back
Ain't no side effects, remember that
You might also like
'Cause I never take nothing from you, you deserve it all
Just tell me what it costs, ball 'til we fall
And we run to the finish, no screens no catches
If I die today, it's yours, if you want it all I give it to you
No side effects, no side effects, no side effects
I give it all to you
No side effects, no side effects, no side effects, oh, oh8Embed
