18 ContributorsMotorcycle Lyrics

Zaytoven
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle

She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back, baby, recycle
Bitch, I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning, baby, no NyQuil
And I can't stop it, keep going, baby, don't stop it
All my garments come from France, French kissing in France
Hundred-thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants
And I can't stop it, keep going, baby, don't stop it (21, 21, 21)

I can't stop it, hundred-thousand stuffed in my pocket (In my pocket)
Pull up on a nigga with a rocket, if I pull it out, then I'ma pop it
I call her bike life 'cause she ridin', non-stop it, eat the pussy up and then a nigga get it popping
Finger licking, good like shrimp and teriyaki (21)
VVS diamonds got my watch playing hockey (Yeah)
21 Savage, I get money like a Jew (What?), hundreds on me blue, hundreds on me blue
You know I'm a slut, I'll fuck your crew
Yeah, I'm a dog like that, pull up in a 'Rari with the top dropped back (Skrrt)
Pull up on your block with the chop cocked back (Bah)
Pew, pew, pew, make a nigga walk back
1017, they need to bring the wop back (Yeah), when I get inside that pussy, baby, I can't stop
I love it when I see them nipples through the crop top (Yeah)
Butt crack showing in them G-Star jeans
Make a nigga wanna go and buy her a ring
She gon' turn a nigga to a fiend (Yeah), she gon' make a nigga kill the scene (Yeah)
She gon' hold my dope when I'm in need (Yeah), she gon' bail me out when I'm in need (21)

She gon' ride it like a motorcycle (Skrrt), throw it back, baby, recycle
Bitch, I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning, baby, no NyQuil
And I can't stop it (Nah), keep going, baby, don't stop it (21, 21)
All my garments come from France, French kissing in France
Hundred-thousand stuffed in my pants (21), money piling up like ants
And I can't stop it (Nah), keep going, baby, don't stop it

Yeah
Put the money in the safe, you could beat it like a case
I've been waiting all day, so I could put it in your face
Been real with him from the start, know a lot of niggas sell out
Get up in the jam, you know who to call to bail out
Got a bad bitch, know these niggas gon' hate
Can't stop getting money, bitch, I don't got brakes
If a nigga 'bout his bread, it be getting to his head
He be running from the feds, left a lot of niggas dead
Ain't enough kush, he be rolling like dice
Show him who the business now he wanna throw the rights
He'll pay for it if I gave him a price, fuck around with my type, boy, you know you ain't right
I'm knowing your bitch ain't had shit
It's Dreezy and 21 Savage
Yeah, million dollar, nigga, blow the money like a whistle
Take me where I wanna order steak up off the menu
Hard head nigga, know he gripping on a pistol, if you buy me a ring, we can make this shit official
Fucking with me harder than your niggas, power couple, yeah, we all up on a mission
I know when you gotta handle business, you know I'ma be here waiting for you when you finish
Let's get it
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle (Skrrt), throw it back, baby, recycle (Throw it back)
Bitch, I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning, baby, no NyQuil
And I can't stop it (Nah), keep going, baby, don't stop it (21, 21)
All my garments come from France (Come from France), French kissing in France (Mwah)
Hundred-thousand stuffed in my pants (21), money piling up like ants (21)
And I can't stop it (Nah), keep going, baby, don't stop it4Embed
