15 ContributorsStunt Double Lyrics
(Ooh, SAV killed it)
I gotta get me a crib out here in Detroit (You do), for real

Put that teeny eeny beeny little watch away
Somebody pass me a cup, feelin' parched today
Would've thought it wasn't summer how my steppas had marched today
This bitch don't fuck me the same, think she gave her arch away
Certified rack runner, I'm a stack doubler
Used to fuck so many hoes, needed a stunt double
Locked safe filled up with gold medals
On the pegs while my brother used to push the pedal

(Yeah, yeah, yеah)
That's how we got around
Used to clean up for my own food, wе had to buss it down
Now I buss a hundred pack (I do)
Bitch fucked me so wack, I want my number back
Slangin' wood in her ass, feelin' like a lumberjack
Got a private FN, guess what's up under that (Thirty)
She in love with my durag like Thundercat

Put that teeny eeny beeny little watch away
Somebody pass me a cup, feelin' parched today
Would've thought it wasn't summer how my steppas had marched today
This bitch don't fuck me the same, think she gave her arch away
Certified rack runner, I'm a stack doubler
Used to fuck so many hoes, needed a stunt double
Locked safe filled up with gold medals
On the pegs while my brother used to push the pedal

When I was young, used to drop shit, now I'm doin' better
My bitch know I'm half way rich, she let me do whatever
I'll hit you with twenty pounds if you moved in quicker
I got a clip in the PLR longer than a school semester
Me and Mikey slid on some niggas out a blue Tesla
Dog took off runnin', got away, but I let Scoob catch him
What the fuck is that, a 36 DateJust?
Every nigga in the clique got two watches, know they hate us

Put that teeny eeny beeny little watch away
Somebody pass me a cup, feelin' parched today
Would've thought it wasn't summer how my steppas had marched today
This bitch don't fuck me the same, think she gave her arch away
Certified rack runner, I'm a stack doubler
Used to fuck so many hoes, needed a stunt double
Locked safe filled up with gold medals
On the pegs while my brother used to push the pedalEmbed
