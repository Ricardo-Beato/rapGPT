Uh, my mind's filled with minefields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It's Judgement Day or a fire drill
Yeah, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin', yeah
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill 'em all and let 'em die

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
The end of time is like a hour away, damn

Military-minded, lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shinin'
Uh, I saw a butterfly in Hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
'Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed
Mama said, "Take what you want" – I took heed, yeah
You might also like
Now let it breathe, yeah

Back to life, back to reality
Been eatin'my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted, we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealin' to me is under banana trees
Love, I go so hard, I tried to pay homage, but I was overcharged
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say, "Fuck the police," now I say, "Fuck jail"
Same shit, different air freshener
I don't play, boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number nine
And I just fucked the clock and let it come with time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of commands, I'm the missin' link

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smokin'on them flowers, catch the bouquet
Here, we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in Hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?62Embed
