7 ContributorsIf Iâ€™m Being Honest Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

If I'm bein' honest
I ain't dead or in jail, I ain't trippin', so I know that this a win
Actin' like I ain't that nigga, so we all just gon' pretend?
Flippin' weight to real estate, I'm corporate thuggin' 'til the end
If I'm bein' honest
I done came a long way from Lumpkin Road, sleepin' on my granny couch
Thousand dollars in my pcoket, in my sock a quarter ounce
Now I got me three accountants just to watch all my accounts
If I'm bein' honest
You know these bitches see a real nigga out, and they ready to risk it all
Don't mind me, I'm focused, I'm just tryin' not to fall
I can see the goal line, I ain't tryna drop the ball
If I'm bein' honest
They tryna make it 'bout them, but a nigga really did it on his own
Could've got a life sentence just for talkin' on the phone
You can tell them niggas, love me or leave me alone

Headed to the other side, yeah, that's where the plug stay
Hungry than a bitch, I might just stop by the Subway
Lie about two dollars, yeah, y'all niggas must be high
Yeah, y'all must be smokin' crack 'cause I ain't that type of guy
You might also like
If I'm bein' honest
I was in the Mac when Sedi showed me how to turn a two into a four
At the microwave, nigga puttin' on a show
That's a hundred and twelve O's like the knobs on the door
If I'm bein' honest
I been prayin' to my mama 'cause I need her and miss her every day
So I'ma go hard 'cause there ain't no other way
Wish we could talk now 'cause there's way too much to ay
If I'm bein' honest
I'm really sick of these niggas on the internet talkin' like some hoes
If I ain't answer back, 'cause I'm busy doin' shows
It's hard but it's fair, quit cryin', wipe your nose
If I'm bein' honest
I'm the first nigga from my hood that ever went and cashed out a Lamb'
Arm and Hammer in the fridge, nigga, right next to the ham
Got some niggas in the fed that'll vouch for every gram

Headed to the other side, yeah, that's where the plug stay
Hungry than a bitch, I might just stop by the Subway
Lie about two dollars, yeah, y'all niggas must be high
Yeah, y'all must be smokin' crack 'cause I ain't that type of guyEmbed
