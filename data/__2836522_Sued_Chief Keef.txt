10 ContributorsSued Lyrics
Hi, Miss Codeine, (I just want you to know)
All I want is you
I know you want me
Sosa baby, GBE baby
(Sosa on the beat)
Bang Bang

I smoke tookah, he smoke oh no
Hi, Miss Codeine, I just want you to know
That all I want is you, if you only knew
I don't care about your ex baby, he not on channel 2
He's not on the news, I don't know the dude
I know you want me and I want you too
What are you hungry for? I'm out gettin' food
You tryna sell me some red, you can get sued

Me and purple got a contract together
We make goals like we raised a runnin' back together
No you can't get none of drink, you prolly got Ebola
All this gank I pour, I think I'm a professional skin toner, bang
Why would I lie to you baby?
I only sip you, I sip red? girl you crazy
Tell my assistant, go get ice, boy you lazy
Your man sippin' yellow, if I sip green, you can tase me
I ain't with the red, how much you wanna bet me?
I don't sip qualitest, knock me out if you catch me
I don't sip no label stretch me out if you catch me
You tryna see me hit, broadcast you on this here .50

I smoke tookah, he smoke oh no
Hi, Miss Codeine, I just want you to know
That all I want is you, if you only knew
I don't care about your ex baby, he not on channel 2
He's not on the news, I don't know the dude
I know you want me and I want you too
What are you hungry for? I'm out gettin' food
You tryna sell me some red, you can get sued

If you ever see me sippin' Actavis, I paid five
Comma zero zero zero, pour that shit on facetime
I ain't pourin' up on farmer
Ridin' in the baked ride
Gettin' baked, let the windows down and, K time
773-202-5862
We go up in the club you sippin' red, then I ain't with you
I just want one Styrofoam
Baby, I don't need two
I ain't gotta lie if I miss out on, ay, I ease, fool
This ain't plug talk, bitch this drug talk
This ain't no limp, this a drug walk
If it ain't a flat then I won't do a pill
If the plot ain't low-key, I won't do the drill
Bang, bang
I smoke tookah, he smoke oh no
Hi, Miss Codeine, I just want you to know
That all I want is you, if you only knew
I don't care about your ex baby, he not on channel 2
He's not on the news, I don't know the dude
I know you want me and I want you too
What are you hungry for? I'm out gettin' food
You tryna sell me some red, you can get sued
