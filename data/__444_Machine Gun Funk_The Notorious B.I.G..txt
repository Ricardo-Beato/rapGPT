Yeah

So you wanna be hardcore?
With your hat to the back talkin' 'bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore
Appeal that you're screamin', maybe I'm dreamin'
This ain't Christopher Williams
Still some MC's got to feel one, caps I gotta peel some
To let niggas know (Let 'em know), that if you fuck with Big and Heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggas sayin', "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me!
Just for niggas actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill ya quicker
'Specially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin' funk by the boxes, packin' Glockses
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates, the funk, baby!

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
You might also like
All I want is bitches, big booty bitches!
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From stayin' in my business, what is this
Relentless approach to know if I'm broke or not?
Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfuckin' meet again, huh
I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the Ave., I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the ****
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts and bitches suckin' dick, the funk, baby!
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk (Uh)
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
So I guess you know the story; the rap side, crack side
How I smoke funk, smack bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy! The place where my head rests
Fifty-shot clip if a nigga wan' test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin' helicopter
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdemeanor
Beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
"What's love got to do..."
When I'm rippin' all through your whole crew?
Strapped like Bamboo, but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's sellin' by the tons
Niggas wanna know how I live the mack life!
Makin' money, smokin' mics like crack pipes!
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain, the funk, baby!

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk45Embed
