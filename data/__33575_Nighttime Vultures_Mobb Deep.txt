36 ContributorsNighttime Vultures Lyrics
Uh
The nighttime comin', niggas, yeah (Yeah, son)
Without question
No doubt, my man took this shit to the grave, nigga
Understand?

Yo, I rose early mornin', spread my wings, yawnin'
Vague memory of last night, now it's all dawnin'
Looked down and see dried blood on all my garment
It stained on my Guess formers, kevlared enormous
I hopped up outta my bed holdin' my head
Flashbacks of gunshots shot past my head
I can recall an eight-man brawl, three men fall
Bullets flew, had to drug my man behind the wall
Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail
Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill
An eye for an eye, you know my science of life
Is you man or mice, thugs or the cowardly type?
I kick that '98 shit for your ears to list'
Nigga, P way ahead of his time, surpassed kids
(Fuck them kids be doin', yo?)
Kickin' rhymes that's true lies
Let me break 'em down to size, minimize they airtime
After this, you never will go back to that which
Sit back and write half-ass shit
The last official, taking out the artificial
Let me relieve you, replace that shit with some lethal
Mobb, remember the name, it's been along
Got niggas shook to death from the first fuckin' song
Fluidly, my mind flooded with jewels infinite
The chronic rap bandits, the addicts stuck on some live shit
Bear witness to this diligent street cat
I carry myself, hold myself down in fact
This one dedicated to my niggas on run
Holdin' big gats, go for your gun
Prepare to crush one, we trust none
Man who ain't down with the clan
The Mobb dynasty, apparently, you thought I was some other type
Nigga you could fuck with, you shit outta luck, boss
I break your compass, throw you way off course
We built this from ground up, started from ground zero
Mafia Onda, see the name up on the mural
Durable, physically fit, raps articulate
You get your whole skeleton cracked somethin' ridiculous
And still facinated by my stee'
Little P, wanna be me, huh? You no D
You might also like
One time, son, you know we be the illest in this
Pushin' shit back, QBC gat, plottin' to move at
Them big mouth cats, ship'll sink to the bottom
Easily overthrowin' niggas, rollin' over niggas

Yo, crushed krills, dollar bills, swish suit on
Screw on, dry-cell nigga with his loot on
Watch this, thunn Glock-less, fiends scopin' out my rock shit
Diamond on some H&R Block shit
Hear me, kids leary and his sneakers are shot
Word to me, thunn, the uniform do mean a lot
I approach lit up, cousin, sit up, matter fact, get up
What fronts on the bottom, face lit up
Yeah, where you from? I'm from here
You know Brina and Javier, and Little Life doin' thirty years
Analyzin' this wise guy, a look-alike first prize guy
Lit up the Thai, said right?
Emotionally playin' 'em close like I'm supposed to be
Somethin' spoke to me, it was this little nigga pokin' me
I heard sirens now, turned around, about to hit him
Son was Po-9 with the emblem
Grabbed my goose down the walkie-talkie
Foul, I'm loose now, shot went off, knocked the juice down
It ricocheted and hit a GS, now here come EMS
Dunn was leanin' near a ZX
Next time shit's parental, God slap fire out your mental
Jet in a boat with rims dimensional
One time, son, you know we be the illest in this
Pushin' shit back, NYC gat, plottin' to move at
Them big mouth cats, ship'll sink to the bottom
Easily overthrowin' niggas, rollin' over niggas
We be the illest in this
Pushin' shit back, NYC gat, plottin' to move at
Them big mouth cats, ship'll sink to the bottom
Easily rollin' over niggas, overthrowin' niggas (Know why?)

'Cause live niggas rap this shit
From Rikers Houses to the street's pavement
Word life, kid, I'll have you hoppin' the fence
Dodgin' for life, runnin' the sprint, the Infamous
Live niggas rap this shit
Fake cats get offended, intimidated
Puttin' up they defense
I'll have you hoppin' the fence
Dodgin' for life, runnin' the sprint, the Infamous
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)6Embed
