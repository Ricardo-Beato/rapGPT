73 ContributorsBlack Beetles Lyrics
Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this world ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead

And I guess we them little black beetles
This wonâ€™t attract the singles
And that flow is mean, but it lacks tacs and needles
I spend my days sharpening my skill wills while it's still legal
Reading through cathedrals applied to my cerebral
They ain't built they feeble, driven by the ego
The vision of a eagle, see the vision in my people
How many lives will they take today? We ain't equal
Another world war sequel and doomsday prequel
This ain't the world we thought it was when we was in pre-school
Sometimes it's hard to be cool, sometimes I feel like I'm see-thru
Sometimes I really wish, yo I wish that I could be you
Away from all the Hollywood acts and record contracts
I won't say I take it back, because I worked hard for that
But this life ain't turn out to be what it seem
Ever since I woke up I been living in a dream
Got me
You might also like
Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
They got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead

Who would've thought a marchin' Martin could spark a starvin' artist
Spit art, at heart young Marcus Garvey
Ponders on it, hardly, rap wonders fondly
Smoking  herb with just Marley and me
This one is for my dogs barking up on the tree
Sometimes that wind blows eventually she gon leave
That's mother nature for ya, uh
Patient and sagacious
I ain't gon pay shit watch she ain't gon say shit
Now that's respectable cause most women expect the dough
Accept it though, words of the wise through them rhythm-wrecking professional, exceptional
Half man, half extraterrestrial
They got me

Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
They got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
They got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead39Embed
