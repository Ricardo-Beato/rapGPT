10 ContributorsPaid My Dues Lyrics
(This is a DJ Skee exclusive)
Oh, yeah, oh

Now it's a possibility, that I can come from nothing to having it all
Now it's a possibility, that I ain't gonna have it all and fall
But I stand tall
I've been down for so long, you really want a chance, so
I done paid my dues, my dues, my dues
I got to go, up to the top

Wassup, Loc? Shit, I'm just out here tryna make it
Moms keep trippin' and a nigga can't take it
Sick of standing on these same corners, tryna come up
Finna run up in the bank, hold my motherfuckin' gun up
Life, got a nigga so frustrated
All my real niggas is dead or incarcerated
Finna fill a nigga with lead
Show 'em what they made me
Give 'em what they gave me back
Feel my hatred
Click-clack-pop, was addicted to the six shot
Fiennin' for a fix like a smoker on the Vic' block
Hoppin' out, getting high when the shit pop
Leaving bullet holes in the bricks in front of Big Lots
When I was broke, I hustled
Learned the game and I bubbled
Took my birthday money on Brynhurst and made it double
Snitches on the block always call the cops on us
Knowing damn well, we got rocks on us, holler at us
You might also like
Now it's a possibility, that I can come from nothing to having it all
Now it's a possibility, that I ain't gonna have it all and fall
But I stand tall
I've been down for so long, you really want a chance so
I done paid my dues, my dues, my dues
I got to go, up to the top

Life's like a dice game
Shake 'em up, throw 'em
There's rules to this shit, niggas fake they don't know 'em
Number 1, scared money don't make none
And number 2, bullshit, we don't take none
Never tell a bitch your plans or bring her to the house
Don't speak about a man, keep his name out your mouth
See, that'll be the shit that'll get a nigga knocked off
Not the pussy, but the principal, 'cause jealousy is a felony
Now when you grinding, nigga, dress bummy, fuck clothes
Ask yourself, are you in it for the money or the hoes
You content with a cutlass or you reaching for a rolls?
You straight up on them stocks says you fucking with them foes
I seen them quarters turn to halves, and halves to wholes
And now we hit the mall, we buy half the store
I had a Bentley coupe dream with an S up on the hood
Nigga ain't about to hustle, he get left up in the hood
Now it's a possibility, that I can come from nothing to having it all
Now it's a possibility, that I ain't gonna have it all and fall
But I stand tall
I've been down for so long, you really want a chance so
I done paid my dues, my dues, my dues
I got to go, up to the top

Me and my brother we was broke as a bitch on some hopeless shit
Christmas day, we helped the homie open his gifts
But I ain't trip though, 'cause I'm from where they flip dough
And when they ask where you from you tell them, "Six-O"
Let's get rich, bro, it's time to get some big dough
Sunday nights on the 'Shaw niggas rich roll
I used to only want to hit a switch and flip hoes
Now I'm thinking bigger, man, it's time to get home
On the East Side, I used to buy stress and flip zones
108, late night, I pray I get home
A lot of niggas die young, they never got to get old
Like Too Tall, Tiny Squeeze, Taca and S Dome
Don't know if you hear me, Lord, these niggas tryna kill me
So, if I chip 'em, would you feel me?
Now if you feel me, Lord, these niggas tryna kill me
If I was your child would I still be?
Now it's a possibility, that I can come from nothing to having it all
Now it's a possibility, that I ain't gonna have it all and fall
But I stand tall
I've been down for so long, you really want a chance so
I done paid my dues, my dues, my dues
I got to go, up to the topEmbed
