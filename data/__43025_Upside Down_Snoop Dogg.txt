11 ContributorsUpside Down Lyrics
Yeah! Aight Bigg Dogg
It's 'bout that time
You got a cup or bottle or blunt in your hand
Follow directions please
Let's go!

Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Said put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(What?) Upside down (what?) upside down

Ugh... the boss in the buildin'
Try to turn it on, you get offed in this buildin'
Higher than a muh, gettin' lost in the feelin'
Motherfuck the law, I got a ball for the children
Nigga - drunk than a bitch though
'Fore I hit the spot I had a bottle full of Cisco
Ate the kush and a model in a trenchcoat
A Crip with a lot of cash, check on how the wrist roll
Baby saw it in my eyes and she knew that I was lookin' at her
Ain't a chance to get her, I can M-I-crooked letter
If she with a nigga I'mma steal her, yeah a crook'll have her
Throwin' up the E once the D get to cookin' in her (Eastside!)
Yeah, so what's it gon' be?
Golden black Joe Clark, H.N.I.C
Regulatin' on any hatin' I see
Something good in your hands then repeat after me
You might also like
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Said put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(What?) Upside down (what?) upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!)

Yeah, yeah
Damn fool, you could see it in my face though
I'm shittin', I'm shittin', what an a-hole
Fuck that, I'm drinkin' 'til I throw up
Turnt like a muh- 'cause my whole hood showed up

Bang to the boogie, keep a thang in my dungarees
Bailin' through the Eastside, feelin' like a younger G
Eatin' like a muh, but I'm so, so hun-g-ry
I dare one of these young dumb fucks to try and fuck with me
Fucker, I'm back to the party
Marley, Bacardi, shawty, gnarly
Becky, and Vicky beggin' me to give me hickeys
Through my Dickies
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Said put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(What?) Upside down (what?) upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!)

Lil' mama tryin' to show the Dogg her G-string
While she sang ain't "Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang"
A nigga throwin' signs tryin' to let me know that he bang
Like I give a motherfuck what he claim
Ay, your nigga better chill doggy
'Fore I treat him like a old bitch and menopause him
I'll stop your ass right there
I swear had homies on your head like hair
Homie I ain't thinkin', I'm too busy drinkin'
Plumber of the month, mami show me where your sink is
So I can get to uncloggin'
I hope that lil' cat ready for this Bigg Dogg and woof!

Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Said put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(What?) Upside down (what?) upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!)
Pause... pause... pause...

Look, I'm just a young nigga in the biz with mo' enemies than friends
Get no money goin' out, but I got it comin' in
And no, I ain't a G but every day that's what I spend
I get paid to drop a verse, for 16 I need ten
End all the speculation
Them pre-conceived notions got me over-compensatin'
And for you slow niggas that mean I've been concentratin'
I'm shittin' on these records while you rappers constipated
Uhh, it's get money, fuck haters
Me and hip-hop is like Chucks and blue laces
Me and Snoop Dogg is Sir Charles and King David
With Problem we all ballin' like the '09 Lakers
Yeah, it's Terrance Martin on the track
And I'm that young nigga droppin' crack back-to-back
My album on the way and I ain't worried 'bout the stats
But I could tell you how the streets gon' react
They gon' say

Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Said put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(What?) Upside down (what?) upside down
Put 'em on up and turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) And turn them thangs upside down
(Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!) Upside down (Fuck it up!)Embed
