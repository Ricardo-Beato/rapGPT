DY Krazy
Lord, Wop
It's Gucci

I'm praying to the Lord (Lord)
Please get me out the block (The Lord)
Guess he see my heavy heart (Uh)
He gave me my reward (He seen it)
I'm praying to the Lord (God)
Middle finger to the law (Lord)
I know He see me working hard (Workin')
He gave me my reward (It's Gucci)
I'm praying to the Lord (It's me)
Please get me out the block (Wop)
Guess he see my heavy heart (Huh)
He gave me my reward (He seen it)
I'm praying to the Lord (The Lord)
I know my tongue's a sword (I know)
He see me working hard (I'm sorry)
He gave me my reward (God)

Praying to the Lord that these folks respect my privacy
But help you spend your money up, the split, I learned from Iverson (Uh)
The world cold, thot hoes, scarfing and conniving (Burr)
Chase a check, fuck a bitch, God I know you're watching me
Got me repping different, when I hear this shit it's shocking me
I shocked the block, I dropped the top, then pulled up at Blue Ivory (Yeah)
Trap, rock, hip hop, everybody mocking me
I'm in a soft-top Maybach, I tinted it for privacy (It's Gucci)

I'm praying to the Lord (Lord)
Please get me out the block (The Lord)
Guess he see my heavy heart (Uh)
He gave me my reward (He seen it)
I'm praying to the Lord (God)
Middle finger to the law (Lord)
I know He see me working hard (Workin')
He gave me my reward (It's Gucci)
I'm praying to the Lord (It's me)
Please get me out the block (Wop)
Guess he see my heavy heart (Huh)
He gave me my reward (He seen it)
I'm praying to the Lord (The Lord)
I know my tongue's a sword (I know)
He see me working hard (Huh)
He gave me my reward (God)

Real steel penalties
Federal sentences (Federal sentences)
Phone time limited (Hello?)
Face them consequences, bih (Face them consequences)
He told you about the Bentley kit (Told you about the Bentley kit)
Did he tell you 'bout the door he kicked? (Did he tell you about the door he kicked?)
Did he tell you all time you'll get (Did he tell you 'bout that time you'll get?)
If you get caught with another stick
Whipping up a brick, Zone 6, fuck my nemesis (Fuck 'em)
Pray to God that I forget, I don't want no memories (God)
Dome full of convicts, envision the synergy
They stabbed him with a ice pick and threw him off the balcony
I'm praying to the Lord (Lord)
Please get me out the block (The Lord)
Guess he see my heavy heart (Uh)
He gave me my reward (He seen it)
I'm praying to the Lord (God)
Middle finger to the law (Lord)
I know He see me working hard (Workin')
He gave me my reward (It's Gucci)
I'm praying to the Lord (It's me)
Please get me out the block (Wop)
Guess he see my heavy heart (Huh)
He gave me my reward (He seen it)
I'm praying to the Lord (The Lord)
I know my tongue's a sword (I know)
He see me working hard (I'm sorry)
He gave me my reward (God)Embed
