17 ContributorsDon’t Trust ’Em Lyrics
Hey yo, pass me a Kleenex before I lay this shit down
I can’t believe this shit man
I tried to be a lover boy, little bitch broke my heart
Words of wisdom

Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

What happened to “be honest with me and I’ll be honest with you”
Your whole past Mrs. Innocent I thought was the truth
Bitch had me felling ill on my knees barfing my food
I’m no longer the same nigga now; I’m heartless and rude
My homies said never trust a ho, but I casually ignored it
'Til I got caught up in it, now I see the reason for it
But I had to be retarded, go and release my heart
I always thought that I’d bring the drama, never knew she would spark it
That’s just the way to learn, I go the tables turned
To get to my cold state of mind I had to make it burn
For pussy, one night stands is my only source
Fuck that love shit little bitch, I’m feelin’ no remorse
Why should I? You had me acting like a fool
Trapped inside your loop because you’re scared to sacrifice the truth?
Come on, how many niggas you really fuck with?
How many time you really suck dick?
Quit lyin’ to me you dumb prick
You might also like
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

I’ll never find love, screw it, fuck it
Been through enough shit
There’s nothin’ you bitches can do to go renew your justice
I’m too disgusted and I’m tired of being played with
You should have thought about all this prior to the occasion
You fucked around, thought for a while you was amazing
'Til I got the pieces and piled up the equation
Had a nigga goin’ in and out your crotch
Not knowin’ this little skank done been around the block
A year later out the blue we having trust issues
After I already fell in love with you
Come to think of it the image does fit you
You fucked every nigga on the thug menu
And I’m the dumb kid who
Thinks he found his soul mate, he’s blinded by the light
'Til it goes dim, now his hand is right beside a knife
A violent type of life is what society offers
Man, why even bother?
Just remember
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

They’ll hide their colors from ones they wanna love
Even if you ask her, more than likely she ain’t gonna tell
Been through this too many times, so take it from me, ooh take it from me!

Yo if you about to fall in love you need to think twice on it
‘Cause girls are triflin’, they’ll start lyin’ when they invite you in
Have you feeling like the man; you think you found a keeper
Girls have said they love you; but when she say it, the sound is sweeter
Your love drowning deeper, now she’s acting like she smoking pounds of reefer
Confessing that whole fuckin’ town done beefed her
Then you like “I left this bitch with my heart, she ripped it apart
I should have seen this from the start”
The shit you and her go and do it sounds nice
But the fact remains, you don’t turn a ho into a housewife
That’s what the fuck I did, and I regretted it, that’s why I’m negative
No medicine could get rid of this
The next bitch who lies to me, watch me damage her
I’m pickin’ her up and body slamin’ her
And that’s real, so if you think your girls a ho but you didn’t witness it
Assume she’s a ho, 'til proven innocent
And just remember
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

Fuck love, Don’t hate me
Hate these lying ass bitches for making me make you hate me1Embed
