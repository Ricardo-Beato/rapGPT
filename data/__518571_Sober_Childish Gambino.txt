And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high

Girl, what's your problem?
'Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time
Oh honey now girl, we can solve them
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
If you let it shine, you can free your mind
'Cause I know

And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
You might also like
Girl, if it's done right
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
Oh honey now girl, give it one night
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be
No, no, no...

And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
(I want to be the only one)
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)
(But now I'm so high)

And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high...277Embed
