6 ContributorsGet It Right Lyrics
Time flies
No time to waste while it's passing you by
Time files
Be patient 'cause good things happen in time
We gon' get it right, we gon' get it right
We gon' get it right, we gon' get it right

Protest the anthems, yes, we chantin'
A movement of people, it's like we dancin'
To the ministry of, it's the energy of
In memory of, of them that we love
The trinity of the people, the peace, the power
The truth we speak to power's even louder
We can say it Blacker, we can say it prouder
A woman vice president that went to Howard
Now we talk helpin' Black businesses
And our differences is magnificence
Bringin' light to the poor and where the prisons is
I was told good life is where forgiveness lives
The ascension is to leave what's left behind
And feed the seeds with deeds that bless the mind
Caress the mind and question just defined
When youth and God and time are best aligned
You might also like
Time flies
No time to waste while it's passing you by
Time files
Be patient 'cause good things happen in time
We gon' get it right, we gon' get it right
We gon' get it right, we gon' get it right

How can I be a better father, son, a better grandson?
Honorin' Fannie Lous and the Fred Hamptons
The Harriets, the chariots that carry us
To various areas that marry us
To progress, yeah, we the harvest
The lovely days and midnight marauders
Even through charges and days of darkness
Know we in the hands of the greatest artist
I see it in the waters, I see it in our daughters
They could be bridges that know no borders
For so long them folk tried to ignore us
When we at the ballot box, it's a vote for us
Peace to Stacey and the people of Georgia
Who galvanized so that we could move forward
Steps of order with the presence of mind
Everything's more beautiful in time
Time flies
No time to waste while it's passing you by
Time files
Be patient 'cause good things happen in time
We gon' get it right, we gon' get it right
We gon' get it right, we gon' get it right

Goes to, goes to what I love
Goes to, goes to the one I love
Goes to, goes to what I love
Goes to, goes to the one I love
Goes to, goes to what I love
Goes to, goes to the one I loveEmbed
