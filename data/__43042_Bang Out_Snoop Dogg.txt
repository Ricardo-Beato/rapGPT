6 ContributorsBang Out Lyrics
Bang out, til the sun comes up
The wheels fall off and the drop collapse
Cause I bang out, keep my Glock in hand
While you're posted up, chillin wit'cha mans
Bang out, won't catch me slippin'
While you in the club, goin' out for keeps
Cause I bang out, shots go off quick
Catch yo' ass butt-naked while you wit'cha bitch
Cause I bang out

I toss up the set
I walk up in this bitch with some gold on my neck
Yeah nigga, I'm controllin' the set
Rock and roll on a bitch then grab a hold of my dick
Uhh, I pop a hole in your clique
So you don't wanna fuck with this
One nigga found on the ground, we don't fuck around
D-O-double-G Pound, L.B.C. style

Victory, is mine and Iâ€™m gon' shine
Ain't no need to try, can't stop my grind
Keep my pen in hand, goin' on for mine
If you didn't know, just press rewind
Victory is mine

Eastside Long Beach Rollin 20's
Yup, we fully wit' it
Yeah, we wear them black and gold coats
With the patch on the back that says "Steelers"
A lot of niggas wanna do us but they can't
Cause it's hard to get wit us
Watch out for them sliders, boy we riders
Heavy hitters, Eastsidaz, yeah
We shoot first, talk later
Nigga y'all hater, Doggy Dogg spray ya
And then I slid away
Smooth lil' getaway, did it with a chill today
I'm gonna need a hit a day
I live my life like I was John F. Kennedy
Mm, nah, I won't be sent away
Fuck a cop, non-stop, 20 Crip, all day



Yeah nigga, back bangin', hahaha
The big boss Dogg, nigga, Snoop D-O-double-G
R&G nigga - Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece
Fuckin' these niggas up once again, yeah yeah
And you don't stop
BANG OUT!Embed
