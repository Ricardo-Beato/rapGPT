Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are (Ayo)
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are (Turn it up in my headphones, turn everything up in the headphones)
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are (Including my vocals)
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga (Yeah that's good, and my vocals a little bit)
Whoever you are, whoever you are (Put the upper bass line in)

I be hatin' sucka MCs and the sucka niggas
Posin' like they hard when we know they damn card
What ya figure? Rhyme-wise, I do the figure-eight so concisely
Musically, we are the herb, so sit back and light me
Inhale
My style is kinda phat, reminiscent of a whale
Young girls' desires, older females' dreams
I be the Abstract Poetic representin' from Queens
Socially, I'm not inane, black and white, got game
If you came to the jam, well, I'm glad you came
See, "nigga" first was used back in the Deep South
Fallin' out between the dome of the white man's mouth
It means that we will never grow, you know the word, dummy
Upper niggas in the community think it's crummy
But I don't, neither does the youth 'cause we em-
​​brace adversity, it goes right with the race
And bein' that we use it as a term of endearment
Niggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went
Now the little shorties say it all of the time
And a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme
Yo, I start to flinch as I try not to say it
But my lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray

The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
It's the neo-nigga of the '90s, c'mon

Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are

I be hatin' sucka MCs and the sucka niggas (I be)
Posin' like they hard when we know they damn card (Hatin')
What ya figure? Rhyme-wise, I do the figure-eight so concisely
Musically, we are the herb so sit back and light me
Inhale (Inhale, inhale)
My style is kinda phat, reminiscent of a whale
Young girls' desires, older females' dreams
I be the Abstract Poetic representin' from Queens
Socially, I'm not inane, black and white, got game
If you came to the jam, well, I'm glad you came
See, "nigga" first was used down in the Deep South

​​brace adversity, it goes right with the race
Yo, I start to flinch as I try not to say it
But my lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop, yo, you know the rest
The sucka niggas, niggas-niggas
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
I throw the suckas in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
Ayo, Shaheed, take us the fuck outta here

Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are

You're not any less of a man if you don't pull the trigger
You're not necessarily a man if you do16Embed
