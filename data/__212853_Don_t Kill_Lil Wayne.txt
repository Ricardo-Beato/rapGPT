70 ContributorsDonâ€™t Kill Lyrics
And if I fuck her, she gon' get attached
Who invited all these fuck-niggas?
Man, shit ain't ever smell this good
Why them snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these niggas, wake me up when it's all over

Bitch, come kill my time, but bitch don't steal my shine
I'm cooking up two quarters, bout' to get rich or die tryin'
I got some killer's on my side, some kill up in my swisher
All this hatin' drive me crazy, take the key out the ignition
Oh my god it feel like Coogi weather
I lost my mind, but I got it back like groovy Stella
Tell them hoes I got that Victoria Secret weapon
I hope you live a double life cause you gon' need an extra
Me and my niggas we got bad bitches up in the pool
Bad bitches up in the pool
She gon' learn tonight, call that shit night school
And life is a bitch on her cycle, delightful
Got ho's on that powder, like light blue
Nice move, now king me nigga
Badass bitch, you seen me with her, we on that
GT Vodka, straight out the bottle, genie nigga
The difference between me and these niggas, is
I go hard and they go wrong
She say, "Hit it from the back," I'm tryin' to leave that crack alone baby
You might also like
And if she love me, I'mma love her back
Who indictin' all the tough niggas?
We smoke that skunk that's always smellin' good
But why these snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these nigga's, wake me up when it's all over

Street sweepers and millimeters, AK's and skateboards
Let 'em know we got beef for anyone who got a taste for it
Real nigga to the bone, bristle
Cocaine, like co cripple
Heard niggas been waitin' on me, well I might as well go and tip 'em
I'm smokin' on that Hulk Hogan
I call shots, you call forward
I pimp my ride, my car's ho-in'
And all my bars be barcoded
These YMCMB stars glowin'
Hate a ho-nigga, like anchovies
My young bitch keep on snappin' on me, I told that bitch I ain't posing
That pussy feel like a pot of gold
The money old and the night is young
All them niggas keep talkin' shit
I make you eat your words and bite your tongue
And when the guns ring I'm the ring leader
Got those ho's on pins and needles
I'm so high I left Earth
And ran into Venus and Serena
Get head like a mind reader
You washed up, I'm the dry cleaner
Don't worry about me, nigga I'm one-
Hundred like a high fever
Got pounds takin' up closet space
Guns all in my bitch crib
Since all you nigga's fly now, bugs all on my windshield
And if she tense, then I'mma rub her back
She alright, I think I fuck with her
Man, I wish a motherfucker would
I feel like a hockey puck nigga
Way too cold to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cold to die young, give these niggas the cold shoulder
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, another bitch when I roll over
We fuck until we fall asleep, wake up and do it all over
