82 ContributorsUndying Love Lyrics

Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At The Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars
Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45
'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evenin'
From Nevada where the sun was beamin'
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs "Peace", kept it movin', I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no, that's down low
My baby's drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around, yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower
On the last swing, I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter
Thought about my nine-side Glock
But somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack
Seen wifey layin' with some nigga mumblin' shit
He had one hand on her ass, and she was rubbin' his dick
Toastin' wine glasses, cherry scented candles was lit
Couldn't handle the shit
Searchin' for words — I found none
Without a sound, I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through
You might also like
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?

Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face, was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
"Son, you home early — they wiped you out that quick?"
I said, "Nah," showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, "Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' — and probably still is
Snuck in my crib, some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me"
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20G's on a ring I would've hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front, when I talked he had jumped
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock — Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze
We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide
Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots, couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger, cocked the Glock and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said "Amen"
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer
Held her close, squeeze the toast
Said to her, "Now unto God, we elope... we elope"
