68 ContributorsFucks Given Lyrics

She text me today
She said she hate me
She's not the first
She probably won't be the last
I don't give a fuck

I came here to do my own shit
I came here to do my own shit
No fucks given (fucks given)
No fucks given

What you know about me
No one else can do it like me
No one else can do it like me
I was checking I.D
She don't look 18
She don't know 18, no
I was doing my thing
You know I was tossing that green
We ain't even on the same team
We ain't even hit her with the real shit
I'ma show these motherfuckers, you ain't really seen bread
Aw, I'ma do it for the real niggas
When them boys ain't feeling ya
Real only see a real nigga
Heard of Bino? Man, that boy amazing
You don't hear me 'cause a nigga blazing, blazing
Oh, you don't want a problem
You don't want yo man to solve 'em, naw
You might also like
I came here to do my own shit
I came here to do my own shit
No fucks given (fucks given)
No fucks given

I'm killin' these niggas off a mixtape
And most these niggas out been fake
Me and my niggas all homeless
We ain't hear shit that y'all told us
We was getting money, you ain't getting money
All we did was study, all we did was study
We don't give a fuck about status
Girls and you know I got baddest
Just cut her off, she the saddest
Wish a nigga would like Aladdin
No chill, dress code I'm like "oh well"
She ain't seen my hotel
Man them numbers don't bode well
War is hell
This ain't war but I'm beefin' nigga, my ether nigga, wooh
I don't fuck with the fake shit
More green than a spaceship
We don't fuck with y'all, no way
Y'all ain't got no taste
Rappers lie boldface
Now we in the mix
If you broke we can fix it
Sayin' I ain't doing things, look at this shit
Look at this shit, look at this shit
I came here to do my own shit
I came here to do my own shit
No fucks given (fucks given)
No fucks given, uh25Embed
