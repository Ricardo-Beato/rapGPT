22 ContributorsRunnin Lyrics
DP on the beat
Sosa on the beat

Sosa, where you going? To the money
Runnin' to it, bitch, I'm runnin'
Like I got on cleats
Pull up, stuntin' like I'm going to luncheon
You call my phone, you talkin' a hundred
Million, yeah, bitch, I want it
Baby, I can take you on an island, I ain't talkin' Stony
How you just keep hittin' it floating?
Baby, I can buy you a new sew-in
Baby, I be pistol toting
Got my pistol and you know it
I go too fast, she like, "Boy, slow it"
I'm like, "Okay, baby, I'm gon' fold it"
She like, "Boy, that's a hundred mil' on the table"
I'm like, "I know it"

Jewelry blingin', bitch, I show it
They like, "Boy, you gettin' bloated"
I'm too turnt, yeah, bitch, I'm loaded
And my style, these niggas stole it
Chopper come through wrestling, Mick Foley
Bitches like, "Oh God, I'm glo-ing"
I remember when I ain't have nothin'
I woke up like, "Oh God, I'm glo-ing"
There go the damn police
I'm gon' get up out of here slowly
Baby, I got on a Breitling
I can't buy you a damn Rollie
'Cause if I bought hoes anything
I be ballin' out, you know it
And I done gave your ass a chance
You done fucked around and blowed it
I get money just as fast as the damn stove shit
I don't need Shaq, I ball like I am Kobe
I don't need Yao, I ball like I am McGrady
Just call me when you talkin' money
Swear I'm money brazy
You might also like
Sosa, where you going? To the money
Runnin' to it, bitch, I'm runnin'
Like I got on cleats
Pull up, stuntin' like I'm going to luncheon
You call my phone, you talkin' a hundred
Million, yeah, bitch, I want it
Baby, I can take you on an island, I ain't talkin' Stony
How you just keep hittin' it floating?
Baby, I can buy you a new sew-in
Baby, I be pistol toting
Got my bitch on and you know it
I go too fast, she like, "Boy, slow it"
I'm like, "Okay, baby, I'm gon' fold it"
She like, "Boy, that's a hundred mil' on the table"
I'm like, "I know it"
Where you going? To the money
Runnin' to it, bitch, I'm runnin'
Like I got on cleats
Pull up, stuntin' like I'm going to luncheon
You call my phone, you talkin' a hundred
Million, yeah, bitch, I want it
Baby, I can take you on an island, I ain't talkin' Stony
How you just keep hittin' it floating?
Baby, I can buy you a new sew-in
Baby, I be pistol toting
Got my pistol and you know it
I go too fast, she like, "Boy, slow it"
I'm like, "Okay, baby, I'm gon' fold it"
She like, "Boy, that's a hundred mil' on the table"
I'm like, "I know it"7Embed
