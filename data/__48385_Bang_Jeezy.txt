13 ContributorsBang Lyrics
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
If you ain't from round here dog don't even come around
Twist your fingers up bang motherfucker bang
Throw your hoods up bang motherfucker bang
Eastside
Hit em up bang motherfucker bang
Southside
Hit em up, bang motherfucker bang

Do your thug thing gon get em up
Represent your side nigga hit em up
Disrespect we gon take it there
We thirty deep lil nigga we ain't fighting fair
You better holla at your partners
Before we catch them outside and hit they ass with them choppers
The .45 make my pants sag
Catch me bouncing through the club with my black flag
You don't like it do something nigga
Where I'm from if we don't like it we do something nigga
And you know we gon ride homes
Stomped a nigga ass out until they turn the lights on
You might also like
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
If you ain't from round here dog don't even come around
Twist your fingers up bang motherfucker bang
Throw your hoods up bang motherfucker bang
Eastside
Hit em up bang motherfucker bang
Southside
Hit em up, bang motherfucker bang

Me and Jeezy on the back street
Choppers in the back seat
What we finna do the question's you ain't even gotta ask me
Desert in my lap and skullcap and a black tee
Looking for the niggas that say they finna attack me
Turn the music down low and let the 'lac creep
Fuck the police, I give a damn if they catch me
Wait a minute that's that nigga looking at me
Let off fifty shots you niggas ran like a track meet
I know my partners would have did the job for a flat fee
But seeing them niggas bleed is the only thing that's gon relax me
I'm hands on nigga damn what you say
All them games that you play don't stand a chance in the A nigga
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
If you ain't from round here dog don't even come around
Twist your fingers up bang motherfucker bang
Throw your hoods up bang motherfucker bang
Eastside
Hit em up bang motherfucker bang
Southside
Hit em up, bang motherfucker bang

Roll up on your block
All the bullshit stops
Man ho know that I'm the prince so that ass gon drop
I was born in the A with things in the way
Smoke weed everyday
Zone Three where I stay
Yeah I think I'm the shit cause I got an SS
But the shit a old folk so you can receive the letter
I'm the best of the best
And the freshest of the fresh
Gotta pistol black out wit an Atlanta Hawk vest
Gotta lifetime of trouble and my brain still nervous
I don't rep the A by mistake I do the shit on purpose
Do it how it's worth it rim and the cars swerving
It ain't nothing but Lil Scrappy and g's up to start murking you
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
Hit em up, peace up, A-town down
If you ain't from round here dog don't even come around
Twist your fingers up bang motherfucker bang
Throw your hoods up bang motherfucker bang
Eastside
Hit em up bang motherfucker bang
Southside
Hit em up, bang motherfucker bangEmbed
