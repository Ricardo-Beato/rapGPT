5 ContributorsHands On You Lyrics
When I put my hands on you
I'ma hold you close and I'll make you feel like you're safe (I'm hold you close girl)
When I put my hands on you
I'ma caress you from your legs, your waist then go to your face, go to your face
When I put my hands on you
I'ma touch you and make you come close so you come by my way (You come by my way)
When I put my hands on you (And when I put my hands on you)
I wanna feel everything you got to give me girl, okay?

I'm a real nigga, with real feelings
I'm a rock star, Future Hendrix
And-and I just wanna show you affection, and I just wanna show you affection
It's party time like winter
When the party over
We can wine and dine
You got some things on your mind
We can talk about it (We can talk it over)
I wanna listen to everything that you have to say
You make me feel some type of way

When I put my hands on you
I'ma hold you close and I'll make you feel like you're safe (I'm hold you close girl)
When I put my hands on you
I'ma caress you from your legs, your waist then go to your face, go to your face
When I put my hands on you
I'ma touch you and make you come close so you come by my way (You come by my way)
When I put my hands on you (And when I put my hands on you)
I wanna feel everything you got to give me girl, okay?
You might also like
You, I'ma touch you when
You take off your shoes
I'ma show you just how cool I really am
You're not my homie, you're my friend
You're really like my fam
You have a way to bring the passion in me
And girl I'm in love with your personality
When I look at you
I stare at a masterpiece
And I know what to do with you if you was layin' next to me

When I put my hands on you
I'ma hold you close and I'll make you feel like you're safe (I'm hold you close girl)
When I put my hands on you
I'ma caress you from your legs, your waist then go to your face, go to your face
When I put my hands on you
I'ma touch you and make you come close so you come by my way (You come by my way)
When I put my hands on you (And when I put my hands on you)
I wanna feel everything you got to give me girl, okay?
