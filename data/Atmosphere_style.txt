We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh


We've been listenin to the vermin, squirmin
Tryin to find a way to get the words in
Twisted space through a missile at the middle of existence, missed it and hit its face
That's my place, give it back
Didn't react, too busy choking on the fat
Follow for now, swallow this spit
You velvet you get ripped
Gift of gab, this mic gets grabbed
Life gets dragged like racist lip stick on men's faces
Complacent as a passive racist
Pathless makeshift, glass knife
Aim for the face lift
I wanna break shit, run up and take shit
I can't take it, runnin' a space ship
Escapism, great livin'

Yo, man, how you doin' man?

Nah you can't borrow shit!

We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh

Can I run up in the settlement
Should I change you like the government
Burn rhymes like sniffin' on double-mint
Make troubles then I blow off suckers then
Bourgeoisie brothers talk about sufferin'
Burn rubber in a silver Delorean
We aim to win, made to end
Fraudulent styles but you play em again
The face card!
Mimic of an action-figure
Embedded in the trash can
Last stand on an ocean of sweat on a path to the sun, how close can you get?
Must be high off the cost of livin'
The life of rhythm, get lost in the vision
Toss that fish in a lake of snakes
Self and Slug came and caught the brakes
Hell - been through it
Jail - seen
Melanin brothers like chalk on pale
It's all good from time to pale ale
Had 50 G's sent straight in the mail
I keep that on stock for all hard rocks
We camouflaged stone cold
Don't stop cause your songs on
You could crip walk before gettin' laid straight on a futon
I got screws gone
Members of my crew gone
Bustin off in the center til the roofs gone
I'm too strong, dealing with snakes on the regular
Take 10 shots to the jugular
Come on, order the special, I dare ya
Get served that riddle that kills your character
Cuttin' at the beams with a hacksaw, on a camel's back
Killin' yak through the last straw
I'm glad y'all made it, now let's see how far we can take it
Already heard that joke about how shit flows
Now get off the mic and get off the coke!

We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh
We came here to slit your throats

The first time I met the devil was at a Motel 6
She left hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks
Sexy little bitch, shorter than expected
About 5 foot 5, big and thick in the breast and thighs
Beautiful, dark eyes, a strong stare
Large lips, soft hands, and long hair
I said I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it
I'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle

Who cares what Jane says? She always spits the same spit
I'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit
Little sister needs seclusion, some how she'll discover it through the pop music
Got used to the feeling of falling, but she'll never see her following
Bouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering
Riding the outer ring of your own private saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the grey matter
Little baby doll she doesn't know what to say to ya'll
The patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall
Break it all smash the past like it was made of glass
Ain't no other way to make it last
It hurts to watch Lucy lose the dream
I've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream
And when she calms down I'll turn the sound down
And put my arms around the little lost and found and I'll tell her that

Hush little lady don't say a word
Or the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed
And if you let them know that you're vulnerable
Then there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow (yo yo yo)
I'm a chapter in your textbook read me like a checkbook
Mistook love at first sight for a sex look
Enough of the blind man's bluff
I want the good stuff
Trying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub
The modern man's hustle I dig it, I shuffle
Feed me your troubles and need me to cuddle (come on)
Bundle up in my mitten and coat
As cold as it gets I keep your winter afloat
So let the snow fall (it's coming down)
She doesn't want to understand why I still come around
She looks at the mirror, she don't see what I see
She holds no history of how precious she be
Lay your head on my chest, speak of the stress
Kick your feet up and rest, before we clean up the nest
I hate to see you upset, it cramps the position
And if you didn't know, you better listen (you better listen 'cause)
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle

Alright
Baby listen, they playing our song
You want to slow dance with me? C'mon
You can just say no
You ain't gotta be a douche about it

I was just a kid, she was just a kid
Lost in the mix, it didn't matter what we did
She used to baby me, I was her baby doll
I used to chase her around, she was my basketball
I guess it had to fall, I should've known
No model to follow, we were both from broken homes
But we used to laugh about acting grown up
And I could hear her mom in the back yelling hang the phone up
A teenage love, a teenage love
Keep up the crush on what it means to us
It's okay girl, we don't even need to fuck
I was the first one to show her what a penis was
We used to sit on the park bench and hold hands
Staying out past dark to feel the romance
Summer time I was waking up early
Bounce out the flat little worm, get the birdy
Walk to her house and watch a couple movies
Kissing on her nipples, playing with the coochy, whoo!
That's as far as it ever got, pet the spot
Get her all wet and hot, and then it stopped
Frustration, soon after that
She broke up with me like boom it's a wrap
She said that we were moving too fast
No seducing the ass, she needed room to relax
But hold up now, I don't understand
All I really wanted was to be your lover man
We can wait, no pressure, I'll be patient
She said stop calling me, I'm taking a vacation
So there it was decorated with the wordplay
I'm at school and I'm tryna hide my hurt face
She started seeing others but it got worse, wait
She let my homeboy hit it on the first date

Never run of the mill when I shoot the pill
I'm a son of a spill, I've got boots to fill
Showed up with a deuce-deuce of swill
And a guardian angel on my Coupe de Ville
Shark in the lake, heart strike the drum
Mark landscape with a dart-like tongue
Spit my blood from deep in the gut
Smoking cigarette butts with my finger-less gloves
Pull over at the welcome sign and raise a toast to those that fell behind
Everybody else got a crippled spine
From tryna' take it back to a simple time
Keep a little pine tree, hang from my rear-view
Beats turned up just enough not to hear you
Gonna swim till the fins get torn
I shall return, keep the engine warm

Millennium Dodo
Pull out your telephone and take you a photo
You didn't know? Better read the logo
You don't wanna play around and get ocho
Recline like I don't care

Now I was at the party sleeping on the couch
When I decided to grab a bottle of something and bounce
I'd rather be by myself
Than have to navigate another fake cry for help
On the beaten path with a bandaged fist
To represent the last half of the damn I give
Play me in slow-mo', fly like a blimp
Millennium Dodo, drive with a limp
Windows down, heater blasting
Got my coffee but I need some aspirin
Watch me merge into speeding traffic
With the truck-stop plastic, cheap sunglasses
Show respect
You broke down on the side of the road, wanna choke my neck
I've got a glove-box full of stolen checks
And I drink moonshine that the chrome reflects

Flannel, look like a farmer
Underneath camo, look like a hunter
With that ski mask, look like a robber
Sleeping in the barn with the doctor's daughter
Got stories to wax, pour me a glass
I run with the ghosts of warriors past
South side, call it pop life
Y'all catch frostbite waiting at a stoplight
All over the map we get festive
It's a matter of class
You can tell by my lack of attractive skeptics
You just mad at my mustache
Hey girl, we'll always have Memphis
But right now, I want breakfast
With the pedal to the metal 'til we hit West Texas
Then cross to Mexico to see my dentist

I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh
I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh

I'm laughing at me, not with me
One hand to keep the other hand clean
The full moon looked like a tangerine
Fell out of the sky to land into the sea
But when I drifted up on that beach
Previous presidents got impeached
Then she put me on the longest leash
I feel like a new drug on these streets
And ain’t nobody in denial
I’ll eat your dinner off the kitchen tile
Never been afraid to go the extra mile
Just wanna see you flex your sexy smile
Woke up on the bottom of a fox nest
Top heavy like a cop's vest
But I gotta put it in the context
She's not an object, she's a bomb threat

I never felt the world explode
Until it was too late, oh
You had me when you lost me then
I found I couldn't stay, oh
Sometimes you were around the hours
I wish you were away, oh
The things we want ignite in flames
Sit back and watch the parade, oh

It's just her and me and some cheap balloons
Turn the key and sing the tunes
The full moon looked like a macaroon
I feel invisible till the afternoon
But everybody wanna catch a star
To try to recharge that electric spark
Crash a car and set it in park
But she’ll smash his ceramic heart like a dead guitar
No spotlight not the type that needs vacancy to occupy
Gotta put that rabbit back into the magic act
Astronauts but they’ll launch your Cadillac
No stop light, no stop sign, no basis to apologize
Fight for that right to love, that’s what life is of
Look up high, you can see us fly above
I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh
I never had those finer things

I parked on a vacant road
To get away from people and watch the planes approach
Turn the music down, put the windows low
Turn the headlights off, but let the dashboard glow
I try not to reminisce
'Cause many of these memories ain't got no kind of benefits
It's the same old lick, you can paint the bricks
But your face is just a way to decorate your shit
I'm the motherfuckin' man when I'm standing in it
'Cause I don't know how to swim, but I project the image
That I'mma go all in, got it under control
Until I grow my fins I'm still plugging my nose
No surprise, stolen by the tide
You can close your eyes but the hopes stay alive
And the crow gonna fly
And the dope gets sold, other than that
There's really not much to know
Don't cut this rose

This lonely rose
With thorns to show
It grows alone
Too hard to hold

Quick to tell you that she don't need a man
From what I've seen I completely understand
Can't stand a cat that try to make demands
Plus her man said he sick of bringing beach to the sand
Quickly sinking in the holiest boat
Figured he might as well drink just to keep it afloat
Nope, when small things end up being gigantic
Relationships go the way of the Titanic
Why panic? Have some fun while it last
Be happy that you even had a spot on the cast
She hard to keep 'cause she know what men about
It just took you too long before you figured it out, huh
Moving fast don't mean it won't end quick
Why put your toes in when you can skinny dip?
Remember when you're with the prettiest chick
There's another man that's sick of putting up with her shit

This lonely rose
With thorns to show
It grows alone
Too hard to hold
This lonely rose
With thorns to show

There is a temperamental magic in the key of love and war
It go "Nothing up his sleeve, not even a fucking arm"
Body ain’t a temple if it’s disassembled parts
Allocated into separate level warps and divorced
Tell tents severing up pell-mell dash melting
Squeegee in his post to a cheesecloth silk screen evenly
East coast tilt kings raised by servals
Pacing up the grape vine nervous
Poke jarred brain matter adequately curious
Pick a perfect patsy, herd ‘em back into the turnip truck
Where a high arch pose as the nobles
Fine yeti fur with a dire prognosis
He prefer to mire with the openly grotesque
Opening a cold discotheque coat check
Oh my low-tech bolt neck, go time, no myth
I'm a slow death goldmine

The first time I met my wife was on a Wednesday night
Making party in a German bar
Murs was there, the rap-off at the Gasthof
Check it out, true story

I got something on my mind, can I leave it with you?
I'm still feeling you and all the things that you do
Remember Wednesday nights in that basement bar
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far (sorry)
Hellbound we must have drowned in a bottle of some rusty brown
Running town to town, like shut 'em down
Shut 'em, shut 'em, what?
When the buzz wore off you still stuck around
And when I think of all the lines we stepped
And the tolerance required to forgive and forget
When I reflect on the boundaries and limits we set
I recognize neither one of us is innocent
Look I'm just a song writer, I'm not a wrong righter
But I'm alive and I'm proof, survival ain't exclusive to the strong
We all tryna keep it calm
So this goes to anyone who sings along

No special effects, I wanna touch your flesh
But baby I'mma do my best
Love connection, nuff respect
I never said I'm the best
You can check for better, but don't hold your breath
But baby I'mma do my best
We were both impressed, it felt so correct
And I ain't never said I'm the best
Sometimes I forget but I know I'm blessed
But baby, I'mma do my
From the first time that we met, you're my best
She made me wait a couple months for some sex
Murs wasn't there
Echo, echo, echo, echo
Delay, delay, delay, delay
She made love to a switchblade
Then stayed over night for a whole decade
That safety net doesn't mean that your nest is safe
Well played, but still called a checkmate
He made love to a rosebush
Drew a crowd, all of y'all can look but don't push
It's a thin line between crime and justice
First you gotta find us, then you can judge us
Outlaws, we far from flawless
We guilty of whatever the accomplice accomplished
And if the cops drop all of the charges
We'll be out all the mall with identical outfits
Like a couple of fly motherfuckers
We married so we don't testify against each other
Till they name a holiday after Marvin Gaye
That's all I got to say, you can stop the tape

We know what it's about
Or maybe we're still tryna figure it out
Or maybe it doesn't matter, we couldn't care a lesser amount
We know what it's about

And I don't even know why
I can't hold on to a word that you say
You escaped from your cage
Just to dance and play across a random face, like
Fly away, little horse, fly
'For it finds you on the front page
We're familiar with the frustration
To say we stay sedated, it's an understatement
Look alive, life is a celebration
We would like to use your current location
Lost faith after the first rotation
And gave it back to the dirt like it wasn't worth saving
And oh, Lord, if I wasn't so bored
I'd already poured this bottle on the floor
Yeah, right, we ain't spilling a drop
About to get so high that we feel like Gods
And I don't even know why

Confident, I need to go surround myself with sunrays
Life's too short to keep shoveling flakes
I walk into the water till I'm covered in waves
From the first breath till the next laugh
Better have a plan to catch your best half
Never let the lakes break beneath the heavyweight
Gotta spray a little paint on this designated negative space
And I don't even know why
But I'm committed to leaving you with the valid and vivid impression
We could separate the pain from the message
But state of mind still in the state of corrections
And I don't even know why

It doesn't matter who you are
You're just another superstar
Everybody gets to shine at the hotel bar
With the fireflies that fell in the jar
Ain't even trying to get free
Buzzin' around is fine with me
That's why I keep one eye on the clock
The other eye on my drink
Make it link like a lock, the timing is key
Got my hands tied up, still climbing this tree
So can't none judge what my crisis might be
Everything will even out when I finally sleep
Tipsy, dreaming about being a pirate at sea
Huh, I hear the sirens singing for someone else to listen
Got me thinking I avoided a bullet
But a lot of my vision was under blurry conditions
I watched from the top of a volcano of bullshit
Which came first, the thirst or the curse?
Most can't distinguish which one is worse
Bartender in a tuxedo shirt with the sleeves rolled up
'Cause she's seen enough dirt, whatever
Look, I don’t know if the ocean is close but
I'mma keep going til I no longer float
Aight, so quit trying to micromanage my emotions
Keep the glass half full or keep the tab open
Last call for alcohol protocol
The television that's attached to the wall
It show a basketball game with the volume off
And I don't know who's playing but I know I'm not, it goes

Into outer space like an Apollo ship
Coasting off the bottom shelf booze and the klonopin
I'm lost, wrote my room number on the fob
Put a dollar in the jukebox, ordered up a shot
Now everything is frozen, just floating flickering dots
As we fade into the night without ever giving it thought
But that's the idea, we don't come for the atmosphere
The food's shitty, the cable's blurred but I'm happy here
We're all alone but ain't nobody keeping tabs there
'Cause misery's a meal that's served better with a glass of beer
Yeah, so fill it up and let me sulk
Smelling like whiskey and complimentary soap
It's the same four bars in every city I go
Surrounded by fireflies just trying to find their glow

I feel like a firefly
I chase all the fireflies
I feel like a firefly

Tie it up to keep the lye bacteria gagged
To a minimal stack, it's a fixable flat
A sideline will get you sidetracked
Put it up if you feel like a blind rat
Just trying to climb out of a wine glass
We under attack but not allowed to fight back, right?
You not about to fight back, right?
We might strike combat if it's time for that

I think I'm still drunk from last night
I woke up in a lawn chair
I feel faint like an old ass flashlight
I don't remember how I got there
Waiting at the train stop, hoping that the rain stop
The pain throbs at the front of the skull
I should have took the day off, looking for a pay off
The brainwash is insufferable
I'm on purpose, coffee in a thermos
Squint like Clint tryna spot me in the cursive
Missing persons, lost in your costumes
Blood, moon and a boombox full of volume
If I had the authority I would probably
Make everybody throw their hands in the sky
And everything I said in this song would be classified
And all of y'all would be captured alive

I mighta showed up when the party start
I mighta  got high with your bodyguard
I mighta  passed out at the airport bar
Everybody wanna see a falling star

Once upon a time in the next few days
I gotta wake up and get out of the shade
I might put on a beat down pair of Chucks
My old swimming trunks and AmirSaysNothing in my earbuds
Just me and my beer gut
I absorb it before I get deported back to orbit
Over the winter I remain indoors
I want the summer in my city to feel like a rain forest
And you know we should skinny dip
In the middle of the Mississip
Do a couple of spins and shit, synchronicity flips
A three-sixty finish, Twin Cities bitch
And I don't care 'bout what y'all think
Dressed up like a cop, stuck up the bank
The police came in some Russian tanks
And I'm in jail with nothing to drink

I mighta showed up when the party start
I mighta  got high with your bodyguard
I mighta  passed out at the airport bar
Everybody wanna see a falling star
I mighta  thrown up in a rental car
I mighta  woke up in a reservoir
I mighta  got robbed at Mardi Gras
Everybody wanna see a falling star 
I want a snack machine on the party bus
Your flag is green, in God we trust
You were born in sin, we were born in debt
I guess this is about as feel-good as it gets
I want Wonder Bread wrapped in rubber bands
It's not too much to understand
I wanna color the world but only got one crayon
Reach for the sky, try to touch my hand

I mighta showed up when the party start

Head, pressure, senses, clutch

Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life

From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch

I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

It goes one for the cannabis, and two for your Dianetics
Three for the reasoning, and four for those that try to get it
Five for your love and six for the stress
And seven for the day that I climbed into this mess

I'm catching ulcers from the child-proof lighters

I'm tired out by the distances achieved walking in my sleep
Thoughts got shifted since the high got a tad too deep
Ask dad to keep cool, I'll call him back soon as I resume normal

Fuck lines that make the sinus choke
Fuck chasers, trails, fuck waves and rails
Fuck hangovers, fuck hallucinations
Regurgitations, mandatory sentences and UA tracing
Blind my insight and dull the common sense
Give me inhibition, kill the superstition and the confidence
Built a tolerance, now it's more that I consume
And when it boards up my room, the world's whores will croon in unison
Unify the eulogy
Autopsy pages read euthanasia, i.e. irony
Well, here I be within a pool of my drool
Sedated, windows dilated, comatose, life overdose
Tell Jacob Miles to keep it wild style

Dear Jacob
I won't take up too much of you time
I know you're trying to get your video game-grind on
And that's fine
Just gimme a second to empty my face
Before I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase
I've been watching you and I'm proud of you man
You're growing up to be the best man that you possibly can
I know you understand why I go out of town
I also know my days are colder when you're not around
Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be adapted to the fact
That daddy never lived inside the same shack
And sometimes I get this pain in my stomach's pit
It's what I get, I'm convinced it's my punishment
For those nights I got drunk and let go at some bar
In some city with some people I don't know
For all the times that the lines on your face
Reminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped
It trips me out how you pick up all my traits
From the way that you spit to the fists that you make
I watch the way you try to keep your mom happy
Daddy learned that from you
You're supposed to learn that from daddy
I can't teach much when it comes to women
I drive safe and slow but don't know nothing 'bout the engine
You're doing good little man that's all I really meant
I love you
You're my best friend, thanks for listening

Dear Craig, what up bones? How it goes?
Yeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old
Sorry that the phone calls ain't too routine
Just been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing
Sometimes the weeks fly a little too fast
And sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed
Other times I'm not sittin' on enough cash
And other times today feels too much like the past
Sometimes at night I would watch y'all fight
A child wonderin'
Why your life just ain't alright?
What's the violence about? Why's it in my house?
And even the memories are turned up too loud
Yeah, I got some issues in my head
Knew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you
I'm not trying to get you down, I know you're different now
But your little man just wants you to listen now
I'm over 30, can't maintain relations
All these women want to hurt me and I just don't have the patience
I can't trust them, and they're not much help
When they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself
What pride, fists, and words just might do?
I'm afraid of my fate, don't wanna turn out like you
I've never hit a woman
I won't do coke
And for that alone I love you and I want to thank you, old man
Dear Sean, what's going on? Not much to say
Just checkin' in with you, trying to see what's wrong today
I know there's gotta be something kicking your bruises
How's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?
Got a lot to lose, it's breaking your shoulders
So you let your paranoia place your bets for you
Too many cigarettes, messing up your voice
Too many arguments, trying to test your poise
The only women that love you are fans and family
Mom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly
No heavy rotation in any location
You're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation
Plus you're getting old, your raps are exhausted
Stop it, everybody knows that you've lost it
Singing for these kids you don't know
When you should be at home with your own instead you're on the telephone
Fighting with your girl like it's you against the world
Another drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus
Come and save him Jesus
Place him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas
Sometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done
And love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone
Your son says, "Hi dad", your dad says, "What's up?"
And me, I wanna thank you, but I won't, I'll just say, "Good luck."15Embed
A recording...it's like "Hi this is a recording" and then....

I was born on a rug made of dogs playing poker
Shoulda never let me cross your border
Sock full of quarters, lost on the corner
Not too high but I'm not too sober
I filled it up just to spill the cup
Better fix your bridges, they're still corrupt
My dreams are vivid, I don't wish for wishes
You know nobody that beats the business
And I don't even miss when it was all so simple
Sick off the vino, kicking out the window
Sometimes life's like the card game War
Hide a couple knives in the silverware drawer
Loot like a cop then deploy of troops
Got heavy artillery shootin' from the rooftop
She can't see me when I move through the nuance
What, so what, so what you want, huh?

We outta give you a ribbon for the commitment
It's no squabble, salute, I raise my bottle
To the fact that you found a few fools who would follow
We live for the now cause there ain't no tomorrow
But my mixtape still needs an outro
And you can mark these words with a Sharpie
We make party as long as there's a heartbeat
I'm like a Harley, you're like a Hardly
Get behind me, Satan, you can't harm me
I'm not scared of the flood, squaring up
When Armageddon come, I turn the stereo up
Making love in the back of an American truck
Bust a nut, jump up and hit the airhorn button, what?

Smart phone in case cops pull the gun up
Artichoke, heart's soft, mock duck tough
Garçon, bring a cup of that young drunk
I ain't ya boy baby, you got me fucked up
Wait, let me state it plainly, shut the fuck up
Trust don't occupy space with dumb luck
Hush, fuzz got the tour bus bugged up

Birds snuck through the security with nun chucks
Adrenaline rush, the whole party jump up
I flood nut on her sponge butt

But if they let you keep your shoe strings
They don't want you to suffer
And if you're blessed you can haunt each other
In a city of ghosts where the vultures flutter
Now, mood swings a convenient excuse
Seems that there's gotta be something in the butter
Smother the fire before it gets discovered
One foot in the grave, the other foot in the gutter, uh
Boosting any loose thing, if it ain't screwed down
It becomes prey to my hunger
I take it back to my underground bunker
Stay cool everybody, have an awesome summer

Hoping that you never treat me like I'm homeless
Unless it mean you about to see me with some donuts
Or dominate the nomination where your zone is

Work like a clown with the squirt guns loaded
Only thing worse than being lonely is coke dick
Word got around and now we call you blow fish
You was pissing in your own bowl of porridge
When I rode across the ocean on the back of a tortoise
Never see me try to act like I'm gorgeous
Greasy mufucker make it party with the Socs

Roll my weed in the papers of some old eviction notices

Oh no, no, no
This is pure evil, this is pure evil

When I woke up this morning my only intention was
To look in my reflection with mutual respect, yeah
I know I'm more than just a badge and a weapon, but
When you see me comin' you recognize my profession
You should believe that I'ma leave an impression
Even if it means I gotta put my knee on your neck, man
Was never meant for you to pass this test
The last question on the quiz is, 'What the fuck'd you expect, man?'
A little money made him want some protection
Because the many with no money made the money feel threatened
And we accept there's gonna be some exceptions
But it's built on a connection of ownership and possessions
Baby boy, you pay attention to them lessons
If you flexin' any teeth, I'ma send you to the dentist
It all depends on how you fit into my spectrum
From lectures, to handcuffs, to beat downs, to death wish
I was told to tell a one-sided story
And that's why I had to eliminate your perspective
I was afraid for my death
I had to make an assessment
Ain't my day to be checked, I felt the weight on my chest
I was told to tell a one-sided story
So say a prayer cause this one's gone to Heaven
Innocence is a submissive position
It's a one-sided story, read it to your children

Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die
I'm not perfect, I try
I'm tryna free my hands, grab the day by the throat
Gotta get a grip but I'm at the end of my rope
I'm not perfect, I know, I know

And if I had a spare moment
I'd probably loan it to somebody who needed to hold it
Life's indecisive, might slice you open
Or show compassion and throw you back into the ocean
I'm tryna keep my faith on the path
But the landscape's full of danger flags
You can change your name and still live in the past
Daddy was the face on a package of Zig-Zags

Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die
I'm not perfect, I try
I try
You might fade away, you might burst in flames
Ain't no reason you should even try to search my name
I'm not perfect, okay?

You gotta grow more toes, you wanna fill these shoes
You gotta make love like there's nothin' to lose

Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die

We gotta work it out 'cause I ain't turning around

Huh, what now?

Some say that I pass, none say that I'm passive
White trash with a fraction of Blackness
My mathematics got Native blood too
But no matter where I stand, either way it's fuck you
I've never been a victim of police harassment
And I knew what they seen when I turned job absent
Irish name, Scandinavian frame
I'm a Rubik's cube, I'm the American dream
Check it out
I'm a feminist, I'm also a misogynist
Spit like an arsonist, dick like an obelisk
And I promise if you ever hear me contradict myself
It's not a sign of the apocalypse
I've been an asshole before it was fashionable
And when it's out of style, I'll be the last to know
And if Illuminati listenin', I don't wanna plateau
Who I have to blow to play the halftime show, huh?

Fall from the sky just to learn how to fly
Don't even gotta put me in the dirt when I die
I'm not perfect, I try

Armageddon started, I guess it wasn't that hard to miss
It didn't trip the alarm on your hybrid
Carbon footprint, the darts are rigged
And I'm a big fan of carbs and the artist Prince
There's a marginal risk that your cards won't hit
It's like tryna borrow a barbecue rib from a starving kid
Be thankful if your stars are lit
Or you might get caught between the Charmin and shit
The armor fits to stay outta harm's grip
But Karma's a bitch so when your heartbeat quits
Consider all the death you've invested with
The shoes, the booze, the phone that you textin' with
Disrespecting gets Second Amendment-ed
But the species still seem to be trendin'
From the friend zone all the way to the Kremlin
The devil give a fuck about a flag or an emblem
Things ain't been the same since Trayvon, shit
Things ain't been the same since Reagan, wait
Ain't a single thing change from the days

Fish swimmin' up a river full of pessimism
I wanna catch one bare-handed
Clean it, cook it, and feed it to Lazarus
All around the planet's the same as Minneapolis
Everybody looking for a little love and happiness
I don't romanticize the rain
And those drugs only hide the pain
Turn up the temperature, high as a plane with non-sequiturs
The tired be trained
And you keep Christoper Walken with the shit that you're talkin'
You can't take it with if it don't fit in your coffin
As a kid, I didn't give it much thought then
Just wanted a mouth full of nipple and a Zippo in my zipper pocket
I remember when the whole world stank like an ashtray; yeah
The good ol' days
I wanna laugh when somebody say 'The Good Ol' Days'
But they was good 'cause we did learn to look both ways
Across a road way like everything'll be okay
Before we go the fuck away like a snowflake

I guess it's time to go
Didn't see nobody from my family around
So I went outside to flag a taxi down
I told a cab to take 35 south and let the windows down
I gotta air myself out

I can't wait to get inside
But I never considered that you'd be fast asleep

I disappear into the smell of your hair
And it's becoming apparent that I've become incoherent

Fade to black way under the shellac

Seven in the morning, locked the door
Put the keys in my bag, next to my passport
Feels like I'm headed towards war
Trying to pretend that I remember what we're fighting for
You're upstairs, passed out asleep
While I'm on the front step staring at the street
Patiently wait for my taxi
Come save me and take me away from reality
The car pulled up at dawn, I put the seat belt on
Everything felt wrong
Stubborn ain't the same as strong
But try to tell that to the queen that the king rides on
Took a look before I hit the road
Your silhouette didn't show up in the window
Well all right then
It's all right then, but something's missing

Girl, I miss you

Stole my crown just to examine the thorns
Scatter 'em around on the bathroom floor
A little ink, with a kiss and a wink
But the bigger the stink, the stiffer the drink
And I think this fight started in a past life
Got you sitting on the dark side of the gaslight
Pick up your phone before my plane departs
I'm trying to make a mark in the shape of a heart
Well all right then, we all right then

Outta foreclosure from all four corners
Feels like I'm riding on an old roller-coaster
The ghost of Christmas sober
Mostly, but I'mma overdose on these four leaf clovers
You can dance like a crash survivor
You can laugh or cry, whatever pacifies you
Funny how time flies
Till my family sets my raft on fire

I don't pretend to be cool, don't pretend to be young
I don't pretend to be smart, don't pretend to be dumb
I don't pretend to be hard, don't pretend to be first
And most of all I don't pretend to be concerned
I don't pretend to be rich, don't pretend to be broke
I don't pretend to be asleep, don't pretend to be woke
I don't pretend to be deep, don't pretend to be clean
I’m everything and everything that's in between

They said you only get one life
But I lived at least four lives in the life I'm living in now
And if I could handwrite what they say when I'm gone
It's that he said everything that he could fit in his mouth
I got the coldest shoulders in the solar system
I know because I drove around this whole existence
Resistance to personal growth seems suspicious
What, you really didn't want to go the distance?
I don't stand still, wander off, I’m a drifter
Look at the bigger, digital, panoramic picture
You catch a panic attack from tryna handle the facts
You inanimate on a map
Wait though, I'll never be finished, infinity
Grateful for every opportunity you give to me
And when the time’s right, y’all can lighten up
Like there's too much life to love

I don't pretend to be cool, don't pretend to be young
I don't pretend to be smart, don't pretend to be dumb

I used to be in love with Brooklyn
Way before I ever got to go to Brooklyn
And I really enjoyed the first time I stayed there
But disappointed about how clean them trains were
Spray paint to debate the claim
But she say "the fake fur don't taste the same"
But your chips on your church and save your place
But first make sure that that's the ace of spades, huh
You know you got it made in the fade
When the worst case scenario's a big bowl of cereal
I tried to state my case to the stewardess
To let me take the steering wheel, but they don't hear me though
I know that I could fly this bitch
And if the bitch don't fly I'll build a pirate ship
And when the bottle tips, the model hits the ground
But they love you whenever you're around

You know, still got a long way to go
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road
You know, grow up just to take up space
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase
You might also likeStill got a long way to go
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road
You know, judge us on the love that we make
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase

But the frame didn't fall when the mirror broke
I can't recall what life was like a year ago
Spit it on the front row, disappear, I'm ghost
Call me Smokey like I'm rolling with some miracles (coals)
I got a yard full of love
It grows like a garden with guards to guard it
Around the same time that this party started
We was on the red carpet with artist access
Shooting down garbage for target practice
Martians living in the margin
Imagine the clean streets and the dirty police
We tryna keep the peace while disturbin' the peace
You know, hitchhike to the mountain's top
To take a picture of the  peak that surrounds your thoughts
And my favorite spot to catch a drink still be down the block
From wherever you sleep
You know, still got a long way to go
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road
You know, grow up just to take up space
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase
Still got a long way to go
But I ain't the only one to put it all on the road
You know, judge us on the love that we make
We don't need an excuse to chase what we chase

All these days are numbered
Falling forward, failing upwards
All these roads to Eden
Maps to nowhere, cold to breathe in

You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so

Tell me, have you ever been addicted to somebody
Still functioning within the melancholy
Baby's mommy got me raw like a zombie
Prolly won't stop until she murder me softly
Vanity is such a popular scene
We could build a family out of the crop of the cream
It's you plus me, we followin' dreams
So why we treat each other like we on the opposite teams, huh?
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
I'm trying to play without my poker face
I put the joker in a shoulder holster
Underneath the floor in a hole
And I'ma save it for a stormy day
And if the clouds break tint
The sun will brush it off like it's all made of lint
Silly you, gimme kiss, never say you never gave me nothing
'Cause you gave me shit

Sometimes I wonder if you're fucking with my head
Some kinda monster living underneath the bed
But forever I'mma ride with you, one hundred percent
Even when I never fully understand whatever you said
Feels like I'm looking at something, painful
A little illustration of an angel
You're like a tattoo that's on my eyeball
I'm blind from the shine of your halo
Girl, my imagination is the busiest
Why you trying to match wits with an idiot?
Passion is the measuring stick
We qualify, we set the world on fire
Just to burn up all the pretty shit
I promise you, that I'm accountable
Probably trying to prove, our love is possible
Now paint a portrait of complaints
But when it makes a mess, confess the stains

You're such a sweet thing

It must be the devil when I taste her sweat, it's the sweetest
Might forfeit just to reach an agreement
Throw the fight and then I'll hold you tight
Poke a hole in the lid so we don't suffocate and choke tonight
I know I prolly ain't right, but I'm just right
We thug life for the love life
And look at where we took it, but you ain't have to cook it for me
Sugar ain't good for me, sugar ain't

I realize that we ain't the same
But you might appreciate it if I try to explain
While I'm sitting in the middle of a lake
Gotta find a fish to come and nibble on the bait
I'mma set the stage for the challenge
I'mma meditate just for practice
I'mma concentrate on my balance
I'mma contemplate on this canvas
I'm a bandit running with a stolen moment
The careful arrow, narrow focus
Gotta roll with both eyes open
Quality of life feels like I'm floatin'
Trying to make this minute stretch
'Cause what's in my face is so picturesque
I mean, it even made me quit the cigarettes
I mean, shit I guess I got a fish to catch

Just like an answered calling
When I drop this line in the water
Keep fishing, man with a vision
Look brother I saw the future
You might also likeLook past I'll draw it for you
Strong words of an old soul
"Don't rock my boat," I told them
"Reel em' in throw em' back slow"

Everything looks clear in hindsight
If you can adjust to the twilight
Tryin' to live enough life to last a lifetime
Roll with the ride like I'm supposed to survive
How you know that you alive?
If you ain't fighting for a mouthful of future?
This ain't business as usual, check the tackle
Box full of beautiful, look like shrapnel
Break the cycle and the old mistakes
But the boat obeys the waves
And then the little fish spoke as it broke away
It said, "Know limits, but know with a 'K'"
Yesterday's catch will cook tomorrow
Right now I gotta do what I gotta
Took a time out from the human drama
Put my line in the water, now who wanna holler?
Just like an answered calling
When I drop this line in the water
Keep fishing, man with a vision
Look brother I saw the future
Look past I'll draw it for you
Strong words of an old soul
"Don't rock my boat" I told them
"Reel em' in throw em' back slow"

First love, who was your first love?
And I ain't talking about your first crush
I'm referring to the first one that make you wanna curl up
Or get you worked up enough to try to burn the world up
And I don't care about your regrets
You can keep those secrets to death
I don't need to know what you speak underneath each breath
But we learning how to read what's in between the text
And when you feel like enough was felt
If you ain't tryin' to eat another helping of hell
That's when you tell farewell to that well you fell down
Fall out the frame, take care of yourself now
It's no thang, come out of the cold rain
Make giant steps, gotta catch the coal train
Everybody wishin' on some better days
Don't let the storm door hit ya, and don't ever change

Second guess your own instinct
Probably best to just listen and think
And don't expect anything less than the kitchen sink
It feel like you're still trying to lead a horse to drink
And I don't dig dramatic
But it was signal static when the thunder struck
It doesn't matter how much clean the vulture up
It never look like a dove, you still gave it your blood
And that's love, I never hated your guts
I never even understood where that phrase was from
But why would you believe that I could trust your touch
If you ain't never make me wanna sleep in my truck?
It's more than a drug
It's more than any liquor you could pour from a jug
Trying to find a little bit of normal on the bus with the windows cracked
It's why we don't look back, it's like we won't be back, right?

Third time's a charm, you've heard that before
Display the scar, you've earned that at war
Turnt on alarm, a guard at the door
But ripped out the heart, was par for the course
But if the furnace doesn't burn at the core
Maybe your purpose ain't to learn anymore
Dinosaur can't soar if he trying to snore
And ain't nobody leaving with a perfect score on the board
But we never got bored of the wind
The memory of how it tore through the skin
By the end of the week it's gonna weaken
Pinned in between depend and discipline
Can't nobody judge but we can pretend
We got it all figured out, no questions left
When the truth is we never even move one step
Just do it all over again and again and again
Any way that the cold wind blows
I'll go 'cause you ruined my home

In my past
I’d wish for something different from what's within my grasp
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
As a child
I’d try to find a way to be okay with how I smile
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
Anybody that I've known

Look at my face
So many miles, I can’t complain
I won’t complain, I don’t complain
I might complain, but still told the truth
My water stay running, but my food don’t move
I make a size 12 footprint
Make love to my wife, make music with my real friends
My voice make enough noise for the books
Then I hunt these woods to catch dinner for my children
Got me dreaming I could reach through the phone
And kiss the family goodnight then sleep like a stone
Hotel, motel, feel at home
If you play a little Nina Simone

I'm kinda like a bumper sticker
Listen, you’re kinda like an artist, you got the vision
Looking at the mirror like it's competition
And it’s always trippin', but you’re not intimidated
We all tryna stay alive and innovative
Everybody aiming at the face of similar limitations
We all cut from the same pavement
If you and I are gonna search through this universe together
First gotta desert the center
Some of us will be mad at the world forever
And some of us don't even curse the weather
Whether or not I gave it everything that I got
It won't stop a single raindrop
But when it finally wash my finger-paints off
I'm tryna make sure it don’t spell my name wrong

I didn’t believe that I could have anything else to share
I mean that I knew I could help somewhere
But I never felt as bare as when I felt your stare
That's what I get for thinking that I’m self-aware
We purposely search for what the purpose be
But the truth is I wasn’t even present in the currently
I coulda been a phone call for an emergency
From some hotel on Bourbon Street
I try to keep reminding my mind that what's mine
It’s just a asinine way to pass the time
Go, hold your kids 'fore they grow too big
Like a minute is forever when a memory’s a gift
Give this one to anyone
No box, no lines made of dots, no labels or locks
Gotta brave through the pain that we're shaking it off
Shave with the crane and aim for the top

I wanna give you the world like it was mine to share
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here
You'll always have my words, I try to speak ‘em clear
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here

But I’ll still be here, I’ll still be here

I'ma still be here, I’ll still be

And I'll still be fascinated by the freedom of wings
I wanna know what you dream with no strings
Looking at shadows and the shapes on the ceiling
Make a little noise to communicate your feelings
I feel fortunate, I found fulfillment
I see my father in the faces of my children
I'm so vain that my heart's like a rooster
You make it hard to be afraid of the future
And when I hear you singin' along
I remember that I'll never be alone again
Judge me on what I depend upon
I want forever to spend with my fam’ and my friends
And I still be guilty
Of challenging the people that balance and build me
That’s why I’m speaking to you and when you reach it too
You can pick up the pieces and see what it do
I wanna give you the world like it was mine to share
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here
You'll always have my words, I try to speak ‘em clear

And if that don’t work, I might be unprepared
But I’ll still be here, I’ll still be here
From the bad to the worst, my love’s sincere
I'ma still be here, I’ll still be

And I ain’t gonna front like I deserve your love
I'm still trying to learn to love
It's my long term ambition
But the burden burns so big you can’t miss it
It was worth the tears
I want my verses to persevere
I don't need a souvenir to prove that I was here
'Cause ever since you appeared, it’s been a happy new year

I'd give you the world like it was mine to share
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here
You'll always have my words, I try to speak ‘em clear
I'll still be here, I’ll still be here

Let's make a bonfire
I got a blanket in my trunk
One blanket, and we could wrap it around both of us
The lake is beautiful this time of night
I wanna listen to your breath
While I look at the moon
Plus, plus I got you this overpriced iced latte
Look at the stars, check this out

There's far too many breakup songs
And there's not enough songs about the moment we met
A lot of words get spread, the pain, shame, and regret
And I'm not holdin' my breath for any change to the sketch
But I hope to death somebody can sing about
The countless times that we found a way to even out
Even though we were born to work with these hands
It's in the plan for us to learn the insecurity dance
It goes: make a party as the method to prevent it
I'm so sorry you reacted so defensive
If I could lend an unsolicited suggestion
Don't even know if I'd recommend that you paid attention
You might also likeThey told me "Hell never felt so good"
But I could tell that they only tryna sell some books
"Look, y'all know that I would help if I could"
But I was too busy tryna nail myself to some wood
There's more songs praising the people we went to prison with
Than there are praising the people we make children with
And I ain't saying either one is more legitimate
But it'd be ridiculous to think that it's coincidence
Shit, I'll never be the best at this
I write songs that I'm living in, welcome to my sweatshirt
I think it's magnificent that you're presently present
Thanks for listening, appreciate your effort
Cinderella, fit your hand in the glove
We on a spaceship, crash land from above
We on a lazy river, fly fishing for love
We on a double barrel shotgun, hunting for dove
Life is just a song, I hope that it's long
It starts with "hello" and it goes till I die
If I did know it all I'd at least attempt to clarify
Why we try to over-emphasize the goodbyes

We try to over-emphasize the goodbyes
We always over-emphasize the goodbyes
So just pretend this is a long hello

You can pretend this is a long helloEmbed
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I didn't stop, ‘cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you, I don't know what I would say
We can sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of light
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?

I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
I can't front, I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit
I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with?
There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it
It doesn't matter, this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of…

I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running
You crept out the front door slow
And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know
And by the the time I looked up, it was booked up
Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept
You disappeared, but the history is still here
That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer
I can't even get mad that you're gone
Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me
I'm sorry, it's official
I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins
Had so much hatred now it brings me shame
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I know it wasn't you, ‘cause you passed away, Dad
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do

'Cause I put any questions to rest

Because you don't even know what you're talking about

My old lady say I'm paranoid
She thinks that I'm not on point
'cuz I pace around with no purpose
Observant, peek out the curtains
I don't recognize that car
So why's it parked right infront of my yard?
It's been there for the last few minutes
It seems too suspicious

So set the alarm and the motion lights
Protect my house....
That fence ain't enough to keep the riff-raff out
Somebody gon' test,
....I'm breaking out in a sweat
It make the hair on my arms stand up tall
If it's a private number I don't answer the call
I'm simple, I want some peace
From all the criminals, thugs and thieves
But I ain't tryin to involve police

Wanna come see me, he better drive a tank

The one who's putting gods smile back upon my hands
The plan this evening is hiding behind leaves and brush
Quiet the breathing hush wait for the right time to rush
Grab your man by the forehead, slid the device across his throat
I'll hold him tight while he chokes, 8, 9, count to 10 drop the body rip the pockets
Come ups, cash and plastic wrapped rockets, hey mister mister you think that you're the shit
But you looked really funny when you felt your tendon rip
There's a thin line between fire and fear, hey mister never should have set your shop up here
Cause I've been thumpin' chumps that push dumps to zombie tree stumps
Big man on the avenue becomes mommy's little speed bump
And this punk was easy, must've hated spinach
And the pigs all smiled they never like you to begin with
Ain't trying to be the man no more, cause I'm a man now
About to take your crew to war, I got a plan now
I'm used to blood and death outgrew the gut wrench
So tell the devil I said fuck him when he finds you on the bus benchYou might also like3Embed
Everything used to be so good then
Now it seems like you're mad at my footprints
I'm only trying to scribble in the book, man
It's not my fault that y'all couldn't
You must have a lot of free time
Otherwise why are you trying to see mine
Strain your neck, let the blame project
But don't give yourself the same respect
So independent but undependable
We're all getting old, now take a mental note
And stop being so covetous
The crime is the punishment
Now run and get a sliver of dignity
You ain't gotta be a figure of misery
You don't want to be a victim to victory
Listening to a bitter sweet symphony

You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
Your jealousy needs an anthem too
You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
And all of these dreams that can't come true

We used to get up in Uptown
Then we hit the highway to run around
Came home everybody wanna judge now
Don't let them see you celebrate your touchdown
Keep clutching those grudges
Don't budge if no budget
The old puppets show love in public
But behind the back can't trust it
Disgusted, repugnant
Insulted, repulsive
Discouraged, rejection
No protection from your own reflection
Chip on your shoulder big as a boulder
Insecurities a slippery slope
Got ya looking around for the sympathy vote
Anything to give a little glimmer of hope


Treat love like a limited resource
Fight for it like there's never gonna be more
On the rooftop talk to the spaceships
Like you've got 2Pac locked in the basement
Get the bag, make the get away exit
You get mad like your middle name desperate
No net, better not get left back
Yeah, you should probably protect that
I'm trying to keep it simple, teeth to the nipple
Beat my chisel, leave my initials
Fly so far when you follow the signals
Sky full of stars and all of them wishful
Not only are we bitter but we're brittle
The world's getting small, and everybody's little
Go roll your eyeballs, toot your own whistle
Don't ever stop waiting for the window

And ain't nobody seen him around anymore
Ever since she left it's like he doesn't even open the door
He'd rather be by himself anyways
In the comfort of his home and his video games
Until the break of dawn, early in the morning
Alarm clock sounding like Gabrielle's warning
Gotta get yours like there is no wrong way
The worm and the bird both worked a long day
And when he comes home afterwards
He looks back once more at the last chapter's words
To try to reinterpret exactly what he heard
When the universe collapsed and flattened the Earth
Pretend that you don't live in the past with us
Give the kids a reason to laugh at us
His heart's broken, but when he hears a car door closing
It gets him off the hardwood floor hoping

And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never gonna end
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
To find a place that we ain't never been

He so exhausted of mourning his losses
Doing his best just to cope with the process
A grown man can't depend on the promise
Plus you gotta be careful not to be too cautious, right?
Getting dumped ain't the worst that it gets, I guess
You could literally lose your breath
You could die in a fiery car crash underwater
And never understand why somebody doesn't want ya
And every night it's the same routine
Ever since you disappeared he just staring at a screen
A couple beers 'til he's light in the head
And then sleeping on the left side of the bed
Well everybody's waiting on some sort of return
Keep the honesty soft and the priorities firm
And even though you'll never ride a horseback through
He needs something to look forward to
Of course we do

And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never gonna end

I ain't the one
I never was the one, just another son of a son of a gun
Grandpa had the skin of a drum
Ru-ru-run but you can't escape what you came from
Bite your tounge, chew blood like it's gum
Climb aboard the diving board, time gets shorter when a child is born
I'm a quiet storm, but when I'm dry and warm, I take final form until you slice the chord
And make the line go flat on that life support
I gotta make some space so I can reach these stars
My face looks like an old race car, tryin' to put it together before it came apart
And when they lay my parts where my name is carved, they should save my heart in this mason jar
Minnesota, Uber drivers, Google Maps to the universal fibers
You're nobody 'til you stole some lighters, cat burglar disguised as a nervous tiger
We've been to many places but earth is liver
Save it, give me likes and favorites
Everybody's famous, I'ma need a lifetime of patience
Remind me what your name is? You won't find me in the known locations
I'd rather be alone in my beautiful basement, whoo

This on my list of shit to do, after I pick which whisper to listen to
And you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, ooh

And I know that I'm supposed to pretend
Like I'm afraid of the day that it's all gonna end
Where the hell have you been?
And how did time get spent, huh?
I gotta, gotta stop messin' about
Stick the neck out like you're stretching it out
The king wears a crown made of clouds
The whole crowd will get loud if you miss this foul
If you don't mind I'ma go mind my business now, whoo

Yes, and I guess, it's just a sign that I'm a pessimist
But life is limited if time is how you measure it
Nobody's innocent
Let's quit pretending such
Just let it finish up so this message can self-destruct
And I don't know my high from low anymore
I'm just trying to do my best
Trying not to get carried off the floor
Climb down the fire escape and throw the mask in the trash
We drowning in a tidal wave from a bath tub splash
And when they finally try to harvest a colony
It's probably when everybody is around an olive tree
It's likely gonna be too late to crown a hero
But we can make a statement making party at Ground Zero
And I can do this to ya all night long
But I, no matter what, I'd still be doing ya wrong
And when I'm strong enough to break out of my eggshell
I wanna hear the ladies yell like I've aged well

We fought ourselves we think we won
We taught ourselves to reach the sun
Took a chance going against the odds
We don't die, we won't even stop, watch

To make a brighter day
Instead of wasting life away
Waiting for lights to change
You not seeing me
I'm swallowed by the scenery
Camouflage my injuries
Channel all my energies
I leave room for the lens to shift
Should've predicted or presumed that you'd be sensitive
But every story needs a conflict, and ours is
I can't find a fuck to present you with
And baby it's the same song whole world singing it
Some of us just humming along some of us really bringin' it
And if it fires up a fraction of the sleeping giant
May we live long enough to see the times that redefine it
And I'm certain all that pain is for a purpose
Makes no difference who's the first one to write their name up on the surface
Some day your work will find its way to get observed
It's just there's too many words and nobody's getting heard

We fought ourselves we think we won
We taught ourselves to reach the sun
Took a chance going against the odds
We don't die, we won't even stop, watch

I pledge allegiance to myself
Food, shelter, and health
Let me find a beach full of seashells to sell
Put your oxygen mask on first before you offer me help
I've got receipts made of scar tissue
Got the vision of somebody going fishing in the dark
When I start up the motor, it still turns over
But nowadays, a little bit slower
Never been afraid of getting older
I'm much more nervous about these public servants
Kill the lights and shut the curtains
You ain't a real lion if you love the circus
Looking at myself like, "What's the purpose?"
That's when I started to hallucinate
Tryna touch the surface and recuperate
You should've seen the look on my face when I was losing my faith
Y'all got me feeling hesitation, embarrassment
I might be the last generation of grandparents
I know that I've been fortunate for all the opportunities
Disproportionately disappointed in the human beings
I get it, we're specks of dust
At the bus stop busking for extra crust
Like fuck it, you can sacrifice me to the weather
If you promise that you'll let my songs live forever

You're looking for a bag of tricks
But my love is like a stack of bricks
Cobblestones and untreated lumber

And when they come for my box of dreams
I'ma finally depart from this toxic scene
No posturing, just lots of self esteem
Got you feeling like the popular queen
This ain't magic, this is fabric
And it's the type that never requires patches
And it's the fire that illustrates with ashes
It's our life, it's nothing we can't manage
Lower the arrow and take a breath
I won't waste ammo aiming at the angel of death
I might have already left, but they hear me still
With my pale knuckle grip on a steering wheel6Embed
That little kid in the window's looking out at the winter like:
"This whole world is mine if I can get this bitch to shine"
There's no kind of friction to find
'Cause ain't nobody runnin' towards the same finish line
Looking at the dirty snow in the street make you believe
Everybody must've just adjusted to the grief
Choose what you use to motivate yourself
You can either hate me or you can hate yourself
Can't trust your fears
You spent a whole bunch of years being judged by peers
All you wanted was to touch my ears
And get inside of my head like: "What the fuck's in here?"
Had to take space from the hazardous waste
Save the rags for acid rain flashbacks
If it can wash off that awful toxic aftertaste
Maybe that can replace all your trash bags
Baby, I don't know, but you're obviously feeling yourself
And that's a beautiful thing, I hope you're real with yourself
'Cause all we got is ourselves and these mouths to feed
And those keys on your belt that held you down on your knees
Whatever dawg, I'm not the underdog
I'm just a side effect of following my thumbs through the fog
I'm outta here, all apologies to your kids
Your whole forest on fire, hollerin' 'bout the bridge
And everybody tryna do they best
But everybody's best didn't take the same piss test
I guess I should expect resentment affects perspective and context
And you've perfected your bomb threats
Yeah, we get high and we gon' die
But either way, those leaves don't lie

Less luggage makes it easier to fly

But I'm alive
I thought that it was more than a tattoo
Try not to get caught in the classroom
Tomorrow morning while the galaxy is forming
I'ma find a box of stories
Buried in the garden underneath the pouring rain
Never seen the storm before it came
Find the strength to forgive my jinx
Swim the length of the kitchen sink
Freedom of speech don't mean what you think
Hold that thought I'm 'bout to close the ink
Y'all know I never gave a frozen shit

Goes on every hour
They trying to drown me
Feel like I am falling (falling, falling, falling, falling, falling)Embed

I can't listen if you can't be accountable
I'm not your competition never been your obstacle
You peacocking just to walk a dotted line down the middle
When you talk now you sound like a pillow
I see the daggers in your eyes like javelins
Ain't nothing going on but the smile on the mannequin
I fantasize about a peaceful release date
But that's standard life we all reaching to keep faith
Sometimes I gotta climb inside, start it up and drive
Just to figure out why I'm allowed to be alive
I was overestimating the damage
It ain't supposed to be as average as the picture on the package
Your fireworks got my sensories on high alert
I'm not trying to put my energy inside the worst
I fight the urge, to submit to your hurtful shit
I ain't got the wish to waste on a perfect bitch

If we wanna stand a chance of standing up without a crutch
And I ain't trying to sound dismissive of that target you've been squinting at
We've all been aiming far beyond our range of limitations
Even when I try to take the bullet I'm impatient
Looking at your face for validation
Fly like dishes but sleep like strangers
Protect my interests, what you think these fangs for?
This isn't even anger
It's just disappointment pointed in familiar directions
This is tight and stressed like a tightrope stretched
Across my whole chest, this is why I'm flexing
Please forgive my voice but I'm lost in the void

It was a dark and stormy night
Puddles of rain reflected the stop lights
The world fell asleep, but I'm wide awake
Listening to traffic on the highway, from half a mile away
I'm looking up in my family, kaleidoscope
I'm trying to float with some harmony, hit some higher notes
And I don't know if I'm supposed to cover your eyes
But I chose to hold your hand and watch the sun rise
Live within the gift
Recognize the warnings
Memorize the answers
This is a recording
I love you to the moon and back
There's nothing new 'bout that
It's just a proven fact
And somewhere my dad is listening to the engine purr
Someday I'm gonna finish my verse
I inherited that free-refills-type thirst
I'm counting on my children to break this curse
It goes

Hyper-vigilant and militant, en garde
Unscathed, slaves free while they unchained
Life's a maze, fiends live in concaves

I would send you back to the bowels you're born from
I raised a glass when you swallowed your forked tongue
I recognize your counterfeit confidence
Got me convinced that the crime is the consequence
You're a derivative of bullshit, literal
Unoriginal, that's why you're miserable
We had to pick up the pieces, it wasn't difficult
I guess you didn't know, your impact was minimal
The opposite of opportunism
Your costume is so transparent, now you're virtually invisible
There's no such thing as a typical individual
There's nothing left except "fuck you" on principle
Seventh of September, still running the temperature
Smoking like an ember, drinking like an amateur
Tripping like your grandpa at the strip club without his pills
Make it rain two dollar bills

Yo, peep the piece of scum, you conceded to become
Competing with me is dumb, seed it deep inside the trunk
You must be drinking cum, 'cuz you talk a lot like a cunt
Get punched and knocked out in the crosswalk right in the front
Your existence is food for my machismo
When I push up on a fool, he's stuck on freeze mode
That ain't a full quip, riding on the Jean-Paul
I ain't got no attitude, I just got a mean soul
Everybody else telling me I needed to grow
Shut your pharmaceutical ass up, and put that weed in the bowl
Got some cancer cells to kill, now the answer from hell
So pass the bill fast, 'cuz I over pressurize my master seal
Don't over glamorize a man to kill
Don't let 'em grow up, thinking he has to actually blast to steal
And make sure they know there's more to life than just some rap skill
It's like decades later emcees get trapped still
Power to the people
Don't let a coward lead you
Can't preach to you if they don't know how to feed you
I burnt the haystack and found the needle
Then proceed to, invest the water, cows, and diesel
And sour diesel, wholesale banana trucks
Hotels in Panama, no dope sales, we're manning up
Unplug the cord, debug the store
We love the lord, but keep getting drug into war
What's the gun for? If all we're doing is talking
What are you doing marching when all of these humans starving?
The diamond's like, shine a light, they got it right
Or, we can set it off like dynamite
The balance is found, Los Angeles bound
In a van full of cannabis pounds
We came back to stick our flag in the ground
If you're down, put your damn hands to the clouds

You gotta try now
Waiting on the morning light
This is what you want in life?
You gotta shout now
Sleeping all morning 
Is that what you want in life?
As the sun sets, the moon rises with vengeance
I ask you to witness what revenge is
Moving mountains and inches
The business is resistance
Powerful as we evolve
Get involved, we can get it all
Altogether we could get it solved
Bosses that'll pay the costEmbed
I wrote this one when I was still alive
Hey you, yeah you, listen
And if I had a horse
To climb up and ride off into the warmth
I'd never turn around
I'd just kick up this dust 'til I find where I'm found
And If I qualified as a genius
Maybe I'd live out my dreams and die dreamless
These voices in my life are all make-believe
Trying to find a way to exploit my choice of pain relief

It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply
You make me wanna understand your graffiti
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me

I'm examining the clouds like I'm looking for a sign
I hope you're having a good time
If you wasn't afraid, would you lie so much?
You got your tail between your legs chasing fire trucks
You can tell I'm not the best at expressing how I felt
That's why I hide it inside the words I spell
I mix the medication, it fixes whatever ails them
And now she treats me like a snake oil salesman, huh
Well, thank you for your vote of confidence
I don't give a shit about how it figures into all your politics
Still believe you gotta make your art, play your part
The world waits for you to break my patient heart
Now let me find a road by the airport
To park and watch the planes arrive and think of what I'm here for
And I ain't tryna kill the vibe, but I'm grateful that you're still alive
Now gimme a high five

And just in case I don't say this enough
Thanks for the love, I love the way that you love
And I ain't making this up, you put some change in my cup
And then you gave me a hug, it's like you came from above

She said she want somebody she could take care of
And right then is when we paired up
Pull a chair up and make a space for yourself
You should taste what I felt
It's probable that those on the bottom gonna hold you accountable
It's lonely at the top and it's also hostile
Everyone got their own course full of obstacles
Don't let your heart grow cold like a popsicle
She said she want someone to treat her as an equal
And right then we started speeding towards Reno
Burning rubber in a burgundy Regal
Fly like the dove then dive like an eagle
I'm a 70 deuce, that year was a classic
Buzz got loose and we're here trying to catch it
She said that she was unimpressed
That's when I stood up and did the Kanye West

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah

She said she needed a place to feel free
And right then we started building a team
Trying to make a better perfect, a little purpose
The only thing for certain is the sleep disturbance
But ever since people started measuring time
We've been looking for an easy way to settle our mind
Take a load off or take your clothes off
Or shut your eyes and roll straight for the roadblock
She said she needed something that she could blame
And right then is when I offered my name
It's the only thing I've got that'll always remain
So I'mma share it with you, so you can complain too
She said she want to find a cure for death
I know she meant that in the purest sense
But when I finally die, put on your Sunday best
Then throw your hands in the sky like Kanye West

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up

The time got a price, but the trouble is free
If we gonna struggle I'mma do it comfortably

The snow's deep I can't wait for the spring
I go to sleep to try to change up the scene
I'm overeating, still running on steam
I know I'm drinking just to numb the dream
I'm sitting in the courtyard lit like the north star
I'm trying to figure out where yours are
The bonfire kept your hair out my face
While we was staring up at space asking Jesus for a raise
But of course now you're gone
You've got me looking forward, towards a new dawn
I got a look up more words to forge a few songs
So I can cook some d'orderves for my boys and they mom
But the chase stays driving me craze
And I'm supposed to embrace it like, "Thanks"
And I shouldn't waste time complaining
'Cuz I'm alive and I'm inside from out of the raining
It goes

And we could try to make up for lost time
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side
And we could both read a different chapter
As long as I can see you in the after
No matter where you wake up tonight

It's just a song that helps
Might as well make a sketch
Write it down, used to write all the time
I see you from the other side of the shine

Do you remember when I slowed it down?
I was trying to make it last like the letter zed
And I'll admit that in the back of my severed head
I'm asking if she'd rather be sleeping up in a seperate bed
She's the magnifying glass between the sun and the fuse
She matched every single hue of blue
She was eleven eleven, I was a catch 22
Make a wish, but wait until i'm sleeping next to you, huh
And I can go my whole life without another love
But can't go a full night without fucking up
Are you serious?
The sky fell, I'm still walking on shells trying to protect myself
And each time that lightning strikes
You said I look so lifelike
But that's like it looks like
Somebody brought some sunshine to a gun fight
Come find me on the bright side
And we could try to make up for lost time
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side
And we could both read a different chapter
As long as I can see you in the after
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side

I don't need no fancy shit

I'm an example of a man convinced
So let the planet spin and I'ma grab the wind
I don't need no fancy shit

And you don't know what the answer is
Nobody knows what that answer is

Peter was my peeps who used to sell weed
Even though he didn't need to
He says he did it for the free smoke
But honestly he would've rather had a speed boat
Or a snowmobile or whatever
See the point is he didn't move enough to make a treasure
Never could have guessed that Pete would make a little impression
On a middle aged detective named Hamm
No irony, yeah Hamm
He didn't come to put the cuffs on your hands
He landed with a duffle and a plan but
Pete couldn't eat all of Hamm's demands
It was an awkward spot, officer thought
That Peter would be sittin' on a lot more crop
He did such a bad job at bein' a bad cop
That its obvious to me that the reason that he robbed him was Sidney
Sid was a sick kid that needed a kidney
The grandson, son of Hamm's son
You do what you gotta do for your fam son
Doesn't take a rocket scientist but I am one
The situation showed the pig for who he truly is
And gave the dealer an excuse to quit
And since Sid's Physician is Peter's father
You should mind your business, don't be a bother
Okay

Somethin' at this party don't feel right
The vibe reminds me of an overnight drive
But I won't complain because it's not my place
And everybody got their own way to celebrate
It's all the same, it's all the difference
It's all about the aim mixed with the distance
It's all the pain and sickness
And everybody in this bitch is over privileged
Its like I'm in a bad movie called "Worst Party Ever"
A cameo from Snoop Dogg couldn't make it better
I'm lookin' for the line for the bathroom
But I'm too distracted by your awful tattoos
Its not meant to offend if I neglect to pretend
To be impressed with the way you're dressed
And shut your mouth, your breath smells like death
I'm convinced this whole house is possessed
A bunch of demons, all of y'all are demons
I think the dog tried to warn me and I didn't believe him
But I can feel them all scheming on my feelings
Now I'm about to climb out this window towards freedom
Get off your chair and put your drink in the sky
Anybody could be gone in the blink of an eye
Spent my whole life reppin' my whole city
So when I die, I'ma take y'all with me

And butter up another batch of those muffin tops

Wound up with a wife and a gang of kids
Her kiss tastes like black licorice

I used to know this woman who had the most beautiful
Tattoos on the top sides of both of her hands
She was forty-three years old and as far as I know
Had never yet been with a man
It's not that she wasn't attractive;
She was beautiful, but it was the way that she interacted
She was aggressively passive to the point where she
Would've intimidated any mitt that ever tried to catch it
On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
She claimed it is what God resembled
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
And this one she explained looked like the devil
I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
How the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
The sweet flower that they both seemed to hunger (Sweet flower)
Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Heaven and hell both take to this woman's womb
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
But if I've learned anything in my years (My years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprise (In surprise)
But what happened next damn near stole my tears
The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped, I left and I don't regret leaving
And I'd never forget all the things I saw that evening
A glimpse of religion, a piece of coming closer
To understanding more about what intrigues me most
I didn't get turned on, I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
For each one of 'em I've hurt and every time I've been burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
About woman taking in all she can
And for as long as I breathe I'll save a seat in my memory
For that woman with the tattooed hands

Camera thief, take pictures
Run like the parallel stitches
Attach my feet to the path I beat
Teach myself to keep the answers brief
Gnash my teeth like the last to feast
Imagine me on that abandoned beach
Sand and sea as if the jazz was free
I’m Ice cream mixed with gasoline
Direct attention to the craftsmanship
Neglect to mention that the past will stick
Like initials carved in the concrete
Like the tattoo that hides on your mommy
I still kick it with angels
The difference is instead of the bar, I’m at my kitchen table
The starlight shines through the glass
But you feel safe underneath that mask

Ferris Wheel, give rides
The scars healed in time to get high
Lock the doors and hide the keys
Let's go describe how to climb a tree
Don’t sign the lease just cop a corner
For you to curl up and try to sleep
Those cheap police won't find my wings
I keep my dreams inside my dreams
And If I had a time machine
I’d probably use it like a vacuum and try to clean
It kind a seems, quite more than a handful of these regrets have been circumstantial
Now give me all the cash out the drawer
Touch that mustache down on the floor
And I’ll be in court holding a pitchfork
'Fore I let the contest outlast the sport

Pulled out a sack full of Samson’s hair
And put it on the dash like a dancin’ bear
I wrote you a horoscope
It won't fit on this post-it note
But if I had to sum it up into a shorter quote

38th street station

Sippin’ on that brown stuff
Got you feeling like you found love
Or maybe it was just luck
But honestly it’s probably none of the above
Train tracks underneath the faceless moon
The paybacks gonna want a statement soon
Been a few years since the last cigarette
But if you put your finger inside the flask, still wet
Stick with the fool like shit to the wool
Gotta get some tools to try to fix these jewels
Cause we don’t need to hear you sing
Of how you spent your time as king
Being mad at everything, huh
And even when we haven’t seen the sun for days
I keep squint like it’s shining right up in my face
Everyones a critic of the minutes I waste
Got me waiting in a line, got me running in place
I don’t really know what to tell ya
Say I spent too much time in the cellar
I’ve experienced a life full of accidents
Tryna write it all down before it vanishes
Wanna remember every adventure
But a percentage of ‘em only exist in the abyss
Spinnin' around like the popular record
My head feels lighter than the fuzz on a feather
I try to put the shapes in order
But in case I get cornered
I'mma sharpen up the darts
I truly hold sorrow in my heart
For every heart that never got carved into the bark
I wish that everyone could leave a mark
But every part wasn’t meant to be a piece of art
You either carpe diem or fade away into the dark
While everybody else watches waiting for the stop to start
With all due respect to my liver
We tryna get as high as the little dipper
Got love for my people that survive the blizzard
But it’s a flood of liquor on my side of the river
We face pain with pain
Everybody's the same
Waiting caught in the rain
I guess that’s why I write about it
It help me wrap my head around it
No matter what the worlds tryna take from you
No matter what the world’s tryna make you prove
No matter what the world’s tryna say to you
You gotta write your way through

Put it in pushed play then I poured a fresh one
I look back with a hesitant laugh
But in reality it’s dark down memory ave
All the trials and suffering we shared with each other
A lot of people thought that we were actually brothers
You know me, you know I’m a control freak
Who told you, you could die before me?
Gone, another dog lost to the wild
I feel like a snot-nosed child

Body was discovered by your own mother

And at the end, even though we didn’t speak enough
You were easily one of the best people I’ve loved
Now I’m tryna write a song for a dead songwriter
That wrote they own songs about life and death
And every breath is full of self-awareness
Don’t ever be afraid to be embarrassed
So I wrote these words to describe what I cry about
But I’m certain if you were here right now
You’d ridicule these lyrics, you’d hate this chorus
You’d probably tell me that the concept is too straight forward

You gaining on it like you tryin' ta exploit him

But Lady Luck got a box cutter
She laughs at her suiters, consumers
Tune her in the letter, blast out the woofers

Beautiful lurks in the background vocals
I don't shit in the sandbox
I'm not winning the dance off

And I ain't trying to sound scummy
But if you lick my wounds it taste like money

Tattoo say ''love life''
Attitude like a sunrise
And when the tongue come untied
You keep it on a quick draw like a gunfight
If it's done right strangers will sing along
The truth is I only came here to read your palms
The freaks keep it moving 'til the beat is gone
We're trying to grow a greener lawn
It goes ''oh my goodness''
We got too much love, now there's nowhere to put it
Time flew like it's designed to do
And all we left behind were clues

You see, ever since I was a teenage mess
I've had a hard time interpreting the opposite sex

The fact is I don't know what you're talking about
And I'm distracted by the gymnastics up in your mouth
Truthfully it's not you, it's me
Cause you're the moon that moves the sea
See, I guess there's a limit to my listening
And then I get dissmissive and treat it as if it's gibberish
And I don't mean to be blunt
Cause I know we'll probably talk about this for the rest of the month
But my life wouldn't be complete
If I didn't get to misread the shit you speak

So what you need?
Yeah, maybe I don't know how to communicate

I highly doubt that y'all think about sex
Anywhere near as often as I think about death
Go ahead and shout at the top of your lungs
But don't wake the baby up, we got a lot to get done
That little light indicates a connection
And if it's all the same I'd like to make a suggestion
See, if everybody on this comet agreed
We could set the clock to whenever we want it to be
I just might just modify the mileage
I don't know much, but I'm confident the fight's fixed
So high that I feel like a pilot
Falling out the sky full of brilliant brightness
Hurry up, stir me up
You gotta learn the words before the whole Earth burning, but
We wouldn't even need to recognize your birthday
If you were the center of the universe in the first place
If I had feathers I would fly away
If I felt fresher in fur I would hibernate
If I ever figured out how to communicate
Maybe then we could accumulate
For now face the wall, I ain't the same as y'all
A real friend wouldn't make you take the fall
Sometimes life'll try to break your balls
With the long list of missed wakeup calls

You know I wanna feel special
Walk around the festival carrying a big stuffed animal
I try not to make a mess though
Gotta stay sensible, ain't nobody coming with the antidote
I wanna watch you grow
And I wanna leave the planet better off than it was handed to me
And I don't know, there's possibility
So I settle for selling my soul to the slaves of the land of the free
I don't wanna leave my family tree behind
I don't want no one to miss me like I miss you
But I don't wanna take up too much time
I'm not trying to run away from the line we drew
The sunshine seems to feel so seamless
The soldier is a dreamer and a realist
And history sealed this
Taught me that a hero ain't nothing but a field trip
Nah, I know you're down to do something profound
Put a stick in the ground to prove you was around
No amount of time will ever be considered enough
I'm trying to tether it up and live forever through love
We're not lucky, but we're fortunate
I'm pretty sure of it
And all the life we wasted trying to make some bread
Might've been better spent trying to raise the dead7Embed
If I was a rich man, I'd buy you some shoes
Tall boots for all the dirt you walk through
What would that do? Enable you to deal
Without schooling you on how to touch what's real
And if I was a smart man, I'd tell you everything that I knew
And give it to you every time you need a talking to
But what would that do? Teach you my guidelines
So you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines
And if I was a driver, I'd keep my headlights on
To see the difference between right and wrong
I'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in park
Cause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these parts
And if I was a better cook, I'd hook up a feast
Set a table full of food for the children to eat
I encourage the nourishment so we can breathe
With the knowledge that we got something accomplished

And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the cause
Wouldn't expect nothing in return
I'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you need
So you can take my hand and I can take the lead
And if I was an honest man
I would stop writing songs
I'd break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast
Tell everyone I knew to stay away from making music
It ain't nothing but a confusing mess (confusing mess)
And if I was you, I wouldn't hear a word I said
Wouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my head
I'd make a conscious effort to live instead
Of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed
And if I was a hurt man
I'd find a way to put my faith
Into a woman that could take me from today, maybe
I need somebody that could save me
From the parts of myself that keep making me crazy
And if I was a wise man
I'd climb to the top of the mountain peak
To think about strength versus weakness
I'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head
And figure out how I could try to help you reach it
(Ho ho ho)
And if I did have a choice
I'd never want to live forever
Just let me have a voice so I can make my points
I can't imagine running a race with no finish line
Just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time
I love giving but I'm bad at receiving
The truth is, I'd prefer to be the one bleeding
But I'm a paranoid that stays between play and work
Cautious and aware, cause I'm afraid of being hurt
Which brings me to the issue
And that would be this:
How often must I ask myself why I exist?
I feel like a freak, this world is a circus
Just trying to find myself as well as my purpose

And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the cause
Wouldn't expect nothing in return
I'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you need
And you can take my hand and I can take the lead
I got nothing but gifts
Keep it up in my wits
Got me drunk on the fifth
And now we're stuck in a ditch
And as dumb as it gets
I'mma run you some fibs
I wanna touch your lips
I wanna rub your hips
Put a glove on the fist
For the love that exists
We'll keep bumping the hits
To get my bucket of chips
From the Bloods and the Crips
To the skateboarding chicks
Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist
Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist

(Yo, what happened to you man?
What, you just woke up like that?
You weren't like that yesterday
What have you been eating?)
And he got bored one day and jumped out of a third story window
Hit the curb in a sprint position (what?)
And that was the first time he found himself different from the rest
Thus began him on his quest for individualism (why?)
He felt he had some big decisions to make
Superpowers can't be all fun and games
Piece of cake in the park under sun rays
I mean wait, he wishes he understood
Wait, hold up, does this mean now
That he's obligated to roam around and do some good?
Maybe he should keep it hidden from his neighborhood
I doubt his girl would even try to comprehend it if she could
And he ain't trying to be nobody's circus sideshow freakshow
Better keep it discrete and hide it from these people
But one day on his way to Falafel King for some lunch
He was approached by these three cats that he'd gotten stoned with once
He cracked a smile, extended an arm to give the first one a pound
Brought the fist down, and sunk him deep into the ground
Whoops, cat's out the pillow sack
You see that puddle?
Well that particular molecular displacement has a mom
Who's gonna want an explanation
As to why her son Jason, her pride and joy
Is now liquid boy dripping down the pavement
Save it
You'd better bolt and hide
Because war patrol gets a hold of your throat you'll probably hope to die
Oh snap, you can fly
It's time to take it to the air
And quit tripping, who ever told you that existence was supposed to be fair?

Yo dawg, this kid owed me like ten dollars, dude
Why'd you have to kill him?)
Made it, landed in the backyard
Fast like a track star
The flight was basic
And the landing, it wasn't that hard
Now act smart
Pack the things you need and leave
Say your peace to this diseased place and keep it free
Face the east, spread your wings
Wait, I hear police sirens coming to inquire about the deceased
I wonder if your chest can deflect bullets
Contemplate surrender to escape this excess stress
Bet nobody thinks about the emotional drain
That it takes to have special strengths and advanced brains
And now he's dancing with sanity solo
Trying to hold his inner ground
Devising a rushed blueprint
Blocking all sight and sound
And pictures of all the childhood trauma
All the livelihood, the drama
The time spent wondering, pondering the secrets of imagination
No way could anyone have understood this present situation
Yo mom
If they take me down, believe I'm gonna miss you
And if I ain't around take comfort knowing I went out with a fistfull
I swear it was accidental, I never meant to
It ain't my fault
I don't know how it started off nor how it shall result
But I'll be damned if I give the man the satisfaction of taking down the man who could have taken out that man with all his bastard plans
And at one glance it was romantic if you think
The freak slit his own throat
And bled to death in the kitchen sink
X3
No longer worried about health or wealth
A superhero's true weakness is themselves

I need to lower my expectations
I never said I was Jesus
Nah, I'm Superman

She say that she still wants a friendship
She can't live her life without me as a friend
I can't figure out why I give a damn to what she wants
I don't understand the now before the then
Most of this garbage I write that these people seem to like
Is about you and how I let you infect my life
And if they got to know you, I doubt that they would see it
They'd wonder what I showed you, how you could leave it
A friend in Chicago said that I should stay persistent
If I stay around I'm bound to break resistance
Fuck you, Lucy, for defining my existence
Fuck you and your differences
Ever since I was a young lad with a part-time dad
It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had
I studied my mother, I digested her pain
And vowed no women on my path would have to walk the same
Travel like sound across the fate ladder
I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter
And I travel with feel, so I can deal with touch
It's like that, thank you very much, fuck you very much

(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Fuck the 'What happened?' I got stuck
They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck
Used to walk with luck, used to hold her hand
Fell behind and played the role of a slower man
I want to stand on top of this mountain and yell
I want to wake up and break up this lake of hell
I feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up
The last star-fighter was wounded, time to give it up
On a pick it up mission, kept it bitter
Gettin' in a million memories just to forget her
The difficulty in keepin' emotions controlled
Cookies for the road, took me by the soul
Hunger for the drama, hunger for the nurture
Gonna take it further, the hurt feels like murder
Interpret the eyes, read the lines on her face
The sunshine is fake, how much time did I waste?
Fuck you, Lucy, for leaving me
Fuck you, Lucy, for not needing me
I wanna say fuck you because I still love you
No, I'm not okay, and I don't know what to do

Do I sound mad? Well I guess I'm a little pissed
Every action has a point, five points make a fist
You close em', you swing em', it hurts when it hits
And the truth can be a bitch, but if the boot fits
I got an idea, you should get a tattoo that says warning
That's all, just a warning, so the potential victim can take a left
And save breath, and avoid you, sober and upset in the morning
I wanna scream, "Fuck you, Lucy"
But the problem is I love you, Lucy
So instead I'ma finish my drink and have another
While you think about how you used to be my lover

And everyone in his life would mistake it as love

Throw your hands up in the air
And wave like you just don't care
Say, you deserve a break today
Oh yeah, work that body, work that body
Make sure you don't hurt nobody
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?
I like the party rock the body
You like the party want somebody
I sang too, listen to the song..

Sittin' on the steps, with ANT, that's my man
Flippin' pig-russian, discussin' politics and contraband
Karma cut me clean as if I asked for it
Seven travels offered states with a case and fake passport
I want to shelter everybody from the snakes
And my sleeves know a couple of tricks for huntin' breaks
(Ten thousand lakes) Multiple choice of where to drown
So I quote the voice, it goes "What floats is what's found"
Gettin down like they did in the 7-2
With the red and blue, had the opportune to bless you
Before you knew about a phone bill
Before you had to hold still
Before the Kool-Aid got diluted with Golden Seal
I used to ride around this town on a dirtbike
Child touched stillato, wild stages just to earn stripes
Read my lips, act like you heard right
And keep an eye on your chick, I work my rubber like a turnpike
It ain't nothin' for me to come swing from your tree
I wear the love like a ring and I sing until it's free
What? You bringin the weed? We break a measure
And let the hook ride just to tie it all together
Whatever..

Spittin' game at your girl, just to take your world apart
I hang with the secrets and the cats that paint pictures
While you sleepin on life and writin the same scriptures
(What you gonna take witcha?) I take it all but the fall
And when I'm sittin still you can blame the Benadryl and alcohol
As far as the stars are above the boulevard
I keep my feet on the tar, with the heat in the car
Keep the beats in a jar, wait for the time to unleash

I put tame on the monsters the moment that I came in
I talk to the voices-- that speak through my headphones
Communicate the life while I decipher all the info
I got styles I ain't even heard yet...
Words like rain it came and left the earth wet
Let it drip-dry, focus eyes on the catalysts
Standin' high in the middle of SOUTH MINNEAPOLIS
They try to figure it out, they try to break it down
But they're distracted by every accent that's makin a sound
Grab it by the throat, lift it up and shake it 'round
Till this whole world sees me as a naked clown
And while I'm pullin on her bra, shes
Tuggin on my drawstring
Screamin' and shoutin to figure out how you lost me
Chewin up my cigarette and smokin' my gum
Out of respect for your boyfriend, I'll use my thumb
From the start to the done, I never claimed to be right
I quit sleepin, now the day looks the same as the night
And I'm the type of DJ that only plays what I like
A handful of mixed nuts, everyone's takin a bite..
My life ain't as cool as yours (3X)

My life ain't as cool as your life

Henceforth, step within my psychoanalysis
Callouses upon my mind make me strain for my lines
Out I ripped it squeezed the brain, it made some liquid
Drained it in a cup and then I sipped it
Atmosphere, the mic let me clutch it
Thoughts take flight so fit Slug in your pipe and take a puff kid
Fuck it, I heat it like a tea pot, steam hot
Upon the roof shoot a marble with the verbal slingshot
Take aim, here I came, I'm the same
Back in '86, I'da tag my name upon your window pane
Stained the mind, a deep shade of residue
Voices within the head make choices multiple
Multiply Spawn, Slug a little buzz
And Atmosphere the scuds, cause here comes the judge
Blasted, so pass kid a mic so we can paint this
Image of the gifted-anxious, to flip the language
It's the noun meltdown from the outer-shell
Now smell the burning flesh fresh from the hell-bound
And come on down here, this mind path, I'm half-
Mathematic Atmospheric staff with the rhyme craft
Comin' to capture, your after-laughter
While I'm hanging from this rafter, I have to rip this rapture
Cause the cramps in my stomach, dismantle
When I tamper with your amplifier, you damn-you die

Cause I can read an emcee from front to back
From the cover to the classified, I've pacified
My mind with my rhyme skills, I climb hills
And leap, foolish twitch with a single bound
Sending tingles down your spine, designed to swing and pound
This ax handle tripled, inch spike protruding
From the tip of my mic distributing fuckin' headshots
Shots to your head, now you're knee-deep, you need sleep
As you trudge through the sludge and the slugs and the bird shit
We swarm with the bees and diseases
And even if your DJ was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids
I swarm with the bees and diseases
And even if your DJ was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids

Yeah muthafucker, you know who you fuckin' with
You know what kind ass whooping comes with this

Then they give. Oblivion's what you've stepped in
Your reps tooken, should have been lookin'

Take mine, your fake rhymes, spit them you shouldn't

Amped shootin' presence, fattenin' each fuckin' sentence

I've lost all respect I could have ever carried (C'mon)
Now I curse your name when it's mentioned (Get out)
I'd shoot you in your face if I thought it would relieve the tension

I wanna grab a pipe wrench and put a dent in your eye socket
Pry apart your jaws, pull out all your teeth
Shove a funnel in ya, fill you up with ammonia and bleach (Take this, take this)

But I'm pissed, you're at the top of my shit list
I wish you'd slit your wrist and kiss an electric fence

As far back as he cares to remember
He used to see his old man lose the temper
And mama's pretty face would catch it all
On a regular basis the nest would fall
But he was always safe from dad's rage
Cause mama sacrificed in his place
Two-dozen years of the blood, sweat, tears
Avoid the mirror, losing her hair from the fear
She never left him, she stayed inside
He beat her ass up until the day that he died
In fact, the biggest beating was the day that he died
Cause now it's too late for her to make a new life
She gets to mourn for the touch of a punch
Won't ever admit that she ain't clutchin it much
Someday she'll die, it still won't be done
The anger lives on through their son
Cause he saw, he caught it all
A childhood of watching ma and pa get raw
It's too bad for him, nah, that's half the truth
Cause you back with him now and he's smackin you
What happened to you? You don't have a clue
Did your mama used to suffer accidents too?
I never knew that you would stand for abuse
I guess I just assumed that you would pack up and move

Let me be the last to say

Please put your shoes on and step into that warm weather
Go get yourself a more better forever
Gotta put it down, you gotta leave it

I'm looking at that lake like I'm waiting to break
Into your traffic
Yeah, it's overly dramatic, but it only takes one bad trip
To leave you holier than magic
I'm all alone, I feel it all in my bones
It's probably why I'm not going home
I'm sitting in the passenger seat of my own car
I don't know where my keys are, sipping on a warm
Lone Stars in the sky don't sponsor my house
That's why I pay no mind to what comes out of they mouth
I stopped pretending like I knew what to do
And let the universe push the needle into the groove
It's no substitute for the love of the truth
So who the fuck am I to be a judge for you, huh?
I fall back and let the chips descend
Go 'head, call me back when you miss your friends
And maybe later we can talk about the weather
Pick a day and we can try to get together
Bring along whatever tool you use to measure
How the temperature reacts to your temper
And lick a shot for the messenger, it's not a mess if ya
Control the stress, never let it get the best of ya
Shit, it's easier said than done
If we can't get free, might as well get dumb
Just keep it rolling and document the whole thing
As if it ain't too late, already seen where it's going
I shape shift to make it fit in any opening
That halo's gonna stay debatable until I grow some wings

To build the will to fill your bag up with some groceries

It's no surprise I overslept
Put my boots on and climbed out my tent
I didn't see you, assumed you were sleeping
Immediately start a fire cause it's freezing
I can't believe we went camping in the cold
I'm in the wilderness standing in some snow
A late start, but we can still catch up
You need to wake up, we should eat and then pack up

That's when I noticed your foot prints
The snow's fresh and those have been put since
What, you're already up making the rounds?
So where you at now, you laid back down?
The breeze came and it stalled out the flame
While I went to your tent and called out your name
You didn't answer, so I opened up the flap
It's just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack

I'm looking at your tracks and You took a couple laps
Around the campground and hoofed down the path
I figure you'll return, no concern
I'mma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn
The wind is blowing strong, minutes rolling on
It's going on at least a half an hour you've been gone
You might also like
It ain't right, start the paranoia
I left the camp site to go and search for ya
I read the trail your feet made
Each step was deliberately placed
It looks like you know where it leads
But I see nothing but leafless frozen trees
About a quarter mile into the course
Another set of tracks appeared next to yours
From the north it came out of the thick woods
And those footprints belong to a big wolf

Trying to find service on my cellphone
I felt aight with my knife on my belt, though
I hope the wolf is intimidated by you
I wondered if you even knew what was behind you
Stalking ya, maybe watching ya
Waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya
Salivating', wanna take ya to the stomach
In the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick

And it gets about as bad it goes
Cause I notice there's a new set of tracks in the snow
I understood, it doesn't look good
Your fan club doubled, now you've got another wolf
And the odds are in favor of the home team
Why'd you walk off all alone, where you going?
It ain't the right time to complain, but
It feels like I'm trying to find your remains
Your foot prints grew further apart
I knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart
It means you started to run, so I did the same
Now my breaths looking like a steam engine train
Suddenly your tracks dip off of the path
And so did theirs, so my knife I grabbed
Into the forest, expect the worst
Adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves

50 yards into the woods and brush
It got so thick that it looked like dusk
The air stood serene, sober
It seemed like a good 15 degrees colder
And I'll admit: Hell yeah, I felt fear
The sound of my heart beat was all I could hear
Looking at the snow it was plain and clear
There was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared

I can't process, I don't follow
It would be easier to believe that you were swallowed
With no sign of death, no sign of struggle
No signs of blood, no signs of trouble
And the wolves never stopped
The tracks kept going and I took off
So I don't know how your story ends
But I know I'll never go into those woods again
It's not that tragic, it's not a shame
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game
I forgot to worry about what you became
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game

So special, it's so stressful
And no rest for the devil on a weekday
And I'll remember the first time I met you
I wasn't really punk rock, just a cheapskate
Go to sleep to the waves on the freeway
Wake up wasted, ain't nobody tryna see straight
Lookin' at me like I drove up in a pumpkin
But climbed inside like you're tryna find somethin'
If we lucky enough to get drunk and fall in love
Maybe decades later we could be arguin' for nothin'
The parts fit like a puzzle and all of a sudden
She let me put a couple Slugs in the oven
I put a ring around Saturn on a Saturday
Valentine's, so I took you on a valid date
Starin' up at the stars above a frozen lake
Maybe the stars are ghosts, it's hard to say
Either way the Milky way doesn't even feel far away
With your lips on my face and a car full of mixtapes

Just push play, don't even ask
Runnin' around in Minneap' like it's the whole map
From the bottom of the rock to the top of the trash
They tried to blow, but couldn't copy my jazz
And I'm tryna slow it down, soften the crash
But when I'm gone, I hope the last sound I heard was your laugh
The vanity plates say "Love Life"
But the look on your face say "Uptight"
I'm upright 'cause I ain't supposed to crawl
And then I, I held breath and dove into the fall
I'm not waitin' on death to write my name on the wall
I'd rather swim through the flood with a chain and a ball
The background took the shock of the tremor
Put the sad clown flag down, but not to surrender
I accept the challenge, got me lookin' at the mirror
Like, "I hear ya crystal clear, you're still here"
I'ma play my position 'til the end of existence
I made this new playlist, give it a listenYou might also likeEmbed

Daddy loves you, I say what's up to the baby
Like, "What's up, baby?" You're such a baby, huh
And then I find the other kids and give 'em all high fives

(Meow) I put some food in the cat's bowl
That way the cat doesn't think I'm an asshole
And put some Cheerios in the Sean bowl
Mixin' in the Golden Grahams for the combo
The sun kinda sneaks in slow
Like melting gold, it's like lava when it starts to flow
Even when it's cold outside
And the whole southside's still covered with snow
But this is a beautiful, summery kind of bright-color
Coloring book, good vibes and good looks
Got me lookin' out the window from the front of the house

It's some shit that my wife ordered online
Like if the sun burns out and civilization stopped
My doorstep still catches more cardboard boxes
It's a problem, this ain't the time to address it, though
I'm not tryna look like a midlife mess, but, yo
Here she comes now, no words, no smilin'
Just hands me my mail and walks towards the horizon

На самом деле я не знаю, хорошо это или плохо — испытывать эмоции, потому что часто из-за эмоций мы поступаем неправильно, это влияет на наши отношения с другими людьми и на наши поступки. Иногда мне кажется, что я бы не хотела чувствовать вообще ничего, потому что мы постоянно выливаем негатив на самых близких людей и... они страдают для насEmbed

She said, "We still haven't liberated Mumia"
She said, "The name of the strain was Eureka"
She synced up the Bluetooth to play Aaliyah
I made myself a drink, tastes like pruno sangria
Nice to meet ya, knock on wood
I said, "I'm sorry, that my English is not so good"
She said, "It sounds like you're fishin' for compassion"
I said, "You're dressed like an assassin"
And it's true, though, she kinda looked like Trinity
It's kinda cool, though, reminds me of Italy
The only time I've ever been there was a short layover
In Rome, didn't even leave the airport
And that ain't even the important part
But somethin' started warmin' up her broken heart

You and I should go and find a swimmin' pool
Better if it comes with a hotel room
That'll let us check in before noon (Aight)
Too many memories to fit into a shoe box
The cops caught a bad tip and raided the rooftop
She opened up a roll of quarters into a tube sock
All of y'all are poseurs, go and kick some moon rocks
I might be the droid that they lookin' for
Or I might be the boy you mistook me for
I might float across the ocean on a horse back
Just to get closer to your outdated format
I might be the gecko from Geico
Got the white women celebratin' Cinco de Mayo
They finished off a whole fifth of mayo

Purple rain on your parade and let me kiss your paisley park
You gimme a condition of the heart
Let's pretend we're married just to rip it all apart
It's a love bazaar, like, do me baby
Like you never done before, who's that lady
Cab driver? My Uber says "Arriving Soon"
I'm at the cherry in a spoon under the cherry moon
From Alphabet Street down to Electric Avenue
I'm lookin' for the girl with the Drag-On tattoo
And it's a sign of the times, but sometimes
It snows in April, let's play in the sunshine
Now take a sip and pass until the cup's dry
Mini apple pie, you can hear the doves cry

Huh, nah, gimme a proper hug
Let's dance and celebrate modern love
We could shout and let it all out
But what happened in the past is not what this is about
You've came a long way and it's good to see
But here's an S.O.S., just be good to me
And I'll be good to you, we can look to do
Some things like get together and cook some food

I used to be assertive
But now I'm just exhausted
I used to wanna burn shit
But now it all feels force-fed
Yeah, I've got a fuckin' headache
I've had enough of all the heartache
I wanna get away, sing about the better days
It's all shade when you're fallin' through that dark space
I didn't know my story'd ever get told
I thought that I would disappear into a cold black hole
No oxygen, no control over the pressure
And no mess left after I implode
And I suppose all the confidence grows
When the shovel breaks ground and success starts to show, yeah
It's no way it won't affect the ego
So keep the injury clean and protect your emo
I'm tryna find a buried treasure
I don't got the time to carry any extra
Don't ever register the efforts of a heckler
Unless you can exploit it for your own agenda, right?
Jumped off of the top rope
And I landed at Bob Hope
Hopped in the cargo and drove to the racetrack
The player had a trailer in the back just to take a nap
I came to rap and break free from the cage
Don't ever misinterpret nothin' 'bout what keeps me engaged
I'm tryna act my age, I'm tryna lose some weight
I'm tryna face what I'm afraid of just to prove that it's fake
Then I'm out, but hold up, before we head to the exits
Let's get these bread sticks and dead this death wish
And even if we lose everything we've collected
They could never remove all of the lives we've connected (Ooh-ooh)

We trying to reach and explore
In case I can locate some supportive resources
Afford us the breath of existence before
Metamorphosis is more than just metaphor for next
I was watching my son play piano and
Thinkin' 'bout how we survived that avalanche
Lookin' down at these shoes that I'm standin' in
I might be happy, this might be happenin'

Keeping my feet planted firm in my footprint
Learning to look through the clouds when they crowd it
When the thunder hits louder than hunger
Start running for cover, cut off and block numbers
I honestly wonder if I'm just trapped under the
Thumb of the weather or whatever's up there
Trying to use all my colors to paint with
I flew up to space just to find isolation
So I'll be the starlight that started tonight
Gotta love myself, so I can love you right, right?

Jeg ved at når jeg dør, så sker der ingenting
For ligesom at jeg ikke eksisterede før jeg blev født, så kommer jeg heller ikke til at eksistere når jeg er død
Og jeg ved at det betyder at jeg hverken kommer til at tænke eller føle noget, når jeg først er død
Og det er selvfølgelig en ret deprimerende tanke at have, men jeg har heller ikke lyst til at leve mit liv og lades som om der er noget som jeg godt ved der ikke er
Og slet ikke når det kommer til døden
Så på nogen måde så føler jeg mig egentlig lidt heldig fordi jeg er så bevidst om hvad det er jeg har i mit liv, og hvad jeg så ikke har når jeg er død
Fordi så behøver jeg ikke gå og måle livet på langs og vente på hvad der er for enden, fordi det ved jeg godt
Og i stedet for så kan jeg holde mit fokus på hvad det er jeg vil have ud af det, mens jeg har detEmbed
Imagine if we all shared a secret
Maybe then we could connect in that space where we keep it
If you and I bleed and it's the same blood
Would I still need a reason to believe in your love?
I'm trying to stay ahead of all the developments
Got to acknowledge the devil in a room full of elephants
And now I'm lookin' for an easy escape
Like, open the window, I'm 'bout to leap to my faith
For real, I feel depleted
An ocean full of weeds, emotional fatigue
And maybe if I had a bag of money
I could be the crash test dummy, quietly standin' for somethin'
I would love to get as fly as them
But I fell overboard, now I'm trying to swim
I'm still learnin' but the water is burnin'
And the world keeps turnin' like it's not concerned, and

I can't believe I used to love you
You don't believe I used to love you
But who you gonna run to?
What happened to the people that you once knew
I'm like, hold up

I'm trying to breath my way through it
Sink into the waves, let 'em move me, stay fluid
So many voices and inflections
Multiple choices and different directions
And even if I had the opportunity
I don't qualify to speak on behalf of the community
And I don't even know who that would be anymore
I lost track of the tracks, I stopped keepin' the score
Or maybe I've been puttin' up my own walls
I don't return your phone calls
Got me floatin' and bobbin' on top this pond
Full of problems we bought from these dishonest spokesmen
I kinda hope we turn it all into ash
I don't wanna have to adapt to the aftermath
The tolerance is as powerful as the pain
You'd probably never know my name if you've never heard me complain

I can't believe I used to love you
You don't believe I used to love you

It never connected that you'd eventually find me
Nothing that suggested you'd even come looking
But I guess I should be flattered, and if I could stand up
It wouldn't even help free myself from these handcuffs
There's probably not a lot left to say

Dental floss inside of the glove box

Double parked outside of the court house

My breath fog all the windows up
Take a break from the rotten grapevines
Fill the tank and then spank the state lines
Never make this mountain move, naw you're bound to lose
But I knew that I could count on you
Next rounds on you (Is that true?)
Wash my sins off in the rain
Caught this fish now, light that flame

Shut the fuck up!

The way she listen to what the MC said
She might as well plug the RCA cords into her head
Taking that into consideration at the center of creation
Cats still criticize my frustration raps
Well off he goes, coming cop some flows
Cross your toes and hopes that I don't climb you like an obstacle
Mission impossible, fishing in the kitchen sink
Y'all fall for anything so what you think this kid will bring
Poker face, let me hold my place
The name-sake is Slug, but you, you can call me stoker ace
Open invitation to catch today's ejaculation all across the front
Of your pretty little apron
This goes to those that own a mouth full of Sean's load
Thanks for starting, now you're barking down the wrong road
Sacrifice plays a part in grabbing mics
From now to the afterlife, I'll continue passion-like
I love this fucking whore with all my heart
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from doing my part
It gave me life, it saved me life, it raised me right
So slide, shoulder slide, and please hand over that mic

So take me apart, try to break me down
Spend all you got just to hate the clown
You can fake the frown, imitate the sound
Underworld, world-wide, wide world of underground
It goes, one little, two little, three little indie rap
Headphones, backpacks watch 'em all piggyback
Switch up my styles, they all complain
But see which kids next year sound the same as me?
The same shit yesterday was like today
Only difference is I trust even less of what you say
But all in all I still make the noise, I still break the toys, I still hate your voice
I still say fuck a major label 'til it limps
Put your deal up our table and we'll show you who's the pimp
There is no sympathy for the careless
Fuck the extra credit and fuck the demerits

Don't even know if I can write this song
Caught on a beam between right and wrong
Gotta keep forward, keep straight
For the sake of why we stay awake all night long
It's not up for interpret
Paranoid of exploiting the verdict
But in the same breath
I got thoughts that I wanna express and let surface
This ain't for props or the pop culture
It's about a balloon that got punctured
The sunshine's fun till it burns someone
And we all got burnt that summer
She was sixteen
Another young angel with clipped wings
She came to the shows, but I never met her
Don't even know if she was listening
That night, we lost a supporter
That night, somebody lost a daughter
He raped and killed her at the venue
Can't comprehend what her friends must have went through
That night, the sun went dark
Now watch everyone on the tour bus fall apart
That night, Lord have mercy
The music died that night in Albuquerque

I wanna go home now and start a new life
Wish I could protect the kids
I guess safety is hit or miss
With a prior convicted sex offense against
A four year old, why we let you live?
Don't know what I'm trying to write
But there's a part of me that keeps dying that night
And when I think about her mother
I become another number that wants you to suffer
You're locked up for now
You have no more chances to steal the children's laughs
And if you ever find God
Better pray to her and ask that we never cross paths2Embed
She abandoned me, left me out in the cold
No surprises, I guess that's how it goes
Sits across from me, at a booth in this dive
I contemplate how much more I can survive
But I'm alive, so I should be content
Then tell why the hell my whole world is bent
I was sent to make and frustrate the population
In-between the alcohol and the copulation
What you call it, if you build it I will break it
"What's wrong, how you doin'?" Nah, save it
Gave it a fraction of all I had to give
I guess I hold a grudge, cause you still got my rib
With your beautiful eyes, unscrupulous lies
Now watch the circus clown run around in circles and try
Seems like all I get to eat is hope
Girl, if we got along better we'd be dope

Four walls, they surround me
Loneliness, has found me

And for as much as I complain, I'm lovin' it
And I only mention it so that I can rub it in
Wake up to the sunlight, shake off last night
Check what's left and try to get the rest right
Decision, splitting, headache, lifting
Symptoms, matching, Mama was afraid of it
Knowledge of self ain't as evil as they made it
Call it what you want, if you build it they will break it
The plain truth, there's no substitute
But sometimes she wears a disguise (Yes she do)
A storyteller deals with life not hope
Girl, if we got along better we'd be dope

Ain't no way to explain or say
How painful the hangover was today
In front of the toilet, hands and knees
Trying to breathe in between the dry heaves
My baby made me some coffee
Afraid that if I drink some it's probably coming right back out me
Couple of advil, relax and chill
At a standstill with how bad I feel
I think I need to smell fresh air
So I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs
The sunlight hit me dead in the eye
Like it's mad that I gave half the day to last night
My bad sight made me trip on my ass, right into that patch of grass like that's life
All of a sudden, I realize something
The weather is amazing, even the birds are bumpin
Stood up and took a look and a breath
And there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed
Never really seen exercise as friendly
But I think something's telling me to ride that 10 speed
The brakes are broken, it's alright
The tires got air and the chain seems tight
Hopped on and felt the summertime
It reminds me of one of them Musab lines like

Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine

Bust it out whenever someone's actin hard

The sunshine's an excuse to shoot hoops, get juice
Show improve their moves and let loose
I hear voices, I see smiles to match em
Good times and you can feel it in the fashion
Even though the heat cooks up the action
The streets still got butterflies
Enough kids to catch 'em
Ridin my bike around these lakes man
Feelin like I finally figured out my escape plan
Take it all and the day started off all wrong
Somehow now that hangover is all gone
Ain't nothing like the sound of the leaves
When the breeze penetrates these southside trees
Leanin' up against one, watchin the vibe
Forgettin' all about the stress, thanking god I'm alive
It's so simple, I had to keep the song simple
When I get home I'm gonna open all the windows
Feelin' all right, stopped at a stop sign
A car pulled up, bumpin Fresh Prince's Summertime
Summer summers fine
Feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win

She came back to visit, she says
Cause in some ways, Minneapolis is more real than L.A
But I won't go to the triple-rock on a Tuesday
Too many people pop out of they pimples and play
And at night, we can watch these people in these bars
They're all insane, they all know my name
Who won the game? No one's in pain
But either way girl, I'm glad you came
And if the elements and irrelevance I strain
Hair's wet, who cares if it's sweat or rain
As long as it doesn't leave a permanent stain
It's all in vain if there's nothing left to gain
And something's in the way she looks at her prey
There's no way she'll allow you to live
Swallow the fight, inhale the night
There's not much else left for you to give
Who's leaving? (There she goes)
Who's leaving?
Who's breathing as opposed to who's bleeding
Caress the rooftop and stare at the space
For the flesh that you gave just to get a taste
It goes... nothing comes close
Scream of the smile and choke boy choke
Passion come death, and death bring power
At the top of the hour we sing for the monster
And here she goes, with that look in her eyes
The souls of those that got took by surprise
Crooked little smile that clings to her lips
On a night like this I sing for the bitch

I was smiling hard
But I was lying

So what's the time? it's almost time for her to go to work
The sun is shining but I'm in the shadow of my smirk
I keep my breathin' under my breath
Tucked within the untrimmed bushes next to her front steps
And when she leaves to make treck towards the bus stop
My love erupts (POPS) a thousand tiny blood clots
Damn I wish that she was mine but time and time over the discretion
On my right shoulder whispers to my ear
Advising me to admire from way over here, play the rear
And struggle for the view to clear
It's been 2 years and quite a few beers
Too many loose tears and a few souvenirs
And if she only knew, how long I've waited for her
How her smiles enough to make my winter warmer
If she knew the way she walks could take away my storm
She'd probably call the cops and get a restraining order
As much as I hate myself, I hate you more
But I still smile when you come through that door
And as much as I hate my life, I hate yours too
Just can't seem to teach myself to ignore you
This is for the ladies, not every lady
Just the ones that drive me crazy, the ones that scream SAVE ME
I wanna thank y'all for everything you gave me
Now lean in and taste me (Kiss)
Just a lonely summer
Slowly dyinng
I was smiling hard
But I was lying
Just a lonely summer
Slowly dyinng
I was smiling hard

Right up to your face and kiss you!1Embed
Do you guys have veggie burgers ?
Yeah, can I get one of those ?
Can you put bacon on it for me ?

Once upon a time, one night next week
I hit the five-eight to get a bite to eat
I went inside, nobody here
But a couple guys at the bar holding beers
I sat down in the booth
I'll take a glass of grapefruit juice
Checking the selections
But I didn't get further than the mushroom Swiss burger
They said meat is murder, but I eat it
If it wasn't illegal, I'd eat people
As long as he used to walk
I'll take him with a side of the tater tots
I don't dine out a lot
I don't spend time out in general pop
And if I wasn't all alone at the spot
I'd probably order it to go in a styrofoam box
She brought me my sandwich
It came in a plastic basket
It's poison for my health
So you know I'm enjoying myself
But all of a sudden
The bar filled up with a herd of suburban bumpkins
No more personal space
Wish that they would all burst into flames
That's when I decided to get my revenge
I quietly got up, locked the doors
Went into the kitchen and popped the drawers
Grabbed any knife in sight
Tonight everybody getting sacrificed, aight?
The whole south side heard them scream
Sent them to hell, felt like a dream
It was a gruesome bloodbath
Stabbed everyone, including the pub staff
Then I sparked a grill and went to town
Fried 'em all up and chowed 'em all down
After the feast, peace
Went home and fell asleep
Now I feel guilty, so in front of all of you
I'm ready to admit that I'm addicted to bar food

Smart went crazy, truth went trendy
The story got lazy so I rewrote the ending
Manipulated the entry, more user-friendly
Now a city full of pain pills and tattoos defend me
I waver from the dead to the half-dead
Grey space between the fan base and the crackhead
Sunset, sailboat set course for hell
A cross and a hammer, but you'll have to get some nails
Take credit, for anything embedded in the edit
As long as you meant it when you said it
And all of the kids laugh, when you admit that
It mighta been witchcraft that made my noose fit bad
Well I'mma act like I don't give a make love
Take what I got to teach everyone to break stuff
I'mma act like there's poison in the pancakes
And amputate the one that wasn't loyal with the handshake
Proud to know ya, Minnesota missile
Never sold coke and I never had to hold a pistol
Civil and simple, but set the freak show loose on the nipple
Watch her whole fuckin' titty ripple

It's why the mascot thinks that I'm an asshole

Still on some "What have you done for me lately?"
No gravy if the bass is porkface
Tour dates ate my big little brother's court case
Poor taste got passed off as gourmet
This beer is foreplay
We'll meet up at your place
I sting like a first divorce, or them first Newports
Whatever hurts you more
"You're headed for self destruction" been there, did that
Kicked back with the wrong angel to fuck with
Carved my charm into your arms
Fuck around, unravel this tall ball of yarn
Snuck round back to disarm the alarm
From the plantation to the reservation to the farms
And nobody knows where you'll end up
Only guarantee in life is death or a headfuck
Yeah, you thought it was a set up, well guess what
Now you can catch up with the rest of my "Best Of"
I got a few blocks left before I reach my destination
And retrieve my breath
And God blessed every step I stole
Just to let me know, she wouldn't ever let me go

Smart went crazy, the rubber band went snap
This goes to those that hold it down 'til I get back
Hold on to me, grow along with me

I got so much trouble on my
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Yesterday, I saw two houseflies going at it in the bathroom like a couple of bar flies
It was disgusting, but not 'cause of the fucking
It's just a random thought I had that everyone's an offspring of something
A whole lot of bacteria
Standing on the rocky banks of Lake Superior
Try to watch the weather, keep a finger on the artery
Stop pretending that you ain't left the party with part of me
I believe you're from the future and you came back to waste me
But I think you probably won't 'cause you like me
We in the shadow of the shade of the moonlight
Let's say good night while it's still a good night, alright?
I'm feeling like maybe it's getting closer to closing time
Lock the door, flip over the sign
And I've got so much trouble on my mind

I'm spilling my bottle upon your table
I'm as willing and able as a tornado
I wear it like the heart you tattooed to your sleeve
You tear it all apart to gather what you need
Stop all the madness, box up the fragments
Stick a book of stamps to the top of the package
Say please deliver this to the previous owner
I wrote my name up in the corner and the S was a cobra
Mix up the ingredients how I showed you
You probably think I'm an idiot, though, don't you?
Never thought I'd grow to be anything more
Than just another gomer being told to shut up, soldier
Looking over your shoulder before stepping over the line
I can turn the water in your toilet bowl into wine
And I've got so much trouble on my mind

I can't help but to think back
Back before the shrink rap
Back before the sound man would sabotage with feedback

That's when I start my departure, then I remember the rhyme
It goes I got so much trouble on

I kind of wish I was inside of somebody else dream
I'm trying to fish for some faith that this ain't what it seem
I mean I might have seen them clouds, even felt some rain
My eyes are open like a window that's surrounded by pain
I know sometimes I don't articulate myself right, right?
Maybe it coincides with how we hear ourselves right, right?
I won't tell you that you're supposed to help fight right
But I've got that shelf life if you wanna know what that hell like
The knife is open, you're holding it up to your throat
The taillight's broken, they don't know 'cause you're pulling a boat
Only take what you need, everything else gets left
But if we gotta die tonight, I might take a couple extra breaths
I never been a born loser, but time got no remorse
Watch over those storm troopers, they'll force you to use force
But you're still trying to hold the tears, poker face, show no fear
Lost in space, solar flare, don't really care if the coast is clear
I'm making motions, I hope it's enough to get home
This lake is frozen, cold as fuck if you sit on a throne
Only give what you can and try not to overextend
But if we gotta die tonight, I don't wanna make any more friends
This train is ours, we should be tagging and writing

I was a sad boy, I liked the sad chicks
Protest the process, problem addicts
She holds me accountable for all of the damage
But we were both digging through the trash trying to find a sandwich
Back when a kiss used to taste like a Camel
Back when we used to play the game just to gamble
We used to ride around the city on a surfboard
Working towards trying to afford a spot on the first floor
Yeah, I guess if you say so, we was comfortably numb in the back of a Rainbow
Choking on the same smoke, looking at the same show
Can't even remember what I came for
What? My name ain't known in the traps or the streets
But it rolls off the tongue like fuck the police
And now you're back up in the city getting sniffy
You only miss me when you're tipsy

She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not

Ain't nothing changed but the coping mechanisms
There ain't an algorithm that can hold you in position
And when the bars close, we can drink it in the alleyway
When my heart goes, give thanks to my family
You're trying to use my soul as a weapon
I stole it back and took a selfie of my own reflection
And y'all can eat me and suck the skeleton
After I climb into that hole and go to heaven, seven

Thе price tag grew an arm and a leg
Put thе pharmaceuticals and the parmesan in the bag
You're trying to force that corpse in a box
The water's turned off, but the door still locks

Something tell me that I probably don't

That's not running like the chicken head got amputated
We built this whole prison out of stacked pennies
We used to go swimming in them half-empties
Southsider since the day my father first started
Dropping agriculture in the back of a Chevy
And I don't even know if I'm supposed to be alive
All I know is that I love it when I open up my eyes
And I'm surrounded by these people I would give up my life for
This is why we get high for

These warehouse wages kill the ends introduction
Man, I should've schooled it up when I was younger, should’ve stuck to plan
Always had the dreams of bein' more self-assertive
And my kid's a teenager now he needs the health insurance
So break my body, break break my soul down
Just another zombie walkin' blindly through your ghost town
Pull up to the bar to politic and tap the power
Ain't nobody really all that jolly at your happy hour
But I don't want to go home yet
So I'ma talk to my cigarette and that television set
It doesn't matter what brand or station
Anything that take away from the current situation
No overtime pay, no holiday
Months behind on everything but the lottery
Winter 'round the corner guaranteein' that my car dies
Wifey havin' trouble tryin' to juggle both the part-times
My cup ain't close to filled up
We tryin' to build up so we can have enough
And when I finally get the color won't be nothin' left to paint on
A friend of mine tried to kill himself to the same song

My better half is mad at makin' magic out of canned goods
My tax bracket status got her questionin' my manhood
My shorty got caught smokin' weed at a concert
And if I smack him everybody treats me like a monster
My neighbors ain't doin' much better
And we makin' competition instead of stickin' together
Can't save no nest egg, in fact this nest is rented
In fact that rent is late, wait
The money ain't here, the raise ain't comin'
Just me and my son and that crazy woman
And those bartenders, this whole fuckin' country
Got everybody swallowin' that lunch meat
Well maybe we can speed up the process
Kill me in my thirties in the name of progress
Put me in the dirt and then change the topic
Sometimes seems like the only way to stop it
Contemplate my departure date
Doesn't take a lot to get a lot of us to talk this way
Take a shot at me that's all I'm obligated for
Apparently my only guarantee is a walk away

They love the taste of blood
Now I don't know what that means, but I know that I mean it
Maybe they're as evil as they seem
Or maybe I only look out the window when it's scenic
Atmosphere finally made a good record
Yeah right, that shit almost sounds convincing
The last time I felt as sick and contradictive as this
Was the last time we played a show in Cincy
"Get real", they tell me
If only they knew how real this life really gets
They would stop acting like a silly bitch
They would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it

Doesn't take much and that's messed up
Because these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us
While everyone was trying to out-do the last man
I was just a ghost trying to catch some Ms. Pac-man
Hello ma'am, would you be interested
In some sexual positions and emotional investments
See, I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking, "Yo where did all the passion go?"
East coast, West coast, down South, Midwest
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Somebody give me a big yes
God bless America, but she stole the B from Bless (and kept it)
Now I'm too fucked up to dance
So I'mma sit with my hand down the front of my pants

Because they make most of they moves off of instinct and scents

Hustle, maybe a couple will love what you said
Emcees drag their feet across a big naked land
With an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hand
Yeah, I got some last words, fuck all of ya'll
Stop writing raps and go play volleyball
Gotta journey the world in a hurry
Cause my attorney didn't put enough girls on the jury
Guilty of dropping these bombs in the city
But I'm innocent, love is the motive, that's why I'm killing 'em
Guilty of setting my fire in all fifty

To emo kids that got too many feelings
He held the register open while he counted her change
I was next in line which meant I was invisible
From where I stood I could see that the till was full
He didn't look the type to play superhero
So I stepped forth and paid for my cigarettes
Crept out the store's front door to chase a little breath
Bangles in my head, shake the song off
Another manic Monday night, its gonna be a long walk
A car pulled up, a fixed up Cutlass
A woman and a child climbed out and left it running
They went inside of the deli, placed an order
With the extra dollar fifty bottled water cause the daughter's picky
When they came out mommy gave me a glance
That said man can love an angel but he's got to take the chance
Already knew the deal, I lit one up and walked
So they got back in they Oldsmobile, belted up, and took off
Thug love on the corner by the Walgreens
Looking at me like I'm just another square Saltine
As I get closer I notice they showing each other sketches
Out of their notebooks, reminded me of my old roots
You might also likeI walk past with a nod and a reminisce
Swear to god hip hop and comic books was my genesis
Respect the life and the fashions of the children
It's the only culture I've got, exactly what we've been building
All of a sudden I'm in front of some man
No, he's a young'un, but he's got a gun in his hand
He looks fifteen, he looks frantic, no, he looks afraid
Immediately apprehensive 'til I heard him say
"Do you want this? It's not mine, I promise
I found it on my block in between a couple garages
Didn't want to leave it for a child to stumble over
I don't even know how to hold it"
It was a thirty eight, the poor man's machete
Held it in my hand, thinking damn man it's heavier than expected
Wedged it behind my belt buckle
Knowing that it's evil, even thought that I could smell trouble
The extra strength felt weak
But over there on the corner saw what I needed
And proceeded to cross the street
Put the heat in the mail box to lose it
Figured that the post office knows what's best to do with it
Mosey down the road, thinking about the old
I used to roam this zone through two feet of snow
Right here, this used to be a record shop
I've gotten love, I've gotten drunk, I've gotten beat up in that parking lot
I've had my Lake Street pride for 3 decades
These alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days
Before I was a germ learning how to misbehave
All the way to the grave, south side is my resting place
Took a right on Lyndale I'm getting near
But then the road became empty and the people disappeared
The clouds ran away, opened up the sky
And one by one I watched every constellation die
And there I was frozen, standing in my backyard
Face to face, eye to eye, staring at the last star
I should've known, walked all the way home
To find that she wasn't here, I was still all alone
No matter where I am, no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
They can leave me for dead they can take away my true
I'm always coming back home to you
Through the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew
I'm always coming back home to you
As sure as the life in the garden that you grew
I'm always coming back home to you
No matter where I am, no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
If only I had known what you already knew
I'm always coming back home to you
From the heaven I've had to the hell I been through
I'm always coming back home to you
I'm always coming back home to you16Embed

Dont cha kno
Pushin big words through a little hole with leave your mouth tore

Turnin' around and puttin' their head down
And saving um from burnin' in my circles eternally
Infernal, purple clouds pour acid rain and it drowns your perception of a classic
That's the same classic that has 300 parts and there all on MTV

Enough to hold you to the brightest of lights
To place you dangerously close to that sun
Enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore
And recognize the cause of what's done is done
More than enough to put my name behind my ideals
And neglect my logic twice daily
Enough to keep me looking for my Lucy in the sky with gems
When I remember how you used to call me baby
Enough to look in my mirror with detest
For every tear you shed regardless of why you wept
Enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth
Of the ocean I swam till I ran out of breath

I love you, don't ever fucking question that
That's why we'll probably never get along
If I was better at finding the right words to say
I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs
I love you, I love you (faded)
Never, don't ever fucking question that
Don't ever fucking question that

Riding the public transit, I study the blank stares
To answer my questions of how and why I got so many grey hairs
I take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord
And I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord
Single file lines, to give her a pound one at a time
But when I faced her, I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine
I awokened from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me
To submission and I still walk with my religion
I watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror
Worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer
I hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin
Gassing me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within
For every eclipse that stares at me
From the other side of a paper cup of espresso
I light a match beneath a kettle
And for every set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program
To seek success, I bleed my ethics out a slow drip
I know a man who met a woman, don't remember where
Big beautiful eyes and light brown hair
She was from the 'burbs, he was from the south side of the city
This was back when Franklin Avenue was still pretty
Two different worlds apart, but the world is just a small town
We all know how people like to get down
Here we go, Aquarius, Pisces
Feel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul
Push shoved to came, without the glove, numbed the pain
The magic from up above what it does for the brain

I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp
I live life like the captain of a sinking ship
The one thing that I can guarantee
I'm like a stepping razor, I suggest you stay fair with me
Been paying dues for a decade plus
Before that I was just another face on the bus
Tappin' my foot, to the beat on the radio
Dreaming 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies
Oh mom, I promise I'm gonna be large
Some day I'ma stop trying to borrow your car
Gonna go far, with charisma and skill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
Atmosphere, it's just a ten letter word
Discretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird
And if you didn't hear, then fuck what others heard
I think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured
Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix
I'mma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek
It's not that I don't like you, I just don't want to speak
You fucking freak, now keep your days out my week
The world keeps a balance, through mathematics
Defined by whatever you've added and subtracted
I'm pushin' on the hammer to trigger the brain
Embrace how I live, 'cause God loves ugly

Once upon a time in Minneapolis, yo
I damn near had to steal the show
I stepped on the stage - "Who is it?"
My name's Slug, I've come to kill a couple minutes
And what's up with the way that everybody gathers around
Each other, so they can steal each others' sound
If it's all about getting down, with the get down
How long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?
Appears more clear in its simplest form
Nobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm
Abandonin' the norm, and handlin' the harvest
Measurin' the worth by the depth of the hardship
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin' short on rations
I began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'
Make it happen, and take this captain to the gallows
I keep steering us into an area that's shallow
Talking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry
Said, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light, a little love and some liquid
I'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow
I'll float atop the flood holdin' on to my ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

Why scream, when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen
Let life be a bowl of melted ice cream
Or be the deer that's caught in my high beams
I'm rolling with the brights on
Scared stiff, reality is just too much to bear with
Paranoid, walking around, careless
No wonder you're in love with your therapist
Go to sleep my little time bomb

Please won't you smile, smile with me, smile with me
Smile with me, please won't you

Oh look at her, she's lookin' as good as dinner
And she's lookin' back at me as if maybe I'm a winner
I'm in my late twenties little girl don't flirt with me
I've got the capabilities to program your circuitry
You don't have to believe, do yourself a little justice
Don't let Slug undercook your muffins
Oh wait, did I say that, I did, must be losing it
Cause it almost felt that it might just have some truth in it
Now back to the platter at hand
She said she's twenty-one and quit school to go work for the man
A switch up in the plan, now she's happy as a chorus
'Cause now she makes rent and now she drives a Taurus
Unwindin' and hangin' out at the bar
I wonder if she knows that I'm not really a star
She seems to be impressed with my lack of an ego and
My self-aware style, I like the way that she smiles
She wanna know how I find the words I use
I don't really know but I can lie if you want me to
Angels sing to me in my sleep
I sold my damaged soul for the magic of speak
Now she's laughin', she likes the sarcasm
Naturally, I'm askin' if she's got a captain
A captain, you mean a man at home, the answer is no
I came to this bar alone
Well heavens to Betsy, enough about boyfriends already
Just tryin' to keep the conversation heady
As much as I would love to run and play in the forest
Ain't no way this girl is gonna break into my fortress
I've never made a practice, of introducing the mattress
To women that I meet at my own gig
I don't know, can't imagine anything as small as
Alcohol and hormones turnin' out to be anything big
Baby's hella beautiful, even kinda bright
I've got the fire of a vampire inside me tonight
It might be alright, everything seems tight
I've got a good buzz and she's givin' me the green light
So tell me girl, what you doin' after
She says hopefully hangin' out with my new favorite rapper
Now wait a minute, that's not fair, you're throwin' 'boulders
I can tell by the way your hair touches your shoulders
Be straight with me and I'll be me with you
I can think of some of us that we should do
So if you think I'm comin' home with you tonight
You're probably right, probably right
A few more beers, a couple more laughs
Undressing my past with the questions she asked
Yes, I love cats and I would love to take a bath
If I would spend the night, would you massage my back
She's closin' in for the embrace
And slightly tucks her head under my face
Her hair smells so good, I gotta have a taste
Where's your Ford, let's ditch this place
In the parking lot, she sparked it off
She must be starving for someone to hit the heart
I've never been kissed with such passionate bliss
Pornstar damn near tore my lips apart
Honey, slow it up, hold it up, start the car and
Leave this garage, let's go to your apartment
Lyndale Avenue, on the way to her rest
Her drunk-ass turns to look at me and she says
You're so beautiful from the hair to the soul
I can't believe that I've never met you before
It feels like I've been waiting for you my whole life
She missed the red light, hit a pickup truck and we both diedYou might also like3Embed

It rang forever, it never went to the voicemail
This goes to all my birdies out in Albuquerque
Don't ever let 'em put the thermometer in your turkey

Hoes gotta eat too, peace, Mr. Witherspoon
Leaves in a swimming pool, listen, fool

Like a kangaroo when you sound like some dude
That sounds like another dude? Rubber from the inner tube
What's the hullabaloo, Winnie the who?
They call me Sean, I used to hang out with your aunt
Toke a little kush and play a little tonk
I knew your daddy and your fast-ass mom
So what, so what, so what you want? What you want, huh?
I drove the bandwagon
Used to have fantasies of Vanity's ass in The Last Dragon
I'm closing in on fifty and my fashion is flagrant
I'm officially too old for these pants to be sagging
When you don't know where you are put your eyes to the sky
And identify the North Star
Watch as it storms toward the podium like, "Give me your support"

Pour a little liquor out for the deceased

I wish I was a writer, I shoulda been a cook
Apprеciate the looks, but food and books
Been the hustle every year for the prior millennium
We're tryna hit it higher than the lights on the stadium
That's just a simple example of how basic I am
I'm not the one that's got your bubble gum
But I got a couple opposable thumbs
And this obsessive compulsion to sweep up these crumbs

I make beats every day, I get at least two in (Okay)
I smoke weed in every language, speak fluent (I'm trying)
If I ain't lovin' it, respect my absence, I be truant

Rolling up this herb to gather word combinations
There's no trouble that I'm facing
So fuck the treble, all the bass in
The livest spaceship from off the station
Without weed, there's no subtleties to my patience
Overanxious, same old songs (Right)
Same story, same roach clip, same old bong (Right)
I take a pull and think, "Damn, how you remain so long?"
I've been living on a view, I try to take it all in (Way high)

She said that I'm a textbook narcissist
I told her that she's toxic like carcinogens
She kicked me out the house, I said, "Karma is a bitch"
And then we made love under the stars and the wind
I must be dumb, she had a pocket full of horseshoes
Smile like orange juice, shining off my fangs
I'm trying to ascertain why everybody has to complain
Even the sunshine'll dance in the rain
You can produce and direct your critique
My skin's thick with three C's, it seem to get thicker every week
Feel free to express your speech
We squeeze diamonds from the pressure as a stress release
If you can flex that strength, then you know how it goes
We show up for each other and try to hold each other close
Both of us supposed to keep it under control
You can't love another life without a couple of woes

I know you got a couple of those
I know you got a couple of woes
Yeah, I know you got a couple of those
I'm like woah

Somebody better call an ambulance
I'd have to be sick to think we'd ever need another jam like this
And at the least, please reach out to my management
Tell them I forgot to leave the seat down in the can again
I'm sorry, I know I'm so unoriginal
Plus I'm overly critical, I'm a condescending contradiction
Slip into the victim role if it remotely fits
A shoulder full of chips, pulling luggage on my ego trip
Apparently, I'm inherently chewing on my foot
Put a judge on the cover of my book
Dad shorts in the streets, dad snores in the sheets
With an orchestra of noise from the core of my sleep
Please baby, keep me in your thoughts
I know it's gotta be almost impossible for you to water
All the flowers in my pot, I put the sour in the sauce
And act like it's not my fault, it's just a product of my flaws
If you ever had a pulse, then you know how it goes
We show up for each other and try to hold each other close
I ain't above it, it's a struggle to grow
You can't love another life without a couple of woes

How does it go? I'm all strung out
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out
Already know, I'm all strung out
I'm lost in the cloud of fear and self-doubt
How does it go? I'm all strung out
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out
Already know, I'm all strung out
I'm tryna work it out, I think I'm burning out

Yes, the rebel, the rhythm
The devil in my system got me feeling like brrt, stick 'em
It's three in the morning and I'm standing in my kitchen
Opened up the fridge to confront my addictions
Looking at the food like it'll save me from my sickness
Maybe that's how it got the nicknames Fixins
I wanna make a sandwich and cop a couple donuts
A bowl of cereal and wash it down with a soda
But I'm getting too old to act young
In a culture of consumption, gotta fix thе malfunctions
Mix another drink so I can feel like a loser
If I stay away from liquor, I'm fiеnding for some sugar
Got a whole lot of excuses to change my behavior
So stressed out, I just wanna stay familiar
Man, I'm just a man tryna feed mi familia

Knowing damn well I should follow Dr. Sebi
But I love to cake parmesan and meat on my spaghetti
Back in the day I could pack it away
And none of that garbage happened to stay
I went from high metabolism to bye, metabolism
Oh shit, I gotta find my activism
But I'm lacking interest
And that Big Mac is smacking, isn't it?
And when big mama's back in the kitchen
I start chasing my appetite like I'm tracking a distance
I gotta get back in business

Once upon a time, there was a young boy
He grew up on the banks of the Mississippi
He wants to fly away to find his personal paradise
But first I give thanks and then finish my whiskey
I can't explain why I feel so alone
When I'm surrounded by these people who won't leave me alone
We used to treat the pain like an obstacle
Before we knew it offered opportunity to glue me to you
It's a beautiful life, we tryin' to notice it
But it's a difficult life, you gotta hold it in your fist
Like a knife, don't ever bleed for vampires
Skeptical of suckers tryna feed my trash fire
If you got the time, you gotta make that impact
Bend up the bars and break out of the syntax
I keep running until I collapse
Until my time's up and I don't come back

Make time to have a good time
If you can't find time, you might have to buy time
Take a timeout before you're all out of time
It's about time, don't be wasting my time

Once upon a time, there was a young boy
He grew up on the bottom of the Twin Cities
We bothered everybody at the party
She could've been my Bobby, I probably was her Whitney
I'll write a song for you, then write another one
I struggle just to keep it down to a couple of
Pages in the notebook, save you on a hard drive
What's it gonna take to get your name in the archives?
And I pretend to do the sensible thing
But I've been swimming upstream ever since I could dream
And it don't even seem like the line's getting shorter
I need a drug that makes time move slower
I been complaining just a little too often
I should be thankful for these limited options
I got a full belly and something to cough on
Somebody tell me what the fuck is my problem?

And we can flex if we wanna
Or we could connect to protect each other from the monsters
Baptized in a pot of boiling water
Doesn't matter either way, the fever gonna get a whole lot hotter

I ain't seeing half the sleep
That I probably should be seeing as a model human being
But I was taught how to adjust with the seasons
Maybe you should focus on some shit that you believe it
And keep it moving like there's no room for improvement
My perpetual truth is I spend a little
Too much of personal time just tryna make some better music
Now what the fuck is that? Hell of a fantasy
You can tell my family I said that I loved 'em
And you can tell 12 I said nothing
Already under surveillance, man, they watchin' your show
Try to change the channel and get lost in the snow
Like who's that knocking on the front door?
And how'd they move past the booby traps that you planted on the front porch?
And all your favorite rappers are not Illuminati
We're too stupid probably
Spank that ass like you got that stock
Stole a tank of gas and broke the nozzle off
Got the volume Molotov'd on the boombox
The world's a costume shop, why you choose to be a cop?
When it rains, it pours, and when it pours, it floods
I'm tryna order one more before you cork the jug
They said we started our initial descent like this
I said a prayer and it went like this

G Rap said, "You can be the G.O.A.T.," it takes one to know one, yup

Why do I feel detached? I could cure the worst disease
But your worker's fee, sorry, call a doctor for that
Knock knock, don't holler back, let's surf, I'm on a couch placed in the the trap
You might see a mouse chase the cat
It's weird, I'm about-facing that turned my back
On the pain and the facts 'cause I'm about facing that
Meh, know I'm a little extra
To everything you didn't measure, no one gave an F for effort
Took what's less for better, used to getting ditched
I used to love her in the whip, but now we sexting in a Tesla
That pleasure was electric, I'm trying not to budge

Soaking in my oats, come find me in the mud
I'm tired, I ain't woke, insomnia's a drugEmbed
And I'm not your mommy
Never cared 'bout your money
And I left your party
'Cause y'all clowns are too funny
You can dive off the stage
Or you can climb up those curtains
It's alright to admit that
You're afraid of the uncertain
I'm here to audition
For the role of the unhinged
Tryna act like it's an accident
The bad guys catch wins
I might just be nervous
Anxiety resurface
I got issues with the misuse
And your excuse of a purpose
I stayed until the finish
To the dismay of my critics
When it's all said and done
Y'all can say that I did it
Or you can tell them I failed
I mean, I guess I don't care
That's none of my concern
Y'all gotta learn not to stare
Stop, we not the same

I want my up as steady as my down
When I, I, I
I want my cup as heavy as my crown
When I, I, I
Look in the mirror, I'm so glad I found a friend
When I come around again
I want my up steady as my down
My cup heavy as my crown when
When I come around

She told me to come inside and get out of the raindrops
And stop living your life like a day job
I'm tryna make this feel like a holiday
It's a complicated celebration nowadays
Gotta take it any way we can acquire it
With consideration to our time and our environment
Trying to find a silver lining with yourself included
It's why we play these records like therе's keys in the music
It could be as simplе as it's supposed to be
If only what they told me was actually what they showed me
Hope the kids get a chance to tell a brand new story
But in the meantime, please don't stand so close to me
She says she never loved the police
That's when I knew I wanted to protect myself from her sting
And I don't know what to think, but now I'm trying to redeem
For every time I didn't seem to keep my eye in your team
And I can be as careless as a dream
But as careful as the breeze carry seeds from the trees and
Spread 'em 'cross the field until they too little to see
Until they barely just a ripple in the sea
Specifically, I'm free to be stressed
And worried 'bout whatever sequence of events and experiences
I'm feeling incomplete and let me get this release
I believe that I need some relief
I disappear into the night like a what?

Hopped in the getaway, left Santa Monica
Dan Monick in the back with binoculars
Ant's on the driver's side, I ride shotgun
Looking at the rearview, I think somebody's following
Helicopters clockin' the wrong clockers
I just dropped my kids off at soccer
It's gotta be awkward to walk and talk
With the defiant posture of a giant toddler
Hey, doctor, write me a script
So I can pop the top off and light me a spliff
Watch a documentary that I'll likely forget
Let's stop pretending we got some type of life outside of this
Gonna be okay, little homiе
A hero ain't nothing but a hoagie
Don't evеr let 'em put the baloney up in your bowl of macaroni
Push the button and put the Dolby in your Sony
Is it live or is it Memorex?
I'm tryna live my best life check to check to check
Never met a pessimist that plays chess

Turned off the headlights, the whole world vanished

(Get things straight once and for all)

It goes truth to power to responsibility
Mama tryin' to put the whole litter out their misery
If you can feel me, lick shots at the ceilin'
Until the 'bots come back from the future to try killin' me
Nah dude, I'm just sayin' it's true
And you namin' me and blamin' me for hatin' on you
Pssh, I got way better things to do
Never forget this is America, banks rob you
Raise your hands up and pay that ransom
We made this anthem over breaks that Ant brung
You caught a bad one and bought you a handgun
Moved to Montana, now you rockin' a man bun
And I ain't even tryin' to clown it or clone it
It fits your persona, it's sick, you should own it
No bones to pick and no stones to kick
Just thе leftover microphones blown to bits

I dеcided to scribe this today
Eight times outta ten
It's suicide inside of my mind
Image of lyin' to side with one eye showin'
Close it, it won't blink, still open
All the emotion I felt for it, I poured in the felt and fell forward
Even if it felt foreign
I thought that I would be scored historically
As one of the best doin' it, now I'm not pressed for it
Shed tear for it, I sweat for it
Cut up until my flesh porous
A mesh, I bled for it, a mess for it
I lost homies yet
You don't wanna flow toe to toe, that's a death warrant

I go online and look at you while you lookin' at me
I'm what it's like to see the thing that you'll never be
Do the thing you'll only dream since you choosin' the sleep
I'm up and performing, my presence is global
Warning a warning that's so abnormal
It's normal to keep ignoring I'm hot
Matter fact, I'm the reason you're heated
And if you can't stand me, we got tickets for seating
They wanna play for a quarter, but I'm here for the season
So if you wanna stop losing, stop competing

Picture me impressed by an IG flex
Roc'll strongarm the mic and exercise these pecs
With breath control ironclad like a knight getting dressed

Shine on every beat like a black eye 'til I leave that charred

Pen with more torque than a Wildcat Challenger
Vice chancellor, fine manicured mic handler
All in my bag after the Benjamins like Banneker
No biz like showbiz until COVID
Opiates stole our hero and left no Prince
All this drama makes it hard to stay focused
It's still fuck 12, 45th, and his four kids
True believer since DMC rocked them loose Adidas
Sprinkle voodoo when in the stu' like a brujeria
Lucid dreamer, grew up pissing off the music teacher
Guess I won at life, wife looking like the new Aaliyah

Making a million exploiting your fellow citizen really isn't the same as giving people medicine
Regardless of feelings, imperialism will only benefit a few, the rest are on the receiving end
So when you witness this loveliness that we're hustling, just know that it isn't an ad or photo op for Benetton
It's a solution in action, independence
Longevity prioritized over everything
Let's start assembling people with some togetherness
Let's hold a rally and introduce them to special guests
The master of ceremonies in effect
And when it comes to mics, he's a specialist
Terrorist from the West, blessed with the weapons in the flesh
Bombs he's constructed with the alphabet

I could probably never admit this to anyone else but you
But back in like 2001
I wanted to kill you
I turnt up when I heard the crash
But in the next few frames that followed
I turnt all the way down like slow motion
Like time and space got swallowed
And I believe every moment is meaningful, even if just for a second
And every second counts when you watch the clock from inside of the wreckage
Two in the mornin', I was outside your buildin' in the back of a taxi
And over on the corner next to the record store, we saw an accident happen
Of course it stole my focus
Cold as the wind, I'm frozen, motionless
I don't remember if I showed emotion
Just autotune and sing those notes
Was almost twenty years ago, long time ago
Sometimes I try to block it out my mind, but then decide to show
Those glimpses of violence on the insides of my eyelids
I still hear it in my head, I can see it, still can't describe it
See the cab driver fumble with his flip phone, tryin' to hit 911
You know the cops are gonna come
Like what the fuck? The one time I've ever carried a gun
This ain't even my gun, what the hell did you put in this flask?
Who the fuck do you think that you are with your scary ass?
Wishin' that you could bury it in the trash
Smash that four-door Ford sedan into an F-150
Bright red blood in the fresh white snow and my breath got sticky
I was on the verge of cryin', but this ain't my time to work it out, no
I'm tryin' to find a way to help out, but I'm nervous that I don't know how to
And I'm sure I heard a voice come from the inside of the car
So I'm pullin' on the handle tryin' to pry the door ajar
Lookin' through the window, I don't see anybody movin'
The noise I heard was the radio, there's nothing there but music
It was no surprise when I recognized y'all drew a crowd 'round
And everybody so quiet, it felt like the song was stupid loud now
Kick, bass, and snare, I swear that to this day, when I close my eyes
I thank whomever can hear these tears, 'cause that's the night that one of us was supposed to dieYou might also like1Embed

I've got your name on the list, bring a guest i
Know you got my back, I can the feel the connect
But my local laundromat doesn't accept respect
And maybe you can help me settle a bet
Should I bite my tongue or keep it hella direct?
When the only thing left is the special effects
But I'm starin' at the camera like, "I ain't dead yet"

And whoever survives gets to clean the mess

I'm dying to know, know

This could be the last song that I ever wrote
Only heaven knows I'm like whatever though
Everybody's gotta travel across it
When I go I hope I go from supernatural causes
But man, I'm exhausted
It's all about how you handle your losses
And whether or not you recognize that you're toxic
You're a product of putting the prophecy below the profit
The pirate treasure's always buried next to monsters
Or lava the promise of trauma
If I could quote a late-century philosopher
He said you can save the drama for your mama
That's why I'm focused on the fire the circumstance
You're not entitled to a second or a third chance
I think I can feel the universe expand
If I could do it all over again, I'd learn to dance

So many other realities exist simultaneously

(What did you say?)
She said it's just your imagination
There's no such thing as good or evil, it's just people
When I consider everything that we've lived through
I wish that I could find the strength to forgive you
But really though, I love you
Don't even know you but I need your affection
Appreciate your business and I cherish the connection
That enables my ability to visit this dimension
That's a whole lot of smoke, huh?
I hope that it was worth the resources you smoked up
Force the opening and stole some closure
It's a cold, cold world when you're alone in your corner
I still remember how to shoplift
Don't be astonished if my socks fit
Let's bring it back to the original topic
It's a graham cracker, marshmallow and some chocolateEmbed
I can't scratch, cause I'm drunk
I got bad teeth and my gums are bleeding
Come and fucking get me, motherfucker
Yeah, break, start the song now, fucker

We traveling the missle, weaving through your cornfields
Leaving behind a trail of amateur porn and orange peels
Navagatin' through this basement, that masquerades
As a nation, practising my acetate masturbation
Watching the expressions on the faces
Of them ones designated to be the queens, kings, and aces
How many miles can you put on one sole
Before the smile starts to blend into one big bullet hole

Shoot through it as a unit, with the best of my crew
Bumping melodies and memories too, my head's killing me, ooh
Stomach empty, my bladder is full
Two-year-old son on Jaybird's phone cryin', you missing me
And I'm starving, I'll bite your arm off
Sabertooth Tiger, run the night with the sharp claws
In your backyard just to fuck with your guard dog
Throw a brick through your shit and cut the alarm off
Bitch

Fuck yes, I do my best to take advantage in bouts
With one hand over the mouth, still managin' to shout
There's more said within the lines on your forehead
Than they could ever try to fine-print on the inside of that warhead
Cross country, like a little lost junkie
Make them hot and jumpy, trying to get that God money
Steering the van through the blizzards, the fanfare
Pivot when we visit, spit victim if you stand there

Take a map of this picture, throw a dart at it, that's where
We took a room back full of kids and threw our heart at it
Angry like a hostage, kicking like a little bitch in one of Dibbs's mosh pits
Shifting through your city limits trying to find the raw shit
Thread a needle with it, and weave a world of heads together, till we get 'em car sick
Face full of war paint, strapped, ready for action
Battle cracks heading, trying to seek the satisfaction of the captain

Climbed over the side, closed his eyes
Took a dive into his fame, inspiration for staying alive
Swam to the shore, stepped upon land
Walked up to a whore, grabbed her by the hand
And said
Let the wheels spin, let the road shake
Let the speakers blow
Let the line in, let the kids play
Let the people know
Let the roof burn, let the girls love
Let the heat flow
Let the world turn, let the curtains up
Cats Van Bags, Yo

Lock eyes with a thousand people at the same time
They minds believing this
My style of graffiti is
Squeezing just the midwest sweat out of my shirt
And leaving with my life essence embedded in your dirt

We work, move, and hustle with the rest of the gypsies
Spoon-feed these issues to a new school of fishies
Swimming through a hazy shade of passion
Here they come, the Hazleton has-been, and his chaplain

Yeah, that's them, the migrants, seasonal workers
The finest imperial wordsmiths on the circuit
Two million smiles and runnin', stomping, trying to flee the heat
Turn around, shooting at the monster till his knees are weak
They call me Jesus Freak, I came to listen
Then I save you, then I make you my favorite position
Chasin' this pigeon down the street towards the banks
Just in case my traffic receives jeeps and tanks

And we wander through this soul, so let it be known
Mama I don't know if I'mma ever be home
The revolution won't have any distribution
I love my son and my music so I gotta keep it moving

Regarde le serpent mignon. Mords-tu, le serpent ? Salut

It's the bird, it must have been the bird
Disgusting critter, it must
We should have known better than to trust
This disease-infested ball of lust and carnage
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
Got to tear her apart, let me at her first
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
What's she thinking
Does she really believe
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
Like she's chosen over those who walk around on two feet
The bird, the melodies she play
The music she make
Rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
Trying to remind us, it's time to awake
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
The chirps, I'll turn them into screams
My feathered friend's end will justify the means
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
And swing her in circles until she's too dizzy to speak
Well I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly)
She's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free
I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly)
She's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better than me just because she's free

And he was a man, or so he thought
Paid attention to the lessons daddy taught
Secondhand-me-down blessing, she was short on patience
Carried mace and hated everyday people
The plight of the pessimist
Habitual living, daily schedule consisted of:
Work, television and sexual moments
But sometimes it gets so hopeless
When nonsense raises an octave, thoughts block all sensual focus
You might also likeWith a firm grasp on the grudge they both clutch in the name of love
Fear of the results had push ever came to shove
Seduced for fun, produce a lot of fight
Two youths on the run, learning some truth about life
And when he stares at the stars, he reflects on the moon
The time, the talks they share walking around Calhoun
And when she watches the look on his face as he sleeps
She recalls every inch as to how it got this deep
Now how am I to know you like the way I laugh?
I can't read the map, no one's ever seen the path
The one you take a bath with is the same one that frees your path
Oh, you going out? what time you gon' be back?

'Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Let's all take seats, please quiet during the performance
Lift her, pull her from the orchids
'Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Trying to read the script, keep getting trapped in the margins
Lift them, pull them from the gardens
Now she was smart, she grew up with this complex
That the people that surrounded her seemed to expect the world
And he was tall, over six, no attempt to predict the fall
Thought he'd seen it all until his all became that girl
She said she loves the drugs, but when she comes down
She speaks about finishing, she's convinced it's the last visit
He doesn't know the difference between come and go
Give him just one to grow and watch him collapse inside of a half pint
She dyed her hair black, maybe now she can relax
Maybe now the regulars will stare half as hard
He wears a old face and beer gut
Existence validation printed on the monthly statements
That come from MasterCard
He thinks she sleeps too much
She thinks he spends too much
He thinks her friends are jokes
She thinks he's out of touch
He thinks she drinks too much
She thinks he thinks too much
It's all another phase turning the page in the book of growing up
She has seen a lot of sex, he tried to hide his resentment
But there wasn't nothing thing left for them to label new
But sometimes the obvious ain't simple to see
'Cause even the time that they killed
Was something that she wasn't accustomed to
She never comprehended what to make of it (make of it)
He was never quite prepared to study the reaching
Together they shared the sacred practices of breathing
The weather was fair, however the hovering clouds weren't leaving
Discover the little drama demons that hide
Deep inside the framework and live in that congested brain
They had old lovers on the side, old flames
That somehow managed to spark regardless of the pouring rains
And each time they mix up the ingredients
They recheck the recipe to see, maybe they're reading it incorrectly
Collect me, consume me, release me, snuggle
Two geniuses putting together the pieces to a blank puzzle

You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me

(I pledge allegiance to Budweiser and free drugs)
Peace to Rick James, Anna Nicole Smith, Bill Clinton
And Motley Crue
And anyone else who has ever utilized their 15 minutes
Of fame to realize their true dreams of being an
Absolute jerk off, just to keep the masses entertained
This goes out to learning from the mistakes of others
Bring it on now
Come on
I said come on
I said come on

They call me a jerk, once they get to know me
But they don't stop calling, they read me well
It's no work if I was phony, I'd win a trophy
Who needs to make records when there's seeds to sell
Freak the bell, and make it all spin crooked
God please help, too much grim to look at
Grab the tree by the limb and shook it
Like, "Have you seen my self esteem, where the hell'd you put it?"
Oh wait, never mind, I found it in a bottle
Drunk at the Troubadour talking to a model
Wrecked the rental on Santa Monica Boulevard
I was headed to the El Rey to slap a security guard

Rowdy, stubborn, loud and arrogant

Package the kid's face, put it on display
Look ma!, another national disgrace

The liquor gets hold of the head, liver, soul
Blurry on Sixth Street and Red River Road
Last thing I remember was the Ogden Theatre
Backstage bathroom making out with all three of ya
Kicked out of Topcats... for where I put the vomit at
Finally passed out in a laundromat
Malnourished and topless, slurring and obnoxious
Like, "Yo, we got this!"
The Zodiac Killer's 'bout to rock this
At the Great American Music Hall, pissin' on the box office
Pick apart the detail, alcohol and females
All around the world, same Sean
Houston and Ludlow, Maxfish, Vampire
You pour the beer and I'll bring the satire
No prob, I'll play the part of doorknob and make it look
So good you're gonna wish that it was your job

It's all about the hangovers, and late checkouts
Maid banging on the door like, "Wake up! Get out!"
But come on mami, y'all probably don't want me comin'
Out like a zombie brushing teeth in the lobby
This is a career, not a hobby
Ain't no reason to fear what you wanna see
Hey paparazzi, don't you wanna watch me quote the
Fonzi and then crash his Maserati?
Sweat pants, t-shirt, mesh hat, blue blockers
Feeding Jack D to a room full of teenie boppers
Howdy neighbor, take a shot for flavor
Let's debate whether or not we should punch the waiter
I'm just kidding, let's love each other
It goes lick, swallow, suck, and order another
Do what you like, don't nobody care
It's a sign of success, only in America


I didn't come to start no trouble or hurt no one
I'm just here to get drunk, party, and have some fun2Embed
Look at your face
When all I could see was myself looking back at me
Reflection
And all I could do was think about sleeping next to you

What would it take to make a woman like you
View a wolf like me for what I really might be
Listening to lyrics, only hears what I allow
You gotta try and make me testify for here and right now
Let's have a confrontation over a cold one
I'll give you conversation just to see if you can hold 'em
I play so dumb
Because I know some of these star-struck small talk art fucks is no fun
I'm the blood type that goes straight for the guns
Like before you even spoke already knew what your love's like
So what you thinking?
Because I'm thinking we should jump into your ocean
Let's go girl, this ship is sinking


Now there's no reason to lie, I've had a lot of lovers
In my reality, it's impossible to avoid it
But there's one reason for life: gotta provide some supper
Gonna build a family just to watch someone destroy it
Do you really think you really wanna get to know me better?
Don't you see the drama? Don't you feel the pressure?
Don't get me wrong, it would be my pleasure
To sing a song that could remove your shoes and your sweater
Bartender, let me get a shot of Beam
Cause this girl over here is trying to get me out my jeans
And she doesn't seem to believe I'm just another thief
Came to take a piece and make you stutter when you breathe
Now girl you too smart to be a tour mark
Set to play correct from the start with your pure heart
And when you're all alone, I'll sing into your phone
If you don't know the words you can make up your own
You might also likeThe first time she met the devil was at First Avenue
Went backstage with him into the dressing room
Sexy ego trip, taller than expected
About six foot three
Seemed to thrive on his misery
Critical, observant, big words
Sweaty hair, sunken eyes, and thick nerves
She said "I'll make him smile for the simple fact that he needs it
I'll make him smile just so I can kill it, and eat it"
You look like you were built for me
You talk like you want to steal my drink
You kiss like you already came
And that's a "Lifter Puller" line for those without any game
It's like damn baby
You know you can't save me
But you should still tell your people that you're leaving with the band
Maybe you can show me your hustle
Neither one of us would be so lonely
If only you would come over here and hold me
I caught you trying to hide your smile behind your glass
But all of your secrets become a swing set when you laugh
And all of your regrets that you're carrying or burying
Don't mean a damn thing if there's nobody to share them with
We've been following each other all night now
We ought to be all over each other like right now
I don't like crowds, let's take flight now
Cause that face that you make
Reminds me of my life now

"Only trying to find myself inside of you"1Embed
Would you prefer if I remove... MY... A-
Nah they... they're clean...
I mean.. what?
You wanna look at the bottom of... of 'em?

My shoes are clean girl, how about yours?
Here we are sitting on your living room floor
Listening to some records from your collection
Boredom; in between a coma and an erection
Staring at the skin on your shoulder blades
And you don't take your eyes off my poker face
I'm wasted, and you're as sober as Jehovah
Knocking door to door, trying to walk the road
That the Mormons paved
If she was here on your sofa with a beer on a coaster
She'd've told 'ya that my game was way overplayed
Make no mistake, I love the way you taste like yogurt and some clover cigarettes
Girl, show me leg!
Some'll go and trade their shoes for rollerskates
And some'll stay happy just as long as there's a whore to pay
But some of us already spent the rent
So we can't be content until there isn't no more today

Those are your shoes
These are my shoes
We've got issues

My shoes are muddy girl, how about yours?
Here we are lounging on your bedroom floor
I'm really drunk so I'm looking at your carpet like
"Man, fuck the permit, I know where I'mma park tonight"
It's closing time, the spins are gonna visit me
They're rolling thick like they know they taking victory
But not tonight, right, I'mma make some history
Get up in your system and direct it like a symphony
Let me get to be the man of your mystery
Cause them meddling kids don't understand your sensitivity
Show some sympathy, let me kiss your feet
Let's talk about a pretty bird and a busy bee
If I live to see fifty, I'mma be a tipsy, dirty old man
Still following my kid beliefs
I know it isn't really your responsibility
So we'll be straight once I take a hit of Listerine


I can't find my shoes girl, how about yours?
Here I am naked on your bathroom floor
I got faded, and you fell asleep
And I'm thanking God that this date was hella cheap
Sitting down, trying to keep the liquor down
Light, thoughts, and sounds- everything flickers now
Sick-bound, the whole room twists around
In front of the toilet, assume the position to drown
Here it comes! Whiskey out bounces all over the floor
Now I'm sitting in the bitch's mound
I'm just a clown, and I'm sorry I found it funny
When you tripped over my shoes and hit the ground
Didn't know you would rip your gown
Didn't think you would shout and get so loud, get so wound
Yeah I'm drunk, but I'm more than a little proud
I'm leaving, fuck the shoes, you keep them, I'm getting out

Dialed up his homie Murs on the telephone
Gotta talk to somebody who can tell him what the hell is wrong
Brain freezing up, he don't know what to do
But the people that know him know that it ain't nothing new
Catch five rings, then an answering machine
Hang up on the beep, stare up towards the ceiling
Stood up to remember that he slept fully-dressed
So he grabbed his keys and put a hat on his rat's nest
Stepped up to that big outside
Somebody once said "Today's a good day to die."
But he never really was a big fan of their work
So he starts up the walk by kicking sand in the dirt
A friend to the strangers, a stranger to friends
He'll take a coffee and a pack of cigarettes when you have a minute
Handle it. Paid up. The change, you keep it
He's a sucker for the morning smile and summer cleavage
If you knew him better he'd ask for some time
Cause he's looking for a reservoir to empty his mind
And there's only so much he can put in a song
Gotta talk to somebody who can tell him what the hell is wrong

And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you

Carefully learning and analyzing the lyrics you use
Finally realizing that humility is a bruise
Scared love don't make none
If these walls could speak, they would peep about the fake ones
Watching this man, falling off of this plan-
Underachievin' just so he can understand

"What's up baby how you doing? I hate the sound of my own voice
And I've been invited here to distract myself from the fact
That I wrote all of this garbage"

And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you

So, who did your tattoos? That's nice
And who built your taboos? That's life
If he had a glass pipe, he would smash it and use it to slash his wrists
But someone already beat him to it
He would fingerpaint you a picture with his blood
A self-portrait, dramatic and morbid
But the odds of you finding any appreciation are too slim-
Keeps his outlook grim
Tap his foot to the rhythm of original sin
Throw his balls to the wind trying to knock down these pins
He'll keep swinging from the hair above his chin
Till he finds his soul in the fifty cent bin
The price of the payphone escalates
Fake smile when he takes home one of his dates
He could write another hate-poem for you to break
Or maybe stay calm and wait for that big earthquake
Still surrounded by the fire and the water
Still trying to honor this empire's daughter
Still answering questions you're afraid to ask
Still believing that God's gonna save his ass

And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And this house has gotta lotta walls
But only very few mean anything to you
And if you knew him better, he would ask for some time
Cause he's looking for a reservoir to empty his mind
And there's only so much he can put in a song
He's gotta talk to somebody who can tell him what the hell is wrong

So... anyway, girl was like:
"Motherfucker, you have a lot of walls, and you know, you don't like, show people shit."
You don't mistake that
You don't mistake that
I just don't like these fuckers
Haven't met too many motherfuckers I like
You one of them
I hope that's enough...2Embed
It was still dark when Mark arrived
Maybe 6:45 in the morning time
In the tenth grade, we was tight friends
But neither of us had a driver's license
His aunt was a flight attendant
And she'd leave town with a Cadillac unattended
So we used to get tempted
That intense tendency to tend to what we wasn't meant to
We would skip out on class and shit
To go visit other schools, just tryin to act cool
And looking back I have to laugh at it
Cause all we did was burn up gas and flunk math fool
But still it was super ill
I mean two teenagers in a new Seville
With 1987 in the tapedeck
That was a part of my life that I'll never forget
It went...

The soundtrack still runs through my head
I gotta keep every single step
As old as we get, we don't forget

But I loved the looks that the girls shot at me from the bus stop
When we pulled up in that caddy
Good thing back then I had bad game
Otherwise there probably be a few with my last name
Better that my true love was rap
Now let it auto reverse, until the bad dub snaps
Felt so right, forgot we was wrong
Sittin at a stop light, singin along
When I look in my rearview now, what would I see
If I didn't have the music in my history, now give it to me

It was right around the same time that nobody was beatin the biz

I was addicted to the radio
Make my request, and wait for it
Holdin my finger on the pause button, like "now go"
I guess that was the original download
Rap videos and girls digits
A fifteen pack of blank cassettes for Christmas
Used to steal mom's change if it's easy to
We used to make up names for our graffiti crew
Used to talk about makin it big
And if we ever got rich, the way we would live
Hey Mark, we ain't there yet but

Got em running round in circles for the respect
They need the gossip, but where's the logic?
Voices in the box guarantee a better product
So here I sit now, and watch em trip out
Trying to pick a finger to put upon what its about
But if there was a point, you would still avoid
You should've taught the boys and girls how to take apart their toys
I stay up-set, with all the pup-pets
Submerged in the drama 'cause they love it
That if they can hold the pain, and then they complain
Why would you chase away the sun if you don't want the rain?
I never asked for the world, just a portion
Tryin' to make a good soldier out of daddy's little orphan
But management called down, demanded that we turned the sound down
And with that, I suggest we start the count-down
Simplistic spiral and work your way backwards
'Til the bastards collapse and choke on their last words

But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
I can get a little piece with my name on it

Are you lookin' to remember or searchin' for adventure?
I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs

Her name was Stephanie something
She lived out in Richville, right off of Portland
I'm talking bout back in the ninth grade
Still had a pony tail, couldn't grow a high fade
Used to take the 5 way out to the suburbs
Waitin at the bus stop, there was my lovebird
She would get on, sit down, scoot me over
And smile with a jheri curl restin on my shoulder
And we would hit the mall together
Maybe hold each other's hand or share a Dr. Pepper
And all we ever did was kiss, no sex
But in our defense, there was never any stress

You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one

On the phone late at night when I'm supposed to be in bed
Mama doesn't know I'm talking to Lynette
I had a lot of sweet nothing to say
You could say not a whole lot of nothing has changed to this day
We was fourteen, but she had breasts
Although we was both too young for anything sexual
Just wanted her to know that she was special
She used to write me notes, do you like me, yes no?
And I don't know if it was practice for later
But both of us would break up back to spend time together
I don't ever remember trying to make her feel bad
Back then we didn't see things like that

You're number one
You're number one

There used to be a spot called the Boulevard theatre
And as a kid when a movie came out I would see it there
Sneakin in to the R-rated feature
I think I was fifteen, that's how I met Lisa
She showed up with a group of fly girls
So me and my crew was in superfly world
After the flick we all went outside
Paired off, took a walk into that night
I can't imagine that happening now
The innocence is gone and all the magic ran out
I wonder if my son will get to understand the fun
That comes from the summer with the one you call the one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one
You're number one

There used to a be a fear and a nervousness
But back then it wasn't cause of domestic disturbances
It used to just hurt your heart
But now it's not enough until it rips the universe apart
Got to see a lot of love when I was a kid
Heartbreak made me wanna die but I never did
So this is for my own babysitter
Wanted to sneak out and fall asleep by the lake with ya
Smells like candy, felt like family
For every girl that ever held me in the back seat
Used to vision being love struck with em
Till I got blindsided by these grown-up women

These headphones keep me from rememberin' (rememberin')
Also guilty of letting me not forget (also guilty)
What type of harvest will September bring? (beckoning)
Everyone to put him to that test (Somebody please kill me)
I've got a sickness, it feels like love
It's not contagious, take off the gloves
Drop your defenses, apply a coat of perfect
I'll form the sentences you try to interpret
It'd all be so simple if I was rich (But I'm not)
But I'm not so I compensate with thought (I got a lot)
I got a lot of nothin' that you need to know (Ay yo)
You would think he wasn't aware of the glow (Where'd you go?)
Swimmin' in a bottle of imposters
Losin' my ground in the name of takin' it farther
We can thumb wrestle or we can make a daughter
I thought it was supposed to get easier when you worked harder
Stole the city, I still feel helpless
Baited the hook and caught me a selfish
I'm gonna gut it, clean it, cook it, feed it to a she
And see if I can get her to need me

And now I'm standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'ma tap her on the shoulder, I'ma give her a clue
Standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue

All it takes is a stroll down the street
A pro and he greets a new soul he'd like to meet
Showed you the beating of the artery he keeps on the end of his sleeve
As he pretends he can breathe
Lend me a piece of your superiority
I feel alone on this mission, I'm wishin' there was more of me
A pair of me, apparently I'm a parasite caught inside a paradox
A paradise, a parody, the hair police have got what you need
For you to get over me and move on with Godspeed
I'd let it all go and break eggs for a livin'
If I wasn't so conditioned to just take what I'm given
Get it, got it, catch it, caught it, and lost it
Yet I can't stop it, it's embedded in my optics
Plus the frustration is a product of the gossip
If you can't walk away can you at least change the topic?
Overextended the amount of time allotted
Broke the engine, I don't know, cracked the block
Now I'm standin' at this gravel roadside festival
And I ain't tryin' to move cause this view is incredible
Standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue
Standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue

Fall in love with all of she (Fall in love with all of she)
Hasn't stopped callin' me (Hasn't stopped callin' me)
Message in a bottle (There's a message in a bottle)
And I stepped inside a pothole (I stepped inside a pothole)
Somehow forgot my name (Somehow forgot my name)
Blew out the flame (She blew out the flame)
A means to an end (A means to an end)
Can't even be friends, it's a song about a friend
She's still in my dreams (She steals all my dreams)
Angel spread your wings (Angel spread your wings)
Tryin' to comprehend (I'm still tryin' to comprehend)
Can't even be friends, it's a song about a friend

All together...(Crowd: WHOOO!)
Smile while you do that shit, you know what I'm saying?

I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand pretend you know my man
Blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game

To cold dis another's a thing that we love
So here's another one to get jealous of, do it Ja!

So push your hand up if you remember the Juice Crew
They don't make em' like they used to
This supposed to be the new school?
Your guns are aimless, songs are nameless
How long you been famous?
I claim this region two hundred-mile radius
Twin Cities' flavors Rhymesayers got the tastiest
And you can hate me, it's part of the territory
As long as you know it's impossible to ignore me
From middle fingers to hugs, tofu to the drugs
The fight's fists, might as well just take pictures of Slug
And live out your own life to the fullest
Why you starin' at my feet when you're standin' in this bullshit?
You could never learn how to ride a bike without balance
So what's the point of trying to grab the mic without talents
Go get your brakes looked at, you fucking fake hood rat
Wanna be the basement's greatest? Too late, already took that!
Father knows best, but Father knows stress
But Father needs love, a back rub, and some rest
Damn he could use a good home cooked meal
Been burnin' both ends since he broke the seal
Up, up and away, watch him take off
Give himself a little hell and quit the day job
And ignite the sunlight, tryin' to write about life
About face, break the fear, and you're here till the plight

Cats be walkin' into the spot like they own it
Wearin' a face that they should save for they opponents
With the shoelaces tied, yet too wasted to drive
Either way I've arrived to bless this place with my vibe
Yeah right, my vibe ain't even cool
I sit in the corner and drink until I slur and drool
The t-shirt says "Shoot pool, not people
Kill time, not life, grab the mic and let the beat go"
(Beat go beat go beat go)
But that's good for me
It's hard to hide a magic card when you wear a short sleeve
Force feed what I've got when they not hungry
Tryin' to replace everything that they ripped off from me
Bloat the tummy, and choke the dummy theory
Beat the point dead until these folks hear me clearly
Keep it all simple, a simplistic intricate
Rebuild the robots with bigger tits and little fists
Repo man, a world full of slow jams
Grab the prize and clutch it tight with both hands
Why go to serve tall talk?
Anyone that calls this fall off can suck my balls off
I ain't goin' nowhere, I'm still here, right here
Same spot that I stood when you first woke up
The same guy that grabbed the mic and made your girl wanna fuck
The same MC still runnin' on an empty tank of luck
And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand, pretend you know my name
And blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game
And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Come here take my hand, pretend you know

Jimmy got shot in the parking lot...

I'm a slow typer, a so-so writer
Been the shit ever since I was an infant in diapers
And I'ma be dope, all the way to the end
From the cradle to the grave, the Pampers to the Depends
Get enough love, got enough friends
But on a regular basis, it's safe to say I've got the bends
And I didn't mean to ignore that vibe you sent
I guess my mind was probably on my rent
Oh I got my mind on my tummy, and my tummy on my mind
Some assembly required, let me run it down the line
The factory is open, time card punched
Until lunch time, it's crunch time, back to work
Fool, the first rule is to keep the verse true
Even if it hurts you, you gotta wear the pain like a stain
Respect the listener, respect the game
Because there's more to game than some dinner and fame

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug
And I'ma play this game, I just wanna say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'ma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll

Flash forward a decade later in your town
Somehow, a good number of ya'll got down
And it's solid, fresh, dope, whatever you wanna call it
Not bad for an aspiring sociopathic alcoholic
(Ahh shit) Look at Slug still rockin' the same outfit
Tryin to make the belly grow bigger than the wallet
Ay yo man, how you doing, (what?), how you been?
Just been makin' it cool to rap about love again
Not that hippie stuff, I'm talkin' 'bout that bitch that gets you nuts
Did he say bitch? Yeah I'm sorry, don't tell my baby's mommy
Speakin' of baby, when done, there'll be a crate full of albums
For my son to page through, thinking daddy was a gun
With a handful of heads that put me up
Til they had some samples from Ant, and faith in What the Fuck?
I said, still goin', still maintainin'
Still standing in the land of snow and purple rain
And I'm still waitin for my date to kiss me or slap me
Cause there ain't no way that I can be happy, when I'm happy

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams

And I'ma play this game, I just wanna say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'ma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll
I've had the pleasure of speaking with some of you
Yeah you, come on now, don't act like you don't know who I'm talking to
After that show, when you approached me like you know me
The CD I sold you, the secrets that you told me
On that world you vision, through the layers of tears
The ones you choke and keep hidden when the players are near
I watch you chase it with beer, some frustration and fear
Try to figure out why the hell I came here
Well I don't know either, and I'm not ready to take a breather, neither
All I know is I'm still a believer
So you can beat me up, or you can beat me off
Pick a side, any side, and let me do my job, come on
If you've got a lot of love to give, but you don't know who to give it to
I'ma turn out the lights of the cigarette, and write a song about you
This one's for you

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug
And I'ma play this game, I just wanna say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'ma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll

Individually wrapped, placed in neat little rows
Becoming a piece of everything that grows
Some numbers, a name, to indicate you played the game
Came empty handed and left the same
A soul is a soul and a shell is a shell
The border in between is full of everything you felt
Some cling to a cross 'cause they're tired and lost
They leave it up to the weather to measure the cost
And every time I look within I recognize the darkness
Familiar to the image of the artist
Staring at the bathroom mirror in a stranger's apartment
Can't remember her name, don't remember how I got here
But here I am, thinking about death again
Humbles out the stress, helps the breath get in
I need to check my friends as well as my next of kin
To let 'em all know I love 'em all until the end
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream "Love your life!"
You might also likeLove your life, quite cliché, but I guess that's me
A ball of pop culture with some arms and feet
As discreet as I've tried to keep the drama and cancer
It's no secret that I hunger for someone to feed the answers
I never expected a bowl of cherries
I'm just a Virgo trying to find my own version of the Virgin Mary
And when I let them carry me to a cemetery
I wanna be buried with a pocket full of clarity

Now, how many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
How many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius

Let no tears to fall from none of y'all
Just remember it all, the beauty as well as the flaws
L-O-V-E L-I-F-E
Here lies Sean, finally free
And as I look across the sea, I smile at the sun
While it feeds the weeds, the nutrition they need
The people still breathe, the city still bleeds
I'mma love it to death and keep planting my seeds
I'mma love it to death and keep an eye on the seeds
I'll be in love till I'm dead, I keep reaching the seeds
I'll give all I got left just to teach you to read
Love life to the death and keep planting my seeds
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream (Love your life)

Now, how many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
How many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius

Atmosphere, and maybe you don't like us
But of all the stars in the sky, believe we're one of the brightest
My life is as trife as your favorite rap record
And I'm possessed with that insight that enables me to laugh better
From the last letter back to the 'A', from around my way
Out of the wrapping paper without the fucking holiday
Can't never be captured, they can toy with my shell
But only after they walk a mile backwards through b-boy hell
From here on out the sun rises at noon thirty
And it ain't quit pressing till the whole f-ing room heard me
Soon the birdy will fly with or without the wings
As straight as the equator, as nosy as the owl sings
Let the poppers pop, let the breakers break
Make the DJs and the assholes and all the rappers snakes
And most graff writers are weirdos nowadays
So I hang out with myself and a rafter and a belt
Every chapter that I happen to skim
Appears if it must've been written by me or the brothers Grimm
And the moral to the story comes equipped with a sting
Once again I'm picked for the wrong fucking team (fucking team)

And I'm filling your mouth with the keys to my soul

And the bricks weigh more then they led you to believe
Remember never let nobody lead you to believe
September was the first time I had to breathe
So I learned to hate harvest, thought it had a trick up its sleeve
Not fucking with the Joneses, I guess that I been jonesing so much
Nothing gets noticed but the mess

And we know how to make some music
And the music ain't supposed to stand still
And little bit of, you know little bits of Negro
Into the music isn't enough
Music is all consuming, let me tell you...

You should have stuck with the original plan: To be a little man
Should have kept it simple, before the shit hit the fan
Give the kid a nipple cause he sucks
Take the microphone from his fist he doesn't know how to clutch
You wanna treat it like a playground?
Well we can joke about your take down
And let your pride get hurt when I tug on your skirt
Like "Shut the fuck up! Professionals are tryin' to work."
And to the people that don't feel us: Fuck em'
Don't need em', can't see em', never leave em', never loved em'
Stuff em' full of dick till the hole rips
And let em' know that's what they get for that ho shit
"Oh my goodness, Sluggo went and flipped his style
I haven't really heard him act like this in a while"
Bullshit! Still broke and I still fake the smile
Blow ahead and download my dick to a file
Yo, you heard Slug sing his songs about women
Like he must be a weakling, I know I can fuck with him
For those who wanna ride, come on, climb aboard
I'mma be an asshole for as long as I'm ignored
So either call my bluff or turn the volume up
And make noise for the women that swallow stuff
And put your hands up if you feel the music

From the fifth floor I schedule my meeting with the moon
Stress, let it go so it don't completely consume
When the vegetables bite back, and the grass starts to sting
I yell up to heaven to get me the hell out of this dream
I fell out of my stream of self-consciousness
And I got welts on my mind to signify all my accomplishments
No matter whose math you use to count the dead
Progress will never rest, in the hand that has no head
Bought my brain a cane and asked it to be my pimp
You know, to make sure I don't get stuck up in my fuck ups
A little overanxious I was, to bust nuts
And find the answers making love
Out of a canvas full of touch-ups
I dip my brush into the what I've wept for
And wonder out loud as I can, how long I've slept for
I should rob a pet store, let the dogs wild
I should close all the schools just to make the kids smile
Seize the limit, let the sky be the moment
Put the key to the ignition, I'ma ride these donuts
And when it breaks, lock the door, walk away
Won't be nothin' else to talk about, nothin' else to say

I'm just waitin' for the moment I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
I'm just waitin' for the moment I can break away

So there's no surprises, written off as evil
I sleep next to women that I don't deserve
They like to hurt my pride, while I work their nerves
Once upon a time, it was worth it
When the urges get fed and the purpose finds a path to the surface
Is respect considered a breakfast food?
I'm guilty of the type of attitude that wrecks your mood
The truth can be pain, and I hate to do it
Either face the music, or get away from me stupid
Super glue it down, now it better not move
See I'm not the best, but I'm in the top two
And I'm not that friendly, when this cup is empty
It's a side effect from trying to find the fucks that sent me
See I didn't just happen, I was made this way
By the same egomaniac that paved this way

See I'm just waitin' for the moment, I can break away
The only reason that I stay, so I can save the day
I'm just waitin' for the moment, I can break away

See I gave up lying, but I still tiptoe
I'm as stubborn as they come, and I'm known to hit low
If I had a chisel, I would carve out a hole
For me to hide in every time the mighty wind blows
Since no one knows where the hell we gonna go
I'ma stand right here, until the end of the show
I'ma clap my hands, so don't pass the chance
To unsnap my pants, get on my lap and dance
No longer am I mad about the things I don't have
All I'm living for is love and laughs
The last starfighter's weapons were rendered useless
So we pulled the scissors and cut the cord to end this music
Music (fades out) (fades in and out again)

I do believe in monsters, I call them officers
I know enough to know to keep an eye on how I talk to them
Some of y'all are peace, but even one too many
Is still a decent number for the breeding of a beast
With no release, she keeps and teaches no remorse
More resembling of a thief than a horse
Plans long range, attached to some fangs
And an arm that's strong, watch the song when they change
Nothing's strange, cause you know before you saw it
It's all the same, there ain't no such thing as flawless
But all I want is a little more security
A little more safety, a lot less uncertainty
Override the circuitry, the sun is your guide
Recognize the urgency, uncover your eyes
When I turn on the lights, she vanishes, hides
But I can feel here essence in the air
Acknowledge the night stalker and regard her as a hunter
Count the amount she takes from the slumber
Summer ain't as hot as you would think
Martyr the child that wears the target for the teeth to sink

This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
This world is a vampire, she eats her kids

This country's a vampire, she eats her kids

She lurks in the alleys with the wrong reality
Allegiance, honor, keep it all in the family
Consumes the young, blind, deaf, and the dumb
Drains the vein and puts them under the thumb
She's on the television, celebrate status quo
Energy, push mute on the remote control
Break the beats, shatter the measure to pieces
All I've left is the breath and the will to prove the thesis
It's difficult to figure out who to fear
Gettin' older by the minute, younger by the year
Will the hunger disappear, metabolism slow
World domination is the goal
Now let's gather the kids, and take em' out to the sticks
Teach em' all how to live, come take my hand and walk with me
Before the vampires lock down the Twin Cities

This world is a vampire, she eats her kids

This city's a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge
Through the mud of the evening she trudges
The name, the blood is tainted with traces of loveless
From up above, truth watches in bewilderment
Contemplating how he isn't really feeling it
Just another chapter of another moving picture
Another after thought looking for a new elixir
But if she goes even when she has to climb
Out the window, out of sight, out of mind
Look out for me below because I've never been on top of nothin'
Other than a stove inside a pot of water bubblin'
And boilin' between a puzzle and poison
Two games in the same toy bin
But when my times comes you better beat the drums
And aim the guns at the ones that eat the young
If we let her, she'll do whatever it takes to survive
You don't stop till you take her life

This world is a vampire, she eats her kids
Let's hide the bodies under the bridge

And this is for those that still drink malt liquor
Put the poison in your body just to pass out quicker
When death calls best believe it's gonna get all
Emotional cause I ain't goin to hell without my menthols
Damn cable TV got me trapped in
Girls acting dumb and cops beating black men
Overfill, overkill, tryin to deal
Call the toll free and order my some diet pills, aight?
Got me looking at the sugar in the Kool-Aid that you made
You need to chase it down with some toothpaste
Still stuck to the simple things
Yep, the struggle in between a couple of Krispy Kremes
I have to ask if you could pass that half in half
To get my coffee back on track
Big ups to all the carbonated hiccups
The energy drinks and the suicide big gulps
Gonna find happiness in the fast food
Supersize, a triple bypass heart attack too
Distract you with these colorful tattoos
To cover up the fact that we feel like bad news

Uh, we love the things that hate us
Push snooze again girl, I don't want to wake up
America the beautiful, that's how she played us
Wasn't that cute, it must have been her make up
Tryin to grab everything that she gave us
Just take it back in the math on that pay stub

This is for the needles you shared
Cause them after school TV specials is too square
Cook the coke for your own consumption

Got lost between the mustard and the hot sauce
Unprotected sex with that one you just met

She found the exit to get out that department store
She reached full sprint when she hit the parking lot
She didn't see police, not even any rent-a-cops
She ran across the street and went behind the Applebee's
From there she could see those abandoned factories
Figured there's a good place for her to hide away
Knowing she could climb inside through the fire escape
At this point, still felt like a dream
In her head she could still hear the little kid's screams
Leaning up against the dumpster to find some breath
She could hear the sirens, now it's time to step
Running through the alleyway, now relentless
Bobbing in between houses, hopping fences
Only two more blocks 'till the overpass
The adrenaline is rendering a panic attack
Maybe she should go back and explain it all
Maybe the best thing to do now is take that fall
Ain't no way that they won't understand
Daddy's little girl is never gonna hurt again
She can't believe that she's having this dilemma
Tryna find a reason that she shouldn't go surrender
She's a kid and a first time offender
Plus he had it coming, hell is colder in December
Decided she would make it to the vacant warehouse
From there she could try to get her head to clear out
She needs a minute to sit and think
Some time to reflect on these events and let 'em sink
You might also likeThere's the building, it's empty she hopes to God

Little Pat, the fuck was that?
I won't lie little homie, they opened up doors for me

Your family physician is a dope man
That new prescription got you open
Came a long way from visions of spirits
Now we getting lifted off the cough syrups
I saw up close how fucked up coke was
So I was always too neurotic for the powder narcotics
Huh, but I'm a pot head, functional alcoholic
I don't binge though, I understand the logic
I like hash but that shit's always hidden
And I've never seen peyote here in my jurisdiction
Never used a needle but I know 'bout the sweats
'Cause I'm addicted to coffee, cigarettes, probably sex
Ecstasy is too damn strong for me
And the intensity lasts too long for me
Plus I figure I don't need any buzz
To make me any more needy than I already was
Huh, and to be real I don't trust them pills

Yeah, a little feminine motherfucker
Used to be scared of the football, yeah man

Wait dog, you can't possibly be
Even thirteen, what you doing open this late?
Ain't got no older brothers to hold you in place?
Yeah I know, you gotta get your hustle on
And life does go on and fronts like nothing's wrong
State law says you're too young to work
But a couple of bucks will put a gun up under your shirt
Coke, weed, junk and speed

Chemistry, economics, math and business
Already a pimp before high school's finished
Even the rich kids get in the mix
Only difference is them bitches did it for kicks
And we quick to say it's just a game that's dealt

We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes

The movies and the music taught me how to do it
And how to build a crew, and how to get it moving
Supply and demand came and held my hand

Only had a pistol 'cause they had a pistol
Cocked that hammer and blowed them missiles
I only had a handful of minutes
So if we gon' talk then we only talk business
Now tell me what you want from me
I got a few females, you need some company
Because y'all don't be where those junkies be
But hold up now, you gon' pull your guns on me?
Nah man, I'm a big kid with big dreams
You gon' treat me like you know that I'm only sixteen
Huh, well fuck it right? Shut my eyesight
Only squeezed out a couple and I only got double life

They always know
They always know
They always know
She left that town
Because nobody there really cared whether or not she kept around
All they care about is which people slept around
They pay no mind to who really held it down
It's like high school for grown ups
It's no wonder everyone you know is so nuts
Ex-boyfriendships with benefits
Whiskey binges and stimulated sedatives
Sky-high on the floor of your closet
Thinking 'bout life and how it tastes like garbage
It's time to get gone away from this town
Seems still wants to blame her surroundings
Got a grudge and a pocket of neurotic love
Played a perfect game but forgot what the object was
Where's the book that the answers are sketched in?
Life lessons, all types of questions
Sick of being misled and lied to
They all want to get inside you, they get inside you
It's enough right, to make you want to just die
Shhh, cry yourself to sleep on that bus ride

No wait, a tea, make it a good green tea

7:30 AM, alerted to life by a song on the radio
The evening is over
Another morning, another opportunity
To do something progressive, to prove that he's worthy
Up and out the door by 9 O'clock
The sun is shining up and down the block
This children in the corner, waiting for a bus
That will take them to school and exploit their trust
He starts the car, sparks with one crank
It's those good ol' fashioned American mechanics
And even though he'd rather own a new import
It's dependable and more important, it's all he can afford
Stops by the coffee shop to pick up some smokes, and a cup of Joe
(No, wait make it a tea, a good green tea)
Back into the Ford with the windows rolled up
So when the radio rocks, he can sing along freely
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
At the top of his lungs, the words burst through shameless
Pushing that dream, trying to beat the time
Oh well, whatever, nevermind
Nothing else matters when you're knifing through traffic
Wishing it was a stick shift, it's an automatic
Listening to the road, voice of the nomad
How he'd love to leave, drive away never go back
Wheels keep on turning, turning, turning and turning
Alone is when he finally feels like a person
Light another Nat Sherman
Crack the window, feel the wind blow
Serenity tenfold
God bless whoever invented sunglasses
And while you're at save the saints that work the fast food drive-thrus
Objects are closer than they appear
Cause when you're by yourself there ain't one else to lie to
Talk radio gets a lot of play in his vehicle
It teaches him topics to discuss with real people
So, when he stops to get gas or hit that coffee shop
His neurotic ass can act like he knows a whole lot
Pour some sugar on me, my counterfeit personality
He's a loner Dottie, he's a rebel
He's gonna drive the escort to the middle of that meadow
Thinking about how he could leave this city
Fill the tank and towards the water, he'll flee
Maybe he should just go get a pitcher at the CC
Find a stool at the bar where he can stare at the TV
Either way, tomorrow will be just like today
And that's all it takes to make the change
He loves to drive more than he loves being alive
And this town doesn't even know his real name

White noise, made its way into my life
It should all get cancelled
I don't think I can handle you going channel to channel
A million channels, nothing channelled
Bunch of reality shows full of assholes
All the popular situation comedy
Caught up in the oxymoronic hypocrisy
On the couch with remote on search
Seen better acting on them shopping networks
I'd like put my foot through the glass
But without it I would have to shoot smack to relax
Every A.M. starts to a cartoon
Watch it in the afternoon and see the people argue
Prime time television is worse though

Program a nation of clones
Subliminal seeds, watch 'em grow

And now she spends mother's day sitting in her kitchen
Looking at the pictures of her past felt surreal
She had a couple of people, some friends that helped her heal
But days like today, she doesn't want to be a bother
And as far as she's concerned, them boys didn't have a father
Nuh uh, she had to teach 'em the ways
Teach 'em how to behave, be brave and even how to shave
Some days it makes her feel like a soldier
And other times it makes her feel like a failure
Why did the stronger one die from a cold, huh?
Why did the smarter one end up in jail? Nah
She gave them boys everything that she could
Two full-time jobs to keep 'em in a good neighborhood
They understood how to love and how to live
Now she doesn't understand how it comes down to this
Maybe she should go work in her yard
And take her mind off the past and try to let the days start
But she's waiting on one of those annual calls
While she's looking at the photos on her hallway walls
His big sibling died and mom's by herself
And now he spends every day inside of that cell
Looking at the photos of his past makes him crash
So he never takes 'em out that folder under his mattress
Days like today he doesn't think about what happened, no
Still gotta call mommy, wish her a happy one
Uh huh, mom, if only she'd had been around
Maybe big brother would still be living now
You might also likeSome days it makes him feel like a traitor
And other times it makes him feel like a martyr

Seems like he blames her more than his father
She was gone all the time at work
Never around to play the part of the police or the nurse
She understood how things fall apart
So why'd she let the nest hit the ground this hard?
Well, maybe he should go walk in the yard
And take his mind off the past and try to let the days start
'Cause it's so difficult to admit it's his fault

...All your funny friends, the ones who have shitty jobs

, perhaps in the Decepticon era
Like seven or eight grades up from fitting blocks together
Graf kids after school to get chased by rival letters
And skate boards and truck cars and rails
Funny shapes of grip tape
I own a Mark Rogowski, I rode it goofy footed
Sicker, I learned to ollie on Colt .45 malt liquor
And that's it, to me it got not any more acrobatic
We would pedal around Manhattan, for lack of better action
One kid is the point man at Pakistani bodega
He sold those loosey Camel Unfiltered to under-agers
Smoke 'em on the promenade, water balloons drop
Hit car, run from cops, skate quick
Basically loaf on the low 
On the laugh with dangerous, nearly vacation
Under the Brooklyn Bridge, across the Brooklyn Banks, show up uninvited
Some kids are drinking beer tonight they're excited
Brooklyn Tech., Brooklyn Friends
Stuyvesant plus rich kids, thug wannabes, and hippie chicks on some escapist shit
We felt the separate fashions and cliques trading places
We formed our own section comprised of Nike Uptowns
Worn on mediocre skaters, it's like this:
Yo, this kid Ivan made the trek from Roose Island
From plastic cup of Cold Duck and a relaxed social environment
He jetted from his section when the meat heads started whylin'
His aesthetic wasn't their style, so they used bats to re-design it

Carried barely half the pleasure of a pack of Newports?

Would've been better linked to preparin' me for the weather
Rocking my t-shirt that reads "Whatever"
All in an effort to relieve the pressure

This wood is cheap, and now fire's back in style
If I had better teeth, I would try to crack a smile
Well, here I am, Mr. Typical
Ridiculously meticulous when painting pictures of pitiful
And little did I know and less did I care

In the afterlife I hope the AC works
So while I wait well I'mma pass out and taste this curb
And she attacked with flirts, smacked my nerves
Wearin' that black skirt
Got my nature so hard it made my back hurt
I cracked a smirk cause I was dumb and drunk
She gave wink and a smile and dropped a quarter in my cup
Man, people are kind of odd so I keep my eyebrow raised
I only hear the words for what they mean, know what I mean?
And I do believe in God cause I keep comin' across all these fine women
With low self esteem, you know what I mean?
I got attention deficit, I've got the bedroom eyes
I've the storms in my head, I've got my telephone voice
I've got to make a decision of whether I live or die
I'd rather just run cause either way it's one hell of a choice

My car is like my own personal universe
She's my drug and it only takes twelve bucks to fill 'er up
But in my galaxy there ain't no room for Earth
So I'm leavin' it cause I can feel the oil pressure building up
Turning over the ignition of my solar system
Check the gauges, push in the tape, put my foot on the brake
Shift existence, light my cigarette
And take it state to state until I crash into my fate

I wish this car had cruise control, so I could rest my legs
I've got this itch to prove my soul, and test my fate
Doing hunny in a sixty five, got stopped by a copper
Caught, spotted, and radared by a chopper
Wisconsin-style, over the limit by forty miles
Watch me smile, cause I ain't been around here for a long while
Grabbed my paper, gave her thanks, have a nice day
Yo, word of advice, trade the doughnuts in and gets some rice cakes
Back to my travels, running from my shadows
Some hitchhikers and bikers honkin' the horn, harrasin' the cattle
Hair back sticking to the seat, sweat drippin' from the heat
Diggin' through a cooler of brew, I'm looking for something to eat
Yo, there's a Hardee's at the next stop
Don't wanna, but I need ta'
Cuz I'm craving something to chase the taste of this tequila
(Uhh, yeah, you guys got value meals? can you put some barbecue
Sauce... I wanna honey bun. change that shit. I want chicken pebbles
No, onion bun, onion bun. onion rings. extra pork. word up. can you

90 east towards Chicago, on my way to Cincinnati
I won't ever let 'em catch me, and I won't ever make 'em happy
Hide your wives and your daughters when I'm passin' through the
Hometown, casting lines into the water, catching goldfish out your bowl now
And I'm as cool as the cat that came to school just for lunch
I'm the rebel pissin' in the public pool, just for fun
I speed in the sun, everyone is speakin' in tongues
Find the talk radio station, yo, turn it up so it bumps
Don't cry, girl, I'm out and I'm a make my way east
Cause everyone in my world is takin' my peace
I need release, and I don't think I'm a find it in between your legs
Yo, I'm just joking, only going to the corner to get some eggs
So when she starts makin' the coffee I toss my bags in the back seat
And I can remember it all like it must have happened last week
Sometimes I stop to think, for all the money I've spent
How I'd rather live in a tent than bust my ass and pay the rent
But I'm eager to pay my dues, and I'd be glad to pay the tollbooth
And I've agreed to sing the blues ever since the day I broke loose
Just like a blindfolded child walking through the toy store

And yesterday was like today
Woke up, got up, near eleven o'clock
Butt naked except I was wearing my socks
And that's cool, cause most the time this floor is cold
Stand up and stretch look around this mess
My place has been a cave since she left me
Make my way to the kitchen, start the coffee
Then dip to the bathroom, begin the triple-s
And wash the previous evening off me
Now out the shower, get dry, shove a q-tip in my ear
Well, what do we have here?
It appears as if a piece of me has got motivation
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little morning masturbation
Fresh, dressed like fifty cents
Clean and awake now I'm ready to commence
Spark up the caffeine and nicotine binge
And that's pretty much the pattern of how the day begins
And I write for an hour, maybe half hour more
Then I put on my shoes and grab my key for the door
Put my headphones on for this world I ignore
Trek down the street towards the record store
"Hey, bro - how you doing, anything new today?"
"Nah man, how you been? it's the same old same again"
Well, then I'll be gone, friend, I'll see you around
And I'm out, destination uptown
In the summertime the women wear a lot of skin
And if I sit in one spot I can take 'em all in
Sometimes I even talk, to see if I can make one grin
If not, yo, it's cool I ain't gonna take it personally
From Anne Landers, to Ani DiFranco to Orphan Annie
I love all women, but most of 'em just can't stand me
I don't know, maybe it's my hair or clothes
"...or maybe she noticed that you was diggin in your nose..."
Either way it's okay, I wasn't tryin' to get laid
I just wanted to say "I hope you have a great day"
And then she stopped with a smile that began to blush
"Here, take my number, call me up, I'll come over and make you lunch"
I got up and headed down towards the book store
To check the titles, that my man Michael's got me lookin' for
My visit was short, cause I just couldn't feel
That cat behind the counter actin' like I'm here to steal
So I dipped back out into a cloud of tattoos
Pierced body parts and colorful hairdos
And I questioned, did Babylon resemble this?
Are we getting any closer to the end of the list?
A sensuous kiss, placed on apoco-lips
We teach them how to make a fist, but not to resist
And I'm wondering how'd we find this position
But people are people and I still love 'em, especially the women
Onwards to the coffee shop, maybe Muddies(?) for a refill and some
Sociological studies
See the junkies, while they co-exist with the sobers
All the bugging of eyeballs, the shrugging of shoulders
And that's when I saw her, sippin' a water
I wanna kiss her mom just for having this daughter
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to come across strong
But I've been waitin' a while and you've been taking too long
And she smiled and I began to blush
She asked if I'd like to go to the bathroom and make some love
And I got visions of us, and the mirror getting steamed
And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream

Woke up, got up, near eleven o'clock
Butt naked except I was wearing my socks
And that's cool, cause most the time this floor is cold
Stand up and stretch and look for my soul
In tomorrow I see no promise
And yesterday was like today
In tomorrow I see no promise
And yesterday was like today
In tomorrow I see no promise
And yesterday was like today

It's the theme of where we're goin')

See the police man, notice the lonely man
How do you think he keeps his head on straight?
Can you feel his rhythm? What do you think he visions
When he squints at the line from behind those shades
Feel the summer's crest, overdressed
So much sweat, his skin begins to chafe
It's the surface wet, the nervous mess
Overbearing and jaded from carrying the weight
Irritated and constipated
And its all covered, player hated, funneled and consolidated
Into the shell of one man with a gun
Riding that thin line between the program and the sun
And I don't hate you, I'm trying to relate to
Wishing you could find a trap door to escape through
But if I see you as a threat to my seedling or my sibling
I'll die to pull the plug on your machine

And I just might just find somebody
And I just might just love somebody
And I just might just feel somebody
And I just might just kill somebody

Can you see her?
She spends her whole day in a theater
Living her time in the life that she would prefer
And she stirs nothing, comes and goes she wishes
Surroundings oblivious to her whole existence
But if they only knew
About the thoughts that she can't seem to stop from coming through
Coming across
At a loss for dialogue
Walking through the fog
With her eyes closed and her mind gone
And now she lives in the films that she sees
And daydreams that she kills us repeatedly
I'm impressed with the tolerance she brandishes
If it was me, I would snapped from the sheer overanxiousness
I'm waiting for the day she strolls through Muddy Waters
And slaughters sons and daughters and bloodies mothers and fathers
Lovely little case study castaway cutie
Masturbating in back of that matinee movie
And someday, one day, when the credits roll
She'll hold a pocket full of gunplay for the ignorant souls
Then we'll know to what death awake touch the sleep
Make me walk the thin line between shallow and deep end

And I just might just find somebody
And I just might just love somebody
And I just might just feel somebody
And I just might just kill somebody (myself)
He used to write his rhymes and recite his lines all the time
Sometimes he'd make them up right off the top of his mind
After doing shows for years, getting respect from peers
Killed the ego, looking at these people like they're weird
Road trips, turned into head trips
Became a hunger for sedatives and eccentric etiquette
Optimism needs to feed off self-esteem
But it seems that he doesn't see it, hasn't felt a thing
Records sell well, but still underground
Travels town to town
Holding hands with fans that love his sound
When it comes around let's hope he can enjoy it
Don't slow down momentum, afraid he might destroy it
When he stops to shake the hand, I doubt they understand
That here now stands only the shadow of a man
Having a hard time with life on a drumroll
Walking that high-wire, passing it off as humble
But it's a thin line, between screams and smiles
Seen the miles, wishing he can go home and read to his child
But tonight's the last day, put the butt in the ashtray
Locked the door and slit both wrists backstage

(What's your name fool?)
Rappers stepping to me, they wanna get some
But most of them should go and try to boost their monthly income
Speaking over beats is the only time I feel complete
I don't hear the weak and I don't fear defeat
So what you got?
Connect the dots, I'll raise the pot
Remove the blood clot from the brain of hip hop
The name remains in tip-top shape
I'm still the wack rapper scapegoat, in the aim of their hate
I came in late, took a chair in the rear
But my classmates were unaware how long I'd really been there
My peers have been held back for years, holding back the tears
Everybody knows our name like we was the cast from "Cheers"
So here's to the good times, tonight is mighty special
So fasten your seatbelts, cause I'm gonna launch this vessel
Ain't gonna land until I'm bigger than Espo
And bigger than ecstasy and bigger than techno
:
I wanna bigger than Jesus and bigger than wrestling
Bigger than the Beatles and bigger than breast implants
I'm gonna be the biggest thing to hit these little kids
Bigger than guns, bigger than cigarettes
You might also likeA few years ago an ex-girl of mine
Asked me to keep her name out of my rhymes
So I said this rhyme that I'm about to say
It came from the heart and it went this way:
Go to hell girl, you make me sick!
I hope your new boyfriend gets cancer in his dick
What the fuck makes you think I'd put your name on my record?
Yeah, now I feel a lot better
You know what?
I ain't drank a forty since I became old enough to drink
Not caught up in what the fuck these people think
Cause when I die they're gonna find the missing link
But tonight I'm gonna vomit in the kitchen sink
I'm suprised more of y'all don't get hit by cars
Missing your surroundings, staring at the stars
I'm lonely without a woman that wants to spar
That's why I spent so much time in these bars
Drunk poolside, screaming, "Do or die!"
Looking at the water asking, "Who am I?"
Saw my reflection, Yes! I'm super fly!
And as you can guess again, I'm too damn high

(What'd they say to you?)
But they said, "Drop dead."
I can't, I got a lot left
More than just another arrogant, asshole pot-head
In the top ten, who you love to hear on tracks
Smiling for the camera while I surf upon your ear wax
This beers flat and she kisses like a stripper
I'm coming to terms with my status as a drifter
Girl, I'm only in this town for one night
And these neon lights are keeping me distracted from my plight
I feel like a legend on a leash
Making an effort to break every piece that I can reach
Yeah, I got something to say, and even more to teach
But first let me scrape these feces from my cleats
Standing on the roof, complaining to the moon
The only time I tell the truth is when I'm naked in my bedroom
Soon I'm gonna reap the harvest of my struggles
But from now on, y'all can call me Sluggo

Bigger than Jesus
Bigger than wrestling
Bigger than the Beatles
Bigger than breast implants

Bigger than guns, bigger than cigarettes3Embed

Six, Six, Six in the mornin' and I'm takin' a nap
In the back of the car, waitin' for the stars to snap
The stars on my cap remind me of the time
We went to Fargo, with a car full of anxiety
An angel's breast, and a tank top
She started at my heart, she's trying to make it stop
And if I haven't learned nothin' then I've learned a lot
Mama had a baby and his head popped off
Give it up turn it loose, for the sake of life
If I knew now what I knew then i'd make her my wife
I been chasin' these mics for too long
Debating with God bout who's right and who's wrong
Got a new song to sing, a little happier, hurtin'
That I didn't learn the words until after
The fact of the matter is a matter of fact, I doubt that
I'll ever even try, to work it out to having her back
Use to skip classes, now I skip breakfast
Never skip practice and I need to flip the mattress
To help me forget the kiss, the lips, the soft
Mama had a baby and his head popped off

Mama had a baby and his head popped off
We did all that we could to try and re-attach it
I couldn't do it so I picked it up and threw it
Off the building, just to see if all the children
Were quick enough to catch it

So I'll tear down these walls, let the chips fall
Let's all go outside and play a game of kick ball
Laugh a little, and live a lot
She squeals and giggles when I hit that spot
If you give me a minute and I can finish my beer
And move a tad bit closer to the limits of here
And when it gets clear, and the sun comes back
We can drive too fast, we can fly off the tracks
Tuck in your shirt, hike up your skirt
Welcome to the jungle where the tigers give birth
I only took my time because she looked so fine
And it makes me crazy trying to pay em no mind
You should save your spine and stay on the struggle
Shoot the trouble and keep the temper subtle
My rent just doubled, because they took my roommate
And I'm keepin' these movies cause they all past the due date
Close, cover, before striking
Lick a missile at the bird and try to cripple it's right wing
And I end every sentence with a dot-dot-dot
Mama had a baby and his head popped off


Say out loud, we must network
Should have been, more specific
Now have this, daily pressure
Some of them, just don't get it
Leave me at, the beginning
Start over and do it well
Shut my trap, stop complaining
Stay sober and step on shells
My oh my, yours oh yours (oh yours, oh yours)
And when it snows it pours
And when I'm running out of fire I just open the doors
And go sit on the porch and watch the neighborhood wars
But I've got the sun, and I've got my son
And I've got my will to run until I'm dead and done
And this is for the love we found and the love we lost
Mama had a baby and his head popped off

You'd better find a way, you'd better do it soon
It's like the middle of May and you've only got 'til June
And if I'm forced to watch you touch that torch to that spoon
Even one more time, I swear to God I'm gonna implode
Sky's too high to hold; too thick to pet
So fold up your two-bits and hide 'em in your wallet
In your pocket full of trauma, in love notes you wrote to the angels
Gathered around the pole, crude and star-strangled
The banter; married in the bed made from propaganda
I've roamed the avenues of humility
And I've kept a toothbrush in the glove compartment
Next to the napkins
For when I'm finally privileged and touched with a permanent address
And I'll be relaxed after this gin and tonic
And I'll bless your track after the impact of a comet
And I'll pay the mortgage after I'm finished paying homage
I promise, consider it accomplished!
For every cigarette butt that's tryin' to climb out of my ashtray
Signifies another phase in this cascade
The great mind, great migraine
We think it's difficult enough to just live, much less gain
Well I put my two bucks on the table just like the sign says
Proceeded to ask God to give me one good reason why we shouldn't perish
She says as careless as we are, unstable as we seem
"Selected few of y'all have found something to cherish."
I countered that, maybe just to be argumentative, I don't know
But I was like "Yo, can't we spare the ones that are worth it?"
She's like "No. I need the comparisons."
I think she could tell by the way I'm responding that I'm getting a little nervous
So I went far left and just said thank you
Thank you for the time, for the mind
For the breath, for the flesh
Thank you for the quest, thank you for the vision
This vision that spawns anxiety trying to see and feel why I'm living
Time is money, every moment is costly
So I ration emotion because existence exhausts me
Oddly enough, I'm happy I ain't famous
Imagine waking up to the fact that you're simply entertainment
I bet god thinks you're amusingYou might also likeEmbed

Hey yo Spawn, what you doing?

I sever heads just to sharpen my skills
Zoom in on brains like a John Carpenter kill
Surprise, that's the element, your confidence is delicate
Never recuperates, I leave you mute and celibate
Break the victim down to a jelly consistency
The brain twisted spits, now tell me who gets with me
I felt they were listening and the smell of fear amps me
Sweet tooth, room full of candy wrappers, I get antsy
Mission activated, attention captivated
Vocals ring bring the so-called king on stage assassinated
You're nice, where you from?
That's the question I ask
Distraction got struck pull their heart out their ass
The blast is nuclear, when the crew appears
So seek shelter, the only helpful advice
Is that you should steer clear of the exits
I take reps and make messes
Broken, when the spot closes we're off to breakfast
Invested breath, skills, adrenaline
Refill the gut then to my hut to build with the pen again
From Hennepin to Lexington the first section conquered
Laid seeds in the soil, peep the props and honor

Take an emcee, stuff him between some bread, cheese and lunch meat
It's just a snack, rely on Ant to thrust a track
Into the mind as I slip behind the whack and crush his back
Must react, if we don't we have no work
So I stomp them, let his team remove remains up off the astroturf
Now who's eager to be made a believer?
It wakes the dead when I shake a rival's head until his teeth hurt
Knee jerk, when I yank your brain into a fever
And melt the weak channels in your receiver

Bust a stance and crush your plans

If you didn't hear it you're gonna hear it right now."]

Bam, the doorway opened for me
I saw ways and told the story
Raw daydreams of holding glory
Junior high hallway kings
Locking, Bagging MCs
Beat boxing, breaking Zulu Nation wannabees
It didn't take long to see who would stay strong
High school came upon, some B-Boys put their gang bangs on
But some kept on doing, stepped on to ruin
Others that were pursuing the same shit we thought we ruled in
But what a surprise: the passion for being the best
Puts a quest for allies to rest
Dead in the Midwest where heads is just a handful
In a land of gangstas
Players, replacements, priests, banjos
We scramble to break MCs that may appreciate it
Guided by their envy, insecurity, and their hatred
Separated by the "gimmie props" technique
And the desire to be the tops this week
I gotta floss the speak
Cause talk is cheap, even the broke kids can afford it
That's why I stand close and if you're dope then I'm supportive
But if not: we'll keep the mic warm
For the next one, respect the artform
And make your wishes on the stars born

Within the movement
Fact checking, trying to completely avoid all channels of backstepping
From the lines of painted concrete
That reside on Lake Street
To the way we close our eyes to sleep
And drift through Deep Space 9 type shit
To find this
I've been around for as long as sound
I've been to that not-so-fresh phase
And to that not-quite-that-serious state
But I've evolved, metamorphed manifestate

I used to be young, dumb and full of vision
Like it was religious rituals
I made initial decisions
I wanted to be a rapper world renowned
From Minneap to the Bronx
Capture girls and crowns
Snap, tackle and stomp
That's when I found
The abyss that sits in-between the one that holds the mic and those that don't even listen
Formed some crews, rocked talent shows at schools
Saturdays on the 18 making my way down to the record pool
I met a grip of people that was bullshit
Was down with a lot of people that was bullshit
But I'll pull shit from the asshole of an angel before I let him hassle and strangle
The love triangle between me the mic and the turntable
Went to studios, we want to make demos
We want to do shows and rock our own instrumentals
Do our own production, fucking around with this kid Kazir
Nitwit engineer, barely knew his own equipment
Atmosphere, the prefix was "Urban"
Wrecked shows, made friends, made foes
Overall, we made flows
And right now as I sit here, right now, writing this
I'm bugging off the people in my life that made me like this
Within the movement
Fact checkin'
Tryin' to completely avoid all channels of backsteppin'
From the lines of painted concrete
That reside on Franklin Ave
To the dead bird on the elevator
To that short in your crossfader
I never got lost later
For efforts to pester
Just throw your hands up in the air like a leper
I've been to that not-so-fresh phase
And to that not-quite-that-serious state
Metamorph and manifestate

Well sometimes it rings and I don't answer it
That's it, no asterisk
No thirst to find the circumstances
It was planted in me deep
It was nurtured and it grew
Gave it sleep and nutrition
It was efficient, let it through
There's a few that have developed to where I let them in my spectrum
For the rest of 'em, I give them just enough to cause infection
Not tripping on attention
But if you have it, it's welcome
Open arms, potent charm
I know the words and I can spell them
Seldom is it, when one inquisits
Do they leave with disinterest
In fact most begin crave the visits
Bringin' me to the table
That's it, no more no less
The love, the life, the stress
Slug, the mic, the mess
Testing. Yes, I've been tested and I've tested some
Not saying I'm the best
Believe I'm not like the rest of 'em
Just saying I'm better than you
That's my mind state my rhymes take me into
When I check one two, I guess some do get pissed
But intentions were to inspire
Build the empire before I get tired
The ones that tear me down don't know it
But they're the same ones that built me
Now quietly in your head say, "Yes you can feel me."

When I first landed the damage was outlandish
Anguish, anxiousness, and taking it for granted
But when I first landed, I was so relieved, I lost my focus
Soon exceeded recommended dosages
Now I hold the crib that holds the soul that holds the poet skills
Exclusive: it leaves illusions of unfocused flows
I don't suppose you're taking too much time
Breaking too much mind trying to unravel the babble
That dismantled and left the lines in need of some assembly
So I can find the secret key and free all the emcees
This planet spins on a thin axis
All-access passes won't help you to grasp the Atmos
I mean, what did you think
My agenda was to freestyle, smile, get paid to smoke weed
And grab the mic and spoonfeed?
There's more to this than just paying the rent
If you're riding on this song you need to ride it to the end

What could you say as the Earth gets further and further away?
Planets as small as balls of clay

Some shells get broke
Some keep their wigs closed
Some get exposed as little man big pose
Some make moves and some stay daydreamers
But everbody seems to want some loot, food and a beemer
Well make mine hunter green with camel insides
10 percent tints, Mr. Pibb, and some french fries
Inch by inch I take it closer to the shoulder
But day by day it's getting harder to stay sober
Once again on the edge, head's inebriated
Movement needs motive, it's easier to be sedated
What makes me mighty and another tiny?
Why does my psyche give a damn about whether or not you like me?
If this crime's right I might be wrong
I grip this mic tight because it's all I really have a grip on
So let the losers lose and let the players play
The only difference is the day to some dust on the clay, what

Whose world is that? it ain't mine, and I'm grateful

Too many get caught up in the lines that emcees thought up
But it's clear to me the ones that fear me are the ones that oughta
I spot a blemish on your planet's existence
I deliver subtle terror submerged in clever sentences
Instantly pissin' away the misfits
The only residue that came of the hypothetical spew they sprayed
When they swayed I'd have 'em
Half of 'em can't fathom where the maths from
My man Beyond knows, tou can ask him
At last, when we get down to it
There's more than sand and fluid
Involved in how I revolve and evolve
Can we solve the secrets? No
Can we take trinkets? No
So when the ink hits it's more than just a sequenced flow
I can't bring it with so I'm a leave me here
Centuries from now they're gonna study Atmosphere
Carefully I steer, I'm aware life is fatal
When I go, I wanna go like hope, taken by the Plato

I woke up on the wrong side of my head
Converts the day into search for awake until I go to bed
I drove up, but misplaced the directions they learned
Ignored the arrows and the signs
Just follow the sense
I don't know whether or not you can comprehend
Levers and knobs got stripped and that was just within the launch of it
They found me in up to my neck
All they saw was this head floatin' on top the ocean
It didn't stop the motion
They kept goin'
Perfect, didn't recognize Slug
Or the effects he'd have when he disrupts the class
Mission bound, twisting around my realm of lost
Cash is expensive, I think I can smell the cost
Decomposion, something died right behind that wall
TV gave me all I needed
It only took a phone call
Pay by the minute
85 percents a second coming
All over the breasts of she who left the water running
Flood the basement, drown the MCs and centipedes
Filed complaints, civil suits and try to sue the sidle tendencies
Energy drained, drain plugged -- hence the flood
Find the fault line, shift plate, take blame off of Slug

Right now, we gonna get together and give you a tune
That we had a lot of requests for...

I never gave props to emcees who don't deserve it
Never smoked rocks, never had guts to serve it
Never had a Glock, never seemed to be worth it
Never had I thought life was gonna be perfect
Never hit the chicks unless I have a jimmy hat
Never leave the crib unless I have my shit intact
Never do I say a rhyme unless the beat is fat
Best believe that, never will the Spawn come wack
I never went to court, never had to serve trial
Never went to jail, had no records on file
Never disrespect, never treat my friends wild
Cause I never had real friends till now

So this goes to those
Who be supporting at the shows
And this goes to those
Who's always working on they flows
And this goes to those
Who use music intake to escape
Finding love and happiness inside a mix-tape
And this goes to those
Whose criticism is constructive
And this goes to those
Who lyrically we just can't fuck with
And this goes to those
Whose love is so strong
You can shut your eyes and see them when you listen to they songs
This goes to those
Who eat and sleep with turntables
This goes to those
Who say "Fuck the major labels"
And this goes to those
Who, unsigned and dead broke
Can still make a name before they even make a demo
This goes to those
Who keep the freight trains lit up
And this goes to those
Who roam the night just to get up
And this goes to those
Who tag and paint walls with aerosol
Lost city crew, from Minneap to St. Paul
This goes to those
Who flip the b-boy acrobatics
And this goes to those
Who put the ball in the baskets

Atmosphere: Up-there lyrical unit
That leaves the average emcee confused like a eunuch
Nonetheless: That's how I often change the subject
Second guess: That's what they all do to Slug's shit
Ironic: Most kids pale in comparison to my phonics
So come inhale some embarrassment
Roller-coaster: A metaphor for my delivery
Overdose: Results of having battle tendencies
Activated: Every time its my turn to rip
But "masturbated" means that you finally came to grip
So reality must mean: guns, bitches, and weed
Cause salary is what comes from: guns, bitches, and weed
Integrity means you're in pain cause you're in love
Collectively means that none of y'all could fuck with Slug
It's like that, never the wack, an actual fact
It's like act transglobal and local, so hold me back
It's like damn aimless, tenseness, wandering
It's a struggle, between what you can give and what you want to

Right now2Embed
I'm sparked, waiting for the dark to hit
'Cause once the moon gets above my apartment
I catch fits for starting shit
I'm smart with it, I give it that special touch when I push it
'Cause I'm also a label rep, and I can't allow no bullshit
So shush kid, shush baby! Shut your eyes
Lay your head back, shed the fear and let the tears crystallize
I wish the flies to land upon your forehead
When I extract the essence from your head
And leave your body resting Moorhead
I left more dead reputations than HIV can
But for every killing there's a reason and it's not just MC's, man!
I'm watching C-SPAN, waiting for the first state rep
To take the first step, to have to kill off to make this world perfect
Well lets get shit right, right here! Right now! Right away!
Atmosphere motherfucker! If I need to I could fly away
I'll grind you and your weak crew into beef stew
Serve you with seafood
You can't cloud my vision cuz you're see-through

You need to recognize the size of the Atmos
You ain't as tall as half this - Madness- past what you practice
RSE you can't fuck with my tactics, you bastard
Thats why you breath fast bitch - no need to ask

We dug the fingernails underneath the skin of your scalp, then peeled it
Sent your underdeveloped pre-school style on a field trip
Now bite your tongue, this is how the mic gets stung
A whole tree to pick some fruit from, man! You had to choose the ripest one

That said it all, it comes from inside, and how you ride
The sound wire when it's live and the vibes feelin right
Catchin' the motion given by rhythms when you hit 'em on time
With lines, makin' sure your rhyme soundin' tight
Your voice should travel without the babble of the average emcee
So listen please use discretion when you breath
Sound is vibration, I choose to use it with a vision
And then comes the style and precision...

No more longer will we hold your hands, Why? Cause you're too damn old
Oh yea, the network called, they told me to tell ya you've been cancelled
They also said big up for all the support
Thanks to your devotion, they now control the world
So let your hair down and eat the poison with a tall glass of Tang
I'm rising past the bank, with the smile I flash my fangs
I tumble over some 'cause some I don't over stand
I got the plot from Spawn, from now on I know the plan
It's the noise it makes, that generates the passion I have
It's the void it breaks, that stimulates when mics get grabbed
It takes shape - escapes from these vocal chords I have
Atmosphere: music makers from the Rhymesayers lab

Come now, who fi me gwan test the giants when we apply this
Vice grips to your eyelids to make you read the fine print
The tyrants that gave you crisis, left you silenced
Don't breath a sigh of relief 'til you hear the rescue sirens

Supreme, be this team, we got this shit on lock
RSE we hid the key under an upscale rock
So you could knock all you want to but you ain't gettin' in
Now you can try to crash the door but you ain't gettin' in
Nigga, what! My definition is raw, I got you all
Wishin' I'd fall, so things could get better for y'all
But I'm tall, and got game, remain the same for the duration
Area code 6-1-2, my present location...

Atmosphere...embellished with talent and the wisdom not to abuse it
Blessed with insight, friends and influences
That's what keeps us dope, what makes us dope is the surroundings
Inspiration stems from love and stress compounding
Stamina: that's achieved over the course of time
In fact, time taught me how to breath, battle, not to court my mind
Defined as lyricist - the Atmosphericist
Makin' sure y'all fear this hit every time you hear this shit
 Sound is vibration
 This sound is taken
 Sound is vibration
 And the ground is shaken
 Vibration is sound
 Yo, we found your replacement
 Vibration is sound

Yo this is dedicated to this girl that I dated
Complicated maze, complicated maze

At first sighting, only a stranger to my eyes, couldn't keep them off me
I'm sure your friend recognized, I didn't care, I had to stare, stood there at attention
Not many words mentioned still I felt the thought connection, wanted the sex then
Got to know you, wanted more, Things got complex when
You had a man and wasn't sure
My thoughts were pure, Is it gonna be him? Or is gonna be me?
Cause that's the way I have to have it
Grasped the idea, Ms scribble head Talia
Wanted you to feature but your man is screwing up the procedure
What is it that you say? I'm on your mind all day
But still say you're content, how the situation lay
Why you play? Why do you stay? There's something better
Know you felt it when you received my first poetic letter
Why you fronting? Tell me something
Is it that you want your cake and stuff it down your face too?
Did I have to chase you?
Why oh why do you cry?
Said afraid of losing me? I think that you're confusing me a lot
No wait a minute, stop, bring that back, I missed a page
Was it that time of the month or were you going through a phase?

Miss Merriweather, the partial, the martial artist of fake imitation love products
Now facing you is irritation
Know you used to have me placing you on pedestals like a goddess
Personality changes it seemed to be to me you were the oddest
Soon to depart us like red seas by Moses
Our friendship's diseased, unfeasible, hopeless
No reasonable answers to my question of focus, Caused my tension
Nothing made sense when you replied with a tied tongue
Said you feared abusiveness, I never swung
Why all these excuses miss? What have I done?
Figured I had the right kind of lady, yeah maybe it was fun, for you
But not for me, I found it quite unamusing
You were using me as a bridge just to pass what was left behind
Play times for dangerous minds, but why'd it have to be mine?
Why'd it have to be mine?

Now I'm not really trying to come off abrasive
But why you messing with my man's head?
I mean I'm spending time trying to keep his mind on rhymes and beats
And you're a distraction. I mean you got my man just shook
I mean honestly, I guess what I'm trying to say is...

Virgin torn from sleep, the newborn
( Why are you doing this? See you're always playing games)
And it was easy to get too deep, the water was lukewarm
Virgin torn from sleep, the newborn
( Oh, what now? What? You wanna come back?)
And it was easy to get too deep, the water was lukewarm

Do you know what today is?
It's the third anniversary, you came back to flirt with me
For certain, you must mistake me for a fool
See I know how you are, I see those tricks in you
Tried to make amends, there's something new
Had problems with your friend, so it's me you always run to
Come to and smell the coffee, go drink the pot with extra caffeine
Cause next to acting, you win awards for cloudy vision
Tired of fishing for the what, why and when
Will this repetition end, step away and give me oxygen
Not interested in talking, say nothing, keep walking, go 'bout your away
See the colors of these areas have started turning gray
See you later, goodnight, got no more candles to light
Yo, it's time to move along cause baby something isn't right
Still I'm glad I met you, it's too bad you screwed it up
The only thing I regret is that I didn't get to f-

It's the caffeine, the nicotine, the milligrams of tar
It's my habitat, it needs to be cleaned, it's my car
It's the fast talk they use to abuse and feed my brain
It's the cat box, it needs to be changed, it's the pain
It's women, it's the plight for power, it's government
It's the way you're given knowledge, slow with thought control and subtle hints
It's rubbing it, it's itching it, it's applying cream
It's the foreigners sightseeing with high beams, it's in my dreams
It's the monsters that I conjure, it's the marijuana
It's embarrassment, displacement, it's where I wander
It's my genre, it's Madonna's videos
It's game shows, it's cheap liquor, blunts, and bumper stickers with rainbows
It's angels, demons, gods, it's the white devils
It's the monitors, the soundman, it's the motherfucking mic levels
It's gas fumes, fast food, Tommy Hil', and mommy's pill
Columbia House Music Club, designer drugs, and rhyming thugs
It's bloods, crips, fives, six
It's stick up kids
It's Christian conservative terrorists, it's porno flicks
It's the east coast, no it's the west coast
It's public schools, it's asbestos
It's mentholated, it's techno
It's sleep, life, and death
It's speed, coke, and meth
It's hay fever, pain relievers, oral sex, and smoker's breath
It stretches for as far as the eye can see

It's in the streets, every city and everywhere you go
In every man it's the insanity, the fantasy, the casualties
It's the health care system, it's welfare victims
It's assault weapons, it's television religion, and it's false lessons
It's cops, police, pigs with badges, guns, and sticks
It's harassment and a complex you carry when you're running shit
It's wondering if you get to eat, it's the heat
It's the winter, the weather
It's herpes, and it's forever
It's the virus that takes the lives of the weak and the strong
It's the drama that keeps on between me and my seed's mom
It's that need to speak long, it's that hunger for attention
It's the wack, who attack songs of redemption
It's prevention, It's the first solution
It's loose, it's out for retribution
It's mental pollution, and public execution
It's the nails that keep my hands and feet to these boards
It's the part time job that governs what you can afford
It's the fear, it's the fake
It's clear it can make time stop
And leave you stranded in the year of the snake
It's the dollar, yen, pound, it's all denominations
It's hourly wages for your professional observations
It's on your face and it's in your eyes
It's everything you be
Cause it ain't me, motherfucker, cause it ain't me, uh

I think her ponytail's a little too tight
Because she's alone walking with me in this moonlight
Tonight she fits in my palm
The storm isn't anywhere close to calm
Look, I've gone and captured the mortal
Put my face to hers clutched her by the torso
And when the lips touched I inhaled
Didn't matter that she hadn't been kissed much
It's such a shame some have a name
And everyone becomes the same
Can't help but adore each one he's torn
From the pores of the face of the earth's core
This is ones more difficult than the last one
This one had an open window she could ask him
If someday he'll be the one to come and save her
Take her away before she takes her away

Take her away to where she didn't need to go
Life fast, bleed slow
Will he ever know the power of speak
Wouldn't be what it was if the prey wasn't weak

Take a peak into the way I seek
The water for the creek
The daughter of the speak
Slaughter of the meak
The Godly technique
The monster marches to a different beat
She don't love herself no more
Won't be nobody elses whore
No one like him spoke before
Now he's gonna take her to see the seashore
There you can stare at the waves
Be brave, take your place, you're safe
Slowly he traces her face with an index fingertip full of hate
Love 'em and leave 'em, love 'em or they leave you
Some see the glow but some glow is see through
As life leaves her body, sometimes he screams: "Me too !"
All he ever wanted was to teach you to reach you
Death is the cousin of sleep
Just close your eyes count sheep and breathe deep
Think about the sound of relief that surrounds you
You were already gone before I found you

"Got to change my way of living
Got to change my style"

He remembers little bit of his childhood
Sometimes bad, sometimes good
But he never was one to blame today's grey sky on last week's rain
So he see's everything face value
Looks grim, it tastes bad too
There's nothing to do except dupe, push down the wall to get through
I swear to god it's too stretched
Too easy to slip or lose steps
And the taller you are, the harder you fall
That's why a lot of us crawl
Momma, please don't look now
I've gotta walk over people I've took down
It ain't as pretty as you probably think
It's gonna take more than soap and a sink
Tomorrow he'll drink to the guilt of
Every cheap wooden bridge that he's built
Bury those skeletons in his head
Til you pick him up and carry him to bed

They said the sky was limit free
No, don't trust none of these people
Won't give him enough to love me for me
So even when they welcome me into their kingdom
Can't bring self to believe them
It goes, faux pas tryna act like no flaw
Turn it up til it burns that stove top
Mr. Know It All, bad boy showoffs
Red lights, no stops
Momma, this can't be the boy you raised me to be
The drama, depression
Afraid that it must be the Daley in me that's crazy
Carry me home - take care of your baby

Don't wanna live like that, no
Don't wanna live like that, no2Embed
Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have

Nobody want to struggle at home
Bass in his voice, trouble in her tone
What kind of couple makes a puzzle out of stone?
Chopping and popping all of the bubbles that are blown
Nobody want to be wrong
And once the line gets drawn across what we disagree upon
It could be the time bomb that we sleep on
It's just a little one, back and forth like a ping pong
Nobody wants an argument
You try to bargain as a friend
But it's hard to with a star offence against a smart defence
And the history you share is full of scars and dents
Nobody likes breaking up
When you hate the situation but you crave the touch
You might stay in the relationship for the simple sake of it
Because you know it's based in love

Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have
You might also like
Nobody want to go to work
For some older jerk that doesn't know the dirt
That's embedded in the hearts of those that hurt
Monday through Friday, and Saturdays for bonus perks
Nobody befriends beast
Just to make ends meet and try to pay rent and eat
Spread sheets by the end of the week
He'd rather spread them sheets than try to get some sleep
Nobody want to lift a crate
That ain't living great, you want a kid and play
You should dip, escape, no two week notification
Show up late and quit today
Nobody wants an awful boss
That got you popping out the top of your mouth as if it's common talk
You ought to wait until you off the clock
And appreciate that fact that you've got a job

Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have

But somebody want that life you got
They think your boyfriend's nice or your wife is hot
They on your block looking at that home you bought
They'd move in today if that door wasn't locked
Nowadays you ought to watch your spot
Even with all the flaws of that boss you mock
You could still close your eyes and toss a rock
I bet you'd hit someone that'd love to cop your job
That's what I thought, of course you don't stop
You won't take the shot, you can't afford the loss
If you don't want to taste the sauce
Then put the plate down and take a walk
Drop, or move away from the pot
Cause every time you talk you complain a lot
Don't forget to count the balls y'all caught
Enjoy what you got before it all falls off
Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track

Hey Daley, Get the fuck away from my sister you punk motherfucker
(intro) I do... I do... I do...
Hey whassup, can I kiss the bitch yet?... I do...
First of all bitch, I never promised I'd be rich
So fuck you and your wishes, ya need to do the dishes
And change the damn cat litter
I thought I told you to get rid of that crazy cat last week
Yo, don't you get sassy with me missy
Because I'll go upside you quickly
But yo, she's kinda sneaky when I sleep she'll probably stick me
But it be a threat, and threats make her respond
She probably grew up watching pops beat her mom
Until the break-a-dawn
I could pop shit, talk shit, hostage to herself
Because there ain't no where to walk; this is the middle of hell
You've got no job, no diploma
Might as well kick it with me and live in Hinckley, Minnesota
She's my trailer park chick
With the pop tarts and venison hard liquor to cop a buzz
Off the over the counter medicine
The rent is in the mail
Bitch pump the keg
Fix the antenna, act your age and spread your legs
It's my CAS-STLE, white trash ho
And if I want to I'll put it in your asshole
You wanna battle baby? I'll put a shadow over your sky
Now shut the fuck up and fix me turkey pot pie

Everything she'll ever need to know she learned from Oprah
You what the hell she's gonna do for you?
That bitch is stuck too
Get off my phone, tell her I said what up, and muthafuck you
And tell daddy if he wants some
To bring his drunk ass on
I beat that fat bastard with a cast on
Ay yo honey I'm trippin
But why you always flippin
Dress slutty everytime that we go drinkin with my buddies
Won't be long before you carrying my puppies
Speaking of which you bleeding yet bitch?
Cause you gettin kind of chubby
Yo, where the hell'd you put my stash?
Better tell me quick fast or catch a foot in the ass
Oh no, you did not smoke all of my pot
If my remmington was out the pawn shop, you'd get shot
Stop, and put that knife back in the sink
Baby, Baby, Baby, why you fucking trying to take me to the brink?
What you think?
Quit thinking and pretending that you're smart
Happily ever after 'til death do us part
I own the camaro and the mobile home, so where the fuck you gonna go?

I had a rough day, but that's life, it happens
Woke up on a dark side of my mattress
I guess I forgot to set my clock
Overslept, almost lost the job
Then to top it off, I'm kinda hungry
But can't eat till I find my money
It's in my wallet but my wallet ain't in my pocket
Can't remember the last time I saw it
And they don't want me in a bad mood
Afraid that it'll spread and everyone will catch an attitude
They got 'em all singing the same tune
Thinking I should go and start a fire in the break room
Co-workers make me sick
And the manager really ain't shit
But I can't quit, so I'm hiding in the basement
Holding onto to my face like fuck this place

Daughter found it and had a panic attack
Plus you ain't had sex in how long?
Afraid to admit that the fire's all gone

Yeah, I saw the sign in the window, for the job
Yeah I got a high school education, but that's all
Skills? You wanna know if I got some skills?
Yeah I got some skills
This goes out to all my friends

What you gonna be when you grown up?
I'm all grown up and still don't know what
I mop throw-up, I rock a tow-truck
Long as it means that I can get old and post up
I used to be a typical winner
Living off the gratuity from delivering your dinner
Cause as a kid, I didn't consider
That I would get the opportunity to be a full-time spitter
I love this occupation
I got bosses across the nation
Validation is an understatement
And I don't really know how to take a vacation
My kind don't have any free time
I'm so distracted, but everything's fine
I speak shine and I read signs
Appreciate your opinion but this dream's mine
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell a cowboy what to do
I was the ugly kid that didn't listen
Little big man full of ambition
Based on imagination, just like you
Daydreaming, thinking bout the things I might do
I used to paint, draw and illustrate
Mom would facilitate and it would feel okay
Seems like yesterday still plays a part
When I grow up, I wanted a job making art
Picture that, how many years old?
Young enough to mix up love with career goals
But I was just this tall when they told me
That the world was mine, but the papers weren't signed
There's no deed, so proceed to go seed
Up the whole piece like it owes me groceries
Don't breathe until you formally know me
Won't leave? Better call authorities
It's all love, we're cool
But you don't tell an astronaut what to do
The turntables stole my heart
Burnt the paintbrush, broke it apart
I miss it, I might revisit
But I wasn't that good, I admit it, maybe you can't tell
But as a kid, I wanted to be Melle Mel
And later as a teenager I wanted to be LL
Then I discovered weed and I wanted to be Del
But thank God eventually I found myself
It's funny when I bump into fools
I used to go to school with, and they ask what I'm doing
Half of the time I want to crack a lie
But fuck it, I'm still a wannabe rapper guy
Hahaha, yeah I guess that it seems that way
I get to see the world, and it's decent pay
As long as somebody want to see us play
I wake up every morning and I seize the day

You all alone with your empty chest
So bury the bones with any regrets
And keep those skeletons piled in stacks
Just drink your medicine, don't bite your glass
I tried to make a difference
But the only thing that changed was I gave you distance

No crime to take a little too much
Got time to drink away a few months
Got a little cocaine habit
But he says he only does it if somebody else has it

Go do that shit, do that shit, lady
She went vegetarian for the baby
Third trimester, I see the kid kick
She showed me outside when she gave me a cigarette
Shit, there's no way to measure it
Not every pony grows up to be a Pegasus
Ya gotta let people be hypocrites
Count your blessin's and mind yo business

Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust
Runnin' in place, sun in my face
Let me fly 'way, Heaven won't wait
Stuck with yourself like the rest of us

It's like that's the only way to love this life on Earth
It's like everyone takes number one in the race
'Cause we all keep runnin' in place
Here kitty kitty, can't train that fox
Must be drinkin' that name brand scotch
All of us cut from the same damn cloth
Some of us never cut the price tags off

She ended up on the pole
With her heels pointin' at her Jesus she used to know
Stripped her down to her naked body
We made her drown in a lake full of patriarchy
In between the pride and the misery
With the infinite supply of sympathy
Are these invisible walls that hold me
Like this goldfish bowl is the whole sea
Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust
Runnin' in place, sun in my face

So he learned early on how to switch into low key
Little person, observant and accurate
Grew the skills to argue and the passion to back it with
Kick over the blocks just to rebuild 'em
His mom and pop used to pop, sound familiar?
Daddy had to leave, but Mama kept hurtin'
So he stepped up to help be an anchor and a burden
And right around the same time
Started noticin' girls, but they wouldn't pay him any mind
And if they ever did, he got nervous
You shoulda seen him practice on his hand for his first kiss
Even though he was too young to hunt and gather
Hungry puppy had to learn how to front and swagger
It didn't matter, it was all self-esteem
At sixteen, you only needed one on your team
And mom and dad was never getting back together
So he was on some "We gonna make it last forever"
Basically married right out of high school
Five years of gettin' high and fightin' at a drive-thru
And when he hit twenty-one, they made a son
But on his twenty-second birthday, their relationship was done
Now he's got a best friend instead of a wife
But he feels like he stole the best years of her life
You might also likeAfter that, it was one codependent to the next
A lotta love, a lotta hate and a little bit of great sex
Self-learning in between the self-loathing
Strangled in a cycle, can't feel yourself choking
Some of them would overlap, some of them would double-back
None of 'em deserved to be exposed to all the trouble
That he posed, strike one? Not even out of fear
He don't even do rough sex, you bite him and he's outta here
Make no mistake he puts the man in manipulate
And he's attracted to the women that reciprocate
Y'all can kick karma till it's gettin' late
Until mama's little drama is the topic of the big debate
And now a days the confidence is off the page
'Cause women are attracted to that clown on the stage
He's only in town for a handful of hours
But Rapunzel wanna come down and dance in the flowers
Wanna make her smile? Wanna make her laugh?
Wanna make up for the mistakes in the past?
Wanna act like he doesn't know better
If payback's a bitch, he'll be in debt forever
Insecure, impatient
Temporary gratification, self-validation
That's what it's made of it's all true
And it's the only reason that he's even talkin' to you
Who?
You can try to fix my broken wings
You can know all the words to the songs I sing
But you don't need to know what's wrong with me
Unless you think you gonna come home with me

Woke up to that familiar feeling
Staring at a unfamiliar ceiling
Still got your jeans on but you're topless
Headache and the stomach feels nauseous
Grab your shirt off the bedroom floor
And try to recollect the night before
How'd you get from the bar to this mattress?
And when you got here then what happened?
And where's the who that lives here
In this house wanna figure out how'd you get here
But the thought got cut by nature
Find the bathroom, the gut got anger
Here it comes can't avoid it
Ain't the first time throwing up in this strange toilet
Anyone else would leave
But you you crawled back to the bed and fell back asleep

All we need is because
Come and party with us
Take care of you when you're passed out
Right there with you in your glass house
All we need is because
Come and party with us
Take care of you when you're passed out
Right there with you in your glass house
You might also like
Woke up all alone with no friends
But you had to throw up again
Choke up the tears and the spit
Grab some tissue to wipe off your lips
And everything still spins
And then the chills begin
And then the "God please kill me right now" hits
And you still don't know whose house this is
In between left over dry-heaves
You're trying to check out your time piece
And you should call your job
But first got to turn this hangover off
You dream that it's just a dream
Until the phone in your pocket starts to scream
Shut it down, don't wanna hear a sound
Heavy as the head that wears that crown, now

All we need is because
Come and party with us
Take care of you when you're passed out
Right there with you in your glass house
All we need is because
Come and party with us
Take care of you when you're passed out
Right there with you in your glass house
Hangover ain't a strong enough word
It don't describe what just occurred
Looking at a phone full of missed calls
Probably all the people that you pissed off
Everything seems so sour
So you forced yourself into the shower
Standing up brings out the stars
And the whole bathroom smells just like a dive bar
Can't do it, better sit
And let the tub be the catcher's mitt
Lay down, face down
Thank god whoever lives here ain't around
Now what you need is silence
And you don't want no one to see you like this
Maybe you don't recognize it
But this is your home, this is where your life lives

All we need is because
Come and party with us
Take care of you when you're passed out
Right there with you in your glass house
All we need is because
Come and party with us
Take care of you when you're passed out
Right there with you in your glass house2Embed
This is for all those tricks and hoes
From the five-star rooms down to skid row
Whether you answer phones or dance on poles
Big money escort or broke on a stroll
He don't care about your stats or background
He ain't picky once he puts his mac down
Make you suck it all the way to the ass now
Cause all of y'all heifers are cash cows
And at first it was just a little game
Had no idea that he was fucking with your brains
When he was around you seemed mature
He helped you calm down and feel secure (sure)
He'd go get them when they still just kids
Give them some gifts, get on they lips
Before they even get a chance to get hips
Skinny pimp turned it down to a trick real quick

Fly trick

Going pay all day
But won't ever get away

Every time you need a little bit of "help you out"
Ain't no kitten gonna play that sharp
Shake you down, make his mark
Take you down, break your heart
And don't give a damn for anything that came apart
Some try anything to leave him
Seen some even put themselves in treatment
Some get away but still gotta keep looking over they shoulder forever
That ain't freedom
Take his tax makes you love it
Same old trap, but ain't you above it?
He'll beat your ass in public
Now suck that skinny white pimp dick, suck it

Don't forget to pay up to: your pimp
Get that money, give it here
He'll keep a bitch in that stable for 50 years
He ain't scared of the law or the cops
Got them paid off, some kind of trade off
Gonna stay in the pocket
As long as the money stays long and the hands stay strong
It's like you don't know a kid
He's right there in your clothes and hair
You never gonna let him in your home
I can smell his breath on this microphone
Your lips taste like his dick
I can always tell when he's been in your whip
You just one of a million, trick

A city full of people and my favorite is that waitress
And she treats me like some type of common vagrant
I see her every day, but there's nothing to say
Unless I decide to step inside of that cafe
I only get to sit if I buy something to eat
Otherwise it's best to keep my feet moving down that street
And god damn she's a hard bitch
Talks at me like I'm the bad dog that got into the garbage
Yeah I know that the toilet is for customers
You ain't got to tangle up the strings to make this puppet work
It doesn't have to be a game of patty cake
But it ain't like you don't know I sleep in that alleyway
And by the way, I can see it in your eyes
You're angry with your life, not a stranger to the fight
I bet you hate every man that you date
And you're probably addicted to all types of escape
You take it out on me that you're all alone
When you know you got your own closet full of hollow bones
Watch the tone when you speak to old folks
I'm grown, just trying to get out of this Minnesota cold

Look lady, I'm homeless, I'm crazy
I'm so hopeless I'm suicidal daily
If you and I can't co-exist, let's fake it
'Cause I ain't got the energy it takes for this relationship

I'm waiting for a city bus to flatten me
And transport me to the ever after happily
Maybe reincarnated with luck
Come back to Earth as a cockroach in your tip cup
She said she's had it up to here
She's gonna call authorities if I don't disappear
I love her threats, it rejuvenates my breath
I give her stress for the reaction that it gets
I got a pocket full of panhandled money
On a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun
In front of everyone she calls me bum
But she notices my absence on them afternoons I don't come
So here I am, thorn in her hip
Holding down the corner table all morning with some corn chips
Ignoring the insults and evil eyes
I feed off of 'em, I wonder when she'll realize
That she's the only reason I visit
The only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence
And if my ship ever comes, I'll miss it
Because I'm getting old and I ain't got much left to give it
So there it is and I have to live with it
I had the chance to make a difference, but I didn't
In the cafe bathroom drinking free tap water
Thinking: "Damn, I should've been a better father to my daughter"7Embed
Ain't no color paint gonna cover the stains
The pictures on the wall will all remain
And even though he's home now, sound and safe
Surrounded by the faces that he place his faith
The images visit from the past he witnessed
Can't stay away from the memories
Sticks with each detail, embedded in stone
Like he chisels those convictions into his bones
The progress stops and pauses
Spits and sputters like the basement faucet
And it's obvious he's lost in his regrets
You can smell it on his breath

Ain't no color paint gonna cover the stains
But now the alcohol is gonna mother the pain
Tuck it away, no complaints
Just laying on his back, in his backyard under the rain
Take tomorrow, but doesn't no how though
For every swallow there's another to follow
He weaves his way throughout the story
Looking for a new missing piece or a door key
You might also likeSpirits used to be for celebration
But now they just take him away from the hell that's waitin'
Re-up until it's three sheets up
And pick a place for the skeletons to meet up

Ain't no color paint gonna cover the stains
But if the oxygen escapes it'll smother the flames
No introduction, doesn't speak his own name
Gonna beat them demons at they own game
The sunset rides to the end slow
Same song echoing outside of the window
You can't grow if the skin don't fit you
Sometimes you gotta get low just to get through
No inspiration left to do your best when
Nobody hates you more than your reflection
Suffer the shame until it stuffs the drain
He's got two hands and a bucket of paint
Come on6Embed

You didn't even count your tips yet
But you can tell that it ain't no big step
I don't see why you're so nice
The customers are all fucks and lowlifes
But don't fight you just keep the lip stiff
And get that money it's the weekend shift
But why they all gotta be freaks?
Wish they would just eat and leave
And keep they eyes to them self
Already insecure don't need any help
And you can blame the pride
That makes you hold your anger inside

And now you never feel independant
And everything seem so hollow

Better bring it back tomorrow
Now pick up the pace
And you might make bar close
Perfect last call then some

I know a guy with a rock star life
But he still don't fly, so he's mad at the sky
He sits me down, he kicks his wisdom
He's been around, I give him a listen
Seems like he's got a lot of complaints
About how nowadays things ain't the same
Used to place some faith in the basement
A toast for this guy and those kids that he came with
Cause they all on the same shit
Based on cut down placement
Uptown stay strong
Don't ever do a dance with the devil now
That smile is a sign that you're sellin' out
Judgement, gossip, ethics
Let's just exploit all this excess
Then you can feel how he feels
To walk around town lookin' down from them tall heels
And who needs fame or fortune
When you get the same love that the famous snortin'?
A future so afraid of yours
That you strayed from the course
And you came up short
Believe he would have more credibility
If he wasn't just another drunk pill junky
It's obvious to me that he's still hungry
For the superstars a little bad lucky
Go ahead and get mad at God
Point your fingers at your dad and at Santa Claus
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Wouldn't look so bad with the bandage off

Beautiful is how we know you though
Rebel, rebel, for all your people
Until the talons of the bald eagle
Reach
Out and rip the back of your head off leaving your skull peaceful
Beautiful is how we know you though
We were all taught to root for the underdogs
One nation under God complex
No wonder we all wanna watch 'em undercover cops
Beautiful is how we know you though
So beautiful, so upset
Came from a place that bred success
So shame on the grass on that side of the fence
Beautiful is how we know you though
Guess daddy didn't hold you enough
I ain't saying that you never had to struggle for a buck
Or some luck or some love, motherfucker join the club
Beautiful is how we know you though
Give the kid a paintbrush and a subject
Self-portrait caricature of the undead
Skeleton staring at a picture of the sunset
Beautiful is how we know you though
Misunderstood is not a birthright
The monster lost control after the first bite
Master your high life, bitch get your swerve right
Beautiful is how we know you though
It ain't new to you, ain't that unusual
And we knew you fully meant it when you drew
Your little line in the sand and chose to stand with the beautiful
Beautiful is how we know you though

I wish you well on escape from your hell

BAM!! We land at your table like dinnertime
Asinine amount of women in the ticketline
Hidden from behind the picket sign
Switch the design and reposition the shine
Subdue what they knew thrown askew
Cut through with the focus of a "fuck you"
Frozen moments. Grown up, made work
Open up the doorway, sewn up, pay dirt
Everybody wants to party
Full belly; still suckin on the parsley
Star sleeps between the hard sheets
You only parked on the street to hear the cars beep
Pan left, pan right, damn right the econoline
Weaves through the landmines
Continues until I leave mankind
Can't find control of the wheels on the van like BAM!!
We land on your plate like a housefly
Just another face from the southside
The fall guy, all eyes on the tall small fry
While I try not to make this doll cry
What you call "fly"? what you call "fresh"
Multi-bulls-eye-sex-and-checks-and-death
I guess I'm best left for dead. And a breath that was never impressed by what's possesed
Girlfriend I need your help
Cause the head on my shoulders won't fuck itself
And homeboy, I need you as well
Cause I gotta live And I got a little bridge to sell
Gonna build a home out of syllables
Gonna be alone when the whistle blows
Cut the embyllical on the cymbals
The break'll shake your silicone when you feel it go BAM!!
(and when they started to scream, I thought of Mike Gee singin "Everything good ain't as good as it seems"
Get ripped like flesh) BAM!!

Didn't understand they were sung by birds
The sunlight burnt to disturb the earth
When the gun-fight burst occurred it goes  BAM!!
We land in your gut like hunger
Sunk your ship while you slept in the bunker
The thunder don't stop the slumber, plug in the sub
Turn it up, let the drummer go BAM!!
We land in your blood like virus
Let em digest...What stylist?
Quiet hybrid of peace of violence
I just might just cease the silence with a BAM!
We land on your head like rain drops
With a chainsaw laced in napalm
Weight loss, pill pop, chaos
Thank god the best plays are made when the game stops BAM!!
And if I gotta die, I got faith the decision was made
That I was outta line BAM!!
And if I gotta die, I'mma smile from the pile
Cause I wasn't on the bottom, I'm a man
With a child and a voice and a lovelife

And she loved me more than I could imagine
So I waited till she slept then I stepped into traffic
Ran away from the backyard to drift some more
Woke up in Texas next to a liquor store
With a woman who don't even drink alcohol
Big letters IRONY tagged on the wall
She was named for another flat land
We had it strong back then
In common we had a bond
That would never see the break of dawn
To damn afraid of the queen trying to take the pawn
Threw that away
Yes, yes headed out west
And got undressed
With the nurture that she gave me made me drip and get obsessed
There was a lady in Los Angeles
That handled this the way the manual suggest (the way the manual suggest)
She turned me on to music that I never heard before
She told me stories from a cup I haven't learned to pour
And I don't know what hurt it more
Professional journals or perpetual burn holes
Scarring up the dirty floor
Peace! Found a hollow hole in the Colorado snow
It's like I follow anywhere El Diablo go
Took a stroll with a feline
And sat silent while the snowflakes fell into the design
Can't let her dance up on the top floor
Been there done that what do you think it's locked for?
I've lost more to my traveling soul
Then I care to talk about so I'll be out, I'll be on the road
Down, down, down in Gainesville
No stranger to shame, Coltrane, and pain pills
Sometimes the ceiling's too easy to stare at
But it keeps me from a forest full of snare taps and bear traps
And it can't come clean without the sun beams
And it ain't complete without the drum beats
I can tell she don't want me
As is time to climb back into the van and make the back stiff
I had to add one more story to the infinite
Already interwoven through a New York cigarette
Ex lover and a best friend, best lover and an ex friend’ll bend
For alcoholic sentimentalism and the rhythm of
Religion on the PA
Make the people here say
God bless the DJ
She stays to wait for a replay
While I wonder if I'll be able to hear it from the freeway

There's a thin line between gossip and gospel
There's a house over there near Wicker Park
Where I found out Smart was afraid of the dark
Had to break a heart just to help me heal up
Tie a knot in the stomach just to help me seal up
And make sure them demons stay beneath the core
Pray for you and yours and whomever you believe in more
Look around you there's angels amongst us
Look around you there's angels amongst us
Sitting in the rain at some sidewalk cafe
Half of her wet cigarette in the ash tray
Trying to find a lost soul to save
And I'm a lost soul trying to find a road that's paved
Keep faith in my suitcase packed my beliefs
Angels exist, I've even seen some sleep
I love this fucking country
And she loved me more than I could imagine
So I waited till she slept then I stepped into trafficEmbed

Stop it there without a care to what you've got to fear
Keep it all between your beer and your hockey hair
A lot of weird people traits and ticks
From the strangers to these dangerous faces you kiss
You know this town ain't cool as it used to be
When the lion, tigers and bears'd stare at your jewelry
Thruthfully I'm content with how the day moves
Stepped up the game, oops, still rock the same shoes
And one-time with them flashin things, they still
There to turn the drama into action scenes
I'm renting me a vehicle to roll me to the finish line
Follow if you wanna, we'll return around dinner time
Back hurts a little bit more with every cigarette
My mack learned to never ignore the petty gibberish
I walk the clay cocky like Mr. Know-It-Also
Patiently waiting to pop, shake up the soda bottle
Horizontal like a mail-order male whore
That came forth just to show you his pale horse
Of course the ones that love him hate him most
Heart broken ain't nothin man, she look like she ate a ghost
Make a toast to the butterknife, fuck it right
Wonder when my butterfly is gonna kep her flutter tight
I get way lonely when I'm on the j-o-b
And every pretty face actin like they know me
Same story, take photos and blow me
Like suckin on my pony is some type of a fuckin trophy
Don't know what to say homie, I understand under
The notion that mine is at home under another man
Don't even give it two minutes of business
Rotate the shoulderblades and keep them chipless
Built a prison out of conjugal visits
Now I rock a fake grimace on my face to catch the kisses
A bag of pot luck, a pint of gut rot
Emcee's is mockduck tofu tough-talk
What the blood clot, jumpshot, fadeaway
Watch these white kids eat it up like it was mayonaisse
Then he's on to the next city followin the destiny
Fell asleep droolin on your left titty
Indeed I play my part and call it high art
Keepin my eye on a piece of that pie chart
Smarter than solutions to the rubix cube
Took it apart and then pulled out a tube of superglue
Electric boogaloo, instead of tryin to look at you
I should stay in my house, sit on the couch and read a book or two
Maybe then this space alien can uncover ways to coexist
With other homosapiens
Until that time comes people know my bum steelo
Incognito with mosquitos and dung beetles
It's like that, never the wack in actual fact
It's like this St Paul, Minneapolis jack
It's like that, take your head out of the vaginal crack
Like what the fuck did you expect

Suzy was a psycho, but she looked good
Little ball of fire, light it up and cook wood
She knew the power of what she had to offer
Pieces of a puzzle, personality, and posture

From big baller to the small fry
Get what you want out of life
But every night now the same thought arrives (you got a light?)
Still as lonely as the number one
Cause you only love someone
So you have someone to run from
Run, run, put your back into it Sue
Always wondered what it would be like to try to rap to you
We gotta show Suzy love
Ain't no way anyone's gonna stop before the music does

Bobby was a genius, and he would prove it
His favorite move is to make you look stupid
He knows the answer, nobody puts their hands up
When he starts talking everybody (shut up)
Bobby didn't have friends, not real ones
Just a bunch of light minded self righteous pilgrims
And they all treated Bob like the big cheese
Knowing damn well they all thought he was a "bitch please"
Blows his own horn, slaps his own bass
While everybody waits for him to fall on his face
And while he's down, someone will take his place
If the suit isn't trump even seven beats an ace
Look at Bobby, he doesn't even know
That you're supposed to set a new one after you achieve a goal
Accomplishments are just excuses to talk and spit
When you music stops, who will have a spot to sit?
Do you wanna play?
Well you don't have a choice
Stand up alive
Cause the music hasn't died yet
Do you wanna play?
Well you don't have a choice

Cause the music hasn't died yet

Bring me the head of whoever said "play fair"
I want to sit in my chair and wear a blank stare
Fuck being king of the hill
When the music dies you'll be the first one the villagers kill
Walk in circles, dizzy up the movement
Talk in circles, the underground's polluted
Lots of circles, you wonderin' where you fit
Stop the circles!
Oh-oh-oh yeah, oh-oh-oh yeah
Well you don't have a choice
Oh-oh-oh yeah
Stand up alive
Oh-oh-oh yeah
Well you don't have a choice

They want us to fight, but we just want to get high
Work all day, all night, trying to get fly
When I get some money I'mma buy me some time
I can't fight your war until I'm finished with mine

I used to be mad at the government
Redirected some of my anger towards the mothership
Trying to guess which shell living hell sleeps under
When the grand scheme plan keeps all these people wonderin
Why we still runnin in place frustrated?
Pride is mistaken for hate, it's upgraded
I got a little breath left, let's suffocate it
Point at the epiphanies and call 'em all drug related
The time I spent with my life on bent
Trying to find the friends inside my head
Must have disengaged every phase and stage
Of of my I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming of age
My unofficial autobio
Will be accompanied with tips on how to smile
Cause I've found that when they don't see you frown
They never know that you're a threat
And they don't sweat you when you came around
So who's going to be my next door savior?
Step up to your neighbor, and do me a favour
Take off the mask, let it all collapse
Empty the pack and watch your wings grow back
You might also like

Society becomes jealousy, intimacy becomes intensity
Say it with a smile like it's meant to be
And all of a sudden, "boom", American family
And I can tell when your mad at your past
Because you tend to take the turns just a little too fast
And I can tell how you push your foot on the gas
That you already knew that you was gunna finish last
Slow it down and take a little time
To look up at them clouds with the fake silver lining
Up in a tree knowing damn well you never reach the top
But you don't stop, you keep climbing
Well okay, it's settled
No more nights in this weed and thorn infested meadow
Uh-uh, from this day forth, only forward I pedal
Get the memo I'm cutting the strings Gepetto
Shuffle the cards and let's argue
Rooted in between the computer games and cartoons
Stop and watch us all get lost
Between God and a shot of scotch, let's get fly

Uh huh gon work all day work all night
Uh huh won't fight your war until Im finished with mine
Uh huh gonna forward move, gonna buy me some time
Uh huh Im cutting your strings and keeping my smile

I'm not really supposed to talk about this.....but

(They've arrived) with the excitement of a newborn
Came to join the main event and fight against the luke warm
(They've arrived) with nothing but their word and they history
Take a can of paint and try to decorate their dignity
(They've arrived) it's not what they anticipated
Fuck, it doesn't matter put your fists up and instigate it
(They've arrived) and they can't save the planet
Or the children, or the pandas, or themselves goddamn it
I'm just a man that loved rap
So much in fact I put every piece of myself inside these fucking tracks
What is that, you whisper something from the back
You think your personal attacks make up for what you lack
I'm just a cat searching for a clean lap to crash
In a world hurting, waiting for their turn to take a nap
Sorting through the bills, fan mail, and life threats
Wondering why the postman ain't delivered my wife yet
(They've arrived) they call me Sean, this is Anthony
No need to act hard cause we got extended family
So I smile while I try to use my words wise
Say what I meant, just in case this is your first time
(They've arrived) ooh child are the wings tired
Smilin' like a couple of fools that the Queen hired
(They've arrived) can't wait for the vibrate to thicken
So we can watch the world's hips gyrate
(They've arrived) even the dead's getting live
It's a little deeper, you can float, c'mon baby, dive
(They've arrived) to fall in love with this bitch
From the petals on her flower to the pimples on her tits
Fuck the insults and fuck the compliments
Just wanna see the mommy free the honesty and common sense
Stop followin' the wind that you swallow
Cause it's too simple to aim for a target sittin' on a fence
(They've arrived) we do it for the candle in the sky
Here's a toast goes out to those who can't handle their high
You and I, we can swim into the tide
And watch these other children lose they mind
(I'm doing fine)
(They've arrived) and they landed safe and sound
Better try to take em out before they make your saviors proud
(They've arrived) so fix the beef, quit actin' like a sheep
Either spit your speak or sit there and grit your teeth
(They've arrived) to spread the info to the kin folk
Fuckin with the climate on the inside of the windows
(They've arrived) they're here, the baby farmer
Gonna take it farther, make a mark and break apart your fake martyrs
Planted firm, let the planet burn
Understand the terms, you don't wanna open up this can of worms
I'm tryin' to keep my prize on the eyeball
But people wanna see you fly, all to watch the sky fall
Who's to blame for your lack of conviction
I wasn't drafted, I asked for the mission
Put your name on the list at the bottom on an empty line
And hold in plain sight whatever gave you the right to question mine
The night prowler, gonna crawl past all the rap politics
You can put that on your last dollar
Wake up, it's bigger than a pay stub
There's the door, get your money, go wash off your make-up

(They've arrived) and they don't need your lovin'
If you don't wanna give it, keep it

Nah, nah, nah, I lost my ID
I don't have it
Come on man, I come here everyday, man
You know me man
Come on man, you know me man

All she wanted was a little bit of solid
Feels like love, it doesn't matter what you call it
Heal those cuts or hide em underneath the polish
Break another promise and take me as a hostage (take me)
Hold your job down and let the zombies crowd around
Thankin' mommy's god that it's a cop's town
Keep it safe for me while I chase a fantasy
Swervin' through the galaxy, searchin' for a family
Happily surrounded by planets and stars
She was stuck uptown, you was landin' on mars
It's all fucked up now, caught your hand in the jar
Another small step back for that man at the bar (hey bartender)
Spill a little bit of blood on the street
For love that goes to those who know they drink too much
And hold your own glass up to the heavens
Take a little time and try to count the seconds

It goes, pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you now
Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you

Drink it all away, numb it down to none
Stay awake tonight and wait for the sun
You say you hate your life, you ain't the only one
Let your frustration out the gate and watch the pony run
One double, for the hunger and the struggle
Two for the fool tryin' to pull apart the puzzle
Three now I smile while I wait for your rebuttal
By the fourth shot, I'm just another child in a bubble
Tryin' to play with the passion and the placement
Just to see what these people let him get away with
Still tryin' to climb a mountain for you
Hammer in my hand, still poundin' on a screw
She don't listen so he don't speak no more
Nobody's winning cause neither is keeping score
Don't wanna think no more, just let me drink some more
Pour me another, cause I can still see the floor

Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you now
Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you
Live life tipsy, Stiff if it don't fit right with me
Kiss my whiskey, lift my lips, press to my angel
Swallow it and leave her empty bottle on the table
Let the past fall, making faces at that clock on the back wall
Countdown to the last call
Ask all these people that make sounds
"How long does it take for the pace to break down?"
Another lonely little trophy
If only I could walk a straight line, I'd make it home free
And everybody in this bar thinks they know me
And my story like "poor me" ("Yeah, pour me another, homie!")
I can count the days till you come back
Or I can follow them sun-rays down to the train tracks
I can stumble drunk over hope and love
Or I could just keep drinkin' until I sober up (hey waitress)

Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you now
Pour me another, so I could forget you now
Pour me another, so I could come let you down
Pour me another, so I can remember how
True that I am to this addiction of you
Bottles and pints, and shots and cans
Couches and floors, and drunk best friends
Models and whores, and tattooed hands
Cities and secrets and cats and vans
Good times, laughter, bad decisions
Strippers and actors, and average musicians
Mornings after and walks of shame
The bartender knows me by my real name
Sing it7Embed
See, they could try to trick you, couldn't they?
Here's something for you, make you really feel good

Little mama got a little pill to swallow
A little water to follow it down the tunnel
Gotta lotta walls but the house is hollow
Got a lot of holes, never found the shovel
Panic attack, so what's the plan of attack?
You had to be had, you cut in half, you had to react
You battle with your shadow from front to back
Stack up the stats, handle the math and that'll be that
Hold your head up, I know you're fed up
But don't let it get up to the top of them steps, love
Instead of playin' with the pieces that got messed up
Get dressed up, we goin' out to catch the best buzz
Self-medicated, spirit on elevated
Help take the self-made self-hate and celebrate it
And I could tell you hated it when you felt naked
But the poison tastes great, wanna know how the hell they made it?
And if the dizzy don't kill you, the city will
Simply for the thrill of wiping up a sticky spill
Little tricky get busy off a fifty bill
So take the little pill straight to your pretty grill

So what you drinking? So what you popping?
So what you eating? So what you dropping?
So what you smoking? So what you sniffing?
So how you coping? So what's the difference?

Contagious, it runs like the paint does
Sedate the sober and over-anxious
The pages of pain that make the songs on the playlist
The renegade rain that jumped just to flood the basements
Look honey, everybody needs a helper buddy
Nobody's drug-free, the streets would be hella bloody
Do you call yourself a patient or a junkie?
The only thing that separates is who takes your money
All smile like we're gonna go buck wild
Order up a shot, prescription filled up now
Pop another (what?) distracted by the rush while
We fight all night about what to name the love child
I'm on that go nuts life that got that gold touch
Fresh Fly Wild, Bold what like the Cold Crush
No luck, don't hold much, just an old flush
Made up of hearts, queen high off the faux-blush
Freak outs, leak out, and bleed out, and speak out
And reroute and seek out the weak crowd
And we doubt, but when I see it keep out
The beast I'll believe for now, it's all "Peace, I gotta be out"

Here it comes, there it goes again (Panic attack)

Watcha gonna do? Slam Doors? Break a glass?
Maybe pass out on the kitchen floor with your naked ass?
She still makes time to hate me, But basically
I'm overbooked no emotional vacancy
Complacency seems so simple
Like fuck it let me be the one you fight and call mister right
It's an addiction bound to stick around
Cause a junky won't bounce 'till he hits the ground (get down)
And these drugs ain't as good as we wish they were (get up)
And this buzz doesn't keep us from missin' her (get over)
And that love that built all of this emphasis
Spilled enough guilt to kill Electra and Oedipus (get out)
It's easier to leave it there, each time I see your tears
Makes me need a beer to relieve the fear
I wanna keep a clear sky and fly away like a meteor
Outta here maybe next year I'll reappear

I say hey there, we don't play fair
Can't stay here, I hope you take care
I say hey there, we don't play fair

I've got a fucking fan base that can attest to that
I'm returning this bleeding hearts club membership card
Cause I want no motherfuckin' part of it
We're just two dogs on all fours
It's a tug of war for who loves you more
Blame it on tours or locked bathroom doors
Or maybe it's cause my voice was louder than yours (what? You jealous?)
And I'll be damned if I do this for forever
Everybody lookin' at me like I don't know better
Instead I gotta run if I'm ever gonna forget her
Cause I've always been a go-getter (so whatever)

And now I got a head full of better off dead
I followed down them steps and slept in the wrong bed
If I had a breath of self-respect left
I'd set fire to the boxspring to help it catch wreck
Let these ashes represent the mattress
Director left the set but nobody told the actress
So she's still acting as if we scheduled a practice
And my soundtrack is compromising her theatrics
You remind me of me, it's not a compliment
Get your song on
Who you tryin' to be?
I've got no tolerance left for drama
You would like to go free, jump off the fence let your claws out
You remind me of me, run from all of them 'til they all gone
There, here we go again, with my threats to leave
Like I've ever left a she who wouldn't let me breathe
Instead I kept it deep enough to get you to believe
That I'm incapable of escaping and setting you free
Well I'mma open up that map and see the nation
Call it vocation
Call it a vacation
You can find me at the airport waiting
Or maybe I'll be chain-smoking down at the train station
With the pros of a Mac and my clothes in a sack
Gotta go and I don't know when I'll be back
Get my last paycheck, smash and make steps
Gone, on the run with Kool G. Rap in the tape deck (peace)
I say hey there, we don't play fair (troubles all around me)
Can't stay here, I hope you take care (day by day)

One little, two little, three little indie rap
Headphones, backpack, watch 'em all...
It goes watch out!

Jack the Ripper, Jack Jack the Ripper
Peace to Jack Tripper and those Wellstone bumper stickers
My name is Sean and I never had dreadlocks
Instead I got an army full of women screaming Headshots!
I guess that explains it, don't it
She started to make a mark but it came apart
That's what you get for tryin' to make your little sister eat the kitty litter
Let's watch a rapper get bitter like the city winter
What the fuck you thinkin'?
You frustrated or something? Did you have a bad week?
Man, you got issues, I feel sorry for you
Yo, shitting on me is so 2002 (Bitch!)
Turn your mic off, and turn the lights off
Whoever put your record out must have needed write-offs
Who they play when the game's in a tight spot?
Slug, you can find me in the A's of your iPod

Watch out!
When the crowd gets loud
It could burn up the roof or make the walls all fall down
Watch out!
When you open up your mouth
I can smell that you don't know what you're talking about
(It goes) Watch out!
We all love a clown
But we don't wanna se you climb up out the underground
Watch out!

Besides police, I've got no beef
Just me, my beliefs and my bad teeth
A cargo van and some Ant beats
Enough boom bap to slap you to last week
Caught between the vice and the advice
Drunk, walking out in traffic just to fly kites
Time out, the free-style rhyme out, my last rights
Fuck a classic album, give my life 5 mics
And when the smoke clears, you won't be able to suck dick
Like you did as a teenage slut trick
And with a mat on his grill, he asks "Who the fuck are you?"
Don't worry man, someday I'ma be nobody too

Watch out!
When the crowd gets loud
It could burn up the roof or make the walls all fall down
Watch out!

I can smell that you don't know what you're talking about

But we don't wanna se you climb up out the underground

If you don't like the sound
Fuck you! I'm just tryin' to put it down for my home town

Look, I understand your hate
When I was younger, I wanted to be LL Cool J
Then he started making records for the girls and shit
So I ripped up the Kangol and threw it away
I stole moves from KRS-One
A little Big Daddy Kane and some DJ Run
And then we took our life and made it a song
And look, nowadays Rhymesayers is on
It's the B-I-G D-A double D-Y S-E-A-N
He hasn't hit the rooftop to jump, guess he waitin'?
For what? I don't know, but who wanna come with me?
I got at least one more tour in me
So criticize me, or idolize me
Study from a distance or stand right beside me
It don't matter, just act like I know
And watch your back on the beat
Or get sacked at the free throw

Watch out!
When the crowd gets loud
It could burn up the roof or make the walls all fall down
Watch out!
When you open up your mouth
I can smell that you don't know what you're talking about

It'll be okay I think that needs to be established
For all of us that are easily distracted
Impatiently waiting for that American dream
Staring at the cracked screen of my anti-facts machine
Crash landed where the woke intersect with the exhausted
They asked if I'm depressed I don't doubt it
I was told it all began as a quest for some knowledge
Progress after you process the conflict
I'll be okay and if I got one wish
I'd probably waste it trying to make mysеlf an optimist
It's ironic because most of my thoughts are positivе
Just hop in the whip I promise not to drive off of the cliff
Happiness is my favorite physical feature
But I'm afraid I'll figure out that it's a mythical creature
I need to believe in the simulation that we're living in
Spent the whole stimulus check on some stimulants
I'll be okay just freestyle the answers
If you feel it put your hands up in front of surveillance cameras
Okay I don't take the buffet for granted
Make you understand it when you see me licking my plate
We gotta travel through space to keep the family safe
Check your connections can they can handle the bass
If they reflect your face it amplifies the existence of your significance
But only if you survive the collision

It's gonna be okay
Okay, alright
It'll be okay
Even if you're feeling like there ain't no way
You're still with us today
It's gonna be okay
Okay
I think I'm feeling alright
And I'll admit that sometimes I'm probably tongue-tied
Got me staring at the sun like my shoes ain't come untied
The clown face got replaced by this mountain of the
Midwest average from the mid-2000's
And being the best was never the intended destination
I just want appreciation for my presentation
Even if I was the only human left in population
This is dedicated to the dedication
You better love yourself today because tomorrow will be harder
Put your guard up don't let them penetrate your armor
Collect whatever crumbs you got and keep them in a bread box
You knew I was the one when I was sleeping in the wet spot
And baby if you had a dollar for all of your doubters
Maybe you could grow a salad and water the flowers
I know the zookeeper seen my leash and my collar
I'm in a tuxedo smoking weed in the shower
It'll be okay
Even if you're feeling like there ain't no way
You're still with us today
It's gonna be okay
Okay, alright

Even if you're feeling like there ain't no way

Laying on the carpet staring up at the plaster
When the preachers and pastors speak about the rapture
I think about eating the Stratocasters
Drowning in the deep end feet first
Dialing in the reverb trying to catch a Freebird
You trying to normalize the deception
But never forget the Porsche 911
Rip the emblem off the hood and let it dangle from the sterling
925 if you're discerning
You trying to ask me like I know I'm still searching
Just spray somе water at the ocean if it's burning
I usеd to keep my money in my sock
But I'm afraid that I might drop it 'cause I'm running like I'm up against the clock

Tell me all about your positives make a couple promises
That's how I got lost in your awesomeness

I feel like I've been saving all my grace for a day like today
Put the phone down and get out-of-formation
It's like you like to focus on the hyphens
The minus, the negative, the lifeless
So how are we supposed to find alikeness
You try to enjoy your time, I'm trying to avoid your crisis
The cosmos reapplied the cosmetics
Disguise the reasons why we decide to keep our feelings inside
I can't justify, the fuck am I?
Tried to stay awake but realized I ain't gonna make it through tonight

Still I will
Love until
Is it real
Still I will
When we're real
When we're still
Still I will love until
Love until

It's like you like to ruin all your shoes
Trying to prove that you've got nothing to prove
Continue the performance till the thorn is removed
Fighting in a war that's yours to lose
I keep my arm on the window leaning into the turns
But don't nobody wanna be the king of the worms
I guess sometimes you gotta learn to disagree with the terms
We lit the bridge on fire just to feel as it burns and
It's like you like the lights and the sirens
We're still attracted to the voice of violence
If survival depends on the appliance of tone
I'd prefer to be smiling on a deserted island alone
I would shrink into the skyline if I could fly
'Cause obviously most of us drinking our own cyanide
Won't you think about what you believe it means to be alive
Synchronize then sink into the eventide

Still I will
Love until
Is it real
Still I will
When we're real
When we're still
Still I will love until

And I just wanna let you know and I just, you know what

Baby, lately I don't even know what to say to ya
Grab something stable and sturdy, it's getting crazier
But why so blue? It's getting brazier too
Try to spread love and keep your head up, buckaroo
I hope you catch a W and your crew does too
Don't die multiply two plus two
And on the 7th looked up and saw the name in the stars
Next to Hüsker Dü and that's super cool
And every stick in the mud became a dick in the dirt
I don't know their music but I got the Misfits shirt
Ayo, my horoscope says that I should skip dessert
And put my fitness first
Dear God, I believe I'vе received your calling
And you'rе probably wondering why I seem to be stalling
Wanna live long enough to buy some weed at Walgreens
Is that too much to ask?

I just wanna let you know
Just wanna let you know

Don't let the operator come and disconnect your line
Keep it rolling even if you forget your lines
I love it when we color outside of the lines
Opened up the hands to reach across the dotted lines
Jumped over the ropes like there ain't no lines
Is that really too much to ask?

I just wanna let you know
I gotta let you know

This ain't my story, I'm just the homie's sidekick
My psychic told me they were gonna be my psychic
I remember back before life was actually priceless
We still pretended like we liked it
Used to keep a vice grips attached to the back of the seat post
Big daddy sweatpants clapping mosquitoes
Trying to squeeze the cheddar out of a bag of Cheetos
So I can pull some records out the racks at Cheapos
Wake me up in 2072
Are you ready to die or are you ready to do?
Fuck the cops, fuck the judge, fuck the referees too
Especially you - but not you, right?
The music sells the movie and the movie sells the toys
The toys sell a lifestyle of girls versus boys
Trying to sing a lullaby in a world full of noise
Now let me hear your beautiful voice

Come on and let me know
Be the next in line
Keep, just in case you forget your lines
I love it when we, the lines, dotted lines
There ain't no lines
I'm just trying to let you knowEmbed
I can't move, I mean I can feel my heart
But the rest of my parts won't start
They stay parked in this darkness
That's when I realized
I possessed complete control of all three of my eyes
So I open 'em wide and try to look around the room
When I assume I'm still laying up in my bed
This ain't just in my head
My defense reflex is effective immediately
Unfortunately my physical don't agree with me
I can't speak, I mean I can use my voice
But can't move my lips or my tongue, it's just noise
I battle with reality but pace my breathing
I'm distracted by the face within the shadows on the ceiling
Maybe it's a demon or an alien being
I wanna pretend that I'm dreaming of course my family sleeping
I try to force my scream but couldn't catch results
Somebody wake me up and come and check my pulse
I can't

Maybe it's only in my head
Maybe I'm all up in my head
Maybe it's only in my head
Maybe you're all up in my head

I can't sleep, I used to tell myself that it was paranoia
Telling me to look over a pair of shoulders
Now I know that it's connected to anxiety
Ability to rest affected by something inside of me
Maybe I should try to pay attention to the melody
I hear the devil singing. What she saying? What she telling me?
Maybe it's influenced when I'm under the influence
Or maybe it's God she trying to tell me she ain't interested in listening
She probably judge me for my weird thoughts
Like she wasn't making raindrops out of teardrops
To get to Heaven first you have to go through Hell
You built your own prison might as well sweep the dirt out your cell
Tell me it's a government experiment
They study from a secret bunker underneath the pyramids
Go ahead and give whatever explanation
But please don't try to make me admit that I'm being visited by spacemen
Well, okay then

Maybe it's only in my head
Maybe I'm all up in my head
Maybe it's only in my head
Get outta my head
And honestly, just just tell me that it, that it's spacewomen
'Cause even that would be just a little less bothersome1Embed
Try not to repeat the same mistakes
How many times can you beat those eggs
Before you teach yourself not to feed the snakes
Everybody trying to sneak a taste

I’ve been better, been worse, more blessed than I’m cursed
Trying to train myself to treat my body like a church
Takes a certain type of nerve to make a person fight the urge
And when I’m dead, I’ll still work to try to fertilize your dirt
But first I acknowledge the vice-versa
We could trade shoes and you’d probably play blues
And while you was paying dues, they borrowed your face too
Tryna get you to admit to some weight that you ain't moved
I see 'em, fightin' off the feelin'
Just to find a little frequency and rotate with the seasons
And I don’t need to know the reasons you believe
As long as you believe that there's a scenery beyond the ceilin'

That’s just my unsolicited suggestion
And don't nobody give a shit if it passes your inspection
But that’s not realistic 'cause we starvin' for attention
A portrait of the artist as an addendum, now that you mentioned it

You don’t wanna hear my voice, but you force yourself to listen
Gotta check in case I'm talkin' about you
And I’ve never sang a song that’s talkin' 'bout you
In fact, even right now I'm not talkin' 'bout you

Cautious, gotta avoid getting caught in the traps
Don’t let them penetrate the skin, step around them like quicksand
With multiple wristbands, the hand was Invisible Man
From the ashtray, I rise like a Pontiac
Watching my back with the eyes of an insomniac
No rats, no pigs, no copycats
Follow the money, honey, who supplied the body bags?

That's just my unsolicited suggestion
And don't nobody give a shit if it passes your inspection
But that’s not realistic 'cause we starvin' for attention
A portrait of the artist as a name carved in a bench, then

I wish that this was more than a gesture
I wish that I could make your everything better
Wish that I could tether it together for connection
Look at your reflection if you're looking for redemption
Of course the fortunate found shelter from the weather
But it still feels like the storms might live forever
Maybe take a little time, put some commas in the sentences
Then maybe we could find a common sense of direction
That's just my unsolicited suggestion
And don't nobody give a shit if it passes your inspection
But that's not realistic 'cause we starved for attention
A portrait of the artist as a departure, ascensionEmbed

It happened last morning

There was a flash, no warnings
Got stabbed with a swordfish
It's probably not that important
It happened last morning
It happened last-

I flew back from Saskatoon
I knew what I had to do
Tryna lose all my attitude
There's no beef in a bowl full of rabbit food

Shoulder to shoulder, no chance to move
Never had a pair of dancing shoes
But I've had a panic attack at First Avenue
In the back stall at the back of the bathroom

I stand up with the last of the laughs
Might as well put all of the cash in the trash
I guess I shoulda brought a biggеr duffle bag
Feel like I'm suffocating in this yellow cab

Don’t lеt the camera snap you in half
Take a little bit back to the lab
A lily pad full of tadpoles needs a dad
The phonograph played Massive Attack

They said it's lonely at the top
You lookin' like you trying to find some alone time
Click the calendar, schedule a nosedive
I'll meet you at the ocean at low tide

If you can roll your eyes, then you can open your eyes
To be the spokes and the headlights
You're flying, you took it to new heights
My pupils are giant, looking like Moon Pies
It's just a part of the character arc
I pull over, put the car into park
Turned out the lights, starin' into the dark
Turned off the motor, I can hear my heart

Release the seatbelt, then inhale like I'm in Hell
I told myself, I’m tryna heal this broken spell
But you can tell this the most alive I've ever felt

Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
Don't go, I need you and I feel the fool
You know that you're alive when you can see your own breath
Surrounded by the sounds of silence must've froze to deaf
Plus the firewood is wet, the smoke'll make you choke
Wondering how many summers are left (right?)
Took a couple steps then stumbled to the floor like
I don't know what the hell we struggling for like
I wanna offer you some comfort or support now
I'm just a little worn out let me catch a couple snores now
There's no way that I'm alone when I say that
It's likely that I mighta let my life bleed on a tape back in the day
And maybe I should take a stab at trying to locate
And give it a showcase in case it shows a way to open up some okay
If you can relate, that's dope I guess
Obviously also gotta offer my condolences
I wouldn't wish this on my least favorite opponents
This performance is more than just production and showmanship
Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
You might also likeI don't believe the protagonist really wants to die
But I imagine that they probably need a nap and some pain relief
Breathe deep and let the brain release
Underneath the poison apple tree to catch up on your beauty sleep
I hope you got somebody you can talk to
Anytime everything's heavy like it's falling down upon you
I think I'm trying to hide from everybody but I'm lonely
I wanna be invited to your party like you know me
Maybe in a previous life
I might've crawled out of an ocean of evolution and took flight
How am I supposed to keep my faith
So easily replaced when the sun starts screaming at my face
And people still wishing for a peaceful transition
Especially for those required to keep living
It's connected whenever I reflect and remember
As long as you're alive I'm gonna live forever
Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
Don't go, I need you and I feel the fool
Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
Don't go, I need you and I feel the fool
And all I can do is believe in the truth
Find me in the valley where the sheep run loose
Everything is real but nothing really matters
Can't go up the ladder if you're holding what you gathered
I'll meet you where the memories are buried
Love was the only material we could carry
Look you in the eye before we took to the sky
Climbing and climbing and climbing, don't ever dieEmbed
I can see we're thinking about the same things
I see your expression when the phone rings
We know there's something happening here
No sense in dancing 'round the subject
Wounds worse when it's treated with neglect
Don't turn now, there's nothing here to fear

You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
Set your secrets free

Silk degrees we're dancing in the same vein
Loose lies and fully entertained
I always knew we would wind up here
All these calls are making my eyes tear
Suddenly last summer is so clear
They always will tell you what you want to hear

You can talk to me

Aside from a few exceptions
Notice the majority authority
Be stepping into traffic with bad directions
I don't wanna sound like another typical escapist
But I won't protest if you wanna deviate away from the basics
If you think it'll help, we can celebrate your pain and your patience
They said Hell is made out of self-deprecation
Dressed up head to toe but never felt so naked
So fortunate there ain't nothing to forfeit
And a torch gotta light it's own course, I guess
Nobody ever told you about the vultures and the hornet's nest
I know you wanna move forwards
But you feel like an ornament
And everyone acts so supportive
The distortion sounds disproportionate
Talk to me
You can talk to me
Set your secrets freeEmbed
I feel like I’m driven by the
Sacrifice just to suffer from the hunger for composure
And structure environment that's under some control
I know it's a dilemma
That’s why I opened the umbrella
And even though the weather looking Armageddon-y
I'm still out here trying to grow some celery
You could be on the other side of the galaxy
That's my reality, it balances me
The gravity keeps me tethered to thе planet everlastingly
That's how I stay distractеd from your pageantry
You're trying to keep the battleship immaculate
Everything changes except the magic tricks
Born and raised in a restless Minneapolis

I'm positive that it's a negative connection
I've got a cup full of Novocaine (Okay)
Stairway to Heaven, hope my name's on the guest list (Go away)
My stress gets trapped between the shoulder blades
Searching for some benefits for perfect attendance
Keep attention span attentive like we dance around an open flame
I'll trade a couple silver linings for some golden days
I confess I'm still trying to impress papa
I guess that I'm expecting I'll see him again, haha
Laughing on a cloud in some wings and a toga
And he's asking why I never left Minnesota
Keep in mind previously thought impossible to find
All of these pieces that were needed to complete the design
I'm on the final lap, then I go back to give my wife a spinal tap
Still writing rhymes like somebody got the time for that

The temperature's rising, but it's colder than Hell
I never feel alone when I'm alone by myself
I try to sing along, but I don't know what you said
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath

Explore the storm to find the source of the hunger and the pain
I stole a horse so I could run towards the thunder
And the reins broke and now this beast is my bestie
We used to chain smoke and now we drinking our veggies
We tell the same jokes and pretend that it's okay
Already know what Hell felt like when it's frozen over
Snow-covered roller coaster stuck in the alleyway
Dreaming about the day my poster's up in a gallery
Feel the cold breeze brought me back to reality
I gotta get these groceries back to my family

A lotta pain
Been shooting from the sky
And the tears they fall
Hot like flame don't know why
But still life
Still life finds a way to look gorgeous
And you still look gorgeous, darling
Even though it's all coming to an ending
The whole thing look pretty like a painting

Uh, alright, uh, alright
Uh, alright, uh, okay
Uh, alright, uh, alright
Uh, alright, uh, okay

Until the end of time, that's what we said
Never woulda guessed that there wasn't much time left
There's no precedent to represent it
Might as well have thought that we would float away like dust in the sunset
I wanna put you on the back of my bicycle
And push like I'm peddling the circle of life with you
The sky's falling let me strike all the personal strife
And try to be the best version of the person you like
You might also likeYou know the plan we exist to resist

This must be how it feels when there's something to live for

A lotta pain
Been shooting from the sky
And the tears they fall
Hot like flame don't know why
But still life
Still life finds a way to look gorgeous
And you still look gorgeous, darling
Even though it's all coming to an ending
The whole thing look pretty like a painting

Do you recall if all of it always felt so out of control
I don't know, but maybe this is simply how it's supposed to go
And if it's still possible
Maybe we should slow down and watch the show
It's like the world's on fire
On top of that my love feels like fire, sirens and flashing lights
I realize this ain't the time to lie you down now
'Cause we should probably find some higher ground now
In the event that this is truly the apocalypse
I don't wanna miss that midnight kiss
If we both still alive when we arrive on the other side
Then forever we can be by each other's side
It's like a bowl full of plastic fruit, paint a picture
The truth never needed an attitude to convince you
Even at your funeral, something's trying to kill you
You always look beautiful to me and you still do

This kind of a heartbreak is threatening to escalate to chasms
Rain seasons lead to monsoons when my tear ducts start to spasm
Contemplating the bitter end that's a gravity y'all can't fathom
But all that hate and toxic bickering, epic battles, y'all can have 'em
And on this Eve I'm pondering splitting from the Adam
I wonder if the fallout will be a Big Bang or a quiet release from the patterns
You say you respect me vow to protect me then turn right around and deplete me
My еnergy worth too much to allow our cycles to keep on repеating
This is over, well maybe, it took too long to heal from
It took you long enough to see my pain before you feel something
So maybe I need space, so I can face that which I fear
That me without you might be a vast improvement in my atmosphere
So choose your fateYou might also likeEmbed
I must've fell off the face of the planet
Before I noticed you designated a space to drop the anchor
I never intended to take you for granted
I found the patterns in your fabric I just wanted to understand you
You put a collar on a dog named Bandit
You're following a dollar with your hands like a basket
And honestly it doesn't bother me I hope you catch it
'Cause I'm here to fix your congratulatory sandwich
You look frustrated and famished
Allocate some assets to evaluate the damages
Establish with your manager to ask if you can ask for a
Few vacation days to get your balancing act back together
But the journey is the bobber
It goes up and down like the mercury in the thermometer
Now maybe that was an iota too soon
But I love you all the way from Minnesota to the moon
Make party and inflate the balloon
You bent me up into the shape of a spoon

And when I was one, was just the first son
To carry the burden, I was barely a person
My folks were young, but committed to keep up their end of the bargain
Protect me from harm and grow a garden
I was loved, I was fed, might sleep through the night
I was taught how to talk and how to read you from left to right
I learned to argue and fight from a distance
Where my vulnerability gets no recognition
And by the time I was eleven, I was already defensive
An extension of environment and reinforced messages
Preemptively believed eventually I'll be a failure to my family and friendships
And when you mix it and blend it with contemporary pressures
Of adolesence, emphasis on the consensus of
A book full of portraits, but didn't consider
That we've been sketchin' stick figures underneath bigger pictures

And on my twenty-first birthday, already had my first born
Baby boy and maybe homie saved my life
But papa kept the motor runnin', I'ma come and see you later
Tryin' to color up some paper, tryin' to make this right
I realize most experiences are coincidental
But I'll never let go of these regrets I hold
That's why the pieces that were missin' always felt more special
Better bring some bigger pencils to sketch my soul
But yo, when I was thirty-one, both ends burnin' 'em
Thought that I was lost in the jungle, but I was in search of something
Learnin' how to deconstruct my puzzle
Permanently nervous, I was in love with the hustle
The Devil went to Hell, just to sell that selfishness
They tried to make me feel important, I fell for it
Embarrassment and trepidation, plus a healthy dose of
Self imposed limitations over my own illustrations
And when I struggled with the number forty-one, I had a couple more sons
And it feel like my real life had just begun
It's gettin' harder to translate
It's likely I've already played my part of this landscape
And all of this time, I've been followin' my design
Tryin' to find a little solace in how the stars aligned
It kinda looks like glitter, but every pixelated flicker
Gets the proper position in the biggest of pictures
And when I was fifty-one...

I'm traveling forever, never released
I'm trying to get some peace, I need to set some boundaries
And step on a beach that's underneath some palm trees
I want my face to feel as fresh as a breeze
That's when I awakened and I remembered police
Get your knee off his throat, he can't fucking breathe
Please each sunrise is golden
When you're holding onto hope that you don't die frozen
I mean, I'ma try to keep both eyes open
Don't be afraid to adjust the lens to find focus
I'm not cold, I just protect my emotions
I suppose I'm supposed to pretend that I'm not broken
I feel attacked by the cameras flash
I'm trying to relax fall back, get off the ambulance path
It ain't funny, but I'd rather just laugh
Play me maybe transfer a fraction of math
Every day, I'm trying to master the craft
I'm living on a ladder, at the same time, rapping for the past

Got an inbox full of videos of their milestones
My headstone might as well be a grindstone
I'm feeling like I brought a microphone to a cyclone
If you're alone, then you're welcome here
But the owner of the bar is trying to sell some beer
I was surprised like you when I felt those tears
We set the roof on fire and the devil appeared
And now I'm looking at a sketch of myself sincere
It's been a few consecutive hell of a years
Yeah, I feel like I'm juggling a couple of knives
'Cause I'm trying to say something that might describe this
