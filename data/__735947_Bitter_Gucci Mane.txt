8 ContributorsBitter Lyrics
Way shawty looking is bitter
Put it on your tongue, get better
Face bitter on them crystals
They better 'cause I brought my pistols
One hitter quitter, big dipper
Got the better faced bitch, you better
Got a hitter with a big ol' pistol
Hope the lean so dark, it's better
Had a bitch that I can't get rid of
When she test me it make me bitter
What don't kill you makes you better
Why you mugging? You bitter
If you tryna cheek, you bitter
If I'm gon' smash you, I'm better
If you get love then show love
The strippers gon' get bitter

I'm gon' nut in her face, big dipper
Every time we hit the club, they follow us with the fireworks like Christmas
Leave a pussy nigga in the swamp just like Izzo
Chase you down like you killed my sister, no Mystikal
Put that stick all in your head just like TI
Got so much weight like I'm in NY, no Eli
And I'm standing and demanding
Your ho gon' go for it like Tom Ford, need bandages
Okay, I got a lot of strippers 'round me right now like I'm pulling shows
I got so many bands around me right now, I know why the want to rob us
Hahahaha

Way shawty looking is bitter
Put it on your tongue, get better
Face bitter on them crystals
They better 'cause I brought my pistols
One hitter quitter, big dipper
Got the better faced bitch, you better
Got a hitter with a big ol' pistol
Hope the lean so dark, it's better
Had a bitch that I can't get rid of
When she test me it make me bitter
What don't kill you makes you better
Why you mugging? You bitter
If you tryna cheek, you bitter
If I'm gon' smash you, I'm better
If you get love then show love
The strippers gon' get bitter

Bitch say she gon' let me fuck, you better
Ten dollars or better, get your North Face wet up
Around my side of town, man, we leave you bitter
Extension clips with thirties, ho, we doing better
Say I came up, finagled the situation
Ask the blocks, dropped off the top right by the station
Half a pound, so hurry up, somebody waiting
Four piece combo, four quarter pounds, combination
Bitches with the big ass get conversations
Bitches with the lil' ass, might just leave 'em bitter
Tell they have to step it up and get it bigger
Got to get a dope boy, get them grams off quicker
Way shawty looking is bitter
Put it on your tongue, get better
Face bitter on them crystals
They better 'cause I brought my pistols
One hitter quitter, big dipper
Got the better faced bitch, you better
Got a hitter with a big ol' pistol
Hope the lean so dark, it's better
Had a bitch that I can't get rid of
When she test me it make me bitter
What don't kill you makes you better
Why you mugging? You bitter
If you tryna cheek, you bitter
If I'm gon' smash you, I'm better
If you get love then show love
The strippers gon' get bitter1Embed
