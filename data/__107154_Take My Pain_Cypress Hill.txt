5 ContributorsTake My Pain LyricsI can't afford to lose you
Who do what you do?
You're the tip of the fucking speer
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

I'm at a strange point of my life, my spirit ignites
I'm destined for heights, I'm so solid with the quest of the life
I'm under pressure but the time is right
For me to look inside of myself, time passes by every night
I'm searching for answers meanwhile my faith is a prize
And my neighbors are looking at me with hate in their eyes
Grinding their teeth, the streets filled with death and lies
Was set up to die but we plant seeds to rise
So when the day comes pray some miracle will keep it protected
Some of us have gotta go but you know it you expect it
I gotta believe in more than I see
In something better than this, whatever it is
I need it quick before my feeling is gone
Maybe my feeling is wrong
But I'll embrace it like a beautiful song
I feel something strong coming along
I can't explain what it is, but I'm relaxed till my mind is gone
You might also like
Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away

This feeling is hitting me hard, my soul is scarred
The feeling is all like I'm getting a message from God
Believin' in cause, no one believes in the laws
The reason the straw breaks, a soul is lost
I'm searching for my soul in the mist of all this insanity
Out of vanity my home is a war zone calamity, randomly
Tragedies happen I'm sick of this life
I'd give in a minute if it could free us from strife
Gotta bond with the new brothers, leditucci and
Cheddars survival of our mothers would be proud of us
When the day comes and we rise to the height of our faith
And nothing can touch us, we don't the feel the mothers
Now the beast inside of my head, the life that I led
Left me for dead and lost on the path that I tread
I've laid so many to rest, from family to friends
We pretend it doesn't happen, but when will it end?
Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away

I gotta new thought in my mind in a matter of time
I'll be in a sublime state of the spiritual kind
My family is holding me high, they're nervous inside
I can see in their eyes pride but the eyes don't lie
If the celebration continues I'll follow my heart
And my home is being infected from the poisonous dart
It's fallin' apart, I don't wanna see its demise
So I'mma have to make a difference to remember I tried
My brother and sister smiling as I leave in the night
My mother kisses me on the cheek and my father is quiet
No words need to be said as my patters begun
'Cause nothing can break the chain of a father and son
As I take a step in the street where my destiny lies
Trying to focus, my nerves got my stomach in ties
Rollin' in a club, goddamn these people are young
What needs to be done, so I'll reach you over the ho
Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away
Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain awayEmbed
