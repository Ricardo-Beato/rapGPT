Flex, sex, drugs, and money
Cars, clothes, and plenty of women
I got all of that, I got all of that
I got all of that, I got all of that
Flex, sex, drugs, and money
Cars, clothes, and plenty of women
I got all of that, I got all of that
I got all of that, I got all of that

Yo, tell the truth, Young Juice the truth
Frenchie, Wooh, and Flocka too
So if you wanna test my crew, step
Now by yourself, boy, you gon' need help
Desert Eagle under my belt
Mac-90, double clip or flare
So Icey all about our wealth
Gucci Mane, I sign myself, yo swag is kinda stale
Sick flow, I need a Ginger Ale
Undercover, I think you are twelve
Longway Gucci cool as hell
Before I had a job, I had a scale

Flex, sex, drugs, and money
Cars, clothes, and plenty of women
I got all of that, I got all of that
I got all of that, I got all of that
You might also likeFlex, sex, drugs, and money
Cars, clothes, and plenty of women
I got all of that, I got all of that
I got all of that, I got all of that

I'm so icey, my timepiece is like wow
Bling, blow, burr, Gucci Mane, ooh child
Million worth of jewelry on, bite down
I'm so turnt up, Drumma Boy turn me down
I think I see the clouds for real, I'm on a jet now
Them 26's, junkies, please wipe it down
Backseat of the Phantom, me and Waka have a pound
Flyer than a eagle, no, I'm higher than an owl
Birthday bash, I might jump off in the crowd
Gucci crew wild, would ya'll please cut it down
Calm down, baby, that's why I style
Girls go wild on our tour bus, wow

Flex, sex, drugs, and money
Cars, clothes, and plenty of women
I got all of that, I got all of that
I got all of that, I got all of that
Flex, sex, drugs, and money
Cars, clothes, and plenty of women
I got all of that, I got all of that
I got all of that, I got all of that
Brick Squad 1017, I hear
Walk off in club and the fine women cheer
Diamonds in my ear, yeah, they crystal clear
Money out the rear, engine in the rear
I wish my dick could see me here
Put it down like she was here
15 diamond chains on, got your girlfriend saying burr
7 busters on the grind, got your girl like where your balls
250.000 dollars, homegirl, that's my truck
60 bricks, yeah, that's my plug
East Atlanta where I'm from
Collard greens just like I'm 
Bust so hard, I'll make you warm
 Gucci Mane  make it thunderstom
Fresher than you at the prom
Ask yo sis or pay me more

Flex, sex, drugs, and money
Cars, clothes, and plenty of women
I got all of that, I got all of that
I got all of that, I got all of that
Flex, sex, drugs, and money
Cars, clothes, and plenty of women
I got all of that, I got all of that
I got all of that, I got all of thatEmbed
