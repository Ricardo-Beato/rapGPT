Uh, yeah
Queen Bee, 2000
Come on

No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Won't you come and)
We are the number one
(Come and show me how you do that, baby)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Shake your body to the rhythm)
We are the number one
(If it drives you crazy)

Everywhere I go red carpet
Gave the keys to valet tell 'em to park it
Then I jumps out the Azure, a Lil' Kim aura
Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R-L-S is in the stretch LX
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bvlgari perfume from a mile ya smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'ma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill', uh
Depending on how I feel I might go on a heist
So at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice
We fly like kites never gettin' into fights
I got a whole bunch of dykes on ninja bikes
You might also like
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Won't you come and)
We are the number one
(Come and show me how you do that, baby)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Shake your body to the rhythm)
We are the number one
(If it drives you crazy)

I'm just trying to be me, doing what I got to do
So why y'all keep hating on me and my crew?
Yo, I'm saying Q.B, look at them and look at you
True, if I was you I'd hate me too
Louis Vuitton shoes and a whole lot of booze
Every other week a different dude and another cruise
I make offers nobody can refuse
You might even see me on the channel nine news
I get paid just for laying in the shade
To take pictures with a glass of lemonade
My rocks shine like it was dipped in Cascade
(Uh-uh, Kim been fly since she was in the fifth grade)
Wake up in the morning to breakfast from a maid
Wanted me so bad you went copped the bootleg
Y'all niggas played like a high top fade
Some of the shit I hear I don't know how it got played
Y'all rock Versace and y'all went out and bought it
I rock Versace and y'all know I ain't paid for it
My fam deep with security in the jeep
When the Queen come in town everything shut down
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Won't you come and)
We are the number one
(Come and show me how you do that, baby)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Shake your body to the rhythm)
We are the number one
(If it drives you crazy)

Breakdown, uh
Let's dance come on
Let's dance come on
I see you, let's go
Yeah, Queen Bee, do it like this

I'm the highest, your highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I'm speakin' so that 'ju know
*Rakim* "This is how it should be done..
'Cause this style, is identical to none"
The hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip-hop a ya don't stop
To rock it to the bang-bang boogie
To up jump the boogie
To the boogie to the boogedy beat
Now what you hear is not a fake
It's the real Lil' Kim, Queen Bee (That's right)
Now I know y'all heard other females rap
But they ain't got nothin' on me
'Cause, y'all take to my rap cause my rap's the best
A hundred and fifty thou, sixteen bars nothin less (Nothin less)
So to y'all haters, I paid y'all no mind
In fact I'ma give it to y'all one more time like..
Uh yeah, what?
Come on, bounce, what?

No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Won't you come and)
We are the number one
(Come and show me how you do that, baby)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Shake your body to the rhythm)
We are the number one
(If it drives you crazy)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Won't you come and)
We are the number one
(Come and show me how you do that, baby)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Shake your body to the rhythm)
We are the number one
(If it drives you crazy)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Won't you come and)
We are the number one
(Come and show me how you do that, baby)
