8 Contributors? (Extended Raw Rhymes Version) Lyrics
131 years, savage generation
One recipe enough said
Jack Daniel's old number 7B
Quality, Tennessee, sour-mash whiskey

Ooh, so many flows
Shit goes, so many ways down and below
20-10 thousand leagues under the sea
Motherfuckers never know it was me
Oh, that nigga' flew so many flows
It's like so many fly colors on the hoe toes
God dammit, motherfucker rulin' whole planet
Gimme' two times, cut no shit, nah, fuck it
I'm coming through kicked the bucket one day
Motherfuckers never see a nigga parlay
Like, lay in the cut, like, he never knew
Motherfucker, Super Villain
And who the fuck is you? Ooh

One two, one two
In order to make a jam, kid
We gotta' get it back up in the zone
Mad shit the way we be spittin, when the writing shit is on
I'm fuckin' it up cause right now
See I'mma be serious my next verse, Imma just be serious (Yeah)
I be starting to laugh, that's my problem
That's my problem too, my shit sound like on some funny shit
You know what's hot? The way we keep talking
I'm taking off the headphones to talk to you
But it's dope, cause we talkin' and still doin' it to the music
So wait, then the beat's too loud?
I keep the beats kinda low, like this and shit
No, nah I don't the levels are fucked up
Oh you mean to keep the tone down?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, kinda like riding like right there, right there, be like yo—
The sound facts on the whole situation is—
Good things
Nope-a nope, nope

He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling a chick like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him (Blatt)
Retarded in real life, on the mic, Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who, or they fancy crew
That's no mystery what Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula, 'dullah
A villain in your land, in his land, a ruler
Hard-hitting like puffin' a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off-day, with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats (Uh)

People question how we live, question, what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't trus' it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44
Contemplate, meditate, dictate
I direct my direct fate, comin' of late
Kurious, can I say shit?
Do it for cutter Roc, do it for K. Nit (RIP)
K-N-I-T, Sub R-O-C
(Eternally for M-I-C)
Only we save we
Yeah, this ain't that rage in public (Word up)
All ya'll punk motherfuckers get schooled, slammed on sight

By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete-sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan, manEmbed
