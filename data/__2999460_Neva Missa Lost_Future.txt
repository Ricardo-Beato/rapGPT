40 ContributorsNeva Missa Lost Lyrics
Who are you again? Why are you in my bed?
You left your self esteem at the door this time (This time)
You just had too much of my lean this time (My lean)
I can tell that you been stallin' me (Stallin')
I'll never hold you back (Never)

I'm losin' you and you know it (Yeah)
I'm losin' you and you know it (And you know)
You know, you know
And you know it, and you know it (You know)
I'm losin' you and you know it (And you know)
I'm losin' you and you know it (You know)
You know, you know
I can never miss a loss
I can never miss a loss
I can never miss a loss
Please tell 'em what it cost
Make me pull this money out the drawer
I whip one or two, I sold one to three
I swear, I never took a loss (Swear)
See, I got many types of flaws (Swear)
That's why I never miss a ho (Swear)

Is that you, Ms. Sagittarius? Tell me what a Sagittarius do
You only eat vegetarian food (Yeah), in the backseat of the Maybach
You don't speak English, immigration, promise I won't leave you waitin'
Catch a Uber to the dealership, girl, you gon' pick up your new registration
You might also like
I'm losin' you and you knew
I'm losin' you and you knew
You know, you
And you know, and you know it
I'm losin' you and you knew (You knew)
I'm losin' you and you knew (You knew)
You know, you know
I can never miss a loss (I)
I can never miss a loss (I can never)
I can never miss a loss (I can never)
You know, you know (I)
Yeah, yeah, I can never miss a loss
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Whatever you need, oh, oh, oh (Oh)

Made love first before we knew each other
I got you stickin' like wet leather
Your pretty body soft as bird feathers
If you bring a friend, I'ma switch-hitter
Keep on my lenses, I don't see niggas
They too busy tryna be niggas (Woo)
I'm out of reach, over peak, nigga (Yah)
Made my first million out the creek, nigga (Yep)
Purple Addies, no sleep, nigga (Woah)
Take the jet so we can meet quicker (Ah)
Her ass thick, but my syrup thicker (Ah)
I'm on it right away (Gettin' on it right away)
I'm losin' you and you knew (And you knew)
I'm losin' you and you knew (And you knew)
You know, you
And you know, and you know it (Get it)
I'm losin' you and you knew (Get it)
I'm losin' you and you knew
You know, you know
I can never miss a loss (Get it, get it, get it)
Whatever you need (Get it, get it, get it)
I can never miss a loss (Oh, woah)
You know, you know
You know, you know, you know (Yeah, yeah)
I can never miss a loss
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Whatever you need, oh, oh, oh (Oh)

Oh, oh, ah
Whatever you need, whatever you need
I can never miss a loss
Whatever you need, oh
I can never miss a loss, yeah, yeah
Whatever you need (Need)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You left your self esteem at the door this time
You just had too much of my lean this time
I can tell you been stallin' me
I'll never hold you3Embed
