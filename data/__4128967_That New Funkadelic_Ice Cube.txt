For the whole wide world
It's a West side celebration
Everybody get up!
And you talk about us, when you freaky, freaky, yeah

You know the funk will linger
All these mother fuckers wanna smell my finger
All these mother fuckers wanna fuck my singers
I don't give a damn, nigga, Jerry Springer
California love, California bud
Long as I got it, I don't give a fuck
It's the Hpnotiq, I'm the narcotic
So if you spot it, actin' robotic, freeze
Just like a mannequin and then start panickin'
I'm too hard for you, you still wanna eat it like barbeque

Freaks on the floor, freaks on the floor
How many of y'all freaks on the low?
Freaks on the floor, freaks on the floor
How many of y'all freaks on the low?

What's up for the evenin'?
I ain't into trickin', I'm into treatin'
