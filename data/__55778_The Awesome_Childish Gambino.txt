13 ContributorsThe Awesome Lyrics
I am the awesome
You see me flossin', watch me walk upon your face
Make that incision
I leave you itchin' just to join my monster race
Say I'm just messin'
Yea well I'm pissed and I can keep an even key
You think you know me
But you can blow me cause you don't know how I feel

It's Childish Gambino, ho
What you know about that?
Niggas 'fraid to go outside, they some house cats
Cause if they see me, they might have to act right
I'm livin' life right, like I got a past life
Boy I got a flashlight
Check my fuckin' hoodie skin
Like God was makin' light and threw my hoodie in
Bambi, naw nigga that's my pseudonym
Call me Elroy
Nigga we some hooligans
And just in case, I keep a million in the glove box
Blast this shit from in your car to make the hood rock
Ice cold, bright colors, like a juice pop
And if you try to touch my shit I'll make your juice pop
Yes I get a two spot just for fuckin' showin' up
Boy it's me, T.N.T., boy I'm blowin' up
Nigga throw it up
Boy, I am the awesome
Call me Elroy
Or Mr. "Hey, how much it cost him"

Okay!
Rackin' 'em, stackin' 'em, packin' these ballers
Bleedin' These hoes I carve ‘em with a big carver
Stiff Like Barbara's
I pack a punch like a bunch of starbursts
Back up ma, let me celebrate your suit
Like five toes cuz you gonna get the boot
Like five guys cuz you're gonna get the boot
Underground sound I reiterate “Roots” what the minute men lose, what the little man grew, his crew while they wrestle in the nude, can’t handle the truth, I prefer my own coop
With my hand on the mic and my mind on the move
Cryin’-on-The-View, Ridin' the wave, I'ma take a step that you bothered to save
I can get crunk in a couple of ways2Embed
