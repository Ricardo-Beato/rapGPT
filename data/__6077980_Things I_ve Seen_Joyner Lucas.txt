42 ContributorsThings Iâ€™ve Seen Lyrics
I've got this darkness in my soul
Don't see no light when I'm wide awake
I'm sick of workin' for no ends
You see the greed made me feel hate
And there's no turnin' back, no
Keep runnin' from my past
Well, the fear, it always lasts
I don't think you know me, know me, no
You don't know my life, my heart, my soul, no
If you've seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen, see things I've seen

Black women hurt, black women curse
Black brothers doin' black women dirt
Black women cryin', black women murk
We can never put a black woman first
Black lives matter, black lives scatter
Black eyes under black eye shadow
Black blood made a black life splatter
Black sister had a black life shadow
Black single mother, black favorite color
Black brother made a black woman suffer
Black women down, black women under
We contribute to the black women struggle
Black women brave, black women save
Black women lost, black women fade
Black man with a black woman
Made black paint, made a black woman change
Black women cryin', black women tired
Tears runnin' down a black woman's eye
Black women run, black women hide
Black violence made a black woman die
Black woman passed, black mama sad
Black pride on a black woman had
Black rage for the black women, mad
Black man callin' black women trash
Black women hurt, let you back in
Black women keep protectin' black men
Black men don't protect the black queen
Black women always get the back seat
You might also like
Black women preach, black women teach
Black soil for the black women seeds
Black pain's all a black woman sees
Black love's all a black woman needs

Woah-oh, you don't know the tears I've cried
If you've seen the things I've seen (Oh, seen the things)
If you've seen the things I've seen
Woah-oh, I'm standin' 'til the end, woah
If you've seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen

Black resurrected, black manifested
Black women vision, black innovation
Black women faith, black women blessings
Black man keep the black queen protected
Black women safe, black women save
Black business is a black women paid
Black don't crack, black don't age
Black women proud, black women praised
Black women smilin', black women shinin'
Black women got it, black women write it
Black wealth, no more back to the bottom
Black kings get a black woman diamonds
Black women body, black women climbin'
Black women body, black women poppin'
Black men keep the black woman honored
Black roses painted back and they got 'em
Black loyalty, black royalty
Black novelty, black odyssey
Black women in a black colony
Black women feelin' black harmony
Black for the people, black women peaceful
Black man treatin' black women equal
Backbone what a black women teach you
Black strength when a black woman feed you
Black pride, that's what's happenin' now
Black men holdin' black women down
Black women gettin' cash and I'm proud
Black angels and they trapped in the clouds
Black women preach, black women teach
Black soil for the black women seeds
Black pain's all a black woman sees
Black love's all a black woman needs

Woah-oh, you don't know the tears I've cried
If you've seen the things I've seen (Oh, seen the things)
If you've seen the things I've seen
Woah-oh, I'm standin' 'til the end, woah
If you've seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen (Things I've seen)

My God, I lost a lot of love
Can see the pain in my momma's face
A daughter hangin' from this earth
She got them scars she don't deserve
And there's no turnin' back
Keep runnin' from my past
Well, the fear, it always lasts, mmm
Seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen (Oh, seen the things)
If you've seen the things I've seen
Woah-oh, I'm standin' 'til the end, woah
If you've seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen
Ooh-ooh, woah
Ooh-ooh, woah
Ooh-ooh, woah
Ooh-ooh (Things I've seen, things I've seen)3Embed
