4 ContributorsCan I Get a Witness LyricsChorus: Run-D.M.C. (repeat 4X)
Can you kick it like I kick it when I kick this
Can I get a witness? (Yes you can!)

New jacks better back up, before they get smacked up
By the R-U-N-D-M-C (that's where it's at cuz)
Known as the tough cats, kickin tough rough raps
In jeans, leather jackets, my Adidas and gangster hats
A ?? ?? ??, yo here we go
I'm tired of brothers tryin to front like they don't hear me though
Knowin if it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be able
Cause I'm the man with the hand that rocked the cradle, uhh
A lot of punk for the chunk baby that's a bet
Album number seven and we still ain't finished yet
I didn't get old, I got better at the craft
Sat back and watched you try to kick it but you made us laugh
So get back, you already had your chance to dance
You proved you had no waist to fit in this man's pants
Word to God, I'm back fo' sho'
Hollis Queens gettin wreck so act like you know
Chorus

As I spit this and get this out of my throat
I need a witness to get with this - take notes
Great quotes like boats float flowin so dope
Never givin up hope, nope, know what I wrote
I'mma saver spectator educator entertainer
You wanna ask me, can't be now or later
I'm a rough rugged person, been that way from the start
Darryl Mack got the knack to put the H in heart
(And it ain't no fun, to step to D and Run
But if you wanna step up, step up and get that ass - done)
A reporter with recorder was recordin the slaughter
As I'm peepin 'cross the border leapin water keepin order
Lit it up like a spliff, get a whiff of this hit
Cause I flick em like bits, and I bust 'em like zits
Dippin down to grip this microphone I rip this
I'm glad not sad I flipped this, now can I get a witness

Can I get a witness, can I hit a, never been ?? fitness
Don't play like I'm bitter, when you come with your best
And I make a suggestion save it David with your bull
Cause you're full of congestion
Soft? Never me, never get more hard
The King of Kings, Lord of Lords, is the one Lord God
Can I can I get a witness ?? ?? next
To my God, DJ Run and I kick it

Suckers suckers suckers
Suckers get flipped when I start to flip
Slip in a clip when they die I dip
Still spray a gun, see how DJ Run
Leave a sucker stunned, gettin ill to the drum
Mic check and I wreck and I'm second to none
Accept it don't regret it I expect to get dumb
So don't you forget this, we'll put you on the hitlist
To stick ya stick ya wicked wickedest can I get a witness
