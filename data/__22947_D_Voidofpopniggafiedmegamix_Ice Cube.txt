Aiyyo, Ice Cube man
Since you went solo, what's up with the rest of the crew?

So High you can't get around it
So low you can't get under it
So High you can't get over it
I can't get over it
Nothin' can stop us now

Dirty mother, dirty mother  -----] Ice Cube
Make it rough               -----] Ice Cube
Dirty mother, dirty mother  -----] Ice Cube
Dirty mother, dirty mother  -----] Ice Cube
Cause I'm steady mobbin'    -----] Ice Cube
Have you never sense the recite in my rhymes?
Standin' on stage and I'm grabbin' my nuts -----] Ice Cube
Steady mobbin'  --------] Darryl Gates
Have you never sense the recite in my rhymes?
Standin' on stage and I'm grabbin' my nuts -----] Ice Cube

I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang

 Daddy, where did he go?
 I'll tell you where he went, goddamn it
Give me that beat fool, it's a full time jack move
Chilly Chill, yo, homie make the track move
And I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank
That's the name of the suckers I done ganked
I get away from a copper
Drop a dime, I'll break you off somethin' proper
With the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B, T-Bone and that's J.D
And here's how we'll greet you
Stop!!!
Here we go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Drop an Old School beat
Goddamn, I'm glad, goddamn, I'm glad
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now, you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the A.K
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Lookin' like straight bozos
I saw it comin, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
When y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Damn, you're wicked, man!!
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people... on it
No vaseline
Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C-E
And let me tell you a story or two
About a punk-Ass-Nigga I knew
Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin' up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin' her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Ridin' Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence? - y'all I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go

Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit
Cops ain't shit to me ------] Ice Cube
Fuck all y'all        ------] Ice Cube
Cops ain't shit to me ------] Ice Cube
Yeah, good that all them girls remember him, Ice fuck that

Once upon a time in the projects y'all
Yo, I damn near had to wreck a whore
I knocked on the door (*Knock knock*) who is it?
It's Ice cube came to pay a little visit to you
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
Yo, I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Fucked up my night

Now, ask yourself, now, ask yourself
What did you say?
Now, ask yourself, now, ask yourself
What did you say?
Who's the mack?
Straight gangsta mack
You know how we do it, yeah
Straight gangsta mack
You know how we do it
Straight gangsta mack
You know how we do it
Straight gangsta mack
You know how we do it

Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood
Like everybody from the hood, is up to no good?
Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood
Like everybody from the hood, is up to no good?
(*Helicopter Propeller Turning*)
Run from the ghetto bird
Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird
Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird
(*Helicopter Propeller Turning*)
Stay off his dick..
(*Flavor Flav sprays Shots all around the place*)Embed
