5 ContributorsBoss Lyrics
Ballin', ballin'
Gucci, Gucci

I'm so fly (Fly), I might fly away (Fly)
Run away to my hideaway (Fly, huh?)
Ride off in that purple van (Nyoom)
Pull up in yellow  tomorrow (Ha)
Bossin' (Boss), keep my jewelry flossin' (Burr, burr, burr)
Purple  stompin', keep my child, I keep a coffin (Ha-ha, ha-ha)
Pussy got him stalkin', Gucci's not a stalker (No)
But that bitch is bossy (Bossy), and her head is awesome (Wow)
So much winter, autumn, I can catch her with me (With me)
Tryna get her higher (Higher), that body got witnessed (Well, damn)
Know lil' shawty pretty (Dawg), heard she be snottin' (Snottin'?)
Tell that boo she with it (I'm with it)
Nigga, buy four ounces (Go 'way)
 this track is bouncin' (Bouncin')
Gucci Mane be bossin' (Bossin')
Found that bitch in Boston (Boston)
All she date is bosses, Gucci!

I boss, then I ball
Yeah, she thicker than a horse
So I ball to help her out
Thеn I took her to the house
Sеxin' on the couch
I got her screamin', "Oh!"
What you talkin' 'bout?
'Cause this what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm a boss, I'm a boss, and I'm thicker than a horse
I be stingy, whip it, get it, just to piss a nigga off
If you test my floss, buyin' all my cars
What you talkin' 'bout?
This is what I'm talkin' 'bout

She a boss, yeah a boss, yeah she thicker than

Take her out, yeah take her out, I take her out
What you bout?
Cause that's what I'm bout
She's a boss
Thicker than 
Yeah that pussy good, but it's 
Turn that ass out, show her what I'm bout
Scoop her in the Benz, then fuck her on my couch
Let her roll the long way, dick her down the long way
 shawty,  fuckin' with that long cake
Hood but she classy, fine and she nasty
Never catch her in the same shit she had on last week
Can't let her walk past me
Put her in a Luie bag
Redbone stupid ass
Bad lil Rihanna swag
Take her out for 
Let her act 
Tell her bring a friend, one for me, and one for Gucci

I boss, then I ball
Yeah, she thicker than a horse
So I ball to help her out
Then I took her to the house
Sexin' on the couch
I got her screamin', "Oh!"
What you talkin' 'bout?
'Cause this what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm a boss, I'm a boss, and I'm thicker than a horse

I taste better than  with the sauce
I'll have you licking all your fingers, baby I'm a banger
I hope you got your change up
I'm a boss bitch, yeah you got that shit right
And you need a real chick like me in your life
Yeah I make big checks, but I'd rather spend your's
If you brag on my kitty, tell them how you 

I boss, then I ball
Yeah, she thicker than a horse
So I ball to help her out
Then I took her to the house
Sexin' on the couch
I got her screamin', "Oh!"
What you talkin' 'bout?
'Cause this what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm a boss, I'm a boss, and I'm thicker than a horse
I be stingy, whip it, get it, just to piss a nigga off
