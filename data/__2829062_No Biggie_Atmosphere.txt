9 ContributorsNo Biggie Lyrics
She said, "No biggie"
Territorial enough to try to build a wall around the whole city
Make it pretty with some Deutsch graffiti
Got a ex tattooed underneath the bikini
She was encyclopedia thick
She got a fanbase, everybody speak with a fist
And you can think about her till the heartbeat skips
Make sure you got the name up on the marquee big
I got such a bad feeling
The last time you heard me say that, we were burnt alive
Roadkill on the grill, gas turned up high
Stepped off the patio with the courage to fly
We all wanna find a bridge to the upside
While you pretend to be dead on the inside
Take a photo with the number one loser
Tryin' to get used to livin' in the future
Years ago you were a different you
Attitude of a hot bowl of cat food
Opened it up like, yeah motherfucker so what?
We all grow up, what happened to you, what's the holdupâ€‹?
You might also likeThrow your nose up bourgeois character
Trying to claim careless wearing an air freshener
You blow a lot of stink, I promise
You're not bold enough to take your mask off in the populace
So make believe, you ain't what you claim to be
It's obvious, painfully
Why you wanna play games with me?
I'm nobody act like you ain't plainly see
She only hears so she can hear you cry
I'm trying to cherish life, you're trying to steer on ice
I wanna put my DNA in your American pie
There's no life after death, I'm not ready to die
When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live for as long
When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live for as long
When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live for as long
For as long as I've been living it2Embed
