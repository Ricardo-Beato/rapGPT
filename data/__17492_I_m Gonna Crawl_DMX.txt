3 ContributorsIâ€™m Gonna Crawl Lyrics
Live and learn
Life's a lesson (life is a lesson)
And I'm the teacher

First I'm gonna crawl, uh (crawl)
Then I'm gonna walk, uh huh (walk)
Then I'm gonna stand, uh huh (stand)
Then I'm gonna talk, uh (talk)
What I gotta learn, what (learn)
In order to teach, (teach)
Then I gotta burn (burn)
In order to reach (reach), my nigga

Yo, I see what I see, day by day
Hoping that the Lord will pave my way
Have I been forgotten, have I forsaken
Or maybe I'm just wrong with the moves that I've been makin
Hatin others cuz they hate me, over envy
Wanna send me, when we used to be friendly
Think I started off on top? With multi-platinum albums?
Naw dog, I started off on the block
I just did shit to get shit
Niggas always knew I was down to hit shit
That's why I stay wit shit
Played with shit, but it wasn't a game
First time locked down, wasn't the same
A whole new world, nothin but clothes to steal
Niggas gettin split for real, miss a good meal
Can't call nobody, cuz don't nobody care
They got my back against the wall, fuck it I'm just here

First I'm gonna crawl
Then I'm gonna walk
Then I'm gonna stand
Then I'm gonna talk
What I gotta learn?
In order to teach
Then I gotta burn
In order to reach, (my nigga)

Dog it's like this, when the fog is type thick
A nigga might flip, and a nigga bite quick
But I stay focused on what's important
Supportin' my family, fuckin with my dogs and recording
According to the man upstairs, we all got our own problems
So why the fuck you worrying about theirs
Learned a long time ago, look away, niggas'll leave you
I hear none, speak none, see no, evil
All I can do is teach you, what I know
How I flow, how I get down, where I go
Maybe what I been through, will send you
Somewhere, other then where, dreams all out the window
I love my people, all of my people
And God gon keep me callin my people
You gots to live life to the fullest
It ain't always about the size of the gun, sometimes it's the bullet
First I'm gonna crawl
Then I'm gonna walk
Then I'm gonna stand
Then I'm gonna talk
What I gotta learn?
In order to teach
Then I gotta burn
In order to reach, (my nigga)

Every day we live and learn, take it step by step
And we create our own path, until there's no life left
I hold my death, off for as long as I can
Knowin my man, is plottin with the chrome in his hand
Supposed to be fam, but niggas get shady over money
My nigga, pull out the 380 over money
Crazy over money, can't do without it
I got other shit to deal with, I'm like forget about it
It's the one I don't know but must teach that comes first
Because he comes with the thirst of a nigga that had it the worst
It's like a curse that's to be lifted, he was there but he drifted
Got a call and he shifted, once he found out he was gifted
Gotta kick it from the heart, and I hope you got it
It was there from the start, I just hope you spot it
Cuz it's my blood on paper, my soul on paper
Words to live by will leave a hole in the paper
First I'm gonna crawl
Then I'm gonna walk
Then I'm gonna stand
Then I'm gonna talk
What I gotta learn?
In order to teach
Then I gotta burn
In order to reach, (my nigga)1Embed
