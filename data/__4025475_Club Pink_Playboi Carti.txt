16 ContributorsClub Pink Lyrics
Damn, damn, damn
Carti, Carti
Let it rain
Pink rain

Grip the .44 mag (Uh)
44 niggas at the door, hold the gats (Hold the gats)
Are you old (Are you old)? Where the cash?
Bitch, splash (Uh)
Straight mob on your ass
Body bags, zombie flesh
TFZ, fuck the rest
Got it for you, call for the homie, pour for the homie (Yeah)
I blow torch the heavens, do you smell that loud fragrance
Oh, God (Oh, God), we don't talk a lot (Uh-huh)
Unless I’m on that pot (Uh Huh)
But yeah, we cool (Bitch)
Swimming pool (Bitch)
Chilling with a goddess, she from a Island
My weed just took (Uh-huh), girl you ain't styling
Black specs (Yeah),gold on the rim
I ain't afraid, beam on your chest, I take your last breath
Bitch, like I stunt, I grind
Nose grind, I’m high off weed
I been third degree fine, Santa Clause red nose, bitch
Throat off the vlne, yeah
Yo, tell me how it feel
When the coke simulate your mind
She still vacant here, hit it from behind (Uh)
I don't hear these hoes, Van Gogh
Sports car, but I drive slow
Glanced at the refugee like who the fuck is you (Who the fuck is you)
Nigga, fuck your crew (Bitch)

Bad bitch (Bad bitch), she don't drink (She don't drink)

Got niggas on go 'cause they have to, cash rules
For the right price, they’d be glad to
Have you heard what you prefer
Don't talk, let you walk, anything'll work
Sipping on light pink, I think much different
Make a grown man devolve to an infant
With guns involved, our coverage goes missing
Your body get found, no revision
Don't judge me off what you see in the album
, then my Diesel is sour
On the herb, I’m an owl
Bitch, I'm a G, not a word with a vowel
Holy shit, Rollie my wrist
I'm holding her head, she holding my dick
Giving me head, still treat her like shit
I feed her the needle, bitch, I'm a prick
Sitting back corner, my niggas on that fuck shit
Just smoking on that loud, that's very disruptive
In the crowd, make it heavily function
Karats in my ear, blowing down on an onion
Just me and my niggas, we too real
Middle finger how you feel
(You try stop )
(With my nigga Carti, yeah)
Bad bitch (Bad bitch), she don't drink (She don't drink)
She just sip the pink (She just sip the pink)
Gave me brain, (Gave me brain)
Bad bitch (Bad bitch), she don't drink (She don't drink)
She just sip the pink (She just sip the pink)
Gave me brain, (Gave me brain)
Bad bitch (Bad bitch), she don't drink (She don't drink)
She just sip the pink (She just sip the pink)
Gave me brain, (Gave me brain)
Bad bitch (Bad bitch), she don't drink (She don't drink)
She just sip the pink (She just sip the pink)
Gave me brain, (Gave me brain)1Embed
