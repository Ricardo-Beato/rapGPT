8 ContributorsDead End Lyrics
808 Mafia
This beat is so sick, bitch
Yeah

I'm in the trap boy mansion on a dead end (Dead)
With them young niggas that'll bust your head in (Your head)
I got a trap house mansion in the fuckin' cul-de-sac (Uh)
And I'm peeping out the peephole, AK with the shoulder scrap (Grrow, grrow)
Had to fit in, it's a dead end
I heard the feds on me, you came to a dead end (What?)
They heard that Gucci Mane just bust a nigga head in (Woo)
And I ain't got no problem handcuffing a dead man (Nigga, what?)

Lot of time, I was seen in a red Benz
With a redbone bitch and her red friend (Woo)
Extendo want me, nigga
I go war with twenty, nigga
In all black, low doubt, like a ninja nigga
I'm in that butler bar spot by your mama house (Skrrt)
I heard your mom was calling the cops (Woo)
So now I'm moving out
The folks on me, I'ma turn it to a hundred, hoe (Yeah)
I'm in the kitchen whippin' the chicken like at Waffle House
You might also like
I'm in the trap boy mansion on a dead end (Dead)
With them young niggas that'll bust your head in (Your head)
I got a trap house mansion in the fuckin' cul-de-sac (Uh)
And I'm peeping out the peephole, AK with the shoulder scrap (Grrow, grrow)
Had to fit in, it's a dead end
I heard the feds on me, you came to a dead end (What?)
They heard that Gucci Mane just bust a nigga head in (Woo)
And I ain't got no problem handcuffing a dead man (Nigga, what?)

RIP to Dunky, was a dear friend (Yuh)
HOS for Aero Music, that's a dead end (Du-du)
Abort that mission if that shit don't bring no bread in (Woo, woo)
I say I'm broke, 'cause when you stuck, they bring the feds in (Woo, woo)
The way I ball, I think I should pay for the Redskins (Skrrt)
See in the streets, ain't no such thing as a best friend (Brrt)
You shopping Lenox, my niggas will be at the west end (Hood)
I'm outta space, like I relate to the Jetsons (Yeah)

I'm in the trap boy mansion on a dead end (Dead)
With them young niggas that'll bust your head in (Your head)
I got a trap house mansion in the fuckin' cul-de-sac (Uh)
And I'm peeping out the peephole, AK with the shoulder strap (Grrow, grrow)
Had to fit in, it's a dead end
I heard the feds on me, you came to a dead end (What?)
They heard that Gucci Mane just bust a nigga head in (Woo)
And I ain't got no problem handcuffing a dead man (Nigga, what?)Embed
