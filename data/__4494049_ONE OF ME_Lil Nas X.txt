I like this, I don't like that
Do this here, don't you do that
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah
I like this, I don't like that
Do this here, don't you do that
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah

Say you one of me, say you need the validation
Tell me that you think you won't top your last creation
Word on the block is you fell off and I'm just sayin'
If it ain't "Old Town Road," Lil Nassy, I ain't playin'
Nigga, just stick to what you best at
I suggest, make another one like this (Huh), yeah
Oh, I know it hurts your soul to know it was only luck, huh
If you drop a song, nigga, we won't give a fuck, no

I like this, I don't like that
Do this here, don't you do that
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah
I like this, I don't like that
Do this here, don't you do that
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah

You's a meme, you's a joke, been a gimmick from the go
All the things that you do just to get your face to show
Oh, you think you big shit, big pimpin', let me know
Ain't the next big thing, you the next thing to go
Now, can you prove yourself? Everybody waitin'
I'm just being real, swear somebody hatin'
I don't see you lasting long and that's just me being honest
Even if your album okay, it's floppin', that's a promise, oh

I like this, I don't like that
Do this here, don't you do that
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah
I like this, I don't like that
Do this here, don't you do that
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
