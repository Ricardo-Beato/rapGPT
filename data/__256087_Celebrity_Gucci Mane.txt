18 ContributorsCelebrity Lyrics

Gucci Mane my name ring in every hood
From hollywood to Englewood to Edgewood
I told her I can't fuck wit' her unless her head good
She said she couldn't fuck wit' me unless my bread good
R.I.P. to Dunk, free my nigga Scooter
Man I just pulled up to Crucial
In that car back to the future
Excuses Lu' Vins feeling on bitches booties wit' juicy booties
Fuck so many hoes in the club it caused a big confusion
Watch 6 figures who?
Earrings 6 figures too
Gucci you nigga you
Do what rich niggas do
Yea this beat by metro, yea its in stores in the enzo
Touch one button you talking 'bout presto
You niggas could never walk a mile in my retros

I got different nationalities
And they all got similarities
Baby I love your personality
I got different nationalities
Got a lot of similarities
I love a bitch wit' personality
Trynna make you niggas mad me
You might also like
Baby tell me what you want (baby what you want?)
I say can he say cunt (cunt)
I do the shit that he dunt (dunt)
My check one day, his check six months (oooh)
You see his trunk is in the back (de back?)
You see my trunk is in the front (foreign shit!)
I say blunt, he say junt (junt nigga?)
Spikes on my shoes look like I punt (field goal!)
Got rifles just like I hunt (I'm still huntin)
Evel kneivel I do stunts (stunt)
Watch so evil call the priest (hallelujah)
So pray for me, I'm in these streets (it's gucci)

I got different nationalities
And they all got similarities
Baby I love your personality
I got different nationalities
Got a lot of similarities
I love a bitch wit' personality
Trynna make you niggas mad meEmbed
