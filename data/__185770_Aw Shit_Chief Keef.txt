Aw shit, aw shit, aw shit, aw shit
Be cautious, be cautious, be cautious
They like, "Aw shit"
Huh?

Bitches see me, they like, "Aw shit", all my cars foreign (Skrrt)
All my niggas reckless (Yeah), don't run up on them (Nah)
My clique is enormous (O'Block), my bitch's ass is humongous (Damn)
This what them hoes say (Huh?) when I pull up on them (Sosa baby)
Aw shit, aw shit (064 baby), aw shit, aw shit (Huh? Huh?)
Aw shit, aw shit, aw shit, aw shit (GBE baby, O'Block)
Aw shit, aw shit, aw shit, aw shit (300, 600)
Aw shit, aw shit, aw shit, aw shit (Huh?)

Boy, please be cautious, Chief Sosa money talkin' (Shh)
If you ain't money takin' (Huh?) then why the fuck you talkin'? (Huh?)
I walk up in the club and them bottles get to sparkin' (Sosa baby)
Bitch, I don't drink (Nah), you can give that to my brothers (GBE baby)
Chief Sosa a reefer chiefer, get it from my momma
I fuck that nigga's bitch that he was undercover lovin' (Yeah)
I even fucked his cousin (Yeah), and that bitch gotta husband (Hmm)
I know I be stuntin' and I don't talk for nothin' (Hmm)
Bitch, I'm money huntin', you ain't got enough checks (Nah)
I leave niggas upset (Hmm) 'cause he ain't got nothin' (Nah)
My 24s they robbin' (Nah), I'm O'Block, 300 (Hmm, haha)
They see us, they like, "Aw shit, look at all the foreign" (Bang bang, bang, bang)
