84 ContributorsBitch Niggaz Lyrics
Some good-ass weed
Check it out Dog: this game is a motherfuckin' trip man
Word on the streets, everybody always tryin' to run up on me hollerin' about "Word on the streets is, this nigga said this"
Man, I don't give a fuck about what that nigga said man
That's what's wrong with you niggas
You niggas is just like bitches
Ho-ass niggas, talk too motherfuckin' much (Speak)
Stay to your own, get your own–you know what I'm saying'?
Be independent, nigga
Biatch

Yeah
Bitch niggas (Bitch niggas)
Bitch niggas (Bitch niggas)
Bitch-ass niggas (Beotch)
Bitch niggas (Bitch niggas)
Yeah, I'm talkin' about you (Beotch)
Bitch niggas
And you too (Biatch)
Hmm, Dogg

I meet mo' bitch niggas than hoes, look here
And I really don't know, but that's just how it go (damn)
Dogg, so many niggas like to keep up shit
And just like a bitch (beotch) niggas be talkin' shit (nigga)
Smilin' in my face and then they blast me in the back
(ka-ka-ka-ka-ka)
Niggas stay strapped from way back, cause payback
Will make niggas wanna pop that shit
If you ain't ready for the game (uh-uh) nigga stop that shit
We rock that shit, my nigga Dre, drop that shit (right)
No mo' talkn', I'm walkin' and I'm poppin' the clip
Glock on the hip, set-trippin', dippin' and shit
If you act like a bitch (nigga) nigga you get smacked like a bitch
You might also like
Bitch niggas, bitch niggas (Bitch niggas)
These niggas don't know what the fuck is goin' on
Yo Dogg, check it, kick back
Let me holler at these niggas for a minute

Straight off the streets of chaos and no pity
The aggravated, makin' these punk motherfuckers hate it
(Compton) is the city I'm from
Can't never leave the crib without a murder wea-pon
Huh, I can't live my life on broke no mo'
And most of these fools ain't shit but cutthroats
They smile in a nigga face, and for what?
They got the game fucked up, and want my thing fucked up
I done learned a lot, seen a whole lot
The top notch nigga, I'm fiendin' for that spot
Now peep game on what Six-Deuce told me...

These niggas after yo' paper, Dr. D-R-E (Wha?)
And these punk-ass hoes is lookin' for dough
You gotta watch your homeboys, cause a nigga never know
Oh, they'll be around, but when yo' paper get low
Just like Master P said, "There they go, there they go"
Bitch niggas, uh-huh
Attention all personnel:
Stop schemin', and lookin' hard
Stop schemin', and, an–, and, an–an–, and, and lookin' hard

Bitch nigga, a bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, hella bitch nigga
You's a bitch nigga, motherfucker bitch nigga
A bitch nigga, a bitch nigga
A bitch nigga

I know yo' type, so much bitch in you, if it was slightly darker
Lights was little dimmer, my dick be stuck up in yo' windpipe
Hmm, you'd rather blow me than fight, I'm from the old school
Like Romey Rome, homey, yo, you owe me the right
To slap you, like the bitch that you are, been wantin' to cap you
Every since you was mad doggin' me with that bitch in yo' car
Fool, "Who do you think you are? Mr. Big Stuff"
Man, you shit on Hitt, get yo' shit bust, plus
Pistol-whipped, cover it up, use yo' bitch's blush
Mr. Powder Puff yo', bark ain't loud enough, huh
I know Chihuahuas that's mo' rah-rah, ha ha
I have to laugh Dre, I bet he take bubble baths
You don't want no trouble with the Aftermath staff, trust me
Doggy Dogg, Diggy Doctor plus me
No you's a busta slash hussy, soft as a hush puppy
Must we break you down to estrogen most hated specimens
A bitch nigga
Stop schemin', and lookin' hard
Stop, stop, stop schemin', and lookin' hard
Stop, stop, ah, –op, –op, stop, sch–, sch–, schemin' and lookin' hard
Stop, stop, ah, –op, –op, stop, sch–, sch–, schemin' and lookin' hard
Stop schemin' an–, an–, an–, an–, an–, and lookin' hard
Stop schemin', and lookin' hard
Stop sche–, schemin', and lookin' hard
Stop schemin', and, and, and stop schemin', and lookin' hard12Embed
