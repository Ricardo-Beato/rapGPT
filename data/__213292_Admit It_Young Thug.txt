Unh Thugga Thugga Baby
Skypad with me
Shit I even got Kosher with me

I got to admit it(Woo)
I been getting money for a minute(Un huh)
Flow so sick they should admit me(Yeah)
This is gettin' ridiculous(Oh)
Hatin on me just cause of my riches(Swag)
Grown men actin' like bitches
I got to admit it(Bratt)
I been getting money for a minute(Un huh)
Flow so sick they should admit me(Ugh)
This is gettin' ridiculous(Ugh)
Hatin on me just cause of my riches(Swag)
Grown men actin' like bitches

Im on bleveland bleedin'
Yo ho wide receivin'
This work im receivin'
Im red like a demon
I know hot boys
Rob you for no reason
You can still shop
We'll call you young meanie
Smoke the pound and ball up paper
I'm yo  
My dick lost yo ho
Gone   it
Rich Kidz I see ya (Blagh)
Im geeked out my mind
I can't feel my spine
Girl watch yo' behind
Everybody call you a dime
Stop wasting my time
Do yo thang baby
Oh you too freaky
I brought my gang baby
You might also like
Meet me on the track
I got sports and rhymes
Any nigga try me its morphin' time
To any competition that's worth the time
Im the best new artist since  
I got bars but i didn't go to court for mine
Yo chick try to stack up like a porcupine
Archives B.N.T y'all support my grind
And we gone let it swag down until  
And this beat to raw close to kill
I already got 11 you can close the deal
How you gone be me
But you ain't "Ko" for real
I got big   
With that being said imma' flow for real
Tell em' you can keep the frames
They can throw the bill
If a boy beat me to a mic
Imma' show da' skills
If I ride on a track probably Kosher will
It's clearer thangs dont have to stay
Im on it and ain' gone have to pay
My team mean
Matter fact pass the plate
At the top we stuck like  baby
That  full of rhymes
So ain' got a child to pay
Money kidz thats all i had to say
And if you like come put it back
To the whole word
Gone bring it back like a 

Make no second chances
Hi haters
Niggas bitches might as well get some vibrators
They talk tough but they won't violate us
Them boys soft
Now And Laters
Ask why the call you skypad
Bitch i live till the sky pass
So fly get dressed on a launch pad
Rich nigga got a Benihana lunch pass
Got hoes in my rims like 
Im banging you throw Suwu
Still fuck wit' a nigga thats true blue
Im trippin' over money two troops
Ain' got not feelings for her
So I tell her fuck pass
Been in this shit so long i need butt pads(My ass hurt)
My team winning(Archives) first class(First Class)
Yall just predictions(Nigga)
