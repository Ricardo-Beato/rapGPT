Yo, man
It's Tony Revolori
What's good, we still on for this movie night tonight?
Hocus Pocus, bitch

Yo, Bob

Yo, Bob
How you doin'?

Yo, Bob

Just calling to check if we're still good for this movie night tonight

Que Pasa Mufasa?
It's Tony Revolori
What's up? Where you at?
I've been waiting outside for like, four hours now
Can you just like hurry up?
Just pick one pair of shoes and get your ass out here

And I miss you

Lemme know if you want 'em backEmbed
