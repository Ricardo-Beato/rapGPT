100 ContributorsZoom Lyrics
Pluto, yeah, yeah (Brr, brr)
Bought a drop-top Porsche, about to cut the top off
Trappin' is a sport young nigga get you knocked off
Hol' up

Turbo switchin' lanes (Brr), Hublot switch your watch (Brr)
Trappin' switch the spots (Brr, brr, brr), when you're runnin' hot
Feet on the gas (Gone) trappin' them bags (Pluto)
Run up a sack (Gone) and never look back (Brr, brr)
Shorty got miles on her (Pew, pew), I'm about to spaz in it (Boom, boom)
I ran it up fast (Zoom, zoom), I ran it up fast (Money machine)
I ran it up fast (Money machine), I ran it up fast (Money machine)
I ran it up fast (Money machine), I ran it up fast (Brr)

I secure the bag first (Brr, brr), I'm ready to boast (Ready to go, yeah)
I secure the bag first, I'm full of that dope (Full of that dope, yeah)
Courtside with a mink, yah, Pee Wee Kirkland in the sink (Shiing)
Five karats, one link (Err), both hands full of ink (Brr)
Money drying in your hand (Brr), wrap the bale in Saran (Brr)
My yellow bitch want a tan, I just landed from Japan (Pew)
Tokyo and Korea (Pew), Panamera to the Lear (Pew)
Yellow mellow with the gold (Gold), fishscale with these hoes (Let go)
Mossberg, I'm drinkin' mud (Pluto), put a hit out on a dub (Yah)
Bought my lil' nigga 12 slugs (Yah), just to shine bright when he mug (Yah, yah)
I just bailed out ol' Buice (Woo), 20 pills goin' hyphy (Yah)
Oh you lookin' real icy (What?), boy you know you nothin' like me
You might also like
Turbo switchin' lanes (Brr), Hublot switch your watch (Brr)
Trappin' switch the spots (Brr, brr, brr), when you're runnin' hot
Feet on the gas (Gone) trappin' them bags (Pluto)
Run up a sack (Gone) and never look back (Brr, brr)
Shorty got miles on her (Pew, pew), I'm about to spaz in it (Boom, boom)
I ran it up fast (Zoom, zoom), I ran it up fast (Money machine)
I ran it up fast (Money machine), I ran it up fast (Money machine)
I ran it up fast (Money machine), I ran it up fast (Brr)

I gave her the raw lean
They sound like my offsprings (Yeah)
Nitro gasoline (Pew)
Bought some more money machines (Brr)
Bring out a brand new machine (Brr)
I bought a whole lot of bling (Hol' up)
Treat me like Weezy and Baby (Pluto)
Treat me like Mannie and Turky (Turky)
I was the Juve with work on me (Juve)
I had to cop it and purchase (Hol' up)
I put more ice in the Date today (Huh)
Rockin' these Prezzies and Cartier (Huh)
I got it in flooded and plain Jane (Huh)
I made my young niggas insane (Huh)
Crunchin' them Xans up and then drink (Crunchin' them)
Get you a Draco and then crank it (Brr)
Saudi Arabian, Ben Franklin (Brr)
Leave it to me, they would've been stained 'em (Brr, brr)
Saditty in back, we done got acquainted (Yo)
You see the dash? They gotta see me (Yo)
I ran it up fast, they can't see me (Huh)
I wasn't surfin' with you (I wasn't surfin' with you)
I buy them Birkins for you (I buy them Birkins for you)
I go to surgery with you (I go to surgery with you)
Turbo switchin' lanes (Lanes, brr), Hublot switch your watch (Brr)
Trappin' switch the spots (Brr, brr, brr), when you're runnin' hot
Feet on the gas (Gone) trappin' them bags (Pluto)
Run up a sack (Gone) and never look back (Brr, brr)
Shorty got miles on her (Pew, pew), I'm about to spaz in it (Boom, boom)
I ran it up fast (Zoom, zoom), I ran it up fast (Money machine)
I ran it up fast (Money machine), I ran it up fast (Money machine)
I ran it up fast (Money machine), I ran it up fast (Brr, yah)
