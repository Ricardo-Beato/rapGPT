3 ContributorsThe Stick Up Lyrics
DJ CapCom is risking his life by playing this song

This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker?
This a stick-up, put them hands in the air
Let me get that there, uh
This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker?
This a stick-up, put your hands in the air
Let me get that there, uh

I'm a smooth criminal (Criminal), put your life on critical (Uh-huh)
Move miracles, smokin' blue medicinals (Yep)
Duckin' 'cause the jakes (Uh-huh) still know the hustle for the cake (Uh-huh)
Seekin' somethin' I can take, like all the money in the bank (Cheah)
Guns, check, bags, check, suits, ammo, and masks, check
Now we ready to go, waitin' for the driver
Got a homie watchin' cops like MacGyver (Haha)
I'ma try to go by the book
Captain Hook, I'ma crook, look (Look)
Stealin' just a hobby, son (Uh-huh), and it's a lot of fun (Cheah)
You need a Tommy gun? I'ma go and cop me one
Life's been nice (Been nice), but you don't live twice (Live twice)
So when they give you a chance, you better spin dice
Takin' it all, doin' it big, duckin' from the boys in blue and the pigs
Arrive (Arrive) at 19th and 5th Street
Look at the bank, give a Grinch grin, big cheeks
Stealin' more than Christmas, cheddar by the pound
Robbin' and stealin', then coppin' them wheels, then lettin' off a round (Cheah)
Tip-toe on that pink panther tip
Don't panic, bitch, and everyone will get a hand of chips (Haha)
Slide to the entrance, walk up to the stairs
Start shootin' our guns up in the air, this a

This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker? (Ayo, fuck Josh Everette)
This a stick-up, put your hands in the air (Uh)

You heard the man, this a demand, come up out them pockets (Yep)
Empty out ya wallets, necklaces, and watches (Haha)
All the guap and don't call the cops
I'd hate to have to watch as you all get shot, ha
There's someone at the door, knock-knock-knock-knock
Good thing we got the door locked (Haha)
Now show me to the vault (Vault), show me to the cash
Been rippin' and spittin' this right, you don't even gotta ask (Uh-huh)
Got class like a mobster, high school Sinatra (Sinatra)
Stay relaxed with a hit from the ganja
Calm, cool, collected, told Billy to shoot
Bullet shot through the air; Gimme the loot! Gimme the loot! (Haha)
The bank teller (Teller), well, he took us to the back
Lookin' like a black cat crossed his cat
Well, that's exactly what we goin' for (Uh-huh)
Pulled out his key to open the door
There was money to the ceilin' (Ceilin'), cake skyscrapers (Skyscrapers)
Enough paper to pay five Lakers
Gold and silver, diamonds and jewels (Jewels)
Anything you wanted you could find in this room (Gimme that)
Now my whole team rich, I don't believe this
This them straight-up Ocean's Thirteen shit
Jesse James, gettin' change, I'm an outlaw
And my boys let 'em bang, pull 'em out, draw!
With all this thoughts about livin' like gaudy (Gaudy)
We forgot about them people in the lobby (Lobby)
Told the posse, "It's time to break"
The cake piles down the aisle of the bank, uh
This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker?
This a stick-up, put them hands in the air
Let me get that there, uh
This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker?
This a stick-up, put your hands in the air
Let me get that there, uhEmbed
