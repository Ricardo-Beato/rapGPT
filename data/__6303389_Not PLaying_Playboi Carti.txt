Out of here, outer space
Pussy all on my face
Money down for my case
I can't lie, life's great
I can't lie, life's great
Yeah, you know this shit been good
Yeah, you know I'm from the hood
But I made it out that hood
But I made it out the wood
Smokin' on dope every day as I should
Countin' up money every day as I should
Fuckin' on hoes every day as I should
I'm a big boss, yeah, I feel like Suge
Don't care 'bout the cost, I'ma make the bitch plug
I can bet, make the bitch ride on that
Her nigga walked in, had a heart attack
I'm 800, I'm part of that
Wе got the same opps screamin' "follow back"
Wе shoot at these niggas, no poppin' back
I'm hittin' the trigger, I'm off of that
They copycat see, copycat Vamp
I light the bitch up just like a lamp
I had a red flag before I was stamped
Niggas dyin' by hoes, niggas dyin' by tramp
We can shoot at the bitch, shoot at the camp
Shoot at that bitch, shoot at his camp
Shoot at that bitch, shoot at his camp
Shoot at that bitch, we shoot at his camp
My shooter gon' shoot, he gon' shoot
My shooter gon' shoot at ya
My shooter gon' shoot at…
My shooter gon' shoot you, yeah
I gotta go bananas one time
I fucked a bitch in Panama
She gonna be here tomorrow
