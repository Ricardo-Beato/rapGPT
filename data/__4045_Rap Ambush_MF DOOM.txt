25 ContributorsRap Ambush Lyrics
So we're gonna stand on perimeter
We did have some shots fired right down the street on us
While this was goin on, so we gotta set up a tight perimeter
We got the streets blocked off
To make sure we don't have any drivebys on us
Other than that, the operation went fairly well
Hell no, this shit is crazy
Where is it they're coming from?
I don't believe that shit

Who told you that? Rolled through, brrat!
Old to the new knows who holds the hat
Custom tailored fitted, head stayed same size
Big since first born, well spitted game wise
Same guy, same disguise
Sick aim eye stare at thick dame thighs, click claim prize
And the lucky contestant was sent
A whole year's supply of buckets of yucky excrement
Digital format, provide the ROM
Ride calm, flow was like a roadside bomb (Woo)
Flipped the Humvee, impact was limb-numbing
Cameraman wig back, gunner screaming "Incoming!"
RPG, rhyme propelled grenade
Time to yell, scramble for cover in the shade
Bright as the midday sun, then it fade
Darkness come quick, some run and get sprayed
Rot dead, hot lead, it's rainin'
Left 'em with they brains kicked in with they trainin'
Dragged the remains into the open by the bootstraps
Dog tag attached to explosive human booby traps
Where's air support? Ears ringin', mortars whistlin'
Bloodshot vision, afterthought: abort mission
Too little too late, as the last man gush
Took no prisoners mush, rap ambush
