7 ContributorsX-tasy Lyrics
Read between the lines
Ecstasy, a place of fulfillment and fantasies
Where your dreams become realities
Mhm, ecstasy
It enhances your most inner desire
To become more free with your guts and feelings
E-E-E-ecstasy

Boy, let me free your mind, lets hook up tonight
Take you on a flight, high, high
Make you warm inside, I won't waste your time
My love is so divine, it feels like I'm on

Ecstasy, I'm willing, to do the things I said I wouldn't do
On ecstasy, the feeling makes me feel like I'm in love with you

Boy look into my eyes, I'm so energized
Make it last long time, touch me
Everything feels sweet, my body feel your breeze
Up all against me, it feels like I'm on

Ecstasy, I'm willing, to do the things I said I wouldn't do
On ecstasy, the feeling makes me feel like I'm in love with you
You might also like
Oh, it feels like I'm on, ecstasy
You got my body jumpin' and doin' something
Feel so free, I feel like making love to you
So what you wanna do? (Ah, ah, ah)
Ecstasy, you got my body jumpin' and doin' something
Feel so free, I feel like making love to you
So what you wanna do? (Ah, ah, ah)

Ecstasy, I'm willing, to do all the things I said I wouldn't do
On ecstasy, the feeling makes me feel like I'm in love with youEmbed
