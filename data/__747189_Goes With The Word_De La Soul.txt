5 ContributorsGoes With The Word Lyrics
It goes with the word, it goes with the word
It goes with the word, it goes with the word

Yo, everybody's sayin'
What to do when suckin' lunatics start diggin' and chewin'
They don't know that the Soul don't go for that
Potholes in my lawn
And that goes for my rhyme sheet
In which I concentrated so hard on, see
Don't ask for maximum security
Eh yo my dwellin' is swellin'
Lit my bud when I happened to fall into a spot
Where no ink or an ink-blot was on my scroll
I just wrote me a new mot
But now it's gone
Cause those punks knew that I hate
To recognise when they come through
And leave with the words


I've found that it's not wise
To leave my garden untended cause eyes
Has now pardoned all laws of privacy
Even paws are after my writer
See, I've pursued that everyone's sayin'
What to do when suckers are preyin'
On my well-guarded spreadsheets
Oh why, hell does it send up fleets
Of evil-doers through the big hole
Give them evil-doers who dig holes
Which leaves my lawn with lawn-chew
I think I'd better plant traces, give clues
Or better yet call 911
They get here I inform them I'm the Plug One
Of the plug cheer and let them realize the reason
For concern of the Soul
But yo check it, we gon' do it like this
You might also like
Ain't no Dilla like the one I got
No one can do shit better
His beats held the DNA of hip hop
And kept it hot like a thermal sweater
Can't duplicate it so just leave it alone
Nah, you can't duplicate the sound, boy
He has a universal sound but the D was his home
The D was his home (Mo-Town)
The D was his home (Mo-Town)
(This is the City of Detroit in the state of Michigan)
(This ain't no muthafuckin' cinema, bitch)Embed
