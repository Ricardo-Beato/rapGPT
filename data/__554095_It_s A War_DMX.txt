2 ContributorsItâ€™s A War LyricsWhere you at, baby?
I don't hear you!
I don't hear you!
I see those! I see those (laughs)
There's a lot of motherfuckers in here, dog
Yeah
Is it on? (Crowd: YEAH!)
Is it on? (Crowd: YEAH!)
IS IT ON? (Crowd: YEAH!)
C'mon! Uh! C'mon! What?
Is y'all motherfuckers ready for the ruff ryde!
When I speak I'm understood, my decision is wood
See what I'm able to see, 'cause my vision is good
It's like I see through the eyes of a wise old man
So I chill, and when I can kill this guy's whole fam
Something better to be thought dumb and remain silent
Then to open your mouth and remove (?) 'cause if it came violent
See I'm gonna give it to you straight, so you don't ask anymore
You don't really want what you
(Man: Asking me for)
It's a war when it's on it's on, when I'm long
Till I'm gone and I ain't got long
But while I'm here, y'all niggas gonna burn
Be (?) after this money and y'all niggas gonna learn
All this fucking weak you've been talking about that driveby
And they did nothing but
(Man: Driveby's)
Listen shorty I'm telling you this for your own good
Everybody is the man in they own hood, for real

Or do my dogs run this motherfucka? (YEAH!)
Do my ladies run this motherfucka? (YEAH!)
Or do my dogs run this motherfucka? (YEAH!)
Uh-huh!
I don't hear you!
I don't hear you!
Arf arf arf! Arf! Arf!Embed
