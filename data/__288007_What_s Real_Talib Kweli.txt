What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya

I'mma start this story, my influence so enormous
Got that shit you love to sing along with like every line is the chorus
I'm born in Brooklyn like Biggie, I'm born in Brooklyn like Jordan
I'm born in Brooklyn like Tyson, you don't live this, you just a tourist
We ride or die for them corners, fuck your private life they spy on us
When they catch us man it's like practice for the new tactics that they try on us
Them cops are lining them coffers, why we get shot we lying in coffins
They want my demise cause when I arrive they stop for lines so often
Nigga just stop, you might as well forfeit, we like Shia LaBeouf so lawless
Still recognize real, real recognize real like the car I'm driving you foreign
My diamond cut so flawless, no not jewels, I'm talking 'bout songs, bitch
So if they after me like I'm Lauryn, I just tell the feds that I'm Moorish
We walking, all the girls is talking
Generally they butt fucking naked just like the Book of Mormon
We see the trees for them forest, my name ring them bells like a doorman
Y'all niggas game is so corny, that's why you grill them hoes just like Foreman, boring

What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya

Paper chasing we on that grind, reputation on the line
Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time
Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time
Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time
Explore and discover what most fear, I will never wait till the brush clear
Swear I will never get stuck here, America, fuck yeah
Measure my career in dog years, my passport got them dog ears
I set sail, travelling the world like Jesus was doing in his lost years
I might give you the pill like Morpheus, I'm like the P.E. logo in the cross hairs
Standing out cause there's nothing but whores here, pimps rock crocodile like false tears
Bring it on through your force field, I'll be giving you nothing but the raw deal
What I say on display is the purest skill, I'll be giving y'all niggas what's more real
What's more real, what's more real? I got chicks fighting like floor sales
You gossiping bloggers all fail, like at the yardstick measuring your tall tales
And you on all fours you small scale, all in between the legs like a dog's tail
You are what you eat, you don't want no beef, you completely vegan like all kale
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya
