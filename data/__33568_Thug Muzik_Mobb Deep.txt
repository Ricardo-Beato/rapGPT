16 ContributorsThug Muzik Lyrics
The Infamous all around and you know we get down
So everybody hit the ground before you hear the loud sound
Thug Muzik, Thug Muzik

On this loose-leaf, my big ink describe foul lives
Snake eyes ready with steel at any given time
I kill, stone-hearted nigga at will
Dunn, this shit real, riddle in a life appeal
And losing again for real like Armageddon
Tec sweating your direction, your face change complexion
My whole life been destined, as sure as the moon shaped crescent
Caressing these raps like back rubs in bathtubs
I'm blessin', mics of all types, learn a lesson
The Infamous strike deadly like gas chambers and bangers in jail
You know the drill, QB on the hill where I chill
41 side still real, it ain't gone change
My niggas think long range, crack a skull frame
Simple and plain, fake niggas want claim fame
Real niggas up north, the Rock, Sing Sing
It don't make a diff, dunn, first nigga riff, dunn
We hit dunn, make his whole shit numb
Run up with my gun up
Nigga, you be done up right, QB at the end of the night
Team'll serve
You might also like
The Infamous all around and you know we get down
So everybody hit the ground before you hear the loud sound
Thug Muzik, Thug Muzik

What's your position?
Trying to come at me sideways
But they ass backwards, jealousy, that's all that is
I see that shit a mile away, but it's all gravy
One little glitch and your plan getting hit, baby
I got enough for you butt niggas laying in the cut
Like a pit never give up
Character ass, amateur ass, damage your ass
With a touch of class, handle that ass
Two aluminum bats, ruin them cats, two exclusive gats
Doing them cats, my crew's in the back, losing it, black
I be that bald cat, shining with the black gat hidden close to my back
My whole click stay strapped
On some Queensbridge survival shit, we strike like that
Full force, we blast at your main source

The Infamous all around and you know we get down
So everybody hit the ground before you hear the loud sound
Thug Muzik, Thug Muzik
As I sit back, dunn, I think about my past
When my moms had no cash, and my first time catching crabs
Or at the time when my brother got splashed
It hurt my ass, to see him pass
But now I gotta keep it moving to get this cash
You better kill his ass, if you wanna pass
These premises full of menaces, kid
Called The Infamous; forgive but we never forget
All that fake snake shit, kid, I never regret
'Cause I learn from mistakes that be guiding my steps
But we pull out and cock twice nigga
When you least expect
(Chinky: Thug Muzik, Thug Muzik)

The Infamous all around and you know we get down
So everybody hit the ground before you hear the loud sound
Thug Muzik, Thug Muzik

It's Murda Muzik, real life situations, placed on the paper
For all you cats rapping acting like it can't happen
Nigga, we the most infamous
My team glows in the dark, your clique's the dullest
Overconfident niggas get punished
Take a number and get on line for drama
You whiling like you was one of my own
That shit don't mix, we clashing
Make moves, handle your biz
Gun pose, take action, reach for those
Long chrome noses up, my gun blows
Your legs turn noodles, you shot a few going down
I give you that much, you went out
Close but no ci-gar, you must be a fucking retard
Extending your arm in my direction, you better squeeze hard
My rank is that of utmost respect
Y'all niggas only know what you heard on cassette
Manifest words in the flesh
Niggas always see the light after they bleed a few pints
Take your most VP dunn, leave them like the letter T
You won't see me run, unless it's police
Now, take these words home and think it through
'Fore the next rhyme we write might be about you, dunn
To all you niggas, don't so confuse it
The Infamous is giving you Thug Muzik
To all you niggas, don't so confuse it
The Infamous is giving you Thug Muzik7Embed
