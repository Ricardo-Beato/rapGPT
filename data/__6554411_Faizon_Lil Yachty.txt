(Wake up, F1lthy)
Brrt
Yoom
It's us (Fuck these weird-ass niggas, man)
You know it's us (Brrt)

Yeah (Slatt)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's us
Look
Damn (For real)

I just sipped a cold pint, now my day gone (Uh)
If you really got some pressure, nigga, say somethin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All my life I put love last like Faizon
Free all of my niggas locked up like Akon

I be on bullshit, I need revenge, gotta step on somethin' (Step)
She not talking pregnancy when she said she do baby bumps
Eighty different sticks up in my house, so that's like eighty drums
I been hanging 'round Bloods my whole life, so fuck it, make me one (Brrt)
Making two-four-five, going double profit
Yeah, Lil Boat, bitch, I'm known to make it catastrophic
By the way, every bitch a squirter just like how'd I work the faucet? (Damn)
I'm done with all these bitches, I got the gold, I'm off the market, yeah

I just sipped a cold pint, now my day gone (Yeah)
If you really got some pressure, nigga, say somethin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All my life I put love last like Faizon
Free all of my niggas locked up like Akon

We ain't never won shit before now
I ain't ever left my gun in the house
Nigga try some funny shit, it's going south (On God)
Say the wrong thing, my nigga runnin' in your mouth
Niggas shouldn't even speak on swag
I'm the quicker picker upper like a Bounty's ad
You niggas act like us, lil' boy, get it through your head
I'm not Jordan Carter, nigga, but I sip a whole lot of (Blatt)
