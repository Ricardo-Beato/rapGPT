9 ContributorsCanâ€™t Hold Us Back Lyrics
"Today we are together, we are unified and on runnin' cower
When we are together we got power
That is why we gathered today, celebratin' our own"

We spit flows on foes
Listen to the message that you never know
Got a plan for the man and it's federal
The rhyme animal, back to play the part again
Clear the madness, and put the message in
D, the Enemy is back to rip the mic
We come together, so don't believe the hype
Check my tone, there's a war here at home
We united and strong, and never move alone

We rep justice, equality and freedom now
Put fam first, man, woman and child
Never mild, keep it hostile 'til we raise
Where we say, what we mean and we mean what we say
It's been a long time comin' that we mob as one
Guerrilla Funk, Hard Truth nigga, that's what's up
No peace on the street 'til the justice come
From the ballot to the bullet, if it's on, it's on
You might also like
I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
See, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Believe, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
That's real talk on the one

Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm a target, I got proof
My buildin' got an 'X' on it
Bloomberg threw the hex on it
It's like a pistol with effects on it
On a nigga with arrest warrants
Hittin' pigs in their chests Quadrant where they vest wasn't
Now he dead cousin
All you snitches hit the red buttons, we some Uncle-Tom killers
Mini-nina concealers, political cap-peelers for this freedom for rilla

Yo, if police stop the whip you got to eat them trees
I ain't got no 'G' to give it to them crackers and court fees
You know my steez, security first, prepare for the worst
Never caught slippin' if you stay on alert
Malcolm X said send them to the cemetery if they touch you
A revolutionary virtue, a dull blade'll hurt you
I'm up early workin' my machete
In war, it ain't no warning, you just got to be ready
I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
You see, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me, yeah, uha

Yeah, my nigga it's bigger than rap
You really think you gon' be left alone
On sayin' that you believe and ain't gon' have to get your scrap on?
Then yap on, and will see if that's the right route
While I get my clap on and turn niggas' lights out
I tried to be nice, now we gon' have to bleed them
I'm willin' to do a killin' for the price of freedom "that's right"
Comin' from the left, nigga, hood is how we kept it "right"
So prison or death is just somethin' I done accepted
So we'll murder a snake, and we'll kill a skunk "that's right"
This ain't the word of a fake, it's Guerrilla Funk
So right now is the time and you turf the location
Y'all about to see the Rebirth Of a Nation
Even if some got de-rebelized
The revolution still will not be televised
U.S. Government tellin' hell of lies
And it's evident, when you look in this president's devil eyes
I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Yeah, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
No homie, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me

That's real talk on the one

That is why, I challenged you now
To stand together, raise your fists together
And engage in our national black ??
Do it for courage and determination..
I AM, "I AM" - SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I AM, "I AM" - SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I MAY BE POOR "I MAY BE POOR"
BUT I AM, "BUT I AM" SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I MAY BE ON WELFARE "I MAYBE ON WELFARE"
BUT I AM, "I AM" SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I MAY BE UNSKILLED "I MAY BE UNSKILLED"
BUT I AM, "BUT I AM" SOMEBODY "SOMEBODY"
I AM "I AM" BLACK "BLACK" BEAUTIFUL "BEAUTIFUL" PROUD "PROUD"
I MUST BE RESPECTED "I MUST BE RESPECTED"
I MUST BE PROTECTED " I MUST BE PROTECTED"
WHAT TIME IS IT?  "NATION TIME"
WHEN WE STAND TOGETHER, WHAT TIME IS IT?
WHEN WE SAY NO MORE ??? WHAT TIME IS IT?
WHAT TIME IS IT?
WHAT TIME IS IT?
