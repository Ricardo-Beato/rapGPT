6 ContributorsPoetry Lyrics
I seen the light, yeah

D-d-d-die about me
Oh gee, it can't be defined by me
When I set it in motion
Never question the motive
Mhm, mhm

Whether facing the East or facing the beast
I'ma keep fighting 'til the world say, "Peace"
Hollywood guilt put a nigga in grease
I'm God-bodied but devil's in the deets
But still I listen when Mohammad speaks
And get a good work when PT preach
My mama used to teach so it's lessons to learn
Before I step and repеat, I step and I earn
I met a girl's daddy, hе was kept in a urn
The world as we knew it, it was destined to burn
My success is a verb, it's a blessing to serve
My presence is heard, I'm investing in words
Like Nikki Giovanni or Amiri Baraka
Jessica Care Moore, Morgan Parker
Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison
Poetry in motion, we moving forward today
You might also like
D-d-d-die about me
Oh gee, it can't be defined by me
When I set it in motion
Never question the motive
Mhm, mhm

We walk-walk the line and talk-talk the rhyme
It's from the sky, it's often a sign
I stomped into time, not to fall in line
What's bound in Heaven, on Earth, I'll buy
I combine strength, poetic liberation
In a nation that asks me for identification
I'm a Haitian, I'm Jamaican
I'm forsaken, I'm mistaken identity
I'm Medgar Evers' memory
I'm my father's good and bad tendencies
I'm a man that love music but don't love the industry
Don't like when fake folk grin at me
I love Public Enemy
I love the messages my love be sending me
Chicago chase so I love being finicky
Love calling him "Cuzzo", even if he ain't kin to me
Love drinking wine while my homie drink Hennessy
I love poetry when it becomes infinity
D-d-d-die about me
Oh gee, it can't be defined by me
When I set it in motion
Never question the motive
Mhm, mhm
