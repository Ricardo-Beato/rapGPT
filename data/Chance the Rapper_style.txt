Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking

Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'ma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack
And a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too189Embed
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit

Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit

What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why God phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter, wonder if I would follow Him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot of off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
You know what I mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck, bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News"
Booyaka buckle up, motherfuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool

With my drawers hid but my hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold

In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole

But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe
Nice to see you, Father New Year

Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance, not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block underarms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas, hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously, they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us, we tryna get lucky, doper than Lucky
You're ending happy, that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating, shit come hot, but y'all still love me
Ugh, how Father Time a deadbeat? Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, igh

What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your xan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love

Murdering merch and events

And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account

Angels (Na-na, na-na, ah)

I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal, man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Ah, ah, ah, ah for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Couldn't stop me, but it slowed me, though
Yeah, a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me, though
Damn, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the do-si-do
'Til they fuck around, sign me to OVO
Ooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split a atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day, but I spent my night-time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages
But never got no hear-back or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud
Couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a lifeline
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali'll swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament?
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures and gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie
Mystery Babylon tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground48Embed

If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh-igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam

We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother footwork, your play sister juke
The Rink was the place, but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shorties with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'

Rollin' with your party, so tell me what you thinkin'

We never rolled at the Rink, we would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more, you just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down," Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean, it's just dancing, it's harmless as fuck

Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone

Lord rain down on me so I can move on water

You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God, seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love

I may cry a river (I may cry a thousand tears, but)
But You take each drop and You wash (You wash me new)
Me new (People sing)
This water is deep (Yes, yes and I need You to)
Jesus, rescue me (Come on, save me, I need You to)
Take me to Your mountain (Hallelujah)

I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as mama's hands
Running water standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold like Nat King
I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous, unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label, pro-famous
I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me, but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shorty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public
I speak to God in public, He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music

Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
It's so natural
Tastes like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh

Birdman handrub
This shit fit me like a damn glove
Shit cleaner than a hand scrub
Feel better than DJ Khaled fan love
This the rock that gave pride to a man cub
Ain't no love in hip-hop
There ain’t no keepin' up with the Bennetts
Ain't no diamonds in the chain but it’s in the pendant
I only own fishbowls, but my rentals tinted
You know I'm used to movin' units like a rental tenant
Real lieutenant, God's army
He like a doctor, he'll never let a shot harm me
I'm a force in the field, I never take damage
I create panic 'cause niggas wanna act fake satanic
And the labels get straight frantic
Their boardrooms look like eight Channing Tatums and a Peyton Manning
And they all been married
They celebrate anniversaries and nurseries and try to play Santa
But they don't sell marriage no more
Guess bein’ all alone ain’t so scary no more (Guess not)
Guess our lives ain't for sharin’ no more
Guess the tale can't end like a fairy no more, but...

Don't misconstrue my offerings to offer new advice
If I said it, I meant it

I'll leave you my last name I left on the last plane
Too much baggage but you can carry on Bennett
I just wanna make sure that my words touch you

7 PM thoughts in my home
Who to put in my will, who to put in my won't
Some people my blood, some people my flesh
That's the difference 'tween catch and fetch
I don't want nobody to be at my wedding
That won't be there for my marriage
They can see that shit on Facebook
They can like it, they can share it
Like, "Look at that lil' dress and how she wear it
I thought that pregnant belly prolly tear it"
"You know they only did this shit for money"
"I know one day that they just gon' co-parent"
"I gotta zoom in, count up all the carats"
"I know that nigga probably went to Jared"
"I know that nigga probably so embarrassed"
But they don't know nothin', baby
That's why I tell you when I say it, I say
Don't look down, don't look down
When they, when they try and make up all that bullshit
I just tell you
Don't look down, don't look down
And when we goin' towards the sky, when we get into that atmosphere
Don't look down, don't look down
And when they go into the comments, we like a comet

Roosters calling in the distance

It was all us crammed in the house
Back when my dad was the man of the house
A lot of dads left, they abandoned the house
My dad Joe Jack, start a band in the house
He said one friend, one friend in the house
Only one friend in the whole wide world
One day will come when you only have each other
Never give it up for a boy or a girl
We come in peace but we don't come in pieces
We on some tag-team WWE shit
We look just alike, the prestige is so prestigious
The splitting image of Lupita standing on them beaches
Don't tweak and don't be facetious
Those shells'll shred you to pieces
These niggas faking like demons
But I'ma send 'em to Jesus (It's just me and my bro)
Versus all of you heathens
They think I'm reading Ephesians
I have all these niggas hiding, avoiding meetings like vegans
I got the keys like I'm Keegan
I'll line the trunk with the bleach
And I'll leave you inside the freezer and let you chill for the weekend
But forget over the weekend and come back inside a month
And I throw you inside the trunk but it's plastic so it ain't leakin'
But we can be cool
We can be cool
Me and my brother
We can be cruel
Find your ass
Line your ass up
Go to work on 'em

Back when Chance was the man of the house
Baseball bats if they ran in the house
We from out south like birds in the clouds
When I was eleven, heard my homie dad died
This shit deeper than music, I got PTS for life
So if you do production just make sure the drums right
The independent Bennetts will never need your advice
Our image won't diminish 'cause Charlie and Marley right
Me and Chano like Peschi and Robin's life
A made man, we just makin' the songs right
You just makin' the song hype
I really snapped, the last time I rapped I was movin' packs
In adolescence, seen ambulances, learned other lessons
Catchin' blessings, overstretchin' from first-hand impressions
Chano called my phone voicemail, hope he don't get a message
Heard that I exit from my axis off that intersection
So if you say somethin' 'bout big bro, bitch, I'ma smack you reckless
We from down south, we bogus twice and we are not from Texas
One more rep, can't run around strapped, so I walk around like pedestrian
Chi-town summer lookin' like my numbers, and you know how I'm bomin', ain't checkin' it
Called big bro, now we run it up, set it up, get it up, nigga, now let's begin
OTF, free Durk and them

My baby mama went celibate
Lies on my breath, she say she couldn't take the smell of it
Tired of the rumors, every room had an elephant
Tryna find her shoes, rummagin’ through the skeletons
She took away sex, took me out of my element
I tried to do the single-dad mingle-dance
At the club with the iron in my wrinkled pants
You could fall much faster than you think you can
Big hands for my ring, I'ma need a Pringles can
I just want the shine back like a Eagles fan
My ego like, "Ah damn, there he go
Prayin' again, again, the same ol’ thang"
I mean, I ain't gon' promise that the pain go away
And you can take your sweet time, but she ain't gon' wait
'Cause a new coat of paint don't make the stain go away
But he go high (We love You, God)
And we go high
They go low, we go…
Higher, higher

Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

Well we must be some zanies and fools
To  take a gamble on this love just like we do
What  a wonderfully crazy thing to do
Love like magnets, we were powerless to choose
I'm so powerful every time I look at you
No  memory of anything I couldn't do
It's  possible, so possible

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Once upon a time I was unsure of myself
I would always claim I never had no help
Looking to the mirror, the most unfair of all
Hit  the Player's Ball, it was unbearable
Another big birthday, another milestone
To make your birthstone feel like rhinestone
The caterpillars that had burrowed inside my belly
Started to flutter before I learned how to fly
I had a bunch of midlife crises 'fore I turned twenty-five
The teachers put me in the back row, I was learning to hide
'Cause when the teachers call you special, that's the perfect disguise
I had to bury all the dancing that would burgeon inside
I got quiet, thought that silence was the perfect reply
I turn to Casper any time a nigga turn on the slide
Until I turned up at the talent show, a permanent high
I had Jesus behind the wheel before I learned how to drive
'Cause it's poss'...

Once upon a time, a lady who tried twice
At being a good wife and giving a good life
To both of her lil' girls with ballerina tights
She called up the RE/MAX and opened her own site
Closing open houses, hired her own type
Alimony is phony, she paid for her own flights
Crazy office parties, she's throwin' 'em inside
And my mama sealed my fate when she opened the invite
The lady had a plan, she knew it all in advance
The party was a good mixture of employees and friends
She told the people comin' to make sure they bring their kids
Yeah, bring some food, but just make sure you bring your kids
After we arrived and after standing around
The lady tinked her glass and told us, "Gather around"
For a special performance from her daughters, she said it proud
"But tonight they not my daughters, tonight they Destiny's Child"
Out from the back came three lil' survivors
In formation, choreo tighter
One on the left, I think I might like her
One on the left, I think I might love her
Lady just folds her arms, rubs her hands
All of the lessons learned, how to dance
All of these moments left up to chance
Everything will go right as it can

Once upon a time, I had carats supplied
To a pair of fair rings I would share with the bride
Every kiss begins with Claire's cut clarity size
They were forever, but marriage had an apparent decline
Now we live in fear of doin' what our parents was tryin'
So every Rapunzel don't got the kind of hair you can climb
Ever since they lost a slipper, every pair that they find
They say these boots were made for dancing like Mary J. Blige
We live a life apart, life so hard
Life'll never really end up like the start
We learned together how the back door feels
And we was jumping over brooms in tobacco fields
We was the same, all black folks still
Until the white man found out black votes steal elections
So they legitimized us, but behind us
It's still black folks at the back door still
For every small increment liberated, our women waited
And all they privacy been invaded
Almost every trait I got through the slave owner gone
Skin brown, nose round, but the Bennett made it
Now I wanna give it to her, Sierra Leone, serenade
Sometimes love come with its own barricade
Sometimes love just gotta hold, marinate
Let it hold, let it wait, here it go, here it go

Once upon a time, a girl from Trinidad
Had to fly to Canada and sneak into the land
Of the free and of the brave, feet under the sand
And I came in realizing nothing free in the land
Dreams of making money, had to split it with Sam
All that Making the Band, yeah, I could've did it, but damn
Rather really be on the come-up, had to stick to the plan
Went from rockin' with Fendi, now Fendi know I'm a brand
That's how God do, I'm in your top two
And I ain't number two, conquered rap, then the pop too
You gon' stop who? Get off cock, boo
Since "Itty Bitty Piggy," giving bitches what they bop to
I met my husband when I was seventeen out in Queens
If you love it, let it go, now I know what that means
While he was up North for a body
I bodied everybody and got known for my body
My nigga home now, he the Clyde to my Bonnie
'Bout to walk down the aisle and be a mommy
Ooh, I remember when I cried like, "Why me?"
Now I wouldn't exchange my life for Armani
Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming and then it hits me
Gotta remember who I am when it slips me
Kids running up to the car yelling, "Nicki"
All my bad bitches, I know that y'all with me
Fuck they thought was sittin' in my seat?
Got a big bowl of ice cream sitting in my Jeep
Got some killers that'll put you on ice, so don't sleep
'Bout to dead this whole beef and rock some gold teeth

We treat the bad advice like bad breath

Magazines, pat my jeans, have a beverage with ya
Count my blessings with ya
They prefer success less than when we stress, bet
Forget about all the drama and the comments they left
Out rightly fine, the bottom line is right on top of they text
You gotta remember that the enemy is not of the flesh
You gotta remember that our imagery is made from the best
So pray for the best
Hands high, caught the garter, caught the Hail Mary
Married, tossed the veil, moved to Fort Lauderdale
1-9 to 9-1, that's the goal
9-1 dash, that's the soul
Can't keep track of lies that they told
So extra in the background, that's they role, but

Ooh, girl, I love you so
Told myself not to love these hoes
Told myself not to fall for these bitches
But it's hard to stop fallin' when you trippin' though
I'm pimpin', though, and pimpin' ain't easy, but it's necessary
I could feed eyes to a vegetarian
My main bitch said she feelin' secondary
Love you, worry 'bout yourself and not the other bitch I'm tellin', girl

Told 'em, must've haven't met another Tunechi yet

I admit I threw my hat in the ring, I'm Michael Jackson
But I figured that your reaction would be allergic
I shot my shot thinkin' before they hang up my number
They'll probably burn my jersey
Call up the pastor clergy
Call up the plastic surgeon
Call 'em the brand new version
Call me whatever you want, just call me back like it's urgent
I learned the art of forgiveness from the son of a virgin
I made so many clean slates that I could sell you detergent
I'm from a city full of finesses and janky merchants
Fragrance in pagan churches
Debt collectors that settle vendetta better in person
I wasn't born last week, yesterday I was nursing
I can't believe that you thought that I was perfect
My hidden blisters turn to pimples on the surface

My heart and tongue are fighting, my mind is undecided
It's not like Trump and Biden, it's more like something private
Like when your cousins fighting, one of 'em get excited
You can't just jump the gun and pick a side and jump inside it
Remember, Pontius Pilate hung a God and justified it
The truth is slow 'cause someone's always in a rush to hide it
The lies is golden 'cause the Devil got a touch of Midas
The soul is brighter 'cause the Holy Ghost is ultraviolet
The tongue is violent when the spirit starts to hunger-striking
The thunder lightning makes the heart go under bunkers hiding
The lungs is silent when it hears the footsteps of the giants
And then, the fingertips, they twist up like Poseidon's trident
Remember safety if you ever running from the tight end
Remember Mookie if they ever come to cut the hydrant
They cut the heart out with the tongue, they want it undivided
You better not start, you make a fuss you end up uninvited

My heart and mind are beefing, I call 'em "rhyme and reason"
They always going head to head, I'm tryna Siamese 'em
My father got a special set of skills like Liam Neeson
He told me faith and squinted eyes can turn the blind Venetian
I seen the sign, I'm in the den, I'm with the lions, sleeping
I seen the wine, I seen the water turn to bright Tahitian
The heart is somewhere on Hawaiian beaches
Tying pigeons to the giant peaches
I want the beat to feel like diegesis
I'm tired of politicians tryna sell us diet Jesus
That's like dialysis was tryna sell us diabetes
Act like you was born yesterday and you gon' die a fetus
The mind's philosophy is old as Thales of Miletus
The mind is quite elitist, that's why they like choir preachers
They buy our leaders easier than I can buy a feature
That's why the genius always end up on the tightest leashes

You better not miss this, overdose, dope and mixes

Dropping tapes 'til I losted count, coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling, I'm Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns
Surfing through the Harlem crowds

You ain't nothing but my seedling, I'll hang you from the ceiling
And leave yo' little ass leaking, and leave yo' body stinking
Dude, yo' ass been drinking? Or you just wasn't thinking?
I'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink
I hear your pockets jingling
It's calling me like "Ring, ring"
I'll choke you with your bling bling
Then run faster than Tink Tink
And all these goofies mad though
Like, "Why he such a asshole?"
And I ain't even mad, yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver
That shit ain't even rhyme, nigga
I'm fucked up out my mind, nigga
I stay right off the '9, nigga
That's where they try an' find a nigga
Feeling froggy? Better timid up
Harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt
'Cause niggas don't wanna get bended up
Stay talking but don’t send it up
Used to send it up for my Skinner lunch
Savemoney niggas really won't spend a buck
Gimme that cash, that Ben, what up?
Pockets keep that denim bruh like ahh
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck, fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you, fuck you, nigga

Turn the radio up and we can have a good time
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times
Back when Thelma had that ass, hope the fam good
My sister said she likes my raps 'cause it sounds good
Told me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters
Sitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders
'Til my pops popped me off, that was family matters
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen
Mama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden
Got big shoes to fill like try an' go bowling
'Til we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out
4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?
Summertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out
Riding, getting nice 'cause it's nice out

Let's land in the land where the Famo stay

For the fam, all my friends, when my mans go away

Good morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck
Tonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck
Bizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck
A new SLR and Ferraro deluxe
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' 'em
Gassed than a bitch no car with him
Market him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game of Operation with Parkinson's
Young kid rappers, kidnapper
Young whippersnappers that will whip past ya

Wanna break ya off, come Kit-Kat you

Chi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in
Going all out for them hoes again
Now I'm fin' to bring the fucking flow and bend it back
And show it's more to this than rap
Love my parents for supporting 'cause they know I'm finna crack
Know my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs
But I'm tryin' to get 'em cheese so I can get 'em out the trap
Now my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack
But I got her on my lap, all she do is make it clap

Charlie Bartlett, John Bender
Class switcher, time bender
Chance Bennett, a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts, only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair, fun fact
I'm never going back to school, been there, done that
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila, you know you know you don't want that
I rap my songs in Spanglish, I wrap my weed in blunt wraps
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without 'em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night, homie, shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night

Uh, yo, this prom shit feel like the Grammys, yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask, "Where'd Granny go?"
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo
And snap a couple candids to the family, get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jann who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping 10 Day with the angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again
'Cause it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down, I don't write e'rything
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Coked out like, "Don't change when you grow up
I hope you get some change when you blow up"
'Cause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder, float up, flying lotus
"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara"
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night
It's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don't think I felt your hand on my head yelling, "Call his father"?
But people don't hear ghost, so how they gon' play me?
Money saved me, so I'ma do the same thing
You droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift?
You better not miss this, overdose dope and mix this
Let your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it

Long time now since I seen you smile
Long time, long time now since I seen you smile
And it's been a long time, long time now
Since I seen you smile

Dropping tapes 'til I lost the count
Coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling, I'm Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowds
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib, I'm falling down
I'm on the floor, crawling 'round
I'm calling out to God, "You're little angel's falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around"

Sometimes I can't pay for food

For chiefin' a hunnid blunts, 14,400 minutes
Fans all in the stands, they hands for Mr. Bennett
That racket over the net, ooh, give me my tennis
Shoes, give me a minute, ooh, I can't be tardy
My class is already started, they told my mom I'm retarded
But that 10 Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai
No tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni
They took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there
An inch away from Heaven, a million songs from right here
A step away from South By, a swing away from Cali
A hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping
So at the school they arrested him, back seat, squad car, nestled in
Shouts to the bitch nigga Heselton
Wit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'
Finna see the 10 Day Pestilence, so far, so good, so special and
No stars, good jobs, or excellents
And I'm still so fucking non-echelon
Ooh, you got suspended, ooh, you not gon' finish

Damn, they gon' resent it, ooh, you representin'

This is six blunt rotation music
This is just got off six-month probation music
This is steppin' on the beach
When you're too drunk to feel a beat
This that laughing in a condo
Throwin' shit down in the street
This that shouts to the Ave, shouts to the lab
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags
This for every math class that I ever had
So fuck you if I failed, and fuck you if I passed
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past
'Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class
Some of us is seein' summer, some of us have passed
Some of us ain't seein' summer, some of us have passed
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass
'Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav'
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave
We on the ground yelling, "Give my nigga back!"

And I just want to roll with my windows down

I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko
I'm off that local, I'm on that global
I often had dreams of being locked in my momma's Volvo
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot, I'm off Ciroc, I'm off a lot
They gave me 10 days off, that's an awful lot
I was off campus but the officer
Told the office that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good, I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave while rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off
They told me gon' rock it, I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught? Picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups? Why you just didn't slip off?
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me, yeah? Well, that's awfully fair
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years
Bitch, I ain't scared, I'm already here
Tell ya partners and ya friends the next coffin is theirs
Guess what, bitch? I'm from internal affairs
Looking for crooked cops to tweak so I can offer 'em years
Have me tweaking like I'm all full of fear (Alright, I'm tweaking)You might also like23Embed

Truth be told, I got the ball on a string
Carried the weight of the world, but it came with some handles
I drag it to the basket, Moses with the passage
Safely Lord God, please make an example
I try to break shackles, now they ankles in shambles
I can't expect them to be grateful and thankful
They thought I had a manual like Hansel
Leave your plans in man's hands and it gets manhandled
Dancing in the street, but I didn't panhandle
When I finally drop, make a pamphlet
Sell tickets, put that shit on FanDuel, OnlyFans and Fandango
Give me your ear like Van Gogh and it's candlewick
I mean, I mean, it's lit like a candlestick
When I'm fatigued like a camo fit
A rich man: the size of the needle that the camel fits
Walkin' to Jesus with my sandals wet

The weapons form, the load don't drop
The boat gon' rock, the foes gon' plot
The rolls don't switch, the photo crop
The motto is "The more those hate, the more doors prop
Open", the prince of Heaven was tempted
Told that he wasn't who he was, and they meant it
Never was there a path better cemented

The highs and the lows
The highs, the lows

I'm an emotional rollercoaster (Ah)
With highs so high, could put Bol Bol on a poster (Mm)
But when the bread get low like four loaves in a toaster
Oh the shoulders can get cold as ten toes in Nova Scotia
Some days I hold a grudge, some days I Holy Ghost her
Some days I just ghost her, some days I'm supposed to
The crib feel like a gunfight, but them strollers, that's the holster (Huh)
We can make amends over old memes and mimosas
My mama know I ain't make my bed, but I'ma lay in it
Whеther it's sandpaper, suedе linen
Whether I'm alone or Creole lady marmalade-ing it
The same pajamas I was afraid in, I boogeyman slayed
My blankets concealed my blade in it, emotional seesaw
With two fat motherfuckers with strong knees in free fall (Huh)
It's cloudy with a chance of meatballs, I checked the weather
I gave all my vices a call, let's get together

To talk about the highs and lows, the ups and downs
The friends that I had to hide to come around
They told me that I knew you'd always come around
Come around, come around, come around, come around
To work out the highs and lows, the ups and downs
No need to hide disguises comin' down

When it's hard to keep your eyes on the road (Eyes on the road)

I was feelin' lifeless, I had to cut my vices (I had to)
Now the feelin' that I feel is priceless
In the spirit, want me to be righteous
But I know I might just relapse, get sucked in these devices
Got so used to feedback, I couldn't tell what mines is (Word)
Sometimes all the outside noise just really blinds us
Beware (Facts), believe none of what you see and half of what you hear (Right)
The best things in life on the opposite side of fear
I swear I see it clear, like after the storm
Still, you can't stop the rain like the Loose Ends' song
My word is bond like James, yo, I couldn't complain (Nah)
'Cause even when I did, niggas really couldn't feel my pain (Uh)
That's the type of shit to drive a nigga insane
Wanna be numb, now your thumb back flickin' the flame
Back to square one, tryna overcome what you became
Like they was right, I guess you're never gon' change, I guess you never gon'

Just know we all been there before (We all been there)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (The highs with the lows)

To talk about the highs and lows, the ups and downs
The friends that I had to hide to come around
They told me that I knew you'd always come around
Come around, come around, come around, come around
To work out the highs and lows, the ups and downs (The ups and downs)
No need to hide disguises comin' down (Comin' down)

That's ten minutes
What you got?
Alright

I got a bar about a bar
It's not a joke, it's just a bar
A nigga walks into a bar
Took his seat, he liked his liquor hard, his women easy
Legend has it, he was callous like fingers that pick guitars
He was just a hick that parked his pickup truck 'cause it was dark to take a piss
The road was long, the line was long as shit
He thought about it, held it in and sipped his straw
Ashed out his cigar and walked out into his car
Forget that nigga, there was a line inside the bar
And the line was so long it wrapped behind the bar
And exposed moonshine and wine inside the jar
And it kеpt goin' to the alley and the trash bеhind the bar
To the same nigga, he was takin' a piss behind his car
The nigga in the front seen that this shit was out of order
The nigga in the back seen that the meter's out of quarters
The patrons in the middle wished this line was way shorter
I would tell you their names, but they names is unimportant

There's what I got so farYou might also likeEmbed

That shit cray, that shit dead, that shit fake, plastic head
Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need an Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking, "What up?" I said on my soul, I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands and my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I'm going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I called up my lil' homie, bought him a .45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they momma and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

Know, know, know, how will I? (Sɛ wo nim dada)
How will I know, know, know (King Promise ni Chance the Rapper)
Know, know, know, how will I know?
How will I know?

You'll know when ya get there
Yah know when I end up on a new track
You'll go when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when ya go
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when ya go

Gun to ya back like Harriet
If you can't shoot, can't carry it
If ya too fake, can't ferry it
Comе carry me home, sweet chariot
Er'body wanna come drivе the boat
But nobody wanna come paddleboat
If we realized we was all compatible
We could combine the money
Maybe come buy the boat
Sometimes, I'm my boss
Sometimes gun might bust (Bust)
Freedom is a must, in Yah we trust
Hold my hand if you scared, hold my hand if you cried
Hold my hand and I'll drive, close your eyes and I'll steer
I'm not woke, I'm just tired
I'm not floatin', I'm flyin'
I'm not broken, I'm fine
I'm outspoken, I stay on code when I'm out in the open online
They gon' know what we know in no time
They gon' go in the show with no line
With a pick for a comb, and clothes, the whole nine
Better hold on tight, no time to slow down
Don't ask, "Are we there?", you slept the whole time

Front to the back, get loud
Ones in the back, get loud
Run and the gun click, pow
One big crowd (One big crowd)
One big smile (One big smile)
Money in one big pile
Blueprints in an unzipped file
Akwaaba medasee, that's the end of my speech
Tell 'em, "Spread the word from Osu to Kumasi"
This for Dr. Kwame, Selassie and Nnamdi
Tell 'em, "Free the youth, or we gon' free the army"
Pray no man can harm me, can't no man can harm me
I can't let you starve me, I can't go out like Gandhi
Bet, say less, bro, we on the way
Starline fest, ho, we on the way
Better open that whole damn street on the way

We almost there, we almost down, it's almost down

Let me take y'all back like Marcus
When Europe was still in the darkness
The boats was big as the arc is
The cargo was gold-tipped spears and it sold by the load and it opened the market
Before currency, the Canary Current made trade and maize was the hardest
Back to the wall like the artists
I leaned on the crib like a mortgage
I breathed on the game like a cartridge
I'm sorry, I mean it never started
Chano got the keys to the starship
With his heart on his sleeve like a card trick
Goin' back to the sea like a warship
Then I'm back to the sand like a starfish
When I'm on, but you don't always have to hit the streets
We must fight, but you must fight to go protect our peace
And I'm your rival when you ride, you'll get some sleep
And we gon' mob, but when we mob, it be lil' more discreet

You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
(You'll know when we get there)
(You'll know when we get there)
(You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there
Let me say
Leave in the mornin'
We gon' leave in the mornin'
We gon' leave in the mornin'

At the break of dawn, we gon' make a break
We gon' take the farm
Take the safe, we finna break the bank
We replaced the tapes, and made fake alarms
The home team waitin', know we comin' over
Got a Sauvignon blanc with the two cigars
'Case you was stoppin' to loot the bar
We got valet waitin' with a souped-up car
Got a nitro boost for the chasin'
Got a few rooms booked at the Days Inn
Got a lil' bit of Mase and a lil' bit of cash
Just in case catch a glimpse of the faces
Good God, this the heist for the ages
From the cages, straight to the majors
Liberation, you gotta take it
Free yourself, learned that from the Haitians
Smile through the tears, learned that from a crocodile
Speak your mind like a pocket dial
Got fully-auto rocket power
So any damn door, it'll knock it down
Just call my phone when you make it down
Just give me a piece when you break it down
Cullinan diamond, I'ma take the crown
'Cause when I take the crown, I'ma break the crown
You'll know when I get there

I don't wanna think too much, don't wanna think about it
But I know we will get there (You'll know)
I don't wanna think too much, don't wanna think about it
But I know you'll get there, yeah

You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there
