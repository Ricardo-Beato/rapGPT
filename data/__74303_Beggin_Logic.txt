53 ContributorsBeggin Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'ma get it right now, and never will I give up
Homie, this is food for thought, you better fill up
I'm coming in strong but this song ain’t very long
So I gotta make you understand before the beat is gone
Homie you are not alone, we are in the zone
We are in The Matrix, full of that fake shit
Make you wanna grab the gat and go apeshit
Living in a world of lies I can't take it
Needed someone to save me, Needed someone to hug me
Needed a whole world but nobody would love me
And I learned from this that people wanna buck me
And I've learned from this, to put no one above me
I said I can't take it I know I'm gonna make it
I know I'm not normal but I gotta fake it
I swear I'm not cocky, I am just confident
That when I step on the stage I am dominant and now I am beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darling

Sick of living in the dark so I'm begging for the light
Feeling like I'm in a fight every single time a write
'Cause I gotta make sure that they hear me right
Told me that I couldn't do it so when I pick up the mic
I gotta kill it with something so real that when they hear it
They can feel what's in my soul
Lyrical coke-head, yeah homie I gotta blow
But first, they gotta know who I is
So I'm begging for recognition on the mission just to do it big
'Cause I ain't new to this I'm true to this
Thinking I'ma stand up and roll out, homie that's ludicrous
Not here to play no games, I’m here to stay and make a change
In major ways, so I remain up in the studio for days and days
Spittin' out these razor blades, don't wanna place no blame
But without you, I couldn't get to where I'm heading
So to everybody, I'm beggin'
You might also like
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darling

Yeah, yeah, I said this is my path don't mess with me
I didn't choose this life it was destiny
God tested me to find the best of me
And I know I'm going to make it even without a degree
'Cause the test scores don't mean shit to me
And when you said that I would fail it didn't get to me
Now I'm beggin', public masses, please
I'm way too proud to get down on my knees
But I'm beggin', put me on the level
Fuck Illuminati, that's word to the devil
'Cause I am not about that, I just wanna love
I just wanna grow, I just wanna learn
The passion, it burns to write this music
I'm so late that I just might lose it
But don't ever confuse it, it's all so worth it
I just wanna help hip-hop, not hurt it
And as for my style I don't know how to word it
Why do you even have to categorize me?
Fuck it let 'em hate, let 'em all despise me
Cause I'm gonna take this, flip it up and make this
Something that the whole world cannot imagine
Let alone fathom I'm from another planet
I swear I'm not manic, listen to me damn it
My future's in your hands and so I'm beggin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' You
Put your loving hand out, darling
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darling20Embed
