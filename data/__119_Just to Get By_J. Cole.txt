That was the warm-up, that was the warm-up, baby
Aight, Elite, for real, one take, dawg, and I'm up outta here
One
Yup, yeah

Lord, please forgive me for my sinnin'
I ain’t sayin' that I’m finished, but I’m prayin' in advance
'Cause the way her eyes glance like they playin' in my pants
Yeah, ball game, I swear the hoes wasn’t in my plans
When a nigga took a chance and came to the big city
My beat machine the only fuckin' thing I had with me
Like Bobby had Whitney, we was cookin' up crack
But them fifteen credits had a nigga off track
Picture that, best rapper since Lil Wayne in classes
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his bachelor’s
But mastered this rap shit, you hear the words comin' from my
Lips, bastards, I never crack, I got that Chapstick
I practiced 'til that shit made perfect and served it
To the people on a silver platter, now where’s the ladder?
'Cause either you gonna whine or you climb; I chose the latter
Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though
‘Fore you get tossed like a forward lateral, we never tattle
Let God handle that, or let the mob handle that
No Soprano, half black, half white; I’m a piano
I’m an animal, my video on Discovery Channel
I’m a beast when my shit hits the streets, these niggas cease
To exist, like a beach in a tsunami, you'll find me
In the ‘Ville in the state of NC, bitch, if I ain’t back
Home, I’m up in NYC, ‘bout that money prob'ly
Like a fuckin' robbery, but I ain’t jackin'
I’m chasin' dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slackin'
I’m chasin' dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slackin'
Hey, take a hard look at my drive nigga, no hackin'
On my shit, I’m straight smackin' niggas, straight taggin' niggas
Yo, I'm freestylin', fuck y'all niggas, y’all be wylin', and I’m outYou might also like6Embed
