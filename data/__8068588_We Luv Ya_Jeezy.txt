1 ContributorWe Luv Ya Lyrics

N* on the dance floor losing they mind
The reason why yo baby mama throwing up gang signs
A n* with an attitude & it's plane to see
The lil n* in my hood call me Jeezy-E
Cause I'm a mothafuckin fool
When I pack a mack 10 & rock a lot of ice cubes (Daaaamn)
Got the choppers n*, ain't talking motor bikes (noo)
The rocks in my ear shine like headlights
A hundred rounds about the size of darts
Call it Big Sexy Tear your man apart (that riiiight)
Real recognize real & dawg I feel ya
But if you put yo hands on me Kinky-B gon kill ya

Them hoes in the projects / We luv ya n*
The n* in ya hood / We luv ya n*
Them n* in the trap / We luv ya n*
They fuckin with you like that? / We luv ya n*

Calling me a workaholic cause I work too much
& They say I like to talk about the work too much
Lemme see, I'm not a plumber, a n* can't fix cars (nope)
I'm an astrologist, I know all the stars (heeey)
I'm not a politician, or lawyer, or doctor, a barber, or a teacher, a rapper, or a preacher
And I ain't gon lie... I had a nine to five
My trap opened at nine and closed at five (haha)
T - R - A - P n* O - R D - I - E n* (yeeeeah)
You n* are sore losers  I'm a born winner
Fish scale on the stove Just cook dinner
You might also like
Them hoes in the projects / We luv ya n*
The n in ya hood / We luv ya n*
Them n* in the trap / We luv ya n*
They fuckin with you like that? / We luv ya n*

It was either be a rapper or sit behind bars
The next best thing Rock ice, drive cars (yeeeeah)
Plus I was good at it n* You shoulda seen me with them thangs
You was good at it n*
I gotta way with hoes Work the microwave I gotta way with O's
Don't get it twisted Look I mean well
I'm a hustla, I can sell fire in hell
Get that thang poppin like a 7/11 if I make it up top I'm selling wings in heaven
Please Lord forgive me For I have sinned
A n* got his grind on i had to have that Benz

Them hoes in the projects / We luv ya n*
The n* in ya hood / We luv ya n*
Them n* in the trap / We luv ya n*
They fuckin with you like that? / We luv ya n*Embed
