18 ContributorsSteal The Show Lyrics
Yeah, Steal The Show baby

I'mma have to ride the ride the ride
Til' I find a girl to slip inside
Ice Cube ain't never been shot
Ain't never got got, up in the parking lot
Nigga, Scott Storch will bang the instrumental
South Central here comes the presidential
Pull up jump out the low-rider
A real lyricist nigga fuck a ghostwriter
Dance baby I'm your provider
Yous a fly girl bitch I'm a spider
I'm on that ass like please leave me alone
A few drinks you like please follow me home
I just hope you ain't 5150
That's a crazy ho even though she pretty
Ice Cube only one El Loco
With the vocals, put your ass in a choke-hold
Stone cold oh yeah fuck the Broncos
Raider down, everybody better lay it down
Think I'm P.G. you must got a squeegee
Are you crazy, down since Eazy

Here, shoulders, knees and toes
Work that pussy across the flo'
Shake that body, Steal The Show
Ice Cube bitch I'm about to blow (Lets go)
You might also like
I'm about to do it like this here
Walk over spit game in this bitch ear
Let her know my name and I got it right here
Girl you know the game can I get a volunteer
I'm about to do it like this here
Walk over spit game in this bitch ear
Let her know my name and I got it right here
Plus a pound of weed do I got a volunteer

Goin' once goin' twice
A nigga nice when I turn off the lights
Tell your friends yo fuck they advice
Cause some time them hoes act like dykes
Cock blockers, pull out your mouth piece
Game over, we up in the range rover
Wake up in the morning with a hangover
Roll over do the whole damn thang over
I'm a roller, took her ass back where I drove her
And we still ain't sober, motherfucker it still ain't ova
Its the super nova, niggas been doin' over
Ice Cube been rappin' since 84'
About the cocaine streets and the po'-po'
Introduce you to my 6-4 low-low
Yeah the one the just pulled out the mo-mo
Here, shoulders, knees and toes
Work that pussy across the flo'
Shake that body, Steal The Show
Ice Cube bitch I'm about to blow (Lets go)

I'm about to do it like this here
Walk over spit game in this bitch ear
Let her know my name and I got it right here
Girl you know the game can I get a volunteer

Punks show up to get beat down
Daddy home motherfucker put your feet down
Better jump up y'all better clean up
Cause I might done pull out this Nina
Put your cups up boy if you fucked up
And you got the baddest bitch up in the club
Put your cups up even if she ugly
And it look like the bitch play rugby
We could take me anywhere where the thugs be
When they see me motherfuckers wanna hug me
It's all love Cuz, it's all love Blood
It's all love when them niggas throwin' up the dub
Its all love with the brown and they yellow man
Cause a nigga got money like the jello man
Mo money, yo money, ho money
Mama didn't raise no dummy learn from me
Cause I could flip shit fast as Bisquick
Mr. Butterworth take it for what its worth
I got them low lows flat like pancakes
Sippin' on syzzurp Fuck what ya hizzerd
Here, shoulders, knees and toes
Work that pussy across the flo'
Shake that body, Steal The Show
Ice Cube bitch I'm about to blow (come on)

I'm about to do it like this here
Walk over spit game in this bitch ear
Let her know my name and I got it right here
Girl you know the game can I get a volunteer

Steal the show baby
Steal the show baby

You know a lot of these bitches need an antibiotic
Moxacillin, Penicillin, something with a slin' in it
They want a sugar daddy, they want a man on a fixed income
They want man where they can come over to the old mans house
And go in the back porch and get $30 or $40 every here and there
And get in they Hyundai and ride on off1Embed
