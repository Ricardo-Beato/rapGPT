Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving

Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving

Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
I poured up a four and I'm movin' real slow with a bad bitch beside me
Why they take Actavis from me, I swear that I need you beside me
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
The last time that I got pulled over, they tried to DU and I me
Don't give a fuck about my probation, I'm still drinkin' and driving

I'm drinkin' and driving, got molly on molly
Taking these pain killers, they fill up my body
They fill up my body
They fill up my body
They fill up my body
Yeah, they fill up my body
Iâ€™m chopping up bricks like Miyagi, I don't know karate
All my niggas sound thirty, nigga try and get thirty
Every clip hold thirty, I gave her back 'cause she was thirsty
I'm not a worker, can't work me
Bad bitches want to slurp me
Bitch thought she had a Porsche, had to get the ho an abortion
I'm drinkin' and driving in foreigns
Drinkin' and driving in foreigns
The game is meant to be sold, it's not to be told
I'm drinkin' and driving, so fuck being sober
Pour up a four, pour up a four, pour up a four, pour up a four
Pour up some more, Pour up some more
Just pour up some more
Pour up some more

Pour up, pour up
Roll up, roll up
Bad bitches, hold up
Hold up, hold up
I'm drinking and driving in 'Raris, drinkin' and driving in Phantoms
Drinkin' and driving in Porsches, drinkin' and driving on camera
Bitch, I got stamina, bitch, I'm gon' handle you
Walk around with the hammer, MCM no Hammer
We fuck in the coupe, we fuck in the Challenger
We fuck in the Challenger, yeah, we fuck in the Challenger
I can't let you handle me, bad bitch, two seats
Riding with the top off, two bitches top me
I'm riding with the beef, so I'm riding with the heat
We gonna keep it in the street, nigga see me, don't speak
Give a fuck about your feelings, all my niggas drug dealing
All my niggas known for killing, we drinkin' and driving and spending
I poured up a fourth of that Ac', hit that bitch from the back
The molly killing, buying packs, drinkin' and driving it back
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
I poured up a four and I'm moving real slow, with a bad bitch beside me
Why they take Actavis from me, I swear that I need you beside me
Drinkin' and driving

Drinkin' and driving
Drinkin' and driving
The last time that I got pulled over, they tried to DU and I me
Don't give a fuck about my probation, I'm still drinkin' and driving3Embed
