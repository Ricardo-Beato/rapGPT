Now let's start the show, show
Step out of the cold, cold
We come from the 'Go, 'Go
To the top of the globe, globe
The pimps and the hoes, hoes
The Folks and the Stones, Stones
Whoever you ride fo', we back for some mo'
Get back to the show, show, you know

Uhh, uhh
Ladies and gentlemen the C-O-double M-O-N
Synonym for fresh, truth is the emblem
Hardcore since I was next door to Clem and them
Cold as the wintеr when fake niggas was shiverin'
Shakin' in thеy Timberlands, you as played as Bennigans
Hot for a minute, now you just a "remember him"
I been a master since P was No Limitin'
Stick to sayin'
No gimmickin' and no mimickin'
Q infinitin' down old blocks are bendin' in
Yellin' "Fuck tha police" like Ren and them
Pelican brief these niggas on who I be
Before the paper and the fame niggas knew Rashid
Noble like Drew Ali
Many have come
But few have been chose to be a true MC
You sing along with it, inside you knowin' it's wack
Young who? Oh, he the openin' act
You might also like
Now let's start the show, show
Step out of the cold, cold
We come from the 'Go, 'Go
To the top of the globe, globe
The pimps and the hoes, hoes
The Folks and the Stones, Stones
Whoever you ride fo', we back for some mo'
Get back to the show, show, you know

Let, let, le-le-le-le-le-let's go
It's a festival in hip-hop, we do it non-stop
Pop your bottles
Chicago niggas do it in staccato
Choppin' notes for my homies, fuck a motto
And Ferragamo shoes givin' dudes the model
Think fast, drive slow, survival is the throttle
Your live show is hollow, should've kept it local
Rappin' over vocals
Soundin' soft as JoJo
With twelve monkeys on stage, it's hard to see who's the gorilla
You was better as a drug dealer
Feel the passion of this B-boy rationale
Half of it is what you say and half is style
I guess it's time for you to start cashin' out
It's over folks, tell your guys to put the glasses down
Masters now, verses touch the youth like a Catholic priest
Performances keep me stackin' the sheets
Now let's start the show, show
Step out of the cold, cold
We come from the 'Go, 'Go
To the top of the globe, globe
The pimps and the hoes, hoes
The Folks and the Stones, Stones
Whoever you ride fo', we back for some mo'
Get back to the show, show, you know

And you say Chi-City, let's go Chicago!
Come on, y'all can make more noise than that!
Get live y'all, get live y'all, ah-get live y'all
Ah-get live y'all, ay y'all can get louder than that
Louder, louder!Embed
