23 ContributorsPad & Pen Lyrics
This is the willy master D-Life as we set it off with my mans A Tribe Called Quest
And, uh, we got to do it like this, baby
We got to do it like that, baby
We got the good shit not the bullshit, you know what I mean?
Haha, we 'bout to count it down, we 'bout to count it off
It goes a-one, two, three, and...

Malik, we gettin' back into that shit again
And when we rhyme, brothers need to break they pens, uh-oh
It's The Love Movement, never ends
The rap game'll never be the same again (Phife Dawg where you at baby?), we came again
Here I come again, you feelin' fine?
The Dawg is like a overflowin' rhyme from mind
Usually mess with shorties whose a eight, nine (Eight, nine)
Shorty bump around to the bassline (Bassline)
F keeps a burner on the waistline
Y'all cat's trick it off, I ain't wastin' mine
You feel the uniqueness, you seekin' this?
And when we do it, we be freakin' this (Freak this, freak this)
Don't even front, you know you feelin' this
My shade is borderin' around licorice (Licorice)
Enjoyin' this tune, glad you playin' it
Ayo, Phife, what's the hook? Here, we sayin' it, sayin' it, sayin' it (Here we go)
You might also like
My pad and my pen (Uh-uh, you didn't go there)
The beat and the blend (Say word, you didn't go there)
The party won't end (You know, we got to be there)
Just keep gettin' ends, buildin' with friends, yo
My pad and my pen (Uh-uh, you didn't go there)
The beat and the blend (Say word, you got to go there)
The party won't end (Uh-uh, we will be there)
Just keep gettin' ends, buildin' with friends, yo

One love, one life and one destiny
It seems that the devil keeps testin' me (Uh-huh)
Got the illest part of the recipe
Yo, tell your homegirl to stop stressin' me (Stop it)
Undressin' me is the part you really like
Brothers hold the cracks, now they holdin' mics
Concussions you get, fillin' up the steady rights
Marauders, we did that shit at Midnight, a-aight (Aight)
I love it when my honey dip be slobbin' me
Don't take it personal, it's just comedy (Comedy)
My comedy completely turned to tragedy (Tragedy)
I sense some of these rappers still be mad at me (Got to be mad)
Sweatin' her because of her anatomy
When I bang you, it'll be assault and battery (Battery)
Don't make me discombobulate your microphone
Talkin' trash will only get you freakin' head flown (Uh)
Buy 'em out the box, never batty ones (Uh-huh)
Get in that ass like karate, son (Uh-huh)
My outlook on life, sometimes it's lookin' grim (Uh-huh)
We manage a smile, sometimes we slip it in (Say word)
My Tribe be worldwide like the Nike swoosh
Emcees be soundin' moist like vagina juice
The top of the world, we pursuin' it
Don't worry about a thing, 'cause we doin' it, doin' it, doin' it
My pad and my pen (Uh-uh, you didn't go there)
The beat and the blend (Say word, did you go there?)
The party won't end (Uh-uh, we got to be there)
Just keep gettin' ends, buildin' with friends, yo
My pad and my pen (Uh-uh, did you go there?)
The beat and the blend (Say word, why did you go there?)
The party won't end (Uh uh, we got to be there)
Just keep gettin' ends, buildin' with friends, yo
My pad and my pen (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
The beat and the blend (Say word, say word, say word)
The party won't end (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just keep gettin' ends, buildin' with friends, yo
My pad and my pen (I got my pad and my pen)
The beat and the blend (So the beats and the blend)
The party won't end (And the party never ends)
Just keep gettin' ends, buildin' with friends, yo

That's the way we do, c'mon
That's the way we do
It's the nigga D-Life
With T-C-Q
That's the way we ride
And the beat won't stop
Got to blow it up for the top
Didn't think you know how we rock
