7 ContributorsSlow Down Lyrics
This life will fade away... (away)
So hard to appreciate... (appreciate)
Each moment, of each day
Life's quick, don't flip, move slow, ya rushing it
Oh... oh... oh...

Looking lavish, I lace all my bunnies with karats
Spending millions and make music, I pay for the clearance
Cuz tomorrow ain't promised and my bankroll's bursting
Connects with Aston Martin, I'll be that first in
That prototype truck, with the space navigation
Cost of living go up, I'm just go on vacation
Fresh oxygen tanks, got world reknowned surgeons
Plush robes made from suede and knitted by virgins
First breath of the day can be my last
So I flash, give my niggas some cash, I just pull out the stash
Buy a million dollar piece like I buy a pack of seeds
You buy OZ's of haze, I buy a forest full of trees


Order that bottle of Louis the thirteenth and some Dom P
I got a bunch of chicks that love to get raunchy
See, Tone double-dipped and I nut like Flanders
Ask Tamia and Chevon, I got 'em both going bananas
Buying frosted bracelets, Louis Vuitton duffles
French vanilla ice cream and hot apple pie truffles
Fly Mika to Costa Rica, I got a crib on the beach
With underwater lights and surround sound speakers
Pet cheetahs, tiger sharks and dolphin feeders
Fly French maids, serving Grey Goose by the liters
Got Felecia and Taquesha, Crystal and Katie
Little Precious, picking my poppy seeds out in Haiti

Slow down, slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down, slow down
Slow down.... slow down...
Life's quick, don't flip, move slow, ya rushing it

Slow it down, I need money though
YouknowI'msaying? This just, just what I do
On the streets, y'knahmean?
Babies need Pampers, man
YouknowI'msaying? I don't know
I think about it, I think about it, yanahImean?
My responsibilities, I've gotta focus more
You might be right though, you know
Maybe things'll start coming to me naturally, you feel me?
Starting praying more, youknowImean? Be with the family more
And, I might live longer, you feel me?
Word... you... just feel like you right, though
I don't know... I'mma take your advice thoughEmbed
