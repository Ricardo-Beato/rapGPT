88 ContributorsKill Lyrics
Aw, nigga thought he killed me?
Alright, that's cool, we'll see
Strict top of the crop shit
Crushin' muthafuckas like moths in a mosh pit
Dollar cents since shit, sense I ain't lost it
It's in a fuckin' jar with guitar picks and bar spit
Bar spat, past tense, warriors of radness
Fuck lame, get it through your brain like dad's dick
Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that I'm back, bitch
Earl leave bastards with milkiest asses
Take a firm standin', nine on the tracklist
Earl half the reason the reviews fantastic
Niggas gettin' comfy on the couch, I ain't havin' it
Kickin' gluteus maximus, killin' niggas on accident

Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em!

Off 'em, no off days, no debates, bitch
Box logo switchblade, and cocaine
In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation
The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick
Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes
The crowd go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with
Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it
Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit
Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face
With erasers and use Based God as his replacement
Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings
Eat puss, sweet puss got my tooth decayin'
You might also like
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em!

Now pan the cameras back to me and Pamela's
Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager
And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina
And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up
Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough
And by enough I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us
Flyer than your man because I'm lampin' up
At the airport smokin' hash with all the fuckin' baggage handlers
Flowin' like the mothafuckin' aqueducts
Odd Future Wolf Gang, fag damagers, bitch, eat a dick27Embed
