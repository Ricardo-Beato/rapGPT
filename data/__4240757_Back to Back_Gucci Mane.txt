A R T G, no dope attached, back to back
In the north, I'm shining, doing this shit, you know it back to back
Gettin money, nigga, I sell dope, do it back to back
Fuckin these hoes, back to back
A nigga hit her, that was back to back

Back to back, back to back
Back to back money, get it back
Back and fourth nigga, back and back
Supercharge, back and back
See the camera when I’m back and back
Back to back gettin money, that's a motherfuckin sack
Your man just came one time, then he left you back
Send him a sack, and a pack, he can't write back
Back to back gettin it, back to back spendin that lettace
Back to back at Neamon’s, doin this shit for no reason
Back to back, she suck it, off the pills and trees, man
Goddamb, killin this shit, killa season
Supercharge my Rolli, hit the cam
Goddamb, trunck full of wam
Nigga from the block, you ain't never been where I been, nigga
Day one nigga, I don't know you, nigga
Fuck a motherfuckin friend, nigga
Back to back, got bitches callin back to back
After you call the first time, gettin money on my mind
Back to back, killin every track, Fresh do it back to back

In the north, I'm shining, doing this shit, you know it back to back
Gettin money, nigga, I sell dope, do it back to back
Fuckin these hoes, back to back

VVS shining car, nigga, I'm back to back
See the watch, see the rings, see the earings, have a heart attack
Goddamb, these niggas think they rappers, they no match
I'm hotter than a match, I be like a blowtorch

Gettin money, nigga, I sell dope, do it back to back
Fuckin these hoes, back to back
