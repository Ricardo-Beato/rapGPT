Livin' in a world so cold
Keep a nigga on ten toes
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control

Uh, thirty million by age thirty
Motivated to reach my goals, trust me, I ain't worried
'Bout weak-minded bitches and hoes
These low-life niggas who ain't got no self-control
Been feelin' hungry and they just ain't feedin' my soul
I had to let go
A lot of people that I really thought were there for me were just in my way (Facts, uh-huh)
Holdin' on the fact of what we used to be back in the day
Niggas ain't gon' meet me halfway, I ain't finna wait
Had to cut the dead weight
Just so I could elevate and levitate, now let me set the record straight
Every day, I meditate 'cause I'm the one they love to hate
Focus on the bigger picture, tryna find a better way
'Cause I ain't finna cut myself short
Money gettin' longer, but happiness never been bought (Facts)
The type of shit I'll teach to my daughter never was taught
To me when I was younger 'cause that shit wasn't even a thought (Wasn't even a thought)

Livin' in a world so cold (So cold)
Keep a nigga on ten toes (Ten toes)
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control
Livin' in a world so cold (So cold)
Keep a nigga on ten toes (Ten toes)
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control

Droppin' my top down on cruise control
Droppin' my top down on cruise control

It was all a dream, came in this at seventeen
Me and my Pro Era team focused on the better things
Tryna stack cheddar, C.R.E.A.M. rule everything, uh
Foot up on the pedal and never settlin'
I'm full steam ahead of them, ten-year veteran, how you figure?
Name a nigga that I ain't better than, my flow iller
Still, it's the cure like medicine, the cold killer
Glock tucked inside the letterman by Pro Era
I swear this shit couldn't be more clearer
It's like I'm lookin' through a whole mirror
I could see the vision, so I live like it's my last day
And everything I want just tryna meet me halfway
I try to stay calm, but niggas tryna blast me
The ski mask way, lookin' for a fast pay, so I stay
Armed and alarmed 'cause I ain't tryna go the fast way
It's a marathon, you can't treat it like a drag race

Yo, what's your name again?
I know you from where? High school?
I don't know you, man
Loser
Livin' in a world so cold (So cold)
Keep a nigga on ten toes (Ten toes)
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control
Livin' in a world so cold (So cold)
Keep a nigga on ten toes (Ten toes)
Where I'm headin', only Lord knows
Said, I'm droppin' my top down on cruise control

Droppin' my top down on cruise control ('trol, 'trol, 'trol, 'trol)
Droppin' my top down on cruise control ('trol, 'trol, 'trol, 'trol)

Ladies and gentlemen
Your man, Mr. Nasir Jones, is proud to present my man, Jo-Vaughn

Wise man, this man has age on him like he's been here before
Yet he's a young king, you heard?
Everybody in the back, quiet down, get ready for some real shit
I introduce to you a great one, you know him as Joey Bada$$1Embed
