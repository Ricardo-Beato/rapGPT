87 ContributorsFOR MY PEOPLE Lyrics
You know, yeah
Always wanted to have super powers
You know, uh

This for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?
This for my people
Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero?

Uh, now all heroes don't wear capes
And all villains don’t get away
But all limits eventually fade
I don't wanna be good, nigga, I'm tryna be great
It’s hard when your back's against the wall
And if you got it all to keep your feet up on the floor
So I thank the Lord when I wake up in the morn'
'Cause to inform the world the very reason I was born
You can see the power when the mic is in my palm
When I storm across the room, hit the stage and perform
Word is bond, don't be alarmed
Don't let me have to sound the horn, and drop a bomb
Wanna get my mom a crib, with a lawn
Somethin' that my future kids, can run up on
So I always do my best to carry on
Life is like game of chess, don't be a pawn, my nigga
You might also like
This for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?
This for my people
Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero?

Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane
No, it's the young black god livin’ out his dreams
What you mean? I been up on an ultralight beam
They don't wanna see you fly, they just gonna shoot your wings
Everything ain't what it seem
Wishin' all these dirty cops, would come clean
Still swervin’ on these city blocks, for one thing
My man just copped a 30 shot, protect the team, know what I mean?
Music is a form of expression
I'ma use mine just to teach you a lesson
Rule one: this microphone's a weapon
I'm shootin' out the actions manifested and my passion
Never restin', I'm surpassin' the expectancy
Of life in my direction
Man the section 8 depressin'
Hard to be progressin' through recession and oppression
Not to mention that they had us cell blocked ever since an adolescent
This for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?
This for my people
Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero?

Oh, yeah
Oh, mm
Oh, yeah23Embed
