I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause

We just love to dream
I fell asleep when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby, it's just me
I don't believe what I just lost

I don't wanna close my eyes
Nobody wants to fall (Fall) after they did it all (All)
I wonder if I left my body there, would I
Die right in my sleep (Sleep) but in reality ('Ty)
It could feel like anything is possible
When I hear you speak, it really drives it deep
Woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night
It's gettin' under my skin, baby
I wouldn't wonder why

I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause
You might also like
We just love to dream
I fell asleep when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby (Na-na-na-na-na)
It's just me (Na-na-na-na-na)
I don't believe (Na-na-na-na-na)
What I just lost (Na-na-na-na-na)
(I said, I said, I said) (Na-na-na-na-na)

And I said, "Ooh, stop it", ayy
I look a little like 'Nashe, ayy
You look a little exhausted, ayy (Yeah)
We should say nah to the party, ayy (Huh)
Take me home in the Bugatti, ayy (Yeah)
Hope you like a little tea, I put it on his teeth
He like my Yerba Mate, ayy
Jump in bed without my bonnet, ah (My bonnet)
Take a minute for the finer things (Yeah)
I don't even wanna sleep
You doin' some weed, blow it in my China bang
I be havin' hella dreams
Pickin' up his sheets feelin' like a tidal wave
Hit me if you want it right away
If he hit me with the mornin' sex
Show up, hit him with apologies
Kicks on him with a pile of J's
Bricks on him with a dick on him (Yo)
Put a fit on him with the Prada shades (Prada shades)
Tits on him and I ride away (Ride away)
How much do you want it? Twice a day
Four times on the holidays (Yeah)
King come through, your dreams come true
And trust me, you won't ever fall asleep
I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms (And I hope you)
I got everything, everything but real love (And I hope you)
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out (And I hope you)
Or you could leave me there, 'cause (Or leave me there)

We just love to dream (And I hope you)
I fell asleep (And I hope you) when you woke up, oh (And I hope you)
(Oh, baby, baby) It's not you, baby (Na-na-na-na-na)
It's just me (Na-na-na-na-na)
I don't believe (Na-na-na-na-na)
What I just lost (Na-na-na-na-na)

(Na-na-na-na-na)
