Uh
Ayy
Yeah
Are you ready?
Logic

Step into the mind of a young man
And if you don't then I don't really give a damn
All I wanna do is make you understand
But if you don't wanna listen I guess you ain't a part of the plan
Sorry if I digress
All I ever wanted was to be the best
Through lyricism that put your mind to the test
Stayin' up, late night, no rest
Feelin' bulletproof, no vest, but I confess
My mind's a mess, living in a world of stress I digest
But I gotta keep grinding
'Cause everyday success what I'm finding
And I don't give a damn if you hate on me
'Cause when I blow what you gon' say homie?
Heh, not a goddamn thing
But that's enough of that, I'ma let my home girl sing
You might also like
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
You might be knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)

All I think about is music
Don't get me wrong I think
About other things but this is how I fuse it
So the whole wide world can use it
When you feel like you just might lose it
Take a breath, homie, don't confuse it
Take a step in the mind of Logic
As long as you don't abuse it
So let me break it down for the whole world
Like I broke it down for my old girl
I can't deal with your bullshit
No more, gotta let it go, let it unfurl
'Cause I remember the time
When I was living sublime, wanted to make a living off of my rhymes
But the whole world told me never mind
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
You might be knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
I just wanna take it to another level
That I never even been on so I can sit on
Every single piece of paper that I put a pen on
And when I been on for like ten years
I'ma do it better than anybody before me
So the whole wide world will adore me, ain't no need to assure me
And if you wonder why I'm rapping so fast
It's 'cause I gotta lot of things on my mind
That wanna come out at the same time
In other words I'm racin'
I used to pursue my dreams
But now they're reality and that's what I'm chasin'
Why are we on this Earth?
Why must we feel pain?
Why does everybody feel the need
To judge one another when we're all the same?
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
You might be knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)46Embed
