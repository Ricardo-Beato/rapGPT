13 ContributorsThe Venetian Lyrics

Ay yo, we like 39,000 feet up in the air and shit like that
Just ride the wave
Niko, what's up

I do this shit cause I want
Man, don't need no reason
Started out at the Bodega
Now we at the Venetian
So Brazilian, but the clothes Parisian
I just do my thing and write like a king man I'm Stephen
These rappers Mr. Fantastic to me, they be reachin'
They poetically describing their gats
That they never squeezin' (pow)
Pardon me I'm starting to see it
Jobs is misleading
Even a snake infiltrated the garden of Eden
Boy stay around the time
It like Martin to Gina
They diggin' meaner than a Spartan's demeanour (Yo, keep it 3 hunnid)
Just spark it and park it
The valet be parking the beamer
Sharper than a ?
That orange indica Ha
You get it for the low
Like Forrest Whittaker's eye
Their vision ?
Don't make up for that counterfeit
Probably with that Alchemist
Free myself then I only see myself like Malcolm
You might also like
I do this shit cause I want not cause I need a reason
Started off at the Bodego now we at the Venetian
Started off at the Bodego now we at the Venetian

(We need to build to destroy, you know what we about)
I had a dub sac in my bucket, rolling round like fuck it
Now i pull up in a luxurious something
With nothing less than an onion
See I'm the wolf the boys cry about (fibbin')
You lyin in yo lines like the county building
Burning backwoods niggas poppin outta woodwork
Punch told me how this shit would work
That's why i just smirk
Niko let these people know b (let these people know)
While they voted
We was devoted, TDE Javotii
Felt like an activist, bumping Hi-Tek and Kweli
Now the activis gone, we sippin' high tech and Kweli (Quali')
Junius Brutus with the flow like the Ceasar
Just ask Seasick, but don't get sea sick
SOUL

Let's go
Squadin' up and the crew is tough
Cold and frozen the chosen, like I got Jewish blood
Commited like institutions
I'm married to my music
Women in my life are gettin' jealous, because is my truest love
Get my eyes on the prize
Cause my lyrics are like the Pulitzer
Murderer of verses
I am Like Persus to Medusa brah
Better yet King Louis the Sixteenth
Them angels are falling like Lucifer
How could see coming its disgusting
This neck is gushing with too much blood
Academic fellowship even my mellow shit is super tough
Not the fellowship of the ring with the hobbits and talking junipers
I am a follower of the Freestyle Fellowship, them niggas knew their stuff
I'm a student of Myka 9
Long pieces of Jupiter
Nowadays rappers are stupider
Swearing to God that they blew up
I soon I take the stage
Niggas take the fade like a super cut
Immediately stage my scenery
So I chew it up
And I spit it out like I was puking
That's why you threw it up
