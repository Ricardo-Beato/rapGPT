(FBG FXX with me, it's more number ones to tend to)
Talk to a baddie, call me in traffic
Come up to Magic you tryna see me

Rich ass nigga
Lost a couple mil' last year, got figures
Made a couple bags, my bag got bigger
I'ma make it hard for them to trace my pictures, goddamn
Made a hundred mil', my nigga
Need a big booty bitch to fall in love with me
I can make it hard for you to fall in love with me

My bitch asked me why I always stay extra-d out
All my whips got extras now
Why so many hoes on the low? You know
Why my niggas extras? (Extra, extra, extra)
Why my bitch so extra?
I'm always on extra

Pour me another one, I cannot slow
Until I can't feel no more pain
Pour me another one, I cannot slow
Until I can't feel no more pain
You might also like
Jump out this bitch, got the water again
These bitches calling me Aquaman
I got her phone number callin' again (Callin' again, callin' again)
Benjis on Benjis on Benjis again
Thats all I been on since you got with him
Ain't been the same since, I wanna save my pain
You know it's all before, man, these hoes all in love
Had to hit all the clubs, swapped out the ones before
Big booty from my city, never seen nothin' like
Nothin' like hit it, quit it

My bitch asked me why I always stay extra-d out
All my whips got extras now
Why so many hoes on the low? You know
Why my niggas extras? (Extra, extra, extra)
Why my bitch so extra?
I'm always on extra

Pour me another one, I cannot slow
Until I can't feel no more pain

(Rich nigga, rich nigga
Extra, extra
Rich nigga, rich nigga)
I'm so (Extra)2Embed
