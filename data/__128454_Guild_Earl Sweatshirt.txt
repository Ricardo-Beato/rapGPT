170 ContributorsGuild Lyrics
Uh, said this a hit of liquid heroin
Marilyn Manson channelin'
Panickin', spar with Anakin
'Til one of us leave in an ambulance
Blow the smoke of the spliff in your eyes
You ain't gon' live 'til you die
Intelligent bitch on my side
She bitchin', I'm spittin' habitual lies
I hit her up when my jet land (Call her)
Got a Swisher tucked in my headband (Baller)
Front page news, I'm young Jesus
Eatin' bagels with no cable on (Let's go)
Been fuckin' hoes since when Mase was on (Okay)
I hope the Based God hear my prayers (Pray)
One day you're here, the next day you're gone
So me and Earl smokin' weed on Jay-Z's lawn
Some dope rap on your ho ass, Tony Womack
Don't hold back, no, feed your girl Cognac (Woah)
Meet a bitch, sleepin' wit' her, feverish, diva chick
Met her off Twitter, even Schindler keep a list (Okay)
Pittsburgh, broke down somewhere in a Fisker (Uh-huh)
I could pull your bitch with a whisper (Uh-huh), then diss her (Woah)
Dumbass ho (Ho)
She only dumb 'cause she love that dough (Okay)
Somewhere gettin' high readin' Juxtapoz
Hit her up, she come through, watch Adjustment Bureau
(That's a good movie)
Moms love me 'cause I'm so commercial ('Mercial)
I fuck 'em raw 'cause I know they fertile (Fertile)
In Myrtle Beach with a purple fleece (Fleece)
Hotel lobbies playin' FÃ¼r Elise (Yeah)
I'm Ron Burgundy mixed with Hercules
Slap a bitch in the mouth if she curse at me (Ow)
Said Josh beard is like Paul Revere
When he walk in the room it's like God is here
I'm at a prop shop in Montauk throwin' tomahawks at civilians
I'm chillin', yeah
You might also like
I'm on the monitor, nigga
She takin' it like a champ and I'm proud of her, nigga
I'm on the couch where that loud is burnin'
I'm shoutin', "I don't fuck with you," 'cause I don't
Never love a ho
But we could play doctor, ma, open wide for thermometer
Your cowgirl is crotch ridin' (Nigga)
With a clean, faded fro, lopsided (Uh)
Tell the label that I want a white driver (Uh)
And tell him give me space, I don't know that nigga (Nigga)
Bold-ass little fuckin' low-class villian (Villain)
Whole van tinted (Tinted), nope, can't kill him (No)
It's the Trashwang nigga (Nigga), that's what's up (Nigga)
Half pint of hope in that plastic cup (Come on)
Real nigga from the start 'til the casket shut (Uh)
Present his own case, he's a basket one (One)
Present-day based nigga, smack the judge (Judge)
Ridin' with them same niggas, ashin' blunts
While that bass make his face like he mad or somethin' (Uh)
Slide in the safe, take the cash and run (Run)
Know that if he fake I'm harrassin' him
Took the big toe so they tagged the tongue
Out here stuntin' like I'm supposed to, dog (Dog)
Blowin' more smoke than a broke exhaust
Pipe only spirit that I hold menthol (Uh)
It's Wolf Gang, bitch, like you know these paws
Livin' like it's '62 (Uh), spit and grip my genitals (Uh)
My bitch just split the Swisher, my niggas split them residuals
Hey, it's marijuana fields, pot growin'
Blarin' Gil Scott Heron while we pill pop
Errand run and kill cop
Niggas know I feel not for 'em, stop bitchin', bruh
Stare and get that grill knocked open
Hey, it's marijuana fields, pot growin'
Blarin' Gil Scott Heron while we pill pop
Errand run and kill cop
Niggas know I feel not for 'em, stop bitchin', bruh
Stare and get that grill knocked open... nigga51Embed
