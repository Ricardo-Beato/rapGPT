Yeah
It's good to be home
No place like it
Home sweet
Home

Ayo I'm going back to Cali
To all the ladies in the valley
And the weather more beautiful than Halle
And I done been all through the hood
My boy Dougie D, man he took me on a tour through the hood
Slauson swap meet, Crenshaw, stop, eat
Then go to Melrose, cop a pair of shelltoes
Then I'm jumpin' on the 5-North
First I gas up, and then I drive off
To the Bay, oh how I love it in the Bay
Same way I love it in LA
I get a lot of love up on Haight Street
Folks look up to me like I'm 8 feet
Tall, ayo the West Coast got it all
And every time I go, man I have a ball
Fun times, sunshine, that's right up my alley
That's why I'm going back to Cali
You might also like
I'll be back, for now I'm gone
You know what they say, no place like home
I'm keeping my girls in my phone
Worldwide I be all in my zone
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
Adios, adios
Au revoir, au revior
Cheerio
Home sweet home

Hey yo, I'm going back to Paris, France
And I must say, that you really should go if you have a chance
The culture, the music, the art
The food, the people, they real to the heart
This is genuine love, this is not a act
And I couldn'ta put it down on a hotter track
I hear a lot of cats talk a lotta smack
But I lost six G's, and I got it back
How real is that? Thinking the utmost
Respect from me against the world full of cut-throats
How could I lose a grip like that?
In a crowded sports bar and get it right back (I don't know)
It's like no place I ever went
And this'll be the biggest shout that I ever sent
To any city that I ever flew through
Merci beaucoup, I salute you
I'll be back, for now I'm gone
You know what they say, no place like home
I'm keeping my girls in my phone
Worldwide I be all in my zone
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
Adios, adios
Au revoir, au revior
Cheerio

I'm going back to the Netherlands
Switzerland, Finland, Deutschland, and the motherland
I'm going back to Jo-Burg, back to Cape Town
Back to Sydney, oh what a great town
Let me break down where I'm going back to
If I been through, I want to come back through
And like a tattoo, I would stay permanent
But my love for the road don't determine it

I'll be back, for now I'm gone
You know what they say, no place like home
I'm keeping my girls in my phone
Worldwide I be all in my zone
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
Adios, adios
Au revoir, au revior
Cheerio
