55 ContributorsOOPS Lyrics
Polo Boy Shawty on the track, so I am killin' it

Never needed nothin', nigga
Canary yellow diamonds like the wrapper of a Butterfinger
Hit him, then my brother follow up, that's a double stinger
Told the bitch the truth, she runnin' 'round like it's Jerry Springer
It could be an opera singer
Two speedin' tickets in a month, that's the Bentley coupe
Split the check in half with the gang, that's what brothers do
Check a bitch, checkmate, check please, woo!
Two cribs, six cars, under 22

Oops, oops, ooh
Fuck a nigga bitch, I'm like, "Oops" (Oops)
Pass her to the gang, nigga, that's an alley-oop (Oop)
Ridin' 'round town in an all-white coupe (Yeah)
Gang of bad bitches blow a nigga like soup (Yeah)
You was buyin' Polos, I was buyin' coupes
Oops, oops, oops, oops

Yeah, 2 Chainz
Lames still rockin' them Ray-Bans (Ray-Bans)
Them sure look like Ray-Bans (Woo)
Took a brick, then got a spray tan (Hah)
Represent the A like a exam
Live from the block, shine in the dark
Grind Ã  la carte, time on the clock
Can't get it back, where you niggas at?
Sold so many Z's, can't take a nap (Tell 'em)
Tired of the fraternize
I am as real as they advertise (Yeah)
I like the pussy with sanitize (True)
She left her thong, tried to sabotage
Bitch, you know I got a main (Got a main)
I got my pockets on Country Kane
Gator shit on like a Florida game
If you spill somethin' on me, I wouldn't get a stain
Oops, oops
You might also like
Oops, oops, ooh
Fuck a nigga bitch, I'm like, "Oops" (Oops)
Pass her to the gang, nigga, that's an alley-oop (Oop)
Ridin' 'round town in an all-white coupe (Yeah)
Gang of bad bitches blow a nigga like soup (Yeah)
You was buyin' Polos, I was buyin' coupes
Oops, oops, oops, oops

Racks up, fat knots, deep bass, big watch
Six cars, young Yacht, too rich, clean stitch (Woo)
Lean fixed, grill-less, new whip black as Seal, sis
Diamonds all real, sis, yo daughter my gutter, bitch
The belly gettin' bigger (Woo), might put some ice on my trigger (Huh)
Choppa start singin' like Trigga (Trigga)
Don't fuck with me, nigga
Yeah, late night, I'm out with your bitch, someone took a pic, ooh (Yuh)
What that is up on my wrist? That's a whole brick, Lil Boat (Woo)

Oops, oops, ooh
Fuck a nigga bitch, I'm like, "Oops" (Oops)
Pass her to the gang, nigga, that's an alley-oop (Oop)
Ridin' 'round town in an all-white coupe (Yeah)
Gang of bad bitches blow a nigga like soup (Yeah)
You was buyin' Polos, I was buyin' coupes
Oops, oops, oops, oops10Embed
