(Wheezy outta here)

No, I will not answer, please do not do call my phone
Mr. Do-Not-Answer-Phone
Please, oh, girl, oh, leave me 'lone
Double cup, it's styrofoam
Pull up, my car, it go, "Vroom"
This a coupe, no, no legroom
Pull up on your bitch like, "Zoom"

What you thought, that I wasn't gon' come through?
What you thought, I wasn't gon' get comfortable?
You know I wouldn't do this if it wasn't you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what I can and what I can't do

I know every time that I'ma come through
Yeah, I just turned to the big man
Big shoes, big hands, countin' big bands
Big B on the back of my new pants
She saw the zippers and said, "Those are some sick pants"
Ooh, I cop Balmain by the flurry
I got all this money nowadays, so I can't worry
Breathe in, breathe out, so a bitch can't serve me
Size 29 my jeans, but my clip is a thirty

Ooh, I'ma get it, run it up, got no choice
I'ma sing until I got no voice
I don't fuck with you boys

I know every time that I'ma come through
Yeah, I just turned to the big man
