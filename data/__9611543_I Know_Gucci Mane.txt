8 ContributorsI Know Lyrics
You see me stunning, I know that it hurt you (I know that it hurt you)
I can get money, I know that it hurt you (I know that it hurt you)
See me go up and I know that it hurt you (I know that it hurt you)
I'ma keep stunning I know that it hurt you
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

I told 'em to spray you, but I could've murked you
I did a commercial, but didn't go commercial
My circle so small, you can't fit in my circle (It's Gucci)
I'm ridin' in a Maybach commission by Virgil
Threw bait at the bitch and she bit it like turtle
I can't fuck her raw 'cause her pussy too fertile
Penthouse on the beach and I ain't talking murder
If you interview Gucci, don't ask him 'bout murders
Vest gon' protect, he got shot in the girdle
Say he got beef with me, I never heard of (Huh?)
Rocking some kicks that don't come out 'til April
This bitch droppin' salt who got kicked out the label (Wow)
How you gon' bite who put food on the table? (Huh?)
Fam' against fam', this shit Cain versus Abel (Fam)
Why you keep begging? Don't watch me, watch cable
Said Guwop fell off, man, that boy told a fable (Well, damn)

You see me stunning, I know that it hurt you (Huh)
I can get money I know that it hurt you (It's Gucci)
See me go up and I know that it hurt you
I know that it hurt you, I know that it hurt you
Money getting longer and it's only getting worse (It's gone)
Game elevated I'm a whole 'nother person (It's gone)
I'ma keep stunning, I know that it hurt you
I know that it hurt you, I know that it hurt you (It's Gucci)

Got so much cash, I can build me a safe house
I'm building a new house, it's bigger than Drake house (Wow)
A nigga play with me, I'm bringing the Drac' out
Rock so much water, turn the clothes to a lake house
I ain't gotta worry about the police doin' stake out
Got a private chef, we don't even eat take out
I remember, I was eating lobster first day out
Whole lot of crabs in that bucket, didn't make out (Crabs)
I know some killers got life on a break out
I had to sack up the bud, take the shake out
We ain't had no gold in the hood, brought the crate out
Floor full of money, make the ho bring the rake out (Well, damn)
Rob with no gun, he got beat, knock his lights out
Took his jewels off, put 'em on, now we iced out (Bling)
He fucked his bitch, now he mad, wanna fight now
Thought he was the man, but he told, he a mice now
You ain't piped up like that, you need to pipe down
Lyrics all cap, need to go put the mic down (Cap)
Bullet fly by, this shit windy like Chi-Town
Don't sleep on the A-Town, this shit ain't a playground
I got say, niggas better get down or lay down
When shots fired, niggas better get down and stay down
Always knew I would come up 'cause I stay down
It ain't my birthday, but I still bring the cake around (It's Gucci)
You see me stunning, I know that it hurt you (Huh)
I can get money I know that it hurt you (Huh)
See me go up and I know that it hurt you
I know that it hurt you, I know that it hurt you
Money getting longer and it's only getting worse (It's gone)
Game elevated I'm a whole 'nother person (It's gone)
I'ma keep stunning, I know that it hurt you (Know it)
I know that it hurt you, I know that it hurt you (Know it)

My dawg just gave me some great advice, he told me go harder
It's Gucci, burrEmbed
