10 ContributorsCocky Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Racked up, stacked up nigga
We getting checks nigga, you feel me?
I can't even stress it no more nigga
Niggas ask me-
Niggas ask me, you know what I'm saying? (I love GOLD!)
Niggas ask me if you good, you know what I'm saying?
Niggas ask me if you good
I tell a nigga I can't remember the last time I was bad, you feel me?
Young rich nigga for real, you feel me?
Count up my digits

Damn, ran up a sack now I don't know how to act
Walk with that check on my back (Lil Boat)
Damn, ran up a sack now I don't know how to act
Walk with that check on my back
Don't give a fuck, that's a fact
Pin my name to the game with a tack
Oh-ohh, niggas be scary like cats
Niggas be snitchin' like rats
Boot to his face like a motherfuckin' doormat
Yeah, yea-ah, fuck that bitch till I break her lil' back
Stupid lil' bitch tried to ask for a stack
Send her on her way, we do not do that
Confidence levels so high (high)
So high in the sky (higher than the sky)

No one is better than me (no)
No one is better than me (no, no, no, no)
No one is better than me (no, no, no, no)
No one is better than me (no, no, no, noo)
No one is better than me (no, no, no, noo)
No one is better than me, no, no (no, no, no, no)
No one is better than me (no, no, noo)
No one is better than me (no, no, no, noo)
No one is better than me (no, no, no)
No one is better than me, no, no (Lil Boat)

Real motherfucker, I'm with it (Lil Boat)
I count up my digits, got too many bitches
Bitches don't mean shit to me, these bitches be history
Niggas be fightin' they homie over pussy that shit so sick to me
Spit a 12 just for 20 thousand that's like flickin' your wrist to me..2Embed
