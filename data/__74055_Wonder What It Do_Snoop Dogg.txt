7 ContributorsWonder What It Do Lyrics
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

Ooh-hoo (Ah)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
Ooh-hoo (Woo)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

They say his Escalade '64 on Vogues
In the game, pain still the same, they knocking at your door
Ooh, you wanna only talk bad (Wanna only talk bad)
It's a sad, sad thing, you dirty low down

Ooh-hoo (I wonder)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (Soo)
Ooh-hoo
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

Wa-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Won't you tell me now?)
Wa-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Please)
Wa-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Won't you tell me now?)
Wa-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Snoop Dogg)

Independent, I'm in it, been getting my cash right
Walking through the daytime holding my flashlight
Spliff-ted, high as I could ever be
I'm lifted, drifting on the memory
My style, my tone, my delivery
My maze is Frankie Beverly
Heavily influenced, I do it like you can't
I'm the weed to the Zag with the bag of the drink
Get live, that's five on the black hand side
Now try to stay fly with a piece of the pie
I heard fish don't burn in the kitchen
The baby gangsters, they get in the hood and on a mission
Uh, you pump 'em, up they fuck it up
Now what you need to do is toughen up
Now chuck it up, what it do, dog?
I thought you wanted to be like big (Snoop Dogg)

Ooh-hoo
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
Ooh-hoo (Tell me)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

When I get lost (When I get lost)
I feel like a boss (Feel like a boss)
She will be my salvation (Marijuana-uana-uana)
And when I feel low (I feel low)
With nowhere to go (Nowhere to go)
She'll be my inspiration (Marijuana-uana-uana-uana)
She never spends (She never spends)
Time with her friends (Nuh-uh, nuh-uh)
Tells me she's blue without me
And when things go wrong (Yeah)
Her faith is strong
I know that she'll never doubt me
(Hey, Snoop Dogg)
Ooh-hoo (What it do? What it do?)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (Yeah, wonder, wonder, wonder what it do, I wonder what it do)
Ooh-hoo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I wonder what it do)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (Get your groove on, uh, yeah)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Do it make you feel good?)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Do it make you feel good?)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Do it make you feel good?)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Do it make you feel good?)Embed
