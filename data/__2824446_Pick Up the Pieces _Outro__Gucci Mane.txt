Waist deep up shit creek
(Will-Will-Will-William)
Tryna come up but the slope too steep
What you kill, what you eat
What you sow, what you reap
What you learn, what you teach
What you see, you repeat
W-I-Z-O-P, Wizop
Hmm, start over
(Zaytoven)

I'm the T-R-A-P-G-O-D (Huh)
In the A with an FNH on me (Grra)
Know the feds want to build another case on me (Fuck 'em)
Eight hunnid got a nigga whole safe on me (Racks)
And I'm marchin' with the bands, FAMU on me (Woo)
It's a battle of the bands in the V.I.P. (Woo)
And she say she go to Clark but she dance at Tease (Yeah)
I dare anybody here to put their hands on me (Damn)
Put the stick up, kids want to kidnap me (Woo)
Got a SIG on me, are you kiddin' me? (Huh?)
A lil' freak lied and tried to put a kid on me
And my own homeboys called the pigs on me (Woo)
But my faith got stronger and my money grew longer
Sold all my artists now, Gucci Mane a fucking loner (Loner)
I'm a part-timeâ€‹ rapper, I'm a full time owner
Breakin' rules and bendin' corners, crack your head with a Corona, wop (Wop)
You might also like
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
When it all falls apart, we pick up the pieces (Yeah)
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces (Huh)
Just hit the streets, hit my jeweler and picked up the pieces (Burr)
Pick up the pieces (Huh), pick up the pieces
Break a brick down then pick up the pieces (Skrrt)
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces (Huh?)
When it all falls apart, we pick up the pieces (Yeah)

I got a FNH on side of me (Huh)
'Case my enemies feel they want to ride on me (Fuck 'em)
'Bout to throw up in this club, all this Ace inside of me (Urgh)
Bad bitch in front of me, these weak hoes can't front on me (No)
Ugly hoes can't sell pussy, rich niggas can't fuck for free (Nah)
Barely standin' in V.I.P., we run off in luxury (Catch 'em)
Throwin' money ain't nothin' to me
I'm just givin' these broke hoes somethin' to see (Ziggy)
2Pac, yeah, "All Eyez On Me," 2 Chainz, yeah, "Feds Watching" me (Fuck 'em)
2 Live Crew, Gucci two times, hit one too many, bitch, and I might be (Rollin')
Haters talkin', don't worry me, all they do is encourage me (Yeah)
I'm a worldwide executive, neighborhood celebrity (It's Gucc')
And ain't nothin' in this world gon' stop me from gettin' currency (Uh)
These bad bitches cherish me, lil' niggas look up to me (Yeah)
Put my AP and my Rollie on when they bury me (Burr)
Scared of me, you better be, tell me who ain't heard of me (Yeah)
I just offed another hunnid piece, bought a watch for eighty G (Wop)
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
When it all falls apart, we pick up the pieces (Yeah)
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces (Huh)
Just hit the streets, hit my jeweler and picked up the pieces (Burr)
Pick up the pieces (Huh), pick up the pieces
Break a brick down then pick up the pieces (Skrrt)
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces (Huh?)
When it all falls apart, we pick up the pieces (Yeah)3Embed
