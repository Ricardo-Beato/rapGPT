6 ContributorsBurr Lyrics
So much Ice, I should have brought my fur
After the club I might leave with her
Go tell your jewelery man to step it up
Cause man your stones ain't bright enough
Rappers think Gucci Mane should lighten up
Club night we be lighting up
Ten thousand dime pieces lining up
And all they say is "boy you blinding us"

My money growing like a chia pet, ch-ch-ch-chia
And my ears like a quarter mil, is you for real?
And my lamb is like a shark with gills, look at the rims
And my beamer coupe got spinning wheels, like they on pills
I put sixes on my old school and my Rolls Royce
Swear to god Drumma Boy I only drove that bitch once
Gucci, ball players where Gucci live, that's how we chill
My back yard big as a baseball field, That's 'fore the deal
My pocket full of old big head white dudes
Because I get forty thou just to walk through
Schedule booked up now I can't make room
Pissy jewelery like my jeweler got it from the rest room

You might also like
You niggas in the hood mad because I got cash
Probably because I ride past fast (pending)
Jumping out the back of the phantom like damn
Don't I look so motherfucking handsome, mam?
Man fuck Gucci, So Icy ain't a movement
So Icy ain't a movement?  is you stupid?
Cupid shoot arrows, I shoot double barrels
Retarded ass diamond watch like Little Darryl
A nigga named Harold, who used to go to 
Was found  back seat of a jaguar
Homie hit a lick, 30 bricks bought a camaro
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, Just like my apparel


It ain't legal, search and seizure, get away from vehicle
Believe, I be smoking reefer, I don't be legal

I bequeath me unto my sea, you know I'm a G
She petite but she such a freak, tear down the boutique
We discreet, we rack up with , damn I'm such a thief
Meet your girlfriend, soon as you wink take her out to eat
Can't compete, say she incomplete, so she fucking me
The elite, Gucci Mane The G, Drumma on the beat
Wouldn't believe what you can achieve, then just look at me
Hope my life a living testimony, Gucci
