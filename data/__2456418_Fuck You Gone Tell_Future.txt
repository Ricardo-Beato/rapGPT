6 ContributorsFuck You Gone Tell Lyrics
Young nigga heard about a lick, nigga, what the fuck you gonna tell em
Still riding around with that stick, nigga, what the fuck you gonna tell em
Nigga ain't never had shit, nigga, what the fuck you gonna tell em
Getting to that money right now, nigga what the fuck you gonna tell em
The homie got double on life, what the fuck you gonna tell em
Nigga ain’t never had shit, what the fuck you gonna tell em
And when you came from the gutter it ain’t nothing you can tell us
Young nigga ain’t nothing but a robber, aye, what the fuck you gonna tell em

(Go Crazy) Nigga get caught with the bales, what the fuck you gonna tell
Caught a body, this nigga caught a L, what the fuck you gonna tell
Lil mexico niggas rain hell, nigga what the fuck you gonna tell
Molly and them xans and the percs, what the fuck you gonna tell
Nigga got caught on them squares, what the fuck you gonna tell
Hottest nigga round in the streets, what the fuck you gonna tell

Lean got in for the cheap, whatcha gone tell
Nigga goin’ hard than the planet, what the fuck you gonna tell
Carry that loaf and handle it, what the fuck you gonna tell
Bought a bitch a new panamara, who the fuck she gone tell
Bitch ain’t none of that shit, who the fuck she gone tell

Young nigga heard about a lick, nigga, what the fuck you gonna tell em
Still riding around with that stick, nigga, what the fuck you gonna tell em
Nigga never had shit, nigga, what the fuck you gonna tell em
Getting to that money right now, nigga what the fuck you gonna tell em
The homie got double on life, what the fuck you gonna tell em
Nigga ain’t never had shit, what the fuck you gonna tell em
And when you came from the gutter it ain’t nothing you can tell us
Young nigga ain’t nothing but a robber, aye, what the fuck you gonna tell em
