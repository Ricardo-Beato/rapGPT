142 ContributorsEye for a Eye (Your Beef Is Mines) Lyrics

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines

Let me start from the beginnin', at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav? Situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya
And leave your corpse for the cops to discover
While I be pimpin' in the Range Rover, all jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryna knock me and lock me
But I be on the low sippin' Asti Spumante
Niggas tried to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack — it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep lettin' them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm outta town, one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours, and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps? I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children, make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile, but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus, the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket, hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter-soft leather upholstery
But mostly, keep the gat closely 'cause niggas wanna toast me
You might also like
A-yo, I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my 9 serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organize fiend servants
Tryna make a mill is stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, 'cause everythin' is real
Cuz, I wanna chill, laid up in a Jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly, with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught, dead up in New York
My brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost, never found again, my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last restin' place'll be a ditch, kid!
No one can stop me — try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me? You're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
A drug dealer's dream:
Stash C.R.E.A.M., ki's on a triple beam
500 SL green, '95 nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor-made ostrich, Chanel for my woman friend
Murderin', numbers on your head while I'm burglarin'
Shank is servin' 'em
What's up to all my niggas swervin' in New York metropolis
The 'Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watchin' us
Mad man, my sanity is goin' like a hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced tryna bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you
Niggas who could've killed you is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar movin' on your weak production
Pumpin' corruption in the third world, we just bustin'!

Hold up and analyze — the wild cats sling cracks, they swing in Ac's
The new routines be my eyes
Blacks playin' corners, glancin' all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane, right?
Word, yo, I wanna get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front, you go
Sip beers — the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin and Queensbridge — we robbin' niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale, but the real, we still kill!
WHAT!
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines

Uhhhh! Laid back, word up
Jus' bless 'em with the bulletproof
Mobb Deep, Nas, Chef creation
For yo' nation, yeah!39Embed
