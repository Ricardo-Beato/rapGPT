2 ContributorsBible of Love (Interlude) LyricsFor those who don't know just what to do
Here's the Bible of love for you
Let it be a blessing every day
Every step of the way
You don't have to be in fear of rejection
Know that it's only God's direction
No matter the religion or your faith
It's the Bible of love
Bible of love, Bible of love
Till the haters get the message
Bible of love, Bible of love, Bible of LoveYou might also likeEmbed
