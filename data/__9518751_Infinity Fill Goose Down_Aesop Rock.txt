30 ContributorsInfinity Fill Goose Down Lyrics
The brand reads, "Animal Farm"
A fugee on the lam running
With a lamb in my arms
Trail of rabbits harboring
The farmer's brand of cigars
The cattle after
After that it's like a ramp to an ark
Planned a garlic salmon
Already romancing the fingerlings
When reminded why the ringer's off
It only ever ring, ring, ring
Out of radio silence
A bad miracle, panic in the paradigm
Attacking the familiar world
Evacuate
Bleeding heart
I had to let the horses out
Who each step forward to bow
Free to ignore the corral
Freedom ain't a circle
Per the management's normal amount
It's when the chorus vow to normalize the horse's mouth
Black Phillip, free to bah what he bahs
From a growing blob of jail-broken ox and hogs
I know some pigs'll splinter off
I seen 'em mixing with the bosses
Sipping gin as if the trough is less prestigious than the office
It isn't
Receiving a transmission from the future
Where your time around them
Humans ain't protect you from they butcher's block
A bunch of us are meeting at the moor behind the Orkin
You could've been a presence at the origin
Should you feel unsettled or some melting into madness
After entertaining more second chances than Velma's glasses
From a person, place, or otherwise
Increasingly disruptive trend
You could always run the red, or break the glass, or jump the fence
You might also like
Yeah
It was always all of a sudden
All's well 'til it's all of his palm on the button
I am always into somethin' (A- always)
I am always into somethin'
It was always all a who-dunnit
All told, it was all of us 'til it wasn't
I am always into somethin' (A- always)
I am always into somethin'

(Al- al- al- al- al- al- al-)
I am always into somethin'
(Al- al- al- al- al- al- al-)
I am always into somethin'
(Al- al- al- al- al- al- al-)
I am always into somethin'
(Al- al- al- al- al- al- al-)
I am always into somethin'

Yep
I could introduce you to another realm
Help you with the move
But only you can go fuck yourself
Cut to helter-skelter in glorious technicolor
With bumper to bumper
Sending turtle shells at one another
It's treasure hunters budding in
Some cannonball Running of Bulls
Sweating in the dead of summer
Red X on the bread and butter
Pardon while his pedal power
Shed the inseparable umbra
Reset the pecking order
Still ain't pick a second number
Dectective on some, "How you get so mega-extra-ultra?"
I said, "Never check the weather
And always dress for the tundra"
Merry "dawn of the mummy"
Heard a call in my slumber
Woke to a thousand years of a sauce-of-the-month in a bunker
Yum
You could be the lunker under pepper X
I feel like Professor Y
Why are all my friends depressed?
Why's this party feel like when I walked back into Selmer's Pets
In precious tears like, "Why are all my tetra dead?
Yet again?"
Land speed entirely contextual
Glacial pace, grand prix, space invader, camera B
Cam or not, copy room, camp ground or canteen
Every time you stand down, I pop out
Yelling, "And scene!"
Make a million paper cranes
Blindfolded, both arms
Stuck in different crane games
Under water, over coals
Whole of his spirit above him
Call now, I am always into somethin'
(Al- al- al- al- al- al- al-)
I am always into somethin'
(Al- al- al- al- al- al- al-)
I am always into somethin'
(Al- al- al- al- al- al- al-)
I am always into somethin'
(Al- al- al- al- al- al- al-)
I am always into somethin'
