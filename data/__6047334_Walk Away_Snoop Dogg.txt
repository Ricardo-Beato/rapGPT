4 ContributorsWalk Away LyricsYeah, nigga I'm a rock star
Yeah yeah
Rock rock rock star
I'm a rock star
Pitbull off the leash
Rollin' through your back door
Grab me
Naw nigga you lose
Hands in the air
Motherfucker, don't move
Uhh, so groove with this
So cool, old school, just groove with this
Hands up to the ceiling, now you feelin' the fillin'
Snoop Dogg in this motherfucker
Killin' and willin', dealin'
Full fillin' and you still won't get mashed
In the coupe with the motherfuckin' heat in the stash
Po-po's got on me, but I got on 'em
In the fast lane, talkin' on the chit phone
They cut the record
Bought a nigga mo' trees
Now we gettin' mo' cheese
And we do it overseas
Uhh, bring it back to thе other side
Roll to the othеr side
On a whole 'nother vibe
Four Fifth
And not a four, four
She said, close the door
Get with the program, lay it down easy
All she wanna do is  on me
Word to the DJ
Seems I'm always C with the dope
Yo, get it smoke
You might also likeYeah, this could be all that you've been wantin' to see
Me, D-O-Double G
I do it to y'all 'cause I'm so way OG
A lil' nigga said he wanna be like me
Honestly, modestly, tattooed chronically
Time make a body
Make me kick it like Bruce Lee
Reading the Quran
Chilling in my goofy
Sipping on a smoothie
Watching my movie
Nigga won't you see
Try to introduce me
A motherfucker tried to spoof me
Goofy, goofy
Bitch, I'm Snoopy
Wooptie, wooptie, wooptie 
Picking up daisies
Niggas is so fugazzi
I keep my porch light on
'Cause I'm bad to the bone and I rock and I roll
Walk out with my cock out
Just like a rock star
Kick rocks, pop like a pop tart
Why you ridin' in the cop car?
Nigga, you get dropped hard
Mother fuck a pop star
Nigga, groove with that
Make a muthafucka, just groove with that
Yeah, rap niggas gotta groove with that
Make a nigga wanna move
And just groove with that
Where do we go?
I'm a rebel rockstar
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
I'm a, uh-oh, 
Where do we go?
Shame on a nigga!
Shame on a nigga
Catch a nigga on the corner
Wanna be up on em
Say, "Easy goin"
Tryna strike him out twice
Wasn't nothing nice
Shot him like dice
Took his lawyer's advice
Move out the hood
Say he wanna rearrange us
Can't even hang around a fucking gang banger
Pigs on a nigga ass
Wanted me to snitch
Showin' me flicks
Nigga, ain't that a bitch?
My whole life, I bad
Your whole life, you sad
Walk like a man, that's my brand new thang
Thirty-six years, little homie off change
And now you wanna say I'm in the game
So you wanna lock me up and strap me up in chains
Nah, I'm too slick for that
Can't get wit' that
Mo' dick wit' that
I won't stand for that
Won't go back wit' her
You can put that on your pig transmitter
Turn it up to the four, to the five
To the death, to the life
To the , to the side
Yeah, to the rough, to the fly
To the brothers on the corner sellin' pies for the mice
Yeah, to the girls, to the guys
To my homies on the rise
Snoop Dogg enterprise, nigga
Where do we go?
I'm a rebel rockstar
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
I'm a, uh-oh, 
Where do we go?
