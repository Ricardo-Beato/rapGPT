6 ContributorsSuicide Lyrics
Playin' games with my money
That's playin' Russian Roulette
You rather take your own life
Before you go and do that
We throwin' bands in the club
It's comin' down like confetti
Ten steps ahead of you bitches
I got on next year's Giuseppe
He in that trap like Mickey Mouse
Got my cat all in his mouth
Stash his crack all in my couch
Got his racks all in my house
Playin' my pussy in a Rolls
While I'm sippin' on Rose
Cause he fuck with me
She feel some type away
Shout out nigga Rich Homie
All my niggas rich homie
Benjies all in my Birkin, bitch
It's diamonds all on my arm tho'
Shout out all my birk
You broke hoes keep call tho'

Sometimes I look at my son
Then I picture my father
When he looked at his son
He understood his story
I can stand on the strip
Flip ten million zips
Or I can parlay with puff
And make a 10 million flip
I been a boss and you know it
Make a mill and I blow it
I had a dream I would sell
And in July it was snowin'
Went and caught me a bird
Momma, pray for my blessings
Niggas fuck with my nerves
Talking fast with them questions
First spray was the ball
Worse fear was the verdict
Fill that mill and desert it
But the block was deserted
Talkin' 500 murders
About 100 I knew
I'm talkin' 500 cases
About 400 that blew
You lost it all in a day
But you been grindin' the longest
I mean you bought off the bar
But got no money for lawyer
