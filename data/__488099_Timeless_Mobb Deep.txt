Thank god for the Mobb, we keep it alive
Respect to the newcomers but respect mines
I'm young spitfire like a flamethrower
H the reason I'm dope now, I told him
My brother I got this, we got this
Sealed in the bag my bro, It's in the pocket
Fresh from the era of big terror
Yeah we made it bitch, most niggas never
Now look us now, we like a mirage
Of the day everything sought a boss
Captain Hooks, I front you at sixteen
Lend niggas a few lines, yeah thats mine
This groundbreaking fresh, there is no blueprint
Set a few trends then move on to new shit
All praise is due to Infamous too
Fuck is that shit you rap, It's not truth
We are

Timeless
Priceless
Timeless
Flyness

Say word, know its not you fronting
Like my hammer not dumping
These days got my goonies on deck though
With nothing to live for or let go
Deadass in front of police
Billy Kid shit with a cold reach
Henny got me speaking with a slow speech
In a sober tongue, spit it so deep
Lock at the bottom, I'm lowkey
Don't want you anymore, she chose me
Fuck outta here kissing on the rosery
Like a bitch on her period it's blowing mines
That rocket science Mobb Deep, know we shine
We at war, niggas got to hold the line
Cowards looking withered like its overtime
You a false flag, still gonna hold the nine
You might also like
Timeless
Priceless
Timeless
Flyness

I know what I am, and right or wrong
People look up to me because I am a success
I got what they always wanted, money
Without it you're nothing
Money buys us dignity
Poverty is a crime
Nobody ask you where you got your dollar
They ask you do you have it
That idealistic shit don't pay your rent
I don't wanna start philosophizing anyway

Can you blame me, I was raised from a cold street
Makes for a better story what they told me
Sad part this shit is real life
Pressure on me 'nuff to break a fuckin' steel pipe

Wipe blood on my razor blade
Teach niggas how to chill out and make way
When you see me take it easy, best believe me
Its the real world nigga not TV
M-O-B-B, Money Over Bum Bitches
Deeper than the seafloor, you sleep with the fishes
When you try my tolerance dumb nigga
I'm a hip hop god, you just a fuck nigga
I do this for reals, you wish you could
Talking like you will, I wish you would
Start a war, get it on
You are not that strong, we are
