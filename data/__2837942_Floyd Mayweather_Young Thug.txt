Pew, pew-pew-pew-pew-pew, pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-ka-ka
I'm in Vegas spendin' thousands on my chips (All on chips)
I can't love these bitches, fell in love the rip (Love the rip)
I was, I was, I was doin' this shit just for my peers
I, I would put inside my blood, my sweat, my tears (Sweat and tears)
Do this shit all on my own, don't need no deal (Don't need no deal)
Di'-diamonds flawless 'round my neck, gave me a chill (Me a chill)
Late, lately, I've been flyin' on them Lears (On them Lears)
Flyin' 'cross the world, these bitches killin' me

Ayy, flood her bank account with bands 'cause she feelin' me (Feelin' me)
Nigga, cash on delivery (Delivery)
If it's a snake on my clothes then it's double G
I don't like police hoes, ain't no cuffin' me
All my diamonds dancin' like they Bruce Lee (Wah)
Check out my smile, I got some new teeth
Pop a molly now I'm in the fuckin' air
Cloud nine, nigga smokin' like the fuckin' bear

We at the Clearport, you niggas never there (Niggas never there)
I wouldn't even cap, lil' bitch, this our year (This our year)
I do it for my fam, twenty racks on gifts (Racks on Christmas)
Bitch, we blowin' gas, roll me up a spliff (Roll me up a spliff)
Now, what you think a young nigga grindin' for? (What you think I'm grindin' for?)
I sip it 'til I sleep, I might overdose (I might overdose)
She made it out the hood and left that dope bowl (She left that dope bowl)
Get them bricks from my mama, she got truckloads (Huh?)
Ayy, fuck you mean you get it from your mammy, ho? Yeah (Hahaha)
Ayy, diamonds all on my chin, diamonds on my folk
Piercin' in my nose, diamond in my nose (In my nose)
Giuseppe open toes, diamonds on my toes (Diamonds on my toes)
I just got a family pack of Jimmy Choos, damn
I just bought a chopper and I'm ready to use it, damn
I got a lot of bitches comin' by the twos
I got a lot of bitches, bomin' by the few (Few)

Big di'-diamonds but we call 'em jewels (Call 'em jewels)
All, all these racks, think I sell dog foods (I sell dog food)
Drip, I spend thousand on my fuckin' shoes (Three thousand on shoes)
Pull up in this Ave, it cost the Christian Loubes (Yeah, yeah)
Nigga, watch your mouth, we ain't fuckin' cool (Fuckin' cool)
YSL the mafia, that's a fuckin' fool (Fuckin' fools)
Take this shit out and shoot (Grra, grra, grra)45Embed
