5 ContributorsWords From the Chief Rocker Lyrics
That's right, I'm dancin' y'all
I'm gon' keep on dancin' into the new millennium
Ya understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey De La Soul, Beastie Boys
I love the way y'all doin' this baby
Y'all just gotta keep kickin' it
Because the kids don't know, the other people don't know
But they all gon' know now because me the Chief Rocker, Busy Bee, gon' just keep kickin' flava baby
Ah like this

Just dance, and don't quit
'Cause the music's, and don't quit
'Cause the music's, and don't quit
'Cause the music's, and don't quit
'Cause the music's gonna be the shit
I just dance, and don't quit
'Cause the music is gonna be the shit

And now once upon a time in the place to be
They was standin' in line to see the Busy Bee
When I pulled up to the curb in my ninety-eight
I rushed inside so I won't be late
You know the party was packed, where you couldn't even move
And Busy Bee rocked, where you couldn't even move
And Busy Bee rocked, where you couldn't even move
And Busy Bee rocked to the funky funky grooves
To the beat that makes you want to freak
Ah to the beat that gets rump out your seat
Ah to the beat that makes you say
Busy Bee, Busy Bee is in the house, haha
Is in the house, haha
Is in the house, haha
Is in the house, haha
You might also like
I like the way this is goin' down man
Ahh this is just too much
We just gotta keep doin' this
Because this is how we do it
No static, no automatics
This is just how we just gon' keep kickin' this flavor babyEmbed
