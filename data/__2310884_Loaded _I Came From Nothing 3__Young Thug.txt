10 ContributorsLoaded (I Came From Nothing 3) Lyrics
These niggas, we ain't gon' play with them, we gon' spray on them
All their bitches, we gon' lay on them and stay on them
Now we're Freebandz, we gon' play with them
You can call the Guap and me, we still play with them
Now we're gym too, we gon' stay on them
These fuck niggas, they hatin', but we loaded
They talkin' cabbage, we showed it
We ran up and we blowed it and got it right back
I said these niggas hatin' but we love that
They talkin' cash, but, we showed that
We ran it up and we blowed it and got it right back, yeah

Goin' first like a hearse, nigga
And if you play, you're done, that's a curse, nigga
And I hope you know they tie you up first, nigga
And I hope you know the CEO gets work, nigga
Born with a sickness, I look suspicious
And everybody round me gunnin', pistol tradition
That brand new Bentley on factory inches
I'mma hit you in your heart, I got great precision
Now I'm up and they down here
Bitch I'm a flyin' king, crown a fair
You ever play, I be down to kill
No games, I'm for real
You might also like
These niggas, we ain't gon' play with them, we gon' spray on them
All their bitches, we gon' lay on them and stay on them
Now we're Freebandz, we gon' play with them
You can call the Guap and me, we still play with them
Now we're gym too, we gon' stay on them
These fuck niggas, they hatin', but we loaded
They talkin' cabbage, we showed it
We ran up and we blowed it and got it right back
I said these niggas hatin' but we love that
They talkin' cash, but, we showed that
We ran it up and we blowed it and got it right back, yeah

Nigga no McDonalds, I'm a Big Mac
Since I'm a lil nigga, I need big racks
Niggas mad cause they know the kid hater proof
And a asshole by nature just like Trae the Truth
A whole lotta fashion but I love the fortune
Have a baby by the bank and don't get no abortion
Yeah, got your main ho on rerun
Pull a no show, no refund
These niggas some peons
Big lobster tails, we got the ocean in this bitch
Lobster size of McMan, they know we smokin' in this bitch
And word to the wise, tell the critics kiss my ass
Never use my breaks bitch, they know I'm livin' fast
These niggas, we ain't gon' play with them, we gon' spray on them
All their bitches, we gon' lay on them and stay on them
Now we're Freebandz, we gon' play with them
You can call the Guap and me, we still play with them
Now we're gym too, we gon' stay on them
These fuck niggas, they hatin', but we loaded
They talkin' cabbage, we showed it
We ran up and we blowed it and got it right back
I said these niggas hatin' but we love that
They talkin' cash, but we showed that
We ran it up and we blowed it and got it right back, yeah

I got a lot of money, yeah it come with haters
Made a whole ticket juggin' in Decatur
Don't ever talk dope if you ain't sold dope
I get white squares, they come on boats
Ain't no squares in my circle, over grind work
Conversation with Guap, Guap is the perp
They gon' hate on me, I know that
Cause I got Freebandz and you ain't got no racks
You pick your own number in my trap
I plug prices, niggas hate that
I got foreign whips, niggas hate that
Every time I see a hater, I throw some free racks
These niggas, we ain't gon' play with them, we gon' spray on them
All their bitches, we gon' lay on them and stay on them
Now we're Freebandz, we gon' play with them
You can call the Guap and me, we still play with them
Now we're gym too, we gon' stay on them
These fuck niggas, they hatin', but we loaded
They talkin' cabbage, we showed it
We ran up and we blowed it and got it right back
I said these niggas hatin' but we love that
They talkin' cash, but we showed that
We ran it up and we blowed it and got it right back, yeahEmbed
