Went to Carvel to get a milkshake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car, oh yeah, there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo, Tip, I tell you, man, the devil's tryin' it
But I'm gonna stay strong 'cause I ain't buyin' it
Tonight, I'm takin' Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool, I found somethin', so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh, shit, I'm fryin' it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it
Took him down to KB, they ain't sellin' it
Here we go with the cryin', yo, he's throwin' fits
My blood pressure's blowin' up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again, the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, my car was in the shop, I had to borrow, see
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi, pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh, yo, Sheila's home
Steady smilin' like a mother, yo, I'm read' to bone
Went down on hun, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

Just last week, my girl was stressin' me (Uh)
Now her best friend be undressin' me (Uh)
Well, I was lovin' her by the moon ray
Now I'm trickin' on her like Kinte (Come on)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walkin' towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team (Uh)
'Cause I was breakin' niggas on the inseams (Word, word)
Some niggas 'cross town was tryin' to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar-fifty (Uh)
Picked up this girl in the hoopty
Just because I rhyme, she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere? (Uh)
Go and get a bloody job, then can we locute (Yeah)
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot (Come on)
She wasn't even all of that, just another hooker
Simply turned that ass away quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face
Problems, problems, problems
Lord knows I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Jesus Christ, I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Pray for me, I'm havin' problems, problems, problems

Yeah
Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside, hah
And you'll be alright, you know what I'm sayin'?
Love, peace from the Phife for '93, know what I'm sayin'?
