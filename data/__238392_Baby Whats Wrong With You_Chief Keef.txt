42 ContributorsBaby Whats Wrong With You Lyrics
(Fatboi on the beat)
Faow, green fly like Peter, whoa, ff
(ISO)
Green fly like Peter though, ff, ff
She like, "I left my weed at home"
To see me, you need bifocals
Green fly like Peter though
To see me, you need bifocals
(Hoodrich, nigga)

To see me, you need bifocals
Green fly like Peter do
She like, "I left my weed at home, can you get me stoned?"
Baby, that is not an excuse
So what you wanna do?
You ain't gotta roll one, baby, you can roll a few
But I ain't gon' smoke with you
Steady asking me what I'm on with you
Baby, what's wrong with you?

Baby said she on me, glue (Phew)
My thirty stay on me too (Phew)
And I shoot a movie too (Phew)
Remember posted on the block (Phew)
Fuckin' on one of my opps (Phew)
Let the bitch try to set me up (Phew)
She gon' be stuck between a rock and this motherfuckin' Glock (Phew)
My bitch bad, she terrible (Phew)
Beat a bitch like Keta do (Phew)
Foreign all my vehicles (Phew)
And I gotta thank Jesus too (Phew)
Now I'm lookin' on 'em and it's easy to (Phew)
Remember they ain't even believe me too
Remember they ain't even need me too
Well, now they need me too (Phew)

To see me, you need bifocals
Green fly like Peter do
She like, "I left my weed at home, can you get me stoned?"
Baby, that is not an excuse
So what you wanna do?
You ain't gotta roll one, baby, you can roll a few
But I ain't gon' smoke with you
Steady asking me what I'm on with you
Baby, what's wrong with you?21Embed
