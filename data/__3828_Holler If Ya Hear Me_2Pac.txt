Aww yeah, uhh, uhh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah

Here we go, turn it up, let it start
From block to block we snatching hearts and jacking marks
And the punk police can't fade me and maybe
We can have peace someday, G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin' down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
Tell my brothers on the blockâ€“better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see when we burned the other week
Now we got 'em in a smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' get mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin' but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen'
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out strapped
Keep ya hands on ya gat, now your boys watch ya back
'Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me
You might also like
Holler if ya hear me!
"Hard"
"Tellin' you to hear it"
"The rebel"

Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me, PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin' it up
One way or another you'll be givin' it up, huh
I guess 'cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one-man clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle ain't do nothing but blow my name up!
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble
Holler if ya hear me!
"Hard"
"Tellin' you to hear it"
"The rebel"

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representin', never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise to all my boys
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fist if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
'Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin' for the day to let the rage free
Still me 'til they kill me
I love it when they fear me
Holler if ya hear me!
"Hard"
"Tellin' you to hear it"
"The rebel"
You're too near me, to see it clearly
Holler if ya hear me!
"Hard"
"Tellin' you to hear it"
"The rebel"16Embed
