6 ContributorsAlready Rich Lyrics

You've got mansions, homie, and diamonds too
Maybe that's the reason that she's digging you
You got all the riches, baby, don't be surprised (It's yours, nigga)
Got millions in your heart (Gold in your head, gold in your head)

Who gives a fuck if you Blood or Cuz, since I got it out the mud
And you're really out here layin' it down just like a rug (Woo)
Nigga manifestin' these millions, I'm still a thug
Steady buying, selling these buildings, I'm still the plug (Haha)
Just get out, once you put in, that's all I'm sayin' (Yeah)
Pac-Man, ain't no arcade, that's how they playing (That's how they playing)
You're already rich than a bitch, it's in your mind (It's in your mind)
This shit is like a scavenger hunt, you gotta find it (Haha)
Street life, you kill what you eat, watch where you sleep (Sleep)
Your financial status can change in 'bout a week (Swear to god)
Been through it, highs and lows, squares and O's
Even had a two door Regal, hammers and bolts
Ain't no standing room now, ain't no reservation (Nah)
First come, first served, nigga, what's the hesitation? (What's the hesitation?)
This ain't the fab life, this the real life, nigga (Nigga)
When it's all said and done, what's you feel like, nigga?
You might also like
You've got mansions, homie, and diamonds too
Maybe that's the reason that she's digging you
You got all the riches, baby, don't be surprised
You got millions in your heart

They ain't gon' give you shit, my nigga, so don't ask (Don't even ask)
Keep waitin' for handout, nigga, you won't last
Still hungry, muhfucker, my stomach touching my back (Back)
My grind is my weapon, I'm gon' kill 'em with that (Yeah)
Can't call my life crazy 'cause that shit was insane
They done killed the lil' nigga for nothing, that's in vain (Swear to God, nigga)
You don't understand my struggles, pure pain (Pure pain, nigga)
You don't understand my hustle, it's pure game (Hey)
Nigga, if you want it, you get it, it's non-negotiable (Non-negotiable)
Ain't no sense in coming to practice, it's un-coachable
Anti-social, my nigga, stressed, perhaps (Ayy)
Yeah, zero times for the bullshit
Must've took most of my life, whatever's left of it (Yeah)
All I ask is, please let me die with some integrity (Yeah)
Them fake niggas wanna call you fake (Fake)
The rap niggas scared to say you're great

You've got mansions, homie, and diamonds too (Yeah, I can see it, nigga)
Maybe that's the reason that she's digging you (It's like death, I can see it, yeah, yeah)
You got all the riches, baby, don't be surprised (Just look in the mirror, my nigga)
You got millions in your heart
So close, I know you can feel it (Millions, millions)
It's right there, nigga, you won't let them tell you what you can't do or you go show 'em what you can (Millions, millions)
That's all I'm saying, nigga (Millions, millions)
Already, rich than a bitch, it's in your mind (Millions, millions)
Shit's like a scavenger hunt, you just gottta find it, nigga (Millions, millions)
It's in your eyes, I see it thought, 104Embed
