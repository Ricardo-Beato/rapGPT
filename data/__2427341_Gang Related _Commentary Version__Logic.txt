7 ContributorsGang Related (Commentary Version) Lyrics"Gang Related." This song, man, this song means a lot to me. It's, first and foremost, another one produced by 6ix again, um, and it was just, it was something I wanted the world to know. You know, the duality of man, you know, uh... Being raised in a household full of drugs, guns, violence, um, just all that, but not letting it effect who you are, because on the first verse, I'm rapping from the perspective of little Bobby, me, who I am, just- you know, that little kid in that house and all the things that he witnessed and on the second- uh, on the second verse, I'm rapping from the perspective of my brother, someone who was in the streets and running around, and you know, maybe doing things that he shouldn't have done at the time
So for me, it was like showing you what can come from the same household. You can go left, or you can go right. I think a lot of people go that traditional route, when you're raised around- um, these things that can touch you. In a negative way, I think. For me I just saw it as a very positive, and decided to do my best not to go down the same route as a lot of my family members, unfortunately. Uh, so this is basically just the story of possibility. Uh, of what can come, and what can happen and my rendition, if you will, of stop the violence, you know, it's also sort of an homage to KRS-One as well, that's why I threw his vocals in there. Um, but yeah, I just wanted people to know what happens where I come from in Maryland, as beautiful as a place it is, its also a dark place, and I think that's everywhere you go in the world. Um, you know, me not going down that route that my brothers did, hence the title "Gang Related," um, and yeah, that's itYou might also likeEmbed
