5 ContributorsRan Wit It Lyrics
Man these bitches told my girl so slick, and my girl, she ran with it
She ain't even give me a chance to say too much, she done ran with it
A nigga fronted me a brick, but he's slick, and a young nigga ran with it
 till a young nigga ran with it
Man these bitches told my girl so slick, and my girl, she ran with it
She ain't even give me a chance to say too much, she done ran with it
A nigga fronted me a brick, but he's slick, and a young nigga ran with it
 till a young nigga ran with it

Country nigga hit me with 50 piece 
Ain't no love in the streets, anything goes, I gotta have it
So fresh, so clean, no stylest
Plug, you know he spanish
 got dammage
All these cuts on my wrist, need bandades
All these bands in my pocket 
 like 
All white bricks, Adam Sandler
Got a few trap spots on 
Got a gass bag, still serve a nigga dezel
 quicker than Little Seasars
All my hoes foreign, gotta get a vesa
All my diamonds water, gotta get a freezer
Ho on the Perk, shaking like she gonna have a seaser
Block on fire, so I toat a Desert Egle
Nigga playing gangsta, till I pull up on a gangsta
Nigga start snitchin, started talking to the people
 turn it 
Blood  real nigga that's 
 like a chemest 
Fuck with  never had

Man these bitches told my girl so slick, and my girl, she ran with it
She ain't even give me a chance to say too much, she done ran with it
A nigga fronted me a brick, but he's slick, and a young nigga ran with it
 till a young nigga ran with it
Man these bitches told my girl so slick, and my girl, she ran with it
She ain't even give me a chance to say too much, she done ran with it
A nigga fronted me a brick, but he's slick, and a young nigga ran with it
 till a young nigga ran with it

My bitch lonely, she know that they on me
While I'm out getting money, she calling my phone, 
Know that I stay on the road like I'm touring
I  and I ran with it
 double saran
 don't panic
Dope in the seel, dope in the pantry
Syrup sippin, no pancakes
I get you Codeine, I got 12 cases
But young nigga got 
 shell cases
 12 cases
My money stand up like some staircases
 spent 12 80
Gotta watch how you move, cause these feds waiting
 like the late 80's
My plug late, and I hate waiting
That ain't the bando, 
Beat up the trap  location
Beat up the pot like 
 stick in the face
Hundred round drum, got a dick on that K
Talking too much, put the dick in her face
Man these bitches told my girl so slick, and my girl, she ran with it
She ain't even give me a chance to say too much, she done ran with it
A nigga fronted me a brick, but he's slick, and a young nigga ran with it
 till a young nigga ran with it
Man these bitches told my girl so slick, and my girl, she ran with it
She ain't even give me a chance to say too much, she done ran with it
A nigga fronted me a brick, but he's slick, and a young nigga ran with it
 till a young nigga ran with itEmbed
