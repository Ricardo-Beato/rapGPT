Southside on the track, yeah
But now the work ain't stepped on
I make her suck it til she strep throat
Turned into a klepto

Used to get slept on, but now the work ain't stepped on
I make her suck it til she strep throat
But then she turned into a klepto
This for my niggas getting slept on
But now the work ain't stepped on
Who make her suck it til she strep throat
Watch that bitch, that bitch a klepto, that bitch a klepto

My niggas in the ghetto, yeah they toting heavy metal
Make her suck it til she strep throat
Jump off the top rope the bed broke
My trap house in the ghetto, my stash house got an echo
I know some vatos in Chicago
They'll slit your throat, they'll leave your neck broke
Savannah plug I call him presto, Savannah boy he call me "Preshto"
At sea port I got good dope
Gucci Mane I got the best smoke (gato)

Used to get slept on, but now the work ain't stepped on
I make her suck it til she strep throat
But then she turned into a klepto
This for my niggas getting slept on
But now the work ain't stepped on
Who make her suck it til she strep throat
Watch that bitch, that bitch a klepto

All these diamond chains got these bitches on me, yea
I know they see me putting on (puttin on)
They ain't want me back then but now she want me, yeah
Same way as Mike Jones
Call me pretty boy Tony Macaroni, yeah
Goldie that bitch chose
Me and the plug in his backyard we racing ponies, yeah
I just bet a kilo
You're playing bully but we all feel it's baloney
Act like you real but we all know you's a phony
I'm like a Beverly hill-billy with the money
Would call you Orville Redenbacher cause you're corny

Used to get slept on, but now the work ain't stepped on
I make her suck it til she strep throat
But then she turned into a klepto
This for my niggas getting slept on
But now the work ain't stepped on
Who make her suck it til she strep throat
Watch that bitch, that bitch a kleptoEmbed
