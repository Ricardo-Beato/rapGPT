10 ContributorsThe Game Lord Lyrics
I love chrome and paint, lookin for some motherfuckin corners to bank
West coast what the fuck you thank?
Everybody here off weed and drank (everybody)
Before you check my rims
When you leave the parking lot, check ya limbs
You better check your friends
And see if your baby momma left with them
Blacks and Mexicans, stop all that bullshit in the pen
Understand that it's us verses them
They can give a fuck if we sink or swim
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
I got to show my ass
To thank these motherfuckas for my past
In South Central, Los Angeles Grandmama smoke cannabis
Granddaughter wanna dance and shit
Her own momma can't stand the bitch
 - repeat 2X
If you fuckin' up, pray to the game lord
Wanna bust a nut, Pray to the game lord
Nigga get ya cup, pray to the game lord
You can throw it up, pray to the game lord

I love where I from, hungry ass niggas better get you some
Smart ass niggas play dumb
Y'all can't fuck with the city I run
If I snap my fingers, better curl up just like a fetus
I hope you know Jesus
Because if you don't, boy you will see us
(Where?) Up in your house, two double barrels up in your mouth
You got some 'splainin to do
And don't get to lyin' cause we aiming at you
(Ooohh!) It's a doggy dog world baby, you a nut and I'mma squirrel baby
Can I get ya in my world baby?
Can ya grease my Jheri curl baby
Did you flip yo' wig
To let Michael Jackson baby sit yo' kids
That nigga old as hell
They need to throw the motherfuckin' momma in jail, let 'em know
You might also like - repeat 2X
 - repeat 2X
Fuck wit this if you want to, the game lord will punish you
Punish us if we ain't true, to the game like we 'pose to

I'm the game lord, y'all come now
Casanova niggas, got the sun down
Run down every ho that wanna go shoppin'
Get they kids, take them to the mall buy 'em somethin'
Are you a gentleman, big bear with a nigga named Gentle Ben
Ladies, he'll be your friend
Wait for the cable guy - even let him in
Not me, I won't flex or bend just cause a ho promise me some trim
You better get with the rest of them
Cause can't none of y'all even fuck with Kim
Some niggas was born with ho in 'em
I was put on this Earth to spit ism
And I shall return like it's written
And slay all the suckers who be sippin
 - repeat 2X1Embed
