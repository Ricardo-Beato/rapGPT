40 ContributorsMELTING Lyrics
Yeah, why, why, why, why, why
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, why, why, why, why, why, why, dun, dun, why

No doubt about it I'm melting, oh-oh melting
World full of wonder if you open those eyes
Shed yourself, get out the disguise
Slow mo' we all want acceptance
Truth, fuck that, get off that
Accept truth, be free, oh, and carry on baby
Hey

No doubt about it I'm crumbling, oh-oh crumbling
No issue I got it, X-Ray through the lies
To enter the void got to lose more of your mind
It happens the same old downward spiral
And I weep, to sleep, give it all I've got in the morning
Oh, so good night my baby
Hmm
Instant pain
Hmm, heyYou might also like13Embed
