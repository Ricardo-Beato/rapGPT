(Ooh, Planet 9)
Uh, what is she talkin' 'bout?
Pass my phone, bro
I ain't even wash my face yet, I'm trippin'
Um

What's your name on Twitter? I might follow you (What's your name?)
Wha-What's your name on Twitter? I might follow you (Okay, cool, le'go)
Wha-What's your name on Twitter? I might follow you (Watch out)
Wha-What's your name on Twitter? I might follow you (I'm Thugger)
Ooh, what's your name? (Yeah)
You can follow me and I might just do the same
But you gotta be a dime, which is 20 minus 10 (And, um)
And you retweet everything that I'm sayin'

Oh, I love my models (I do), I love who I follow (I do)
I love my followers (I seriously do), especially her
She say she got her mom listenin' to my shit
Upload it on Twitter, now they vibin' to that shit (Ayy, ayy)
Ooh, a hundred new followers today (Followers today)
And one of them niggas just said "Hey" (What you talkin' 'bout?)
All-all-all of them bitches said, "Shit, that's what you talkin' 'bout"
So everyone say "Shouts out" to me, yeah (Like "Shouts out to Thug")
