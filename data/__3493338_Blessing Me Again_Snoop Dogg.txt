Blessing me (blessing me)
Oh yeah (can't you see)
Blessing me (blessing me again and)
Happy as can be (happy as I can be)
You keep blessing me (blessing me again and)
Just believe (just believe)
Taste and see (taste and see)
Oh-wee (blessing me)
You're blessing me (again and)

I got a whole lot that I can really thank him for
When I was moving fast, he had to slow my role
Out and in control, next episode (he's blessing me again)
Now look here, ugh
See when you think about when everybody tells you out
See he the only that prolly really helps you out
I'm talking from experience, you hearing this? (he's blessing me again)

Blessing me (blessing me)
Oh (can't you see)
Blessing me (blessing me again and)
Just believe (just believe)
Just gotta believe (taste and see)
Oh-woah (blessing me again and)

Oh when my soul gets hungry, and, he feeds me
He's blessing me again yeah (he's blessing me again)
When my spirit gets a little low, oh-ooh-oh
He lifts me up, he's blessing me again (he's blessing me again)

I took a chance for real, so I can dance up in heaven
My granny used to always tell me "you gon' be a reverend"
But how could I see what she's saying?
When I was seven I didn't wanna go to hell so I kept steppin'
Reppin', for the lord, no weapon will be formed
Sunshine, on the grind, take me through the storm
Seems like he testing me again
But on the flip side, it's like he blessing me again

Oh, you better come on now
Every time I turn around (he's blessing me again)
Blessing me again oh, oh
Every time I turn around (he's blessing me again)
Over, over and over again
Over and over and over again
Put yo' hands together
You better come on
You're blessing me again
Get up, get outta yo' chair
Come on all the way, all the way down here
Dance around the room
He's blessing me again
Yeah the blessing, waited on you
Yeah, you blessing me yeah (he's blessing me again)
You're blessed going in
You're blessed coming out
Everything you have is blessed without a doubt (he's blessing me again)
Get up, get outta yo' chair
Come on all the way, all the way down here
Feel the rhythm, the groove (he's blessing me again)
Dance, till you get rid of your old blues
You gotta dance, dance (he's blessing me again)
YeahEmbed
