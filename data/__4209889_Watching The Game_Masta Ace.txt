4 ContributorsWatching The Game Lyrics
Yo what up my nigga, whatchu' doing dawg?
Chillin' man, watching the game
Oh word, who winning?
Nigga, Eagles 21-3 you know the deal, you know how we do it
Whatever man. it's 'cuz yall ain't playing the Packers
Whatever
Yo but listen, Lisa's brother and them niggas?
Yeah
They got knocked today
Fuck outta here, say word
Word man, yo
DA pulled up in vans and shit
Oh shit
TV cameras (fuck outta here) locked all them dudes up man
Serious?
Shit was wild
See that's that shit
She was tryna get me to mess with them cats man
I'm so glad I ain't listen to her
Or I had been right along them niggas (I know) facing football numbers
Yo how you liking that school?
That shit is alright so far man
I mean, my roommate is a little, he a little shaky man but..
Other than that, it's pretty decent
I got my first exam tomorrow in um.. Bronx history (alright)
I gotta read these chapters that on Flash and Bambaataa but..
So far it's cool
Yo man let me hit you back 'cuz i'm missing the game nigga
Alright yo
Word
