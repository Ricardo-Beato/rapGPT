Imagine, imagine

If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back
(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)

Man, fuck college! We finna do this rap shit

My mind's like 5 mics, rhyme tight, fuck it
Limelight, shine bright, life short, love it
Let's fill it with experiences
Balls in my hand like the grand prize game, aiming for pocket sixes
Throw back so that, you know when I say
Back in the day, you know exactly where I go at
Expanding my vocabulary
Rapping every word off the magazine covers down at Walgreens
That's a .357 Magnum like Tackleberry
Academics took a backseat like Hightower
I flowered my power, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You might also like
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back
(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)

Yo, we got a contract on the table from Atlantic Records
What do you think?

Well every rose has its thorn, and if I could be reborn
I mean to be the king, even Jesus puts 'em on
So, Atlantic ocean motion might make you sell funny
Betcha didn't know the advance went straight to bail money
That's right, to free Chilly Chill
And to do it all again, I would sign another deal
Still kinda paranoid from when they leaked my tape
Jeopardize being friendly just to keep mine safe
When keeping it real goes right, I couldn't keep my faith
By third album I was done, you shoulda seen my face
Fuck Craig, fuck rap, fuck this, fuck that
Fuck your 360 deal, nigga, that shit's wack
I was Truth.com with no backup plan
Got blackballed, couldn't find a job, tryna backup dance
That shit was crazy, thanks to my back-up fans
I guess what lawyers can't do, (we are Anonymous) the hackers can
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back
(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)

You wouldn't change nothin'? Like nothin'!?

Well, that's not totally true
Young Lupe, I wish I could be totally you
But that's the way it works, came to bring the pain, that's the way it hurts
Picking in the scabs from the past just gon' make it worse
Can't be 21 every time I sit and make a verse
When I did that song with NumbaNine, I was tryna break the curse
The good don't make it out of the hood unless the hood make it out you first
All you needs just to believe that you can leave
Crown B and Es made me believe that I could lead
Righteous deeds, planting seeds for good society
So you see that I can't be totally new
Cause there's a future Lupe out there that wanna be both of me too
And nobody really knows what the future holds
All the future sins for our future souls
And what I am doing now I couldn't do before
What would you do, man, if you could go?
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)
If I coulda, brought it back
I wouldn't change a fucking thing
If I coulda, brought it back
(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)2Embed
