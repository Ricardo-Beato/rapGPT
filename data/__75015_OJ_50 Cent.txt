18 ContributorsOJ Lyrics
Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches

I'm smoking up my lungs, this liquor drowning my liver
I'm now using these prescriptions, these pancakes now full of syrup
Mayweather all contenders, I eat each rappers for dinner
Put these ratting ass niggas in a sewer, Master Splinter
Sound like my phone is bugged, give a nigga the jitters
I don't give a fuck, tell the pigs to kiss my shitter
Yeah, I'm kind of thinner but Goddamn, you're jeans are slimmer
I don't want you 'round my children, you look like a sex offender
Planet of the Apes, I'm a G-Unit gorilla
All these rappers claim they killas, prolly sue you when you hit 'em
See I'm not what you used to, I ain't soo-woo, I ain't crippin'
I'm a Rider Gang nigga, we gon' get it where we fit it

Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches

Got a new bitch that's so bad, yeah, she don't know what she doin'
And her ass so round and fat, when she touch me, I'm like boooing!
I want head and I want tails, so I don't wanna flip a coin
I don't kiss it, I don't tell, so her close friend she can join
They don't call me from the pens, that's to see how things are goin'
So the money, it still flowing, get a Rider Gang, it's still glowin'
And my neck and my wrist and my ears and my fist, got diamonds all over shit glowin'
And the Lambo ain't got no top, it ain't summer yet but it's hot
You gon' lose the speech when you hit the streets and you see the bitches I got
You better believe it's real from the Philippines to Brazil
Lil Mexican chica, I want you to meet her, people can give it to you pure
100% uncut, now nigga you know wassup

Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches

MJG, bitch I got them 8 balls
4 door garage, bitch, I need 8 cars
They want me locked up, they singin' like Akon
Or shot up like a dope head arm
Bitch my life right and you niggas dead wrong
I would take your head on, so you can see me head on
I'm gettin' my air blown, you know what her head on
She got my head gone, shit, I'm 'bout to head home
Pimp zone, that's my destination
Still street, never handed in my resignation
Ding dong, I'm at your doorbell waiting
Who tryna get served, I'm 'bout to do some catering, huh!
Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home and go back from doing some different shit
I'm pullin' off a O.J, off-off a O.J
I'm pullin' off a O.J, I'm killin' these bitches4Embed
