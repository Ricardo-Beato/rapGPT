16 ContributorsDrugs, Basketball, & Rap Lyrics
Yea
That's what I'm talking about
S-A-S, size ain't shit, never that
Strong Arm Steady, Talib Kweli
Yea

Niggas gettin caught in the trap
For the cash, it's the drugs; basketball; or the rap
There's more to us than that
We the shit consider the facts, after you analyze that
You know you best to fall back

I'm dealing with, nothing but facts, when I spit it, though
You niggas superstitious don't step on the cracks or split the pole
Candle light, flickers so bright, my silhouette can kick a sicker flow
And spill it like a liquor store, I spit the shit to make a cripple get up and dance
I spit the shit to make the average MC piss in his pants
I spit the shit to make a motherfucker call it a night
I spit the shit to see fuck wit C. Delores Tucker sex like
I take a sip from my creative well, in this game for a minute
I play this well to win it, you go to Africa, like Dave Chappelle, you finished
Cause your prehistoric raps is boring, the number of whack rappers soaring
Like the percentages of teenagers who have abortions
These niggas meek, their lyrics weak, and their beats is corporate
They try snitching on records their mouths is leaking faucets
Dripping them over system than, Chinese water torture
Ripping a series of events, more unfortunate than Lemony Snicket

Medallions mind, bless the mic for the gods, teach the blind
Plus get a piece of mine release your minds for each design
Baby food for thought, rappers not coonin' for sport
Due to these pork eatin niggas of sort
Yo you's a fuckface, burnt out loser that's always up late
Planet Asia the revolutionary slash nut case
A witchcraft black magic, data load up computers
A spread the message wrote to you where when I show illusions
If all y'all niggas is killas then how you write your records
How'd you find the time stop lying, your minds' infected
There's only a few, and I ain't saying niggas don't put it down from you town
I'm talkin bout you
Yea the fake dude promotin propaganda
And open on some fanna, and out right, snitching on them cameras
Planet Asia, gold chain black bandanas low
Steady Gain Klick Klack rang rang, there they go


Just a high skip and a jump
Away from getting everything that I could possibly want
And prostitutes front
Get a 4 bar on the roster, scratch that
I'm talkin about a full roster of raps
Monsters that rap, buzzed out ?? check the cadence of the frequency
Uniquely, we strong arms strategically
Easily I twist the ?? killa cali ??
Back alleys burnin backwoods in danelis or
He probably with Kweli, out in BK
We make it easy for the DJ's, like instant replays
Conversation by the buttons, I talk and touch something
Straight shots of the Louis he flew me out to London
Crunchin numbers flippin more dough, like siccisero
Next thing you know we kissin ya ho, without the mistletoe
Strong arm steady, agony can ???, fill the rigglies
The Big League niggas is dropping indies
Let's go

Talib kweli, right about now
This what I'm feelin right about now
And I invite you all to check it out wit me
Lets go!
S'like
