One for the money, two for the drugs
Three for my pistol, four for the slug
One, two, comin' for you
Three, four, knockin' on your door
Five, six, comin' through your gate
Seven, eight, we was runnin' a lil' late

Nine, ten, I'm ridin' with extendeds
Eleven, twelve, Forbes on my hit list
Thirteen, fourteen, karats on my pinky
Fifteen, sixteen, tattoos bitch, I'm inky
Seventeen, eighteen, chains got me iced out
Nineteen, twenty, fuckin' bands to get you sniped out
Little case, twenty-one bands will get you right out
Free Cdai, a .22 shotter's on me right now
Twenty-three's on the car, twenty-four's on the truck
Twenty-five times 2's in my motherfuckin' Glock
I got twenty-six pumps for a motherfuckin' thot
I'm sendin' twenty-seven shots at a motherfuckin' opp

One for the money, two for the drugs
Three for my pistol, four for the slug
One, two, comin' for you
Three, four, knockin' on your door
Five, six, comin' through your gate
Seven, eight, we was runnin' a little late
You might also like
Twenty-nine, thirty, I was posted with them .30's
Thirty-one, thirty-two, I'm so gone like a birdy
Thirty-three, thirty-four, call me Sosa Paul Birdy
Thirty-five, thirty-six, I got my ball all dirty
Thirty-seven, thirty-eight, Tony Tiger bitch, I'm great
Thirty-nine, forty, I can sense these niggas fate
Forty-one, forty-two, I want it from them in the coupe
I'm goin' 143 and 144 too
Forty-five for my jacket, aw man!
Forty-six in them and we givin' out ten
Forty-seven of them bands
Big racks like I wear a 48 in pants
BANG BANG

One for the money, two for the drugs
Three for my pistol, four for the slug
One, two, comin' for you
Three, four, knockin' on your door
Five, six, comin' through your gate
Seven, eight, we was runnin' a little late1Embed
