Ay, what's up wit' it', y'all
This your boy Nip Hussle once again
Just hollerin' at y'all real quick
It's somethin' a nigga need to address out here in these streets, cuz
Niggas call theyself real niggas and gangbangers and all that
Stop every time you niggas take a loss runnin' for your pistols, my nigga
Feel me? Fuckin' the game up, setting the wrong example
Niggas think that's the way it's supposed to go
Feel me, nigga? Hop out there, do what he do, win, lose or draw, nigga
6-0, all that other shit is for the birds, my nigga
That's some coward shitYou might also likeEmbed
