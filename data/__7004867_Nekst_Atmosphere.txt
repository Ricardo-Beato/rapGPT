Don't underestimate the power of a threat
Could probably turn your volume down a couple steps
The universe of every surface that reflects
It's in your drugs and your food and your sex
I'm a tyrannosaurus wreck
Break another sweat
I gave you my heart in the shape of a cassette
How can I continue if I don't know how to let
Go of all my issues to forgive you and forget?
I love you, don't ever expect anything less
I've got your name on the list, bring a guest i
Know you got my back, I can the feel the connect
But my local laundromat doesn't accept respect
And maybe you can help me settle a bet
Should I bite my tongue or keep it hella direct?
When the only thing left is the special effects
But I'm starin' at the camera like, "I ain't dead yet"

Gotta get so high to decompress
And whoever survives gets to clean the mess
We gotta evolve, develop what's next
We gotta evolve, develop what's next
And I ain't even tryin' to leave my nest
'Cause when I do, I realize that I'm the least impressed
We gotta evolve, develop what's next
We gotta evolve, develop what's next
And I don't know if I believe in death
But I believe in the scars that you collect and protect
We gotta evolve, develop what's next
We gotta evolve, develop what's next
And it'll all make sense if you hold your breath
But how you gonna grow if there's no regrets?
We gotta evolve, develop what's next
We gotta evolve, develop what's next
