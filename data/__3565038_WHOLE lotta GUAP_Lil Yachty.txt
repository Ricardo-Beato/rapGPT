Whole lotta hunnids (Ooh)
Too many bands, I can't thumb it (Ooh)
Whole lotta hunnids (Ooh)
Too many bands, I can't thumb it (Ooh)
Whole lotta hunnids (Ooh)
Too many bands, I can't thumb it (Ooh)

Watch how I thumb it (Yeah), choppa, it came with a drum kit (Ooh)
I hit the jaw for the kicks (Uh), I fucked a bitch in the back (Yuh)
I got a six and a two (What), I got a 12 and a eight, ooh, how that taste?
Baby (Fuck it up, fuck it up), eat it up, huh
Upgrade the whip, had to lift it up (Huh)
Brother locked up, he would whip it up (Huh)
Whip it, whip it, whip it up (Whip)
Got a choppa in the kitchen, hundred bitches, they all with it
And I ball like I'm Pippen, don't fall when you're sippin'
Never see me limpin', used to ride 'round in the Lincoln
Beat on that pussy, it's leakin' (Uh), hit it one time, now she geekin' (Uh)
Baby you trippin', start tweakin' (Uh), you know we fuck on the weekend (Skrr)

I got a crib at the top (Top)
Brother, he stay on the block (What)
Brother, he sip on the wock (What)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta guap (Guap)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
Used to have work in the socks (Socks)
I'm talkin' pieces that hit (Yeah)
Bro got the stickies, bro got the bullets that hit
Bullets, they hit, all of my diamonds, they hit (My diamonds)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta guap (Guap)

Ayy, yuh
Free my bro Reese out the slammer (Slammer)
Bitch watch him walk with the hammer (Yuh), dressin' like I seen a camera (Yuh)
Everyday Christmas, everyday Christmas, baby girl, tell me your wishlist
Fuckin' a bitch, oh that's your thot, damn, now she a mistress
I'm in the basement like Tigger (Ayy), this lil' white bitch call me nigga
Long as she don't call me broke, dick in her throat 'til she choke (Ooh)
Me and the gang make it rain (Yuh), tell me, lil' bitch can you float? (Float)
Walk in the club with the scope, diamond chains, fuck ropes
Ayy, whole lotta guap (Guap), I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
Fuck that lil' bitch out her socks, teachin' a stripper 'bout stocks
Stalk, stalk, stalk, stalk, all of these bitches, they stalk
Watch how a young nigga walk (Huh), I put the Bentley in park

I got a crib at the top (Top)
Brother, he stay on the block (What)
Brother, he sip on the wock (What)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta guap (Guap)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
Used to have work in the sock
I'm talkin' pieces that hit (Yeah)
Bro got the stickies, bro got the bullets that hit
Bullets, they hit, all of my diamonds, they hit
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
I get a whole lotta guap (Guap)
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta guap (Guap)4Embed
