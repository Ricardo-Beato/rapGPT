6 ContributorsGeeking Lyrics
Trap do half a brick on breakdowns
Just hit a lick for 100 a pill, half a pound
Came up selling OZs and half a pounds
Rob my homeboy, knock 'em off, it's going down
Knock 'em off, it's going down
I say knock 'em off, it's going down
Sold 'em dog food, bales of rabbit nigga
Flexin' Randy Savage nigga, gotta have it nigga

I'm geeking, I'm geeking, hell yea nigga geekin'
I'm geeking, I'm geeking, hell yea young nigga geekin'
Bought a Rari just to crash it, I'm geekin'
Hit a lick, threw up in the club geekin'
Got a nigga girl swappin' and freakin'
Just do a quarter mill shawty last weekend

Molly then Molly
Up then on me
Double cup, Pimp C, damn I'm drowsy
In a Rari, can't start it
Bout to go fuck on Foley
I'm higher than everybody
Feeling like Wayne, ain't got no worry
Feeling like Wayne, true
Feeling like Wayne, true
Feeling like Wayne, true, ain't got no worry
You better get yo bitch, molly just kicked in
Getting head while I'm looking at the back cam
I spray everybody that back there
When I'm geeked up, PeeWee don't play fair
Hit 'em with the shotty, make everybody look forward
Dope back around, make sure scraped up
Top shawty shit, who want it with us
Top shawty shit, 
I was geeked bitch, you bout to get abortion
You gon' name your baby Molly
I'm geeked up, I forgot I did a song with Waka, goddamn I'm in the lobby
You might also like
I'm geeking, I'm geeking, hell yea nigga geekin'
I'm geeking, I'm geeking, hell yea young nigga geekin'
Bought a Rari just to crash it, I'm geekin'
Hit a lick, threw up in the club geekin'
Got a nigga girl swappin' and freakin'
Just do a quarter mill shawty last weekend

286,  out of my britches
Goddamn, Big Bank got bitches
Totally opposite of these snitches
Where I'm from, young niggas diggin' ditches
They know, they know, they know it
Had a whole 6 locked down with the blow
All night flight, get in through 
I can give a fuck if your friend or foe
Never ever trust nigga that smoke dope
Niggas don't care, they'll sell their soul
Do some bullshit 
Won't hear me laugh cause lean ain't no joke
Cocaine, cocaine is a hell of a drug
Them goddamn bands got me geeked up
I be sneakin', freakin', geekin'
Fucking last night, this money is speaking
Black beat Boosie back I got you
100 in the chopper, I'll murk me a nigga
Put 100 in case we put you under the dirt nigga
I'm free, it ain't shit to me
1017 my family
You don't fuck with them, you don't fuck with me
Couple shootouts and robberies
Most, most my niggas got felonies

I'm geeking, I'm geeking, hell yea nigga geekin'
I'm geeking, I'm geeking, hell yea young nigga geekin'
Bought a Rari just to crash it, I'm geekin'
Hit a lick, threw up in the club geekin'
Got a nigga girl swappin' and freakin'
Just do a quarter mill shawty last weekend1Embed
