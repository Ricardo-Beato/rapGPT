On time
Don't you worry, don't you fret
Has there ever been a time when God has failed you yet?
Don't you worry, don't you cry
Just keep your head facing toward the sky
When I was sinking, He lifted me
When I get lonely, He comforts me
He's always there when I need Him the most
Filled my soul with the Holy Ghost
Jesus steps right in on time, ON TIME!
(Jesus always steps right in on time)
Jesus steps right in on time, ON TIME!
(On time)
Don't you worry, don't you fret
Has there ever been a time when God has failed you yet?
Don't you worry, don't you cry
Just keep your head facing toward the sky
When I'm down, He's there for me
When I'm lonely, He comforts me
He's always there when I need Him the most
Filled my soul with the Holy Ghost
