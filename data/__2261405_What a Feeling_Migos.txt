Feelin' great, whoa
Feelin' aight, feelin' okay, yeah
What a feeling
What a feeling!

Trap out the bando, I really did it
Mamacita, bad bitch, and we split em' hit em
Whole lotta money, give it to the children
Whole lotta choppas coolin' with extensions
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'

Talk to em' Quavo
Takin' back the streets you know I own
Trap and cap when momma ain't at home
When she cook up the dope call it Nia Long
Kickin' dough was my specialty
Mama told me she gon' get at me
But I was worried 'bout the police
Runnin' from 12 in a Gucci fleece
It's a great feeling that they notice me
Came from bando to mansion to TV screen
No more trappin' no more ReNeNe
Now it's double XL Migo magazine
Don't get me wrong, I keep the magazine
Now I'm the last don, shout out to Master P
I pray to lord, devil don't tackle me
What a great feelin' million dollar me
You might also like
Trap out the bando, I really did it
Mamacita, bad bitch, and we split em' hit em
Whole lotta money, give it to the children
Whole lotta choppas coolin' with extensions
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
Trap out the bando, I really did it
Mamacita, bad bitch, and we split em' hit em
Whole lotta money, give it to the children
Whole lotta choppas coolin' with extensions
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'

Trapped out the bando I really did it
Water whippin' chickens, all these cameras in the kitchen
Breakin' in the mitten, my nigga was sellin' Whitney
Niggas come and get it cause I got a lower ticket
What a fucking feeling giving money to the children
Bentley Mulsanne pulling up in project buildings
Break niggas neck, walkin' in the chinchilla
My Giuessepe steppers same ones in thriller
These niggas they hate me, but they can't defeat me, I know why they envy me
What a feeling, how I got a hundred million all in cash and you niggas just look at me
VVSing for from my jeweler out in Cuba
I see fugazi diamonds on your Cuban link, 100,000, money nigga ain't nothin' to me
Take that bitch make her work for me, wanna fuck on the shower pole? Mimi
Trap out the bando, I really did it
Mamacita, bad bitch, and we split em' hit em
Whole lotta money, give it to the children
Whole lotta choppas coolin' with extensions
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
Trap out the bando, I really did it
Mamacita, bad bitch, and we split em' hit em
Whole lotta money, give it to the children
Whole lotta choppas coolin' with extensions
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'1Embed
