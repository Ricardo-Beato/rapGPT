I woke up on the wrong side of my head
Converts the day into search for awake until I go to bed
I drove up, but misplaced the directions they learned
Ignored the arrows and the signs
Just follow the sense
I don't know whether or not you can comprehend
Levers and knobs got stripped and that was just within the launch of it
They found me in up to my neck
All they saw was this head floatin' on top the ocean
It didn't stop the motion
They kept goin'
Perfect, didn't recognize Slug
Or the effects he'd have when he disrupts the class
Mission bound, twisting around my realm of lost
Cash is expensive, I think I can smell the cost
Decomposion, something died right behind that wall
TV gave me all I needed
It only took a phone call
Pay by the minute
85 percents a second coming
All over the breasts of she who left the water running
Flood the basement, drown the MCs and centipedes
Filed complaints, civil suits and try to sue the sidle tendencies
Energy drained, drain plugged -- hence the flood
Find the fault line, shift plate, take blame off of Slug

Ayo Money let's sit down if you've got the time
Cause if you can take the time, I've got some substance on my mind
No I don't really know you, but I know who you are
We've spoke a few times, joked a few times
We even toked a few times
I can remember one time purchasing weed from you once
Yeah, it was worth it
One time we even discussed maybe hooking up and workin'
It didn't happen, but that's not the reason for this
I know I should just get to the point
So let's all get to the point
But let's all get to the point
You may get pissed at what I'm about to spit
Bottom line is mad or not, somebody needs to say this shit
When I'm finished, you might wanna fight
But I don't wanna fight, I've seen you fight
Go ahead, get wild, and I'll still smile for bein' right
See me and mics are like marriage: makes life complete
And you've been fuckin' with nasal drugs, renders love obsolete
I dare to speak upon you, not to front on you
But I'd rather address this here matter
Than have to duck and shun you
It's getting close to harvest, time to count your livestock
All I've got for a hype is five spots to shovel my sidewalk
It's still within you, I can see it, I think it froze
Cause you keep cooling it off, putting winter in your nose
Man, I don't know about you no more kid
I mean look at your shit, I mean your shit's all off balance
I mean I don't know, you're fucking with these drugs and shit
I just don't know, I don't know

Adjustments - they need to be constructed
Adjustments - they need to be constructed

Adjustments, they were made, but not just for the purpose of adaption
Cause that's natural, I'm trying to stay alert to actions
Surroundings became more dangerous
The more familar I became with strangers
And the more I focused on they strangeness
Strain with this, but I guess that's out of choice
He pinned me down, gave me the right to shut up after I used my voice
Well guess what? Fuck You
And that's all I wanted to say
Go tell your kids about my crew and the next venue we're gonna play
Stressed out, but that's nothing new, everyone is
And it's gonna stay that way cause nowadays that's how we're runnin' shit
Punishment: that's just another fancy way to say it's time to wake up
Fuck your fame, I'm trying to build some game for my man Jacob
That's my son
Some say spittin' image
Same smile, different grimace
When grown, I hope he's never prone to heed the limits
Of life. Life: probably the biggest word I've ever said
That says a lot, cause there's a whole lot of words inside my head
Death almost a quarter deep, still ain't learned to cope
I struggle to see the horizon while I'm hanging from this rope
