Got a hundred million things all on my mind
Every damn thing, new day, new fight
Always runnin' in and out my life
Hell no (Hell no)
But I won't let you back in this time
I won't let you back in my mind (Yee)
I won't let you blame me this time
Hell no (Hell no, no)

Finally, I can fly and be free and be me
You do you, I'll do me, I don't mind it (No, no)
Finally, I can fly and be free and be me
You do you, I'll do me and I like it

And they used to always tell me, "You ain't nothin' special" (Woo)
Damn it, you done took it to another level (Yeah)
I was patient, you was dangerous, I was young and mellow
Congratulations, you done turned me to a fuckin' rebel (Hey)
Yeah, I've been peepin' how you move like some new luggage (New luggage)
Used to love you back when we were boo lovin' (Woo)
That was way before I seen your fuckin' true colors (Yeah)
Always poppin' shit and I ain't even do nothin' (Joyner)
Tryna play me like we unofficial (Unofficial)
You got other issues (Other issues)
I done held you down when weren't nobody fuckin' with you
Once you close a door, don't you let it fuckin' hit you
And I'd be lyin' if I told you I was gonna miss you

I gave you the world, now I gotta fade to black (Oh, shit)
I lost it all, but I made it back

Got a hundred million things all on my mind
Every damn thing, new day, new fight
Always runnin' in and out my life
