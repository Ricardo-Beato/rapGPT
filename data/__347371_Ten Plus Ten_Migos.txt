10 ContributorsTen Plus Ten Lyrics
Ten for my ring
Fifteen for my chains
Ten for my ring
Fifteen for my chains
Ten ain't shit, I just spent 20 on your main
Ten plus ten, I need 20 Ms
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, woah

Ten plus ten, I need 20 of them
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, I need 20 Ms
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten

Got a 2010 Mazi with the Forgis on that bitch (No you don't!)
Got a 2010 Mazi with the Forgis on that bitch (No you don't!)
Got a 2010 Mazi with the Forgis on that bitch (No you don't!)
Took that Breitling Bentley then I wrapped it 'round my wrist
Young rich nigga shit, hopped out, pulled your bitch
Whip, whip, whip the dope so hard I broke my wrist
Want Migos to do a show, it's gon' be 20 Ms
How the hell, it's 20 M's and it ain't even 20 of them?
It's some 'migos in the club, I ain't even seen walk in with him
Will they catch him? Fuck the RICO, all the cartels, I'm plugged in with them

Ten plus ten, I need 20 of them
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, I need 20 Ms
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten

Ten for my ring, fifteen for my chains
Ten ain't shit, I just spent 20 on your main, your bitch
Ten for my ring, fifteen for my chains
Ten ain't shit, I just spent 20 on your main, your bitch
Young rich nigga need a young rich bitch
Kept me on the northside with Domingo juugin' bricks
Them Ballys, they call me 600
Young nigga jake, gotta juug somethin'
Hatchoo, that ten ain't nothin'
We in the hundred band juug gettin' somethin'
My Migos, nigga, they can't stop juugin'
Man I put that on my mama
Think I'm a sweet lip, fuck around and get hit
Haha, blaww, llama
Ten plus ten, I need 20 of them
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, I need 20 Ms
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten

Ten plus ten plus ten, dope boy bundles
Stuffed in my Balenciaga jeans, number one stunna
Don't call yo bitch ten, shoot yo bitch a ten
Turn her to cocaine runner for the Mexican
Migo, Quavo, call you Quavo, Guapo, Takeoff, shoot you ten
For every red truck that you back in
He  bring it back in
Tryna get PeeWee Longway to walk in
And I'm GK a hundred man strappin'
Ten, ten, ten, got racks, Longway
Big face Benjamin, what can you say?
That bitch in my face, she just started my way
I skeet on her lace for a glance at my safe
Tarantula I take off her face
Longway you switcharoo ten different races
Speakin' no Inglo, put ten in their face
Smokin' on indo I got from the Bay
Fuckin' and dismissin', they cannot stay
 catch a cab by the gate
That valet a 10 for a quickie it's safe
Ten plus ten, I need 20 of them
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, I need 20 Ms
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten

I just fucked your bitch and I ain't give that ho shit
I just fucked your bitch and I ain't give that ho shit
Fuck all you cockroaches, I'm on my Scarface shit, Tony!
I just fucked your bitch and I ain't give that ho shit
Fuck all you cockroaches, I'm on my Scarface shit, Tony!
It's levels to this shit, I'm on my Meek Mill shit, Meek Milly!
Ten plus ten, that's a dub, you dumb bitch
A hundred band juug, young nigga had to snatch it
All my bitches bad but I still fuck with the ratchets
Draped up in designer, everything European
Big blunts of weed, big cups of lean
Y'all ain't even see me comin', choppa with the beam
Trap jumpin' out the gym like a trampoline
Fuck you mean? Jordan 3 for the whole team
We not the gold gang, but our neck covered in gold chains

Ten plus ten, I need 20 of them
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, I need 20 M's
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten2Embed
