8 ContributorsGucci Coming 4 You Lyrics
Go

One, two, Gucci's coming for you (For you)
Three, four, better lock your door (Better lock your—)
Five, six, he'll take yo' bitch (He'll take yo' shit)
Seven, eight, better stay awake (Better stay up late)
Nine, ten, he's back again (Back again)
Eleven, twelve, he escaped from hell (Huh)
Eleven, twelve, he escaped from hell

"Gucci Mane got long money," that's what these bitches say
"And I'ma pay his bond money," that's where my shooter spray (Grrra)
My jit went on the run for me
We ain't related but I feel just like they sons to me (Wow)
'Cause on my birthday every year, they buy two guns for me (Baow)
I did the math, they damn near sold two metric tons for me (Huh?)
Another product of the slum just like me homie
Don't play with me because you know I got a whole army
We in Miami, deep with heat, don't get put on a poster
I keep two shooters on the wing, I feel like Eric Spoelstra
I got the drop, I know where all my opps be playing poker
My section full of rich-ass junkies who hate being sober (Sober)
It's Gucci

Seven, eight, better stay awake (Better stay up late)
Nine, ten, he's back again (Back again)
Eleven, twelve, he escaped from hell (Huh)

My car cost so much the police don't even pull me over (Huh)
I don't sign artists no more, I recruit soldiers (Woah)
My money done stacked up so tall my shit done flipped over (Well damn)
If it don't jump the first time, that shit gettin' whipped over (Skrrt)
Come in my traphouse, need a mask 'cause of the dope odor
Just sold a brick, not all at once, four plays for four quarters (Sold)
Come in my traphouse, need a mask 'cause of the stank odor
It ain't no way you snaking me 'cause I keep king cobras (It's Gucci)

One, two, Gucci's coming for you (For you)
Three, four, better lock your door (Better lock your—)
