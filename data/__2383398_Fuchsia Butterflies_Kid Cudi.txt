Yeah
Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun
Dun-dun-dun-dun, dun-dun

Yeah, I'm feeling I'm a goner, I'm feeling I'm a goner
I'm feeling I'm a goner and I don't know where I am
I'm feeling I'm a goner, I'm feeling I'm a goner
I'm feeling I'm a goner, na-na-na-na
And I got my bed made, so long, sweet dreams (Sweet dreams)
Fuchsia butterflies dizzy, now what am I?
Climb in the shadows, honey, I'm home (I'm home)
It's all by design if I pass out on the lawn

Then I'll be happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic luxury
Happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic company-y-y
Such manic company-y-y
Such manic company-y-y
Such manic company (Na-na-na-na)
You might also like
I got my mind gone, but I love you and you know (You know)
Fumble and mess things up, I can be such an asshole
I said I'm sorry, my lady, I'm so sorry (So sorry, babe)
Keep doing the right thing, you just stay, stay away

And I'll be happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic luxury
Happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic company-y-y
Such manic company-y-y
Such manic company-y-y
Such manic company (Na-na-na-na)

I got my daddy's gun, oh
Such manic company (Na-na-na-na)
I got my daddy's gun, oh, oh13Embed
