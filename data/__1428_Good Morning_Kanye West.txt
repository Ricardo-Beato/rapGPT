Uh, uh
Uh, uh

Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Good mornin'

Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mr. By Himself, he's so impressed
I mean, damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, motherfucker, D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Lookin' at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie, this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Good mornin'
You might also like
Good mornin', on this day we become legendary
Everythin' we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters sayin' you changed, now you doin' your thing

Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Good mornin' and—
Good mornin'

Good mornin' and, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you, "Read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus"
Okay, look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that, you received this
Good mornin'
Hustlers that's if you're still livin', get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good mornin'
Hustlers that's if you're still livin', get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good mornin'
Hustlers that's if you're still livin', get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good mornin'
Hustlers that's if you're still livin', get on down

Get on down
Get— Get on down
Get on down
Get— Get on down133Embed
