Mmmmhmmmmm, yeah, mmmhmmmhmmm

People talk shit 'bout me
Deep down they knowin' they ain't right
Hmm, when I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes
When I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes
People talk shit 'bout me, and they know that I know
And they also knowin' they ain't right
Hmm, when I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes
'Cause when I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes

Rejuvenated, recreated, rebooted, in a new program
Prada calf’s, black skinnies, T and hoody
Y’all niggas know the brand, GQ mustachin’ I’m in LA
Soaking up the sun and I’m laughing, what can I say?
I love the way the fans say they love me
I know it’s all because my God above me
But damn I’m feeling like Sam
Except my daddy ain’t stuck up no video game
Things changed, for the good
He watched my back until the world started knowin’ my name
This should be in the Bible
Middle finger up to the people who don’t like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don’t give a fuck fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I’m elevated
No drank, no tree and I’m levitated
I got my own empire, I’m the baby
I ain’t taking care of nobody but my daughter and my mom
Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting
While I’m winnin’ livin’ life, skippin’ grinnin’ on em
All hail King Wizard in the fuckin’ house
Been chill for a minute quiet as a mouse
Now I got the juice, call me Bishop when you see me round
I be showin’ love, showin’ love baby, dap and pound

Yeah, mmmhmmmmm, yeah, mmmhmmmhmmm

People talk shit 'bout me
Deep down they knowin' they ain't right
Hmm, when I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes
When I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes
People talk shit 'bout me, and they know that I know
And they also knowin' they ain't right
Hmm, when I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes
'Cause when I walk in the room, they can't look in my eyes

Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide
Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide
Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide

Thought you were my brother, I thought you were
Thought you were my sister, I thought you were
Thought you were my homie, I thought you were
So absurd
Thought you were my brother, I thought you were
Thought you were my sister, I thought you were
Thought you were my homie, I thought you were
So absurd
I am a person with powers, I possess the power
You can’t hide, see me shine213Embed
