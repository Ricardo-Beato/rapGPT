130 ContributorsFor Real Lyrics
Damn, DJ Plugg, you just killâ€”
Bobby Kritical

For real, for real, for real, yeah
Sleep on 'em, that's Tempur-Pedic
Get the green like it's kale, pockets, they fat just like Kenan
Told her I love her, ain't mean it (What?), that's because her head the meanest (What?)
You heard that I am from Mars, I heard that you was from Venus (Okay)
I met that bitch in a meeting (Ooh), I fucked that bitch from the meeting (Ooh)
I been was planning to leave her (Ooh), so I just left it to Jesus
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, Lil Vert, like Gerald (Damn)
Told that girl to cheer up, fucking that girl 'til she tear up
Heard you fucked her, she embarrassed
Heard your whip Gary Barbara (Eww)
Wait, for real? For real? For real?
Diamonds, they wet like a seal, diamonds wet like Navy Seal
Heard you drink lean, crack the seal, everybody know, it ain't real

You know I kept it for real, walk around with it for real
You wanna bet if my money for real, for real? For real
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah, that's for real, for real, for real
You know I kept it for real, walk around with it for real
You wanna bet if my money for real, for real? For real
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah, that's for real, for real, for real
You might also like
Won't say no names, but my niggas, they pulled up
You niggas talk too much, get your mouth sewed up (Yeah)
Look at my chain, throwing salt 'cause it's snowing
Vivienne West but my fur lookin' polar
My Gosha from Dover, I drive in the Rover
Homie don't know me, don't get in my moment
All that sneak dissing, don't think that I ain't noticed
I lift my door and I forgot to close it
Boy, better keep it sealed (Huh), fuck around, get killed (Yeah)
Fuck around, get drilled, cut your hands if you steal (Damn)
Whip it up like a meal, I just made me a mil' (Yup)
Money jumping out my pocket, tucking bands in my belt
Stop calling my phone, leave me alone
I'm on TV with the VVs so I 3-D'd my stones, yeah
We really don't get along, she anemic, I'm more chill
Had to keep this shit for real, all the way to the beat build, yeah

You know I kept it for real, walk around with it for real
You wanna bet if my money for real, for real? For real
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah, that's for real, for real, for real
You know I kept it for real, walk around with it for real
You wanna bet if my money for real, for real? For real
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah, that's for real, for real, for real
My diamonds real
For real, for real, for real36Embed
