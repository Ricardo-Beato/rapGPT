I'm up
I'm up
I'm up

I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up

I'm hands on like a iPad (iPad)
Them racks in my pants look like thigh pads (Thigh pads)
I hit it with the fork, that's my dance (Scur!)
I hit it two times, that's a slow dance (Scur scur!)
I ain't got time for the romance
Cocaine avalanche when I finance
I'ma laugh at ya, I'ma throw a bomb at ya
Since you a crumb snatcher I'ma throw a crumb at ya
I ain't mad at ya, but ya got me bent backwards
I roll another swisher, I don't like to smoke Backwoods
Brick Squad bandana fool, trapped out since grammar school
Brick Squad Atlanta crew, she got a bandana too

I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up

Yea I got that fire for ya FYI
Nigga didn't respect me, it's hello, goodbye
All my hoes is dykin' (Dykin'), all yo hoes is triflin' (Triflin')
Yeah I got a pistol but the bullets from a rifle
Yeah they call me deuce, I got deuces on my coupe
Put two swishers together look like I'm blowing on a flute
Yea nigga we up, we ride up on you
Ralph Lauren teddy bear it's not Winnie the Pooh
Yeah nigga we winnin', and spend it on these women
And I ain't playing soccer when I'm kicking it at Lenox
Say what up to Louis, say what up to Fendi
Niggas know what we doing I make it so I spend it
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
I'm up
