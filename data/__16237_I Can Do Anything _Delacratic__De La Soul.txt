10 ContributorsI Can Do Anything (Delacratic) Lyrics(It's Delacratic)
If I want to I could jump off this building
(It's Delacratic)
I could hold two pieces of doo-doo in my hand
(It's Delacratic)
I could call everybody in that room a rubberneck
(It's Delacratic)
Come on, please?
(It's Delacratic)
I can say anything that I want
(It's Delacratic)
I could wave my hand in my air
(It's Delacratic)
I could stick my hand up my nose
(It's Delacratic)
I could hold my foot and count to three
(It's Delacratic)
I can do anything
(Possie? Dovie? Masie?)
(Pass my bag.)You might also likeEmbed
