John Dillin-

I'm living that YSL lifestyle (That lifestyle)
We living that 1017 lifestyle (1017, nigga, 1017)
We living that rich nigga shit lifestyle (Rich nigga shit, nigga, nigga)
We living that fly shit only lifestyle (Fly shit only)
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along (Get along)
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along (Yeah)
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along (Wee)
Get along, little doggie
John Dillinger

I'm geeked out my muhfucker mind (Boy)
I got a whole lot of shit, I ain't paid a dime (Fuck)
We take everything, we'll steal the scene (Steal it)
We take niggas bling (Blat, blat, blat) (Money talk like Charlie Sheen, woo)
Blat, blat, blat, man down, get him
Treated his body like chicken bricks, split him (Woo)
Catch his pussy ass, take your belt off, whip him
Pussy nigga tryna run off with them bricks, talkin' 'bout he missin' (What)
Fold his pussy ass up just like a centipede (Centipede)
Count so much money with my thumb, everything I touch turn green (Green thumb)
I'll make your white t-shirt feel like Miskeen (Bah, bah)
Hundred bands got my skinnies looking like Bugle Boy jeans
You might also like
I'm living that YSL lifestyle (That lifestyle)
We living that 1017 lifestyle (1017, nigga, 1017)
We living that rich nigga shit lifestyle (Rich nigga shit, nigga, nigga)
We living that fly shit only lifestyle (Fly shit only)
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along (Get along)
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along (Yeah)
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along (Wee)
Get along, little doggie
John Dillinger

Wake the fuck up fatass, that pussy nigga got that connect
Let's go 'head and grab, then smash (Smash)
Slow it down, don't you see they rounds?
Yeah they army down even though we gon' spray 'em down
I'm on that, so therefore I keep my hand on my gat
Nigga shot me in my finger (Now I laugh)
Now I'm shooting a Tommy Gun (With a rag)
And I hope out in that 67 Jag
Smash, I smash on they ass
Big ball son, I got big guns
I'm throwin' trust funds
Hit 'em with the golden gun, James Bond's son, let's get it

I'm living that YSL lifestyle (That lifestyle)
We living that 1017 lifestyle (1017, nigga, 1017)
We living that rich nigga shit lifestyle (Rich nigga shit, nigga, nigga)
We living that fly shit only lifestyle (Fly shit only)
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along (Get along)
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along (Yeah)
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along (Wee)
Get along, little doggie
