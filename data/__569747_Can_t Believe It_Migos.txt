18 ContributorsCanâ€™t Believe It Lyrics
I came out of jail to about 300 thousand. Gadgets on my whip, I'm lookin' at this mothafucka like how the fuck am I supposed to start this shit, man? (Yeah) Rich Nigga Timeline. (I know you can't believe this shit.) Unbelievable. (We did it.) Nah, forreal

Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

You say you didn't see but you can't believe it
When it come to kickin' doors I make you believe
We took off the block, cold, anemic
Touch down on the north and I really feed it
Mama, she told me go get it, get it
How can I not believe that she with it?
She came in my room, caught me breakin' a safe
Then she asked me, "Boy, Quavo what's really in it?"
Down in Miami, the 305
They tried to assassinate us like Biggie
What the hell goin' on?
No time to talk, bustin' back with extensions
Who got the iron?
I'm prayin' the Lord the bullet don't hit one of us in the spine
Open your eyes, stand up and bust with the 5
Stand up and bust with the 5

Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

I can't believe it, how I got these bitches
They suckin' me like they some leeches
These niggas, they actin' like bitches, they wanna take pictures
They not a rapper on a feature
Wake up in the mornin', I say me a prayer like a preacher
I teach myself like a nigga had a teacher
I got Justin Bieber in my cabin fever
Picasso pretty pictures is Mona Lisa
I can take a trip to Argentina, Indonesia
I don't need a fuckin' visa
I can't believe that we did what we did
But I pray to the man above, nigga we did it
Watch over my brother, I'm my brother's keeper
Dressed in black Margiela, I'm the Grim Reaper
Can you believe that we made a milli off of "Versace" money
Mentions ran off the meter
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

Achievers, you niggas just disbelievers
Used to be in the bando with egg beaters
You seen the first chapter, now this the sequel
I'm ahead of you niggas, we not no equal
That's the same nigga that broke in them houses
He ain't have no checks so he sat and accounted
21, I had a Challenger
Monitor had 20 thousand, I couldn't even count
My life start changin', these bitches got frantic
These bitches, they see me, they start to panic
Grandma told me better take advantage
Your situation, don't take life for granted
Prayed to the Lord and my prayer got answered
I pulled to the club in a Phantom
'Member when the police bust in, it was random
Fuck it, we took the rap game, held it ransom
Give it up!
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it5Embed
