16 ContributorsLess Speed Lyrics
Point me to the racks, please (Racks, please)
Before I make this fuckin' mac squeeze (Mac squeeze)
Don't make these fuckin' racks sneeze (Racks sneeze)
You little niggas is some pet-peeves (Pet-peeves)
Up in traffic, where you catch me (Catch me)
So much ice, I could jet ski (Jet ski)
This bitch wish she never met me (Met me)
I told her more brakes, less speed (Less speed)

You know I got the hammer, even in my pajamas
He is not a member, we don't want him around us
Smokin' on this dope pack, how much you get a pound for?
I can get you real dope, stop lookin' 'cause you found him
Accelerate then hit the gas, we don't fuck witchu', we sped pass
We rolled pass then doubled back
Let down the window then upped the Mac
Like FAH-FAH-FAH, tell 'em that
Folded up put it back in duffel bag
Gotta blick on me, I'm bussin' that
Swear it ain't shit here, tough as that
If you was 'bout it nigga, you would buss back
These hoes nigga, I ain't trustin' that
These bitches nigga, I ain't lovin' that
I'ma hit once and I'm puntin' that
Man, fuck you niggas, I ain't stuntin' that
Put em' in a cycle like a laundromat
I'm high as hell of this onion pack
And I'm ridin' round in this Iron Man
You might also like
Point me to the racks, please (Racks, please)
Before I make this fuckin' mac squeeze (Mac squeeze)
Don't make these fuckin' racks sneeze (Racks sneeze)
You little niggas is some pet-peeves (Pet-peeves)
Up in traffic, where you catch me (Catch me)
So much ice, I could jet ski (Jet ski)
This bitch wish she never met me (Met me)
I told her more brakes, less speed (Less speed)

She want me to fuck her, I'm so low off stamina
She's a fuckin' freak too, she put us on camera
She got that non-stick shit, I'ma name her Pamela
I be poppin' big shit, I'm livin' spectacular
I gotta bitch named Tabatha, flip her like a spatula
And the way she suck me, I cannot be mad at her
I'ma fuckin' changed man, I cannot be draggin' her
Stay gettin' the same bands, but my Louis lavender

Point me to the racks, please (Racks, please)
Before I make this fuckin' mac squeeze (Mac squeeze)
Don't make these fuckin' racks sneeze (Racks sneeze)
You little niggas is some pet-peeves (Pet-peeves)
Up in traffic, where you catch me (Catch me)
So much ice, I could jet ski (Jet ski)
This bitch wish she never met me (Met me)
I told her more brakes, less speed (Less speed)Embed
