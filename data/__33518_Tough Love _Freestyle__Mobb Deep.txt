2 ContributorsTough Love (Freestyle) Lyrics
Niggas, niggas, niggas, niggas, niggas, niggettes
(Yeah) y'all been invited, (welcome)
That's what I'm talkin 'bout
Mobb Deep up in this motherfucker, bring yo' ass in here
Hey yo check it out son, check it out like this

I keep a hammer on my waist 'cause ain't no steppin' to this
Hey yo don't let you be a problem that I'm fiendin' to fix
You peep the grin on my face that mean I'm creepin' on somethin'
Whether a bad bitch, or a nigga that stole somethin'
Call me a old school cat wit aiyyoung mentality
I live by the day and I go out for family
I don't understand language if it ain't talkin' money
From the era walkin' 'round with knots lookin' bummy
Certain bitches knew the code so they went with the flow
And let you know they wanted fifty-four elevens from the door
We cut school, cooked caine, took traum' to the brain
And though a nigga had it, still hopped the fuckin' train
Look back and laugh but ain't shit funny still
My little brother took his life, forever I'm stuck with a ice grill
Got friends with chemical imbalances
And when the love get tough, believe me it's challengin'

You go out for me, I'm goin' out for you
Tough love (tough love)
It's the crew for one, and one for the crew (yeah)
It's tough love (tough love)
No matter the bullshit the world put us through (*gunshot*)
Tough love (tough love)
Y'all my motherfuckin' niggas and you know what I'd do
(hey yo check it out)
Bust slugs (bust slugs)
You might also like
It was one of those days you could smell it was 'bout to rain
Parked in the car sittin' in the back seat
Just me and my dun, smokin' the weed
That's when the floor phone rung, "who could this be?" (get back)
"What's good?"
"Yo dun, I got some very bad news"
"Yo who this?"
"Lil' BG from Springfield, and Franny Lou"
"Okay, talk to me"
"Now to make a long story short, Yvesh got bodied at
Precious' party"
"You lyin'"
"That's word to our dead, hear what I said
Now meet me at the rest it's time for get back"
"I'm there"
Dropped off my dun at the Vann's, at Yorke College
Can't believe they killed my man 'Vesh
Why not flip?  somebody gotta pay for this
And we know who did it man it's time for that shit
Go around they way and spray them clips
And watch niggas lay down like naked chicks

You go out for me, I'm goin' out for you
Tough love (tough love)
It's the crew for one, and one for the crew (yeah)
It's tough love (tough love)
No matter the bullshit the world put us through (*gunshot*)
Tough love (tough love)
Y'all my motherfuckin' niggas and you know what I'd do
(HEY YO CHECK IT OUT)
Bust slugs (bust slugs)
That's right my niggas and niggettes
It's that certified Mobb shit (God DAMN!)
Stay tuned, know what I'm sayin'
And get that motherfuckin album and stay, in-tune
Ya' heard  (yeah)

Mobb Deep
