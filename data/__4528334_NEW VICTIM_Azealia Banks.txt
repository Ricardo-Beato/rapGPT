13 ContributorsNEW VICTIM Lyrics
And in every case
A blood clot eight inches from the victim's neck
The mark of the beast
(I love you baby!)

Slayer, bass up
Boy, gotta get you geekin'
Mixer, elixir
Gotta get this bitch freakin'
Hey cutey, hey cutey
How you got a dick so big yeah?
Big tits, D cups
I can see these bitches peekin'
Tit lick, clit rub
Tell that Lil' bitch don't fake it
Scissor, sister
We about to get this paper
Why you wanna keep me waiting?
Hey cutey, hey cutey
Are you gonna get me naked?
I don't wanna be impatient
But I just wanna take this off
Fuck me to the beat
Cause this my favorite song
Face down, ass up
Anyway you wanna take it
Boy you better break this pussy
Leave my lil' pussy achin'
Boy you better make me take it
Boy you better dick me hard
Dick down, ah-huh
You know that I like it raw
Face down, ass up
Anyway you wanna take it
Boy you better uh, uh

Slurp it, kiss me

Make me writhe and moan
Pin me up against the wall
Lick down, lick down

And you know this pussy warm

Gotta get you out this jaw
Time to stick your dick in
Boy you know that dick too long
I know you wanna sink your teeth in
But you better take your time
Deep down, deep down
