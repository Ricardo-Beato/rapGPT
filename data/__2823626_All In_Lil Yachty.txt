82 ContributorsAll In Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, Lil Boat
All my brothers with me!
Yeah
From the start, they been with me from the start
I love y'all!
Gang, gang, gang, gang

Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Seven years later and I got the same friends
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Seven years later and I got the same friends
All in, yeah I'm all in, I'm all in
All in, yeah I'm all in, I'm all in

All in with a pair of twins in a Benz
Just bought a new necklace and it came with heavy winds
She suck me like a push-pop, she love cock
My brothers they been with me from the very start
Recorded in the closet with sock mics
If one fight we all fight, it's fight night
You might also like
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Seven years later and I got the same friends
All in, yeah I'm all in, I'm all in
All in, yeah I'm all in, I'm all in

Black and white like a zebra
I don't sell furniture but nigga IKEA
I have an idea, headshot, ID ya
Media wanna see me in jail like Madea
If my career go south I'm going to South Korea
Macaroni sells, I been macking, making macarena
I'm cleaner than the cleanest
It's Byou, nice to meet you
This ain't a cookout but my meat on her grill

I started off like I'm a goonie
When I got in they gave me a toolie
I'm high off these snacks like I'm Scooby
I can't be no average joe
Never fucked an average ho
We lit and you know it's a problem
Grill like I'm eating on pollen
Keep a bitch on my thigh like a pocket
If I fuck her she sucking the gang
Me and my brothers done did everything
Backwood, it's stuffed, look like Oreo
If you know me I know that you owe me
Kay the Yacht keep a K and a forty
Balmains on me like I'm lonely
Fired a banker for twenty
Thumb in her butt while she sippin' the Henny
I know that my gang won't forget me
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Seven years later and I got the same friends
All in, yeah I'm all in, I'm all in
All in, yeah I'm all in, I'm all in

You a stain, you a lame
Swerving hoes like I got a cane
Old friends call me, say they can't look at Perry the same
Perry growin' up and I got the same gang
100 deep, run up, yeah I'm glad you came
Young nigga with expensive tastes
Matter fact, ask your girl 'fore you go and kiss her face
Damn, who is she, let me check my database
Yeah, Perry here, the other human race

I'm all in, I'm all in, I'm all in
Bitch I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin'
These bitches callin', they stalkin', they stallin'
25 just for a fucking walk in

All in, 40 for the walk in
Now I'm flossin', drop top Slauson
Got a goth bitch, she put me in a coffin
Got a dog bitch, now she leaving paw-prints
Still ridin' sports when I'm sittin' in it's great
Tell my bitch make a play, now I'm frosted like a cake
Chef knife with the steak, now I'm flexing heavyweight
In the six like a date, all my partners livin' great
Bankroll after bankroll I'm stacking
JBan$ keep three phones, I'm trapping
Working with the work, I double up, it's magic
Chopper make a nigga backflip, gymnastics
Bad bitch take off with the pack if you lackin'
Got 100 bloods posted in the back with rachets
Pull off in the Aston, ball like Collin Sexton
26's for my wrist, diamonds dancing like they Prince

Bankroll after bankroll I love to spend, yeah
When I get it back I love to spend it all again, yeah
Boomin' out the gym, yeah, way above the rim, yeah
Ten up on my neck and I spent fifteen for my wrist, yeah
Woah up on my wrist, yeah, wetter than a fish, yeah
Woah, you just want to come because I'm next, yeah
Woah, you just like that glow that's from my neck, yeah
Woah, I'm tired of talking, can you cut my check, yeah
Woah

Bankroll after bankroll I spend (I spend)
Only love my gang, I don't got no new friends (no new niggas)
Hit your bitch from the back and I watch her bend (dumb bitch)
NAZ for life, nigga, that's 'til the end
I only want to fuck, I can't be your boyfriend (stupid bitch)
I speak rich nigga shit, broke niggas can't comprehend
Ayy, it's Cartiers all over my lens
All hundreds in my bankroll, I don't do no tens

Never Amount To Zero in this bitch, you understand that?
2016 Dream Team, matching Bimmer boys, let's get it
Got love for all my niggas
We all in, we all fam

All in
All my brothers all in
Same gang, I got the same friends
I promise that I'm all in
I'm all in, I'm all in
All in
Fuck it I might cop the Benz
Oh, I'm all in
All in, ah, oh
Sailing Team
