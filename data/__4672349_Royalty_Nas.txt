22 ContributorsRoyalty Lyrics
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy and it bugs me
Behind her best friend back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less then a week ago
He's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speakerphone
Right before he clinked up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You can stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk
Never swung at nobody, never let a gun spark
Big nine-seven Benz with the old body
Pulls up to the corner, out jumps his old hottie
You might also like
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty (Nigga)
But they gon' know when they see us (Yo)

Football wives, basketball wives
Mistresses slash more tires with knives
They lookin' for a dollar
I'm lookin' for a JoAnne Chesimard to turn to a shotta
Spot a King of Diamonds, Onyx, one bitch get it off the floor
Other chick out of her man's pockets
What kind of shows you be watchin'?
It shows, this is how we choose who we should rock with
I think about settlin' down again, have more seeds
Ten toes on the ground again, let hoes be
Nothin' like makin' love with somebody you love
Nothin' like comin' home to grub
Netflix, hugs with a wet kiss
The best shit, take my mind off of makin' records
I need that moral support
Give me a reason to spoil you more
Make 'em jealous of who we are
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

Tryna get my niggas legitimate
Shit is ugly, my dudes strugglin', drug dealer shit
Silhouette of a murderer, thug nigga, fitted Mets cap
Drunk liquor bit, young black militant
Just hopin' I hit a lick, a criminal's wit
Intelligence, still a menace each Guinness I sip
Bring the kid ideas, the visions I get
How this dude rich? He snuck in with no citizenship
Motivation, so I get off my ass
I'm the star of the movie, lookin' for my supportin' cast
Read the Forbes pages, lookin' at G4s
Wish it could be more, pray I beat the court cases
Women with small waists, lonely, I ain't too far
Smoke weed, and count paper
I'm about paper and pussy and buyin' the bar
Fly ass niggas, y'all jealous of who we are
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us2Embed
