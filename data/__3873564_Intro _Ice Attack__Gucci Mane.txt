5 ContributorsIntro (Ice Attack) Lyrics
Once again is Gucci Mane La Flare, the songwriting extraordinaire, teaming up with my boy Zaytiggy
Zaytoven, the world renowned producer from the San Francisco Bay Area, he fye with it and he fly with it, if I hit it, than he hit it
Zaytoven, Zaytiggy, money bags, count this money, too fresh shawty, young future, funky fingers kno' I mean
Damn what you thought he can make a crippled man walk and a keyboard talk? Zaytoven
Y'all don't know nun' about Zay, y'all don't know his game strong, and he play for Eddie Long, and everyboy from here to  got it going on
He pimping and popping, and taking girls shopping
Trapping and rapping, and making things happen, you kno' I mean, he keep it moving and he making good music
Y'all don't want it, y'all don't wanna see his  with the big rims on it, kno' I mean
Me and Zay, like Snoop and Dre, Eric B and Rakim, we shining in your face like puffy mace
We putting on big shit, and I could talk all day bout' my homeboy Zay, cause he's too legit to quit, somebody give him a piece of toilet tissue cause he's the shit, kno' I mean
He's a friend of me, he don't compete with niggas on the street, but only niggas in the industry
He's an executive nigga, an upper echelon ass nigga
Got pretty, saddity, bitches from the inner-city, been PI since , been popping rubber bands fore' I heard of TI
Zaytoven, the millenial Beethoven, the next Dr Dre from the Bay, representing EA all day
And, it's a blessing, just to be in the presence of Zay, cause he's a bad man, and he's funky like the trashcan
And, I could talk all day about my homeboy Zay, cause he's fresh to death, and he's signed hisself, so let me give a shoutout to my homeboy Zaytoven, the producer of the year in my book

So, all y'all producers in the industry, tighten up, because Zay gon' make you step your game up, and I got one question to ask ya'
