My first mind is where the cash at, where the cash at?
You love her, bro, keep her all from 'round me or I'll smash that
No need for bringin' up that old shit, look, I'm past that
Grown man in a time machine shit I laugh at
I been on my grind this whole week, ain't gettin' no sleep
That's your broad, you better watch her, dawg, 'cause she a whole freak
Agency is 99, yeah, I'm into sports now
Park the Dawn, I'm hoppin' out the Dawn, I'm in the Porsche now

My first mind is where the cash at, where the cash at?
First mind is where the cash at, where the cash at?
My first mind is where the cash at, where the cash at?
First mind is where the cash at, where the cash at?
My first mind is where the cash at, where the cash at?
First mind is where the cash at, where the cash at?
My first mind is where the cash at, where the cash at?
First mind is where the cash at, where the cash at?

Hydratin' on Defiance Fuel, on my Figgers phone
Avión doin' numbers, nigga, what I'm trippin' on
My real estate buyin' real estate while I'm sleepin', nigga
Buckhead at my steakhouse, bon appétit, nigga
Kept me flyin' down Peachtree in my drop top
Bad lil' Asian thang beside me in a crop top
Agency is 99, yeah, I'm into sports now
Park the Dawn, I'm hoppin' out the Dawn, I'm in the Porsche now
