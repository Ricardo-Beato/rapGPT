88 ContributorsDome Lyrics
(Wheezy Beatz)
Yeah, okay

I got like 5 million and 12 hundred thousand hoes (Racks)
They drippin' all over my motherfuckin' clothes (Sheesh)

Let's go off the dome (Woah)
I can't make it home (No)
I fucked her, I boned her (Yeah)
She leave an aroma (Skrt)
They callin' my phone up (Brrt, brrt)
My girl like "What's goin' on?" (Brrt, brrr)
She suckin', put me in a coma (Slurp)
I nut on that bitch on my sofa (Yeah)

Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What's brackin'? (Yeah)

Dickie suit, chucks
Flag hangin' to the right
Put that young bitch in a buck'
Kid Cudi, fuck her all day and all night
Okay, I'm in this bitch with Lil Duke, Longway
You can be with me, you too, four way
Put that bitch off from my deuce, slow day
I'ma sell at least like two
Thugga Thugga, what it do?
Ridin' in the fast lane, I'm eludin' (Skrrr)
All these drugs that we abusin' (Drugs)
Addicted to winnin', not losin'
I'm in the kitchen just cookin' (Cook it up)
Middle finger to a bookin' (Fuck 'em)
Fuck runnin' off, fuck nigga I took it
Diamond so wet, I might need to douche it
Diamonds they shower, they shower me
Yes that lil' nigga I got with me
When it's war my niggas count on me
Beyonc√©, bitch, I'm a bumble bee
This the beehive, this my turf, bitch, you can't sting on me
Jingle bells, baby, you can ring on me
You might also like
Let's go off the dome (Woah)
I can't make it home (No)
I fucked her, I boned her (Yeah)
She leave an aroma (Skrt)
They callin' my phone up (Brrt, brrt)
My girl like "What's goin' on?" (Brrt, brrr)
She suckin', put me in a coma (Slurp)
I nut on that bitch on my sofa (Yeah)

Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

458 California 'Rari, I got that old money, call it Atari
Let's go off the dome, I trap by the Dome
Keep a couple grams in my field pocket
Keep a pocket rocket on me, ain't no guessin' if I'm gon' pop it
Got a lot of blood homies, and guess what? It ain't no stoppin'
Hop in the car and I'm wylin', I'm stylin'
I hop out and cuss out my driver (Skrrt, hop in)
Fuck nigga try me, no Eddie Bauer, I'ma pull up and make it rain, showers (Ahh, grah, grah)
I'm a lil' kid when it come to that pussy, I hop up like the Icy Tower (Hop up, yeah)
I would rather be a coyote than be a coward (Damn)
I creep right up on them, hit 'em with the AK, 7 in the morning (Pew, pew)
No Christmas Eve, caught him by surprise, he was still yawnin' (Ahh!)
I'm runnin' the city, you ridin' in that loaner, I'm runnin' with owners
I'm runnin' with armor, I'm not even thinkin', I'm right off the dome
Let's go off the dome (Woah)
I can't make it home (No)
I fucked her, I boned her (Yeah)
She leave an aroma (Skrt)
They callin' my phone up (Brrt, brrt)
My girl like "What's goin' on?" (Brrt, brrr)
She suckin', put me in a coma (Slurp)
I nut on that bitch on my sofa (Yeah)

Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What's brackin'? (Yeah)43Embed
