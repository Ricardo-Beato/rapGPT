60 ContributorsShe Wanna Party Lyrics
Drinks in the air (Ahh)
Rich nigga, put that Ace of Spade in the air (Ahh)
Mack a couple bitches, yeah, we played everywhere
Shake it up and pop it, now we spray it everywhere, yeah

And we be saucin'
I love her, so you know I got her flossin'
I'm not a dentist, but a nigga flossin'
I'm fresh to death, they say I should be coffin, hey

I'm boutta turn it up, she wanna party with a real nigga (Ahh)
She wanna party with a real nigga (Ahh)
Shawty wanna party with a real nigga
She wanna party with a real nigga (Party, ooh-ooh-ooh)
She wanna party
She wanna party (Ahh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
She wanna party (Shawty wanna party)
She wanna party (Hey), ayy

Twist it like a Tootsie Roll, Roll, Roll
Like a movie play your fuckin' role, role, role
Can't believe my circle small like Cheerios
Hate to say it, but it saved another Bankroll
She tryna pop it all for me
Lil shawty tryna drop it all for me
But I see right through her body
That she just want her money, she not vibin'
And if you look, that shit is what I'm poppin'
I left you with a brick, better re-rock it
Fucked her good, and now her heart is in my pocket
Ha-uh, ha-uh, ha-uh
Her heart beatin', mind racin', but we gotta pace it
Sit on my face, that pussy wet like she fresh out the lake, and
I milked this place, I beat the case, crank up my generator
I got some X, I got some syrup, I'm smokin' turtle tank, and
You might also like
And we be saucin'
I love her, so you know I got her flossin' (Flossin')
I'm not a dentist, but a nigga flossin'
I'm fresh to death, they say I should be coffin, hey

I'm boutta turn it up, she wanna party with a real nigga (She wanna burn it up, ahh)
She wanna party with a real nigga (Do it with a real one, ahh)
Shawty wanna party with a real nigga (Ooh-woo-woo)
She wanna party with a real nigga (Party, ooh-ooh-ooh)
She wanna party
She wanna party (Ahh, she wanna party, ooh-ooh-ooh)
She wanna party (Shawty wanna party)
She wanna party (Hey), ayy

I wanna know if you gon' roll with me
I'm tryna see if you gon' stroll with me
Jeffery tryna roll, hey
You should try livin' with a gangster
Stay down with me if I'm banged up (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh)
I'ma do or die with you no matter what
No matter what
Everything about you please me
Darlin', I'm hungry, I wan' eat that pussy (Darlin')
From you, away could never push me
Darlin' (Darlin')
I want you for real
And if you feel like I
Wasted your time, I'll reimburse
Now, I don't mind puttin' a little interest on it
Okay, about you, I'm ready to kill
I'ma come back on it, appeal (Ah, ah-ahh)
Look at my kick game, reimbursin'
And I might put a lil' interest on it, ayy
Drinks in the air (Ahh)
Rich nigga, put that Ace of Spade in the air (Ace of Spade, ahh)
Mack a couple bitches, yeah, we played everywhere
Shake it up and pop it, now we spray it everywhere, yeah (Spray it everywhere)

And we be saucin'
