6 ContributorsIâ€™m Still Fly Lyrics
Yeah
Alright
Paige, I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind me, uhm havin' a little fun you know?
I know this your joint I just I always liked this song so I figured I may as well throw in
Here we go

I'm still fly, (Yeah) I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings (Ah)
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand 'em (That's me singin' by the way)
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing (In case you didn't know)
I'm still fly, (Yeah) I'm sky high (It's some new shit, it's some new shit I'm on)
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings (I promise I got 'em though)
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around (Love)
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing (Here we go)
I'm still

Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre talent, let me see if I can condition you
Took over my city, and I never asked permission to
Started poppin' bottles, cause it's ATL tradition to
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him at the So-ho
If there ain't an elevator in it, it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin', and these bitches wanna snow blow
And they just give me head, while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ should've won that
Listen and respect, man, the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, halla at me when you're done laps
Roll around with Neego, Party with Azooka
Shout goes out to 1Da, shout goes out to Future
Shout goes out to Getti, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch, just can't seem to hold it steady
'Cause I see the flame flickering, x girls bickering
Got these women jockin' me from Holly Grove all the way to Picker Ring
I tryed to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan, but my connect said it'd take a minute if you listening
Please start doing you, I been doing me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody, even if you suin' me
My brother P-rain know, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot an officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hopin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just halla if you got me, fuck you if you had me
Shout goes out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to B Plus
The names I mention are crucial, you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes, I could sacrifice a line
Yeah, I swear, I really fuckin' does it
I had these niggas trippin, no luggage

I'm still fly, I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand 'em
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I'm still fly, I'm sky high (Yeah)
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I'm stillEmbed
