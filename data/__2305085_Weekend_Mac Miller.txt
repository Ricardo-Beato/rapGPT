Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, (Uh, uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, now

I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets, roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins, I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Gettin' high to deal with my problems, fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches gettin' obnoxious, they nuttin' to me though, I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights, talk too much, the wrong advice, all the lights
And call my life, doctor, doctor, will you help me? Get me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch, you jealous now, smokin' weed at the crib watchin' Belly now (Alright)
All the pain that they causin' like, fuck it, we ballin', now everythin' straight
You feelin' the feelin', I'm chillin', just livin', I'm burnin' away
Conversations we havin', I'm gettin' too static, too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)

We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)

I been havin' trouble sleepin', battlin' these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathin': is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinkin' 'bout the places that I frequent, all the people that I see
I'm just out here livin' decent, what do it mean to be a G? Yeah (Alright)
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
In God's desire, I make water wine, pausin' time, it's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's, wonderin', well
Wonderin' how I got this high, fell asleep and forgot to die, Goddamn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browser, like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what the day is
But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)
Mondays I think of you, but I ain't trippin' on it
Tuesdays I'm hittin', gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit wit'chu, you know you're stayin' over
Thursdays I'm sick of you, I got to get rid of you
'Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of my life, alright
When I get faded you hate it, but, baby
It's gon' be alright
Haha, alright58Embed
