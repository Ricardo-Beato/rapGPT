A, L and M, I, G, H, T, Y
JD on the beats

True, true, true (Ayy, ayy)
Don't make me shoot you, you (Like bang, bang)
Like bad bitch in the room, room, room
Bitch, my car go vroom, vroom, vroom
Got an elephant in my Trues, Trues, Trues
Thousand for my shoes, my shoes, my shoes
Sosa be flexin' on these niggas, I know (Flexin', flexin')
Baby, that's the way it go (Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am)
Go, go, go

You don't wanna give me top then go bye-bye
Got some niggas that be at your door knockin' (Bang, bang)
Fuckin' with Almighty So', not him
Baby I don't care about shit, nothin'
But countin' them Ben Franklins, countin'
84 carat diamond necklace, that's a shiner
It look like it's 'bout to take a piss, goddamn
I'm G'd up, I'm T'd up
Baby boy, you don't wanna try me, boy
Like your fuckin' father, boy, I'll beat you
When I see your bitch, boy, I'll freeze her
She call me papi
Don't care about no nigga 'cause I'm me
Get dome, then I leave
Kill that bitch, she try to set up me
That's the way it go
Tell the cops I ain't sayin' shit, radio
Try to drive by, bitch, we shootin' out the stereo
You don't want these problems, pussy, carry on
I'm with Obama up in DC
Tryna find some bitches that's gon' eat, eat
He say when Michelle trippin', he call Chief Keef
'Cause I blowed up like a motherfuckin' B-E
That bitch, whore, whore, she a whore
She call my phone then I ignore her
Like I fuckin' know her
All 'cause I'm a Glory Boy

True, true, true (Ayy, ayy)
Don't make me shoot you, you (Like bang, bang)
Like bad bitch in the room, room, room
Bitch, my car go vroom, vroom, vroom
Got an elephant in my Trues, Trues, Trues
Thousand for my shoes, my shoes, my shoes
Sosa be flexin' on these niggas, I know (Flexin', flexin')
Baby, that's the way it go (Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am)
Go, go, goEmbed
