Back to the block, to the booth, back to the basics
I want that money so bad, I'll take it
We in the matrix, my nigga, we in the matrix
We in the matrix, my nigga, we in the matrix
Back to the block, to the booth, back to the basics
We want that money so bad, we'll take it
We in in the matrix, my nigga, we in the matrix
We in the matrix, my nigga, and it's amazing

I want that money so bad, I'll take it
I got that sack on me now, I'll end up racing
I'm trying to run it all up, ain't got no patience
I know some niggas in the yard, they'll rape ya
And we don't play with lil' boys, we'll cage ya
Bitch, you gone starve, you gone starve, before I pay ya
I pushed out all of my cars, I'm in a spurr
You want that soft I got hard, we got that work
That Oxycotin, that powder, that rock-n-roll
I'm cashin' out on the spot, straight out the bowl
I want them racks to the sky, won't sell my soul
I get some money, that money, say fuck them hoes

Back to the block, to the booth, back to the basics
I want that money so bad, I'll take it
We in the matrix, my nigga, we in the matrix
We in the matrix, my nigga, we in the matrix
Back to the block, to the booth, back to the basics
We want that money so bad, we'll take it
We in in the matrix, my nigga, we in the matrix
We in the matrix, my nigga, and it's amazing

Soon as I jumped off the porch, I was in it
I had to get me a Porsche, without no limit
Sell dope for polo sports, stop by in Benzes
You got a lick on the first, without attention
This dirty society made me a menace
These young niggas riding on you, they so relentless
I conquer any and everything that I wanted
You see that chopper on my lap, its fully loaded
Ain't trying to hurt you, I'll murk you, I'm playing defense
These pussy niggas they trying to give me a reason
You can't be talking to niggas turned co-defendants
We ain't gon' stop, we on top, and we gone keep winning

Back to the block, to the booth, back to the basics
I want that money so bad, I'll take it
We in the matrix, my nigga, we in the matrix
We in the matrix, my nigga, we in the matrix
Back to the block, to the booth, back to the basics
We want that money so bad, we'll take it
We in in the matrix, my nigga, we in the matrix
We in the matrix, my nigga, and it's amazing6Embed
