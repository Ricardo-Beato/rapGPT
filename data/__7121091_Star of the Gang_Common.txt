6 ContributorsStar of the Gang Lyrics
Everything is alright
I've been through a lot, but I'm fortunate
Feel it comin' from all sides
Heavy is the crown, but I'm passionate
And I know I'll be just fine
Understand the world, we're the same
I'll be alright
I've been through a lot, but I'm fortunate

Rain showers, brainpower
Thunder sparks can dark and light, live in the same hour
Live from the main tower
From the same flower as H. Rap
Grew up on concrete where we couldn't escape black
Listen to MCs who made me take thеy tape back
Rewind, black stars align
Help mе define exactly who I am
Know the voice of the lamb
Recognize the shepherd
Black Panther and leather
Won't jeopardize the leopard
From where my strength come is the same place I bled hurt
Crossin' the 7 is like crossin' a desert
Get ate like dessert 'cause ain't nothin' sweet
You might get a red shirt
I'm so fresh, man, I should be redshirt
Though I'm far from a expert
Master of style 'til my head hurt
My stepfather was a plumber
So I understand pressure
Bustin' the pipes and hustlin' nights
Scuffles and fights, my cousin's advice
Go harder, think smarter, be a model for the part of society that desires free
Freedom ain't to barter
You might also like
Everything is alright
I've been through a lot, but I'm fortunate
Feel it comin' from all sides
Heavy is the crown, but I'm passionate
And I know I'll be just fine
Understand the world, we're the same
I'll be alright
I've been through a lot, but I'm fortunate

A time it'll go our way
Yes, this is the time when we know our way
My mama said, "Baby, you should know y'all way"
Footprints of the prophet on my soul, I'll shade
Halfway across the bridge, I saw a couple of kids
Who yell, "Black lives," but ain't know where Blacks live
It's okay, if you for it, you ain't against
You and your white pickets can help paint the fence
This is knowledge of self-defense
You felt the rinse of the brainwash
I hold weight like suspense
Thrillers, this is thriller night
Gods and monsters, odds to conquer
Squads with contra, bars and mantras
With my palms up, I ponder
Am I a son of Ghana or the one that squanders?
I'm glad I seen Bianca, she reminded me
No matter how far I go, to keep findin' me
I know that there's work on this earth that's assigned to me
I know there's a race between, between time and me
I'm locked in, find the key, my mind is free
I took time with me, it took time to see that—
Everything is alright
I've been through a lot, but I'm fortunate
Feel it comin' from all sides
Heavy is the crown, but I'm passionate
And I know I'll be just fine
Understand the world, we're the same
I'll be alright
I've been through a lot, but I'm fortunate1Embed
