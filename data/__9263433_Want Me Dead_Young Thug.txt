Expect me, nigga, like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me, nigga, I'm comin'

Your ex like Pocahontas (Woo)
Whatever happen, I'ma get money (Woo)
I'm a Thriller nigga, fuck my conscience (Woo)
These foreign shoes, fuck my bunions (Okay)
We done made a hundred bands on Sunday (Woo)
And ain't goin' to Magic Monday (Woo)
Put that dick in her abs like crunches (Woo)
I came from shootin' Cee-lo in the dungeon (Okay, woo)
Yeah, I'm tired of makin' it rain
I'd much rather go buy me a plane (Okay)
I had to call 'em to stop up the sink (Okay)
Whole lot of **** tried to go down the drain (Ha, okay)
First hundred thousand, I went, made a strain
I was ridin' behind Gucci in a red Mulsanne
That was back in '09, just before the fame came (Okay)
I had a check 'fore the rap check came (Okay)
I put baguettes on this shit out in Spain
I don't four-four, make the check Houdini (Woo)
Bitch, you cheated, don't speak when you see me
I'm in the Turbo S, no GP (Skrrt)
I'm gettin' head from Ch— I meant CC
My nigga ain't even tryna hit sweetie (Nah)
That bitch turn me off, no kizzy (No kizzy)
I told my ex, "Don't call, I'm busy" (Oh)
I just told my new one she gotta trust me (Gotta trust me)
She love all my friends 'cause they love me (Love)
Everything you do and everything you say is stuck with me
You're lovin' me, yeah
You might also like
I told my brother, "Take this watch because I'm vulnerable"
I let her get away with murder when I fall in love
I told 'em, "Ante up the chips because they know it's us"
I told my niggas, "Fuck them niggas 'cause it's fuck us"
They want me dead, they want me dead
If I had one wish, I'd bring my niggas back from the dead
I'm sippin' codeine, this ain't no red, no
I'm up, but came from the struggle, duckin' red dots

I keep that fire on me everywhere (21)
It's one nigga talk on the Internet, but when we turn on his block, he ain't never there (21)
All them lil' boys be tryna act gangster, that's why when they die, I don't ever care (21)
We in the middle of summer, but nigga, we steppin', this shit feel like February (Pussy)
Yellow diamonds, they canary (Pussy)
Came from the bottom and I made it to the other side, nah, I ain't use no ferry (Facts)
Opps be smokin' on niggas they ain't step on, them niggas funny, Jim Carrey (Straight up)
Stones in my ear, they VVS certified, bitch, I can hear you clearly (On God)
Big 4L, we ain't beefin' 'bout hoes, nigga, don't bring that shit near me (21)
Leave your phone when you step
I drop the bag, your secret is kept (21)
Opps cliqued up, they needed some help
Got too much money, I hired a chef
Get me mad enough, I do it myself (21)
Y'all niggas pussy, it's all on your breath (21)
Go against me, that shit bad for your health
Where he stand is the same place he left (21)
I told my brother, "Take this watch because I'm vulnerable" (I told my brother take this watch from me)
I let her get away with murder when I fall in love (Yeah)
I told 'em, "Ante up the chips because they know it's us" (Ante up)
I told my niggas, "Fuck them niggas 'cause it's fuck us" (I told my niggas, niggas)
They want me dead, they want me dead (They want me dead)
If I had one wish, I'd bring my niggas back from the dead (Yeah, yeah)
I'm sippin' codeine, this ain't no red, no (Codeine, this ain't no red, no)
I'm up, but came from the struggle, duckin' red dots
