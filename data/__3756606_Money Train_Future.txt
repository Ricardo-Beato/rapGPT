22 ContributorsMoney Train Lyrics
Wheezy Beats
Yeah
Wheezy outta here

Yeah, got nothing but hundreds on my membrane
I can't be broke I might go insane
I whip that Rolls up with that Mulsanne
Swear it won't stop we on the money train
Went overseas I had a foreign exchange
I'm smokin' trees, California strain
Two tennis necklace these ain't PF Chang's

16 foreign cars, I ain't nothin but 26
They snatched me up, I said I was innocent
Fuck them cops tryna take my slime in
Seven black whips, you don't know what I'm slidin' in
My money way taller than my ceilings, yeah
Old school Murcielago ain't come from Craigslist
Brand new Aventador, I chopped the head off
20 new tennis chains, Eliantte
Pull up, perfect ten, 'bout my pesos
Gotta stay gassed up like Valero
Oh oh nah nah nah nah big talk red hoe
And she do whatever when I say so, oh
Pay the judge off to get the case closed
You might also like
Yeah, got nothing but hundreds on my membrane
I can't be broke I might go insane
I whip that Rolls up with that Mulsanne
Swear it won't stop we on the money train
Went overseas I had a foreign exchange
I'm smokin' trees, California strain
Two tennis necklace these ain't PF Chang's

No surfboard, these niggas riding our wave
Oh, these niggas riding our wave
I put the hood on my shoulder blade
Put the hood on my shoulder blade
Yves Saint Laurent, lil bitch you know we paid
Saint Laurent, lil bih, this YSL
Bought some more icing, don't need no more cake
Some more icing, don't need no more cake
I popped a perc, it healed my headache
I popped a perky, healed my headache
2-door Rolls Royce, still got leg space
2-door Rolls Royce, this bitch got leg space
Show no remorse, we killing everything
Show no remorse, I'm killing everything
That SlimeLife came with that FreeBandz Gang
SlimeLife came with that FreeBandz Gang, oh
Yeah, got nothing but hundreds on my membrane
I can't be broke I might go insane
I whip that Rolls up with that Mulsanne
Swear it won't stop we on the money train
Went overseas I had a foreign exchange
I'm smokin' trees, California strain
Two tennis necklace these ain't PF Chang's4Embed
