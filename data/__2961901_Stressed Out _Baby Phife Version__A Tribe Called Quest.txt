I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
(What's your name?)
Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?)
American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend
(Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream)
(Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember)
(Shaytan got you caught in the storms of December)
(And brothers on the block packing nines like September)
(Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender)
Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies
Yo we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at the Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it, 'til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo I know the feeling when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that
You might also like
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

You got the N.W.O. (with low cash flow)
Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who)
And crosstown niggas trying to (bust at you)
Ayo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)

Dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lo, dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lee
Me no look for trouble but trouble done follow me
All I wanted to be was a illa MC
Ever since me was small as a youth out in Queens
What did you mash on de dancehall (all a me)
Until my best friend caught two in him head (Right, scene)
And ever since that day (ya nah hear me?) things been a mess
R.I.P Ghosta Rock, true ting, God bless
So nowadays I go see wifey just to cure me from stress
Lay my head on her breast
Sugar dumpling knows best
Explaining all my problems to her getting things off my chest
A little hookup, squeeze up, and no more am I vexed
Ayo son, without my peeps I'd be truly assed out
Making sure I have my medication so I wouldn't pass out
Native Tongues for believing in me, when everyone was fessing
Most of all Jah Mighty for the guidance and the blessings
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually
