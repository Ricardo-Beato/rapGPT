9 ContributorsPull Up Late Lyrics
(MCV, bitch)
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

Pull up late just to ride that face
He wanna be down, he respect my chase
That's why I gotta keep a special place for you
'Cause when I'm done in the booth, I'm comin' home to you
You could pull up in that ooh, make a nigga say, "Ahh"
Pull up in that ooh, make a nigga say, "Ahh"
Pull up in that ooh, make a nigga say, "Ahh"
Pull up in that ooh, make a nigga say, "Ahh"

Look, its five o'clock, just touched down in the city (Down in the city)
Tell your people, hit my people if you're tryna link up with me (Hello?)
Niggas like to play me soft because they think I'm acting pretty (What?)
One phone call and your whole block feel it (Baow, baow, baow)
Long legs, big titties, I'm the hood Tyra Banks (I'm the hood Tyra Banks)
How bitches 'xpect to catch me when I pull up where you can't? (Uh-uh)
This some shit you can't pronounce but I know what you're tryna say (I know what you're tryna say)
I'm finna switch this bitch to sport to come and put it in your face (Mwah)
Pull up in that ooh, make a nigga say, "Ahh"
Ask for my number, it's Chanel No. 9 (Uh-huh)
Only time I'm a freak is if I really got the time
If the nigga really mine, then he really won't mind if I...

Look at it, Daddy (Yeah), you know that I'm outta your league
All of the shit I got on me expensive, I look like a money machine
He say it look like I came from Belize and he wanna know it was weave
If you're not talkin' 'bout feedin' my pockets then you are not talkin' to me (Nope)

Go commando in a Lambo just in case he wanna slop me

Game over, threw it over my shoulder (Yeah)
Pulled up actin' rowdy, hangin' out a Range Rover (Hangin' out a Range Rover)
You don't wanna go to war with a street soldier (Uh-uh)
Speedin' in the foreign, whip that ho like a Toyota
Bitch, it's young Tina Snow, the young bachelorette
I told him he can keep the roses, nigga, ice out my neck (Yeah)
Got me some 'Retha on me now 'cause I'ma get my respect (Baow, baow)
And if my bitch ain't work tonight then we gon' fuck up a check
Uh, take it off, bitch, lean back, pop that pussy (Let's see it)
Pull them panties to the side 'cause you know them ballers lookin' (Know them ballers lookin')
You a money-makin' pro, ain't no motherfuckin' rookie (Ain't no motherfuckin' rookie)
If a nigga want some nookie, let him know he gotta book it (Uh)

Pull up late just to ride that face
He wanna be down, he respect my chase (Pull up)
That's why I gotta keep a special place for you (Pull up)
'Cause when I'm done in the booth, I'm comin' home to you
