New Lil' Kim freestyle, shout to the whole ATL
Shout to the whole Dirty South
Black Friday man, Big Mike, let's go!
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What they got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
It's tax season and we, comin, to collect

Got racks on racks on racks, just count about a hundred stacks
Just came from the bank, I'm goin right back
Headed to the mall, we gon' spend it all
The Hermes, Louis stall, wood all in my car
Like Blake Griffin I ball, like Chris Paul I ball
Like Carmelo I ball, should be playing in the all star
Cause I'm a rock star, international rock star
No matter where we are, we gon' rep the block
Lace all in my bra, dancin on the bar
We shinin from afar like these rocks in my 
Staying fresh to death VVS's on my neck
It's the IRS, and we all about the checks

YC, what'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
We got (Racks on racks on racks)
S.O.D. (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What they got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What they got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What they got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)

New Bentley GT, my fingers the King
I'm riding through the A, bumping that YC
Racks on racks on racks, money stand tall like Shaq
Still gotta work for the block, still gettin money from the trap
It's the IRS and you know we don't play
If you spittin candy bars then it's fucking Pay Day
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, ayy!
20 bricks apiece, set the whole clique straight
It's more in the oven, we let them pies bake
And this is my party so we all eatin cake
A Rolly apple red now  in my drank
Like Cheddar Boy rapped, I keep a trap boy

YC, what'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
We got (Racks on racks on racks)
S.O.D. (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What they got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What they got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)
What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)

What'chu got? (Racks on racks on racks)Embed
