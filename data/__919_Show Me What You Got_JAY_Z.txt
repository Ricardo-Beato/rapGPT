This is a state of emergency, bitches
What you want me to do? I'm sorry!
I'm back
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey! Uh! (Uh-huh!)
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shorty
Show me what you got, baby
Hands up and waves, and waves (Show 'Em Whatcha Got! Show 'Em Whatcha Got!)
And waves, and waves! Uh! (Show 'Em Whatcha Got!)

Give the drummer some
Shit, I already gave the summer some
It's the winter's turn, Hovi Hov is the coldest
I'm just getting better with time, I'm like Opus One
Young, no two alike like a snowflake
Okay, show me what you got babe
Words is slurring, engine purring
Mami front, but I'm so determined
Shots of Patron, now she in the zone
I ain't talking bout the 2-3
Mami in the zone like the homie two-three
Jordan or James, makes no difference
We all ballin' the same
Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recordin'
Nigga, you might want to fall back from recordin'
Shit, what you write is not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave they may applaud him
But misery, I will assure them
Aww baby, just ignore them
Truth or dare, mami, listen and learn
I got a drop, I just took off the top, it's your turn
You might also like
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! (Uh!)
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shorty
Show me what you got, baby
Hands up and waves, and waves
And waves, and waves! Uh!
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shorty
Show me what you got, baby (Uh, uh!)
Hands up and waves, and waves (Show 'Em Whatcha Got! Show 'Em Whatcha Got!)
And waves, and waves! Uh! (Show 'Em Whatcha Got!)

H.O.V.A., gold bottles of that Ace of Spade
Why even fool with these other guys, they all stingy
All these dudes know how to say is gimme
Gimme some head, gimme some brain
Gimme your number, gimme your name
But if I get one night baby girl, I swear
I'll make you tell these other dudes gimme got you here
I'll take you shopping, take long trips
I'll take the cork off, you can take sips
I'll take you there, take my time
Take your clothes off, you take off mine
Ma, show me what you got
Hovi in the spot, tried to told you I was hot
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap
Get the fuck out the throne you clone, the King's back!
Y'all got less than two months to get y'all thing together
Good luck
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady (Ow!)
Show me what you got, shorty
Show me what you got, baby (Uh, uh!)
Hands up and waves, and waves (Show 'Em Whatcha Got! Show 'Em Whatcha Got!)
And waves, and waves! Uh! (Show 'Em Whatcha Got!)
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shorty
Show me what you got, baby (Uh, uh!)
Hands up and waves, and waves (Show 'Em Whatcha Got! Show 'Em Whatcha Got!)
And waves, and waves! Uh! (Show 'Em Whatcha Got!)
