36 ContributorsNo Charge Lyrics
808 Mafia
Yeah, Super Future
Feel that wave
Yeah, you see what I'm saying?

Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
I'ma give them Xans to you baby, no charge
Give that Perky to you, no charge
I give prescriptions to you, no charge
We gon' have fun baby, no charge
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

I look inside your eyes, I see the same things I'm going through
Tryna take your heart away, you gotta be bulletproof
Trapping Penny Hardaway's, I can take a screen or two
All I do is gravitate, Iâ€™m rolling on the pinnacle
I get in the trenches for this paper each and every day
I go make another hit and then go buy another Wraith
Anytime you see me with some jewelry got it custom made
Most the time you see me, I'm done coolin', bustin' down in Bape
Drop top Spyder, that's in the entourage
Travel places they look at you like an alien
Started off my first check, I bought some David Yurman
Try to give the recipe to you, no charge
You might also like
Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
I'ma give them Xans to you baby, no charge
Give that perky to you, no charge
I give prescriptions to you, no charge
I give prescriptions to you, no charge
We gon' have fun baby, no charge
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

Pyrex and the soda, gave you no charge
Come like a bulldozer on the full charge
Trappers and gamblers that's in my entourage
Trappers and gamblers that's in my entourage
I never did trade, never did one time
Still posted on the corner duckin' one time
I know you still hittin' your BM, nigga time from time
I know you still check your DM from time to time

Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
I'ma give them Xans to you baby, no charge
Give that Perky to you, no charge
I give prescriptions to you, no charge
I give prescriptions to you, no charge
We gon' have fun baby, no charge
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah4Embed
