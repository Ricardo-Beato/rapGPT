5 ContributorsGive Us What You Got Lyrics
Once the Glock go pop, yo' body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, and fuck the cops
Real gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot
Once the Glock go pop, yo' body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, and fuck the cops
Real gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot

Save yourself, we the niggas with them big triggers
Me and D, bringing the pain to you bitch niggas
Imma hit em' with the chopper, man
The only thing that can save his home is an avalanche
Hood Classics
Imma hit em' with the chopper, man
The only thing that can save his home is an avalanche
I just make a phone call, one call, have all yo' domes 
38 with the long barrel, hollow tips hit you, crack a nigga bone marrow
Niggas hating, but I'm still here
Won't hesitate to put a nigga in a wheelchair, or should I say a pine box
I'm runnin deep on your street, with 9 Glocks
And they all got extended clips, pistol grip, pump slip, you get pistol whipped
I make em' take they clothes off, fuck  the pistol, then shoot a nigga nose off
I'm in the hood, I never leave, bustin heads with Jody Breeze
I kill a nigga on the spot, nigga
Fuck the body, cause I'm aimin for the top, nigga

Once the Glock go pop, yo' body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, and fuck the cops
Real gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot
Once the Glock go pop, yo' body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, and fuck the cops
Real gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot

I'm hangin with them real killers, cop pillers and drug dealers
Going tp fill your ass up with bullets up out the Skriller
No questions asked, see, I'm goin blast you off the ripple
Stealing your cash, faster than a hoe can flash you her nipple
I specialise in sweepin up game with Breeze, nigga
Let my dope sizzle, I'm a wizard, a work whipper
Drop is great, so this cake, I can get it quicker
Tryna be slick, I  my rod up a little bigger
I'm blast yo' monkey ass, for thinkin I ain't
Have your brain slide the wall, like some brand new paint
And ride off in some brand new wet, go check, you bet we ain't in nobody debt
If you owe me, Gucci or Jody, we gon' collect
Signed yourself, sure enough we goin have your ass on the stretch
Disrespect the flex, I had them thangs up to your neck
Tecs, AKs, Pumps, these ain't no death threats
Once the Glock go pop, yo' body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, and fuck the cops
Real gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot
Once the Glock go pop, yo' body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, and fuck the cops
Real gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot

I walk around without a bodyguard, cause you niggas is not as hard as you say you was, if you was, you wouldn't have to have a bodyguard
45 by me close, try me hoe, they gon' find your legs on land, but the rest of your lil' body floatin'
Get pumped, imma' put you in the trunk, with the pump
Don't mess with the pump, less you wanna get pumped
And if it had to go down, I ain't scared of a dump, nigga
Leave you in the forest, like your last name Gump, you chump nigga
Jody Breeze and Gucci Mane, pull up in the Gucci van
With 2 or 3 rugers that's what we shootin, man
Hold up, nigga
Bitch, sure enough, nigga
When I'm shootin, I'm aimin' from your throat up, nigga
Cause you haters bout to make me put my Glock in yo' face
Show you pussys what it's really like to ride the wave
So lean back, nigga, I mean that
Nigga, I squeeze back, trigger, cause I'm back, nigga
The bumper same color as the Indiana pacer, man
Redgy getting old, so I'm stickin' with the purple, man
I'm the young thug y'all been dying to hear
If you rich, nigga, let me see you sign yourself
Once the Glock go pop, yo' body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, and fuck the cops
Real gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spot
Once the Glock go pop, yo' body bout to pop, dog
Might as well, go head, give us what you got, dog
Run, you get shot and killed, and fuck the cops
Real gangstas don't plot, we just kill yo spotEmbed
