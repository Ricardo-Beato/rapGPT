20 ContributorsAnything (2006) Lyrics
Listen, uh! Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa

Ooh you so nasty, amateur pole dancing
Come and get this cash from me, they call me Rain Man
She tried to rain dance, money so long it'll drown you girl
Buried under so much stacks
They had to pull back about 50 thou before they found ya girl
I brought book bags of that bankroll, I'm a D-boy, baby they know
I'm an original D-boy, they go bankrupt if they try to keep up
No roof in my car but I got mirrors on the ceiling
I'll spread bread on the bed, ever had sex on a million?
Tell me
You might also like
Listen, uh! Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa

Red light, TLC
Through the left eye, my POV
On the iChat
How's that for computer love? She rolled her eyes back
I'm like, "Ooh you're so nasty"
You turned my Maybach back seat into the Hotel De'Paris
I ain't gotta go down to the go-go
You got a private show that's like Magic City
I got stacks of fifties, I got piles of hundreds
Let's role play, act like you want it
You know, you know you hot like fire
You throw that body, I'll throw them dollars
But not them 1's and not no 5's
Have you ever seen a Grover Cleveland?
That's a thousand dollar bill, baby
Listen, uh! Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa

You know, you know, you hot like fire
As I blow, this dough, you might could retire
Take it slow like Neo, when shots was fired
In the Matrix have patience, got lots of bottles
Rock-a-bye baby Jay-Z got notes like Mariah
Got no 1's got no 5's, my D notes are higher
I'm a D boy, they decoys, they money is lighter
Than Nicole Richie, roll with me, they on a diet baby

Listen, uh! Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce (This is sponsored by the Goodfellas), bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa
U-S-, H-E-R, R-A-, Y-M-, O-N-D, Skateboard P
And the J to the A to the Y to the Z, bitch!
Hehe, woo!
Magic City, Club Rolex, Sueâ€™s Rondevu
And all the amateur strippers, who's in aerobics classes
Try it out at home, it works baby, it work
I can make great, baby
Just put it on the floor baby

Listen, uh! Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know (You hot)
You know, you know, you know
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa2Embed
