57 Contributors730 Lyrics
Hey Quan, where you at?
Bring the money counter
Don't get your motherfuckin' hand hurt, money cut a nigga hand, countin' too much
I'm sorry, we ain't countin' no more, we with it
Rich Gang, millions and billions, nigga
You dig?
(Rich Gang)
Ooh
730, 730
Ooh
730, brazy brazy
Get with me bro
We got London on da Track

These niggas ain't loyal they ridin' with royal
He play I'ma leave him on fire, boil
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma stunt the lil baby, yeah, spoiled
Fuck nigga cannot be blood, he might as well be royal
Blue, shoot up the coupe
Pull up in Audis, the carbon'll smoke the fuck nigga like Snoop
Richie pass Thugga the boot, take off like a troop
Bloods are with me, bangin' twenty-one gun salute
Everything come out your mouth is a fairy, no tooth
IPhones and Blackberries when I pull up and serve you
I might get gangster, pull up to the set and murk too
Nine racks inside of my pockets, same size as my shoes, damn
Still got yams, y'all got grams
I fuck ma'ams, y'all fuck grams
Whoa, why so harsh? Why so dark?
I got lots of white, Bubba Sparxxx
Know your man royal, high as Sequoia
Woah, I got loaded, now I don't know you
Bitch, I'm slime, king cobra (Slime)
I drink sodas, no Coke Cola (Shee)

When I go 730 do not get discouraged (Go brazy, go brazy)

I might go 730 if it's too perfect (Go brazy, go brazy)
Slime these lil' bitches, I slime these lil' niggas
I slime 'em, I slime 'em, I slime 'em all
I'ma still slime your ass out if it's not Percocets, it's just Tylenol
I'ma slime your ass out all by myself, I do not need no help at all (On blood)
Bitches and niggas gon' come and gon' go and I know how to deal with y'all (On blood)
Come and enroll to the YSL school and I swear I'm the principal (Slime)
I do not care if you slime for a dollar and change, it's the principle (Slime)
Send a lil' bitch inside the boy trap, slime him for his utensils (Slime)
And bring it back, slatt, slatt, slatt, woo (Shee)
