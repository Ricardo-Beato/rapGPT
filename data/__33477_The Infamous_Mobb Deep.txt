9 ContributorsThe Infamous Lyrics
Yeah
Just like to thank my mama
Thank you, baby, for cutting me out
Sorry, ma, I know it was hard
Look what you did though, man
And it's poppin' now
(Alchemist)
Smell like money
Smell like millions

Just when you thought it was safe to come out
Infamous all in your face, in your mouth
That's right, niggas best to stay up in the house
Whilst we getting our money for the two thou'
Nigga, P back out in the street, so what now?
Strictly for the ghettos and hoods in your town
Probably got bundles of drugs in your town
Like crack, coke, and dope, remember me now?
Queensbridge, motherfucker, we blow your house down
We the big bad wolves that eat your food, clown
I ain't gotta huff and puff, you know my style
Calm as fuck, I just let my gun wild out
I got cash, motherfucker, I could have you touched
But I'd rather be hands-on with that, son
Certain things, you just gotta perform yourself, son
When I start busting, I don't stop 'til I hit it, come on

Everybody got gangs, everybody got cliques, but they ain't like this (The Infamous)
Everybody can't afford to live the lifestyle of the young, Black, and rich (The Infamous)
You ain't crazy, don't make me show you why they call us this (The Infamous)
We own the streets, who basically control this rap shit?
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit

We got the most gangster shit
Second most biggest projects, we sold the most crack since '86
Don't handle a lot of bricks, but we the most thug
You think you're dirty over there, but we more dirtier
We last more longer than them, more songs than them
More money for us, more broads than them
We get the most love in the streets
I had the most tattoos ever since thirteen
P got the most now, our guns the most loud
With enough bullets to down mostly the whole crowd
We drink the most Henny, yeah, and E&J
Smoke the most weed and that's mostly the haze
Get the most Timb boots kicked on a nigga face
Gotta be the most idiot nigga on the face
Of the Earth to ever let the thought cross your head
That we not the most likely to pop off, kid

Everybody got gangs, everybody got cliques, but they ain't like this (The Infamous)
Everybody can't afford to live the lifestyle of the young, Black, and rich (The Infamous)
You ain't crazy, don't make me show you why they call us this (The Infamous)
We own the streets, who basically control this rap shit?
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit
Right now, I change guns with the season
When I was young, I bought ninja stars on Jamaica Ave, hittin' trees then
Started hittin' trees then
We ran the train on the girls in my family dance school, we was beasting
Little young heathens
I had the Rambo knife, and when I got my first gun, I was cheesing
I couldn't believe it
I had the power of life or death in the palm of my hand, fiending
For people to be scheming
They choose to front on me, then they leave me no choice to start squeezing
And hope they stop breathing
'Cause if they do pull through, in them hospital beds, they'll be squealing
Talking to the D's, man
They don't waste no time, they want answers even if you still bleeding
Homie, I'm on the fleezy
I ain't got time neither, I'm gettin' money off this, it's too easy

Everybody got gangs, everybody got cliques, but they ain't like this (The Infamous)
Everybody can't afford to live the lifestyle of the young, Black, and rich (The Infamous)
You ain't crazy, don't make me show you why they call us this (The Infamous)
We own the streets, who basically control this rap shit?
