Hah
Southside on the track, yeah
1-0-1-7

I'm a cocaine cowboy, got bricks right now, boy
Just call me and then I'm on the way (On the way)
They locked my homeboy down, but I hold my partner down
You know he called me, he good, it's on the way (On the way)
It's on the way (On the way), you in the way (You in the way)
Touch down with yay, rain, sunny, cloudy day (Cloudy day)
No cloudy days (No cloudy days), no rainy days (No rainy days)
Man, I done had my share of motherfucking rain
A lot of pain, a lot of chains
Felt like a slave, all this motherfucking rage (A lot of rage)
I want a change, I made a change
So much 'caine, I'm in Sun Valley hall of fame
I met the twelve, I made her do the walk of shame
I'm Gucci Mane, that's who I was before the fame
These clout chasers tryna come up off my name (On my name)
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame

'Cause you's a lame, you's a lame
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame (You's a lame)
You's a lame, 'cause you's a lame
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame
'Cause you's a lame
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame (Won't even talk to y'all niggas)
'Cause you's a lame, 'cause you's a lame (Taylor Gang)
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame (Uh, yeah)
You might also like
Bitch, you's a lame, look at my chain (Woah)
Nothing but diamonds, I could put you on the game
Your best friend wanna fuck me, that's a shame
But I don't even hit it, she just give me brain
My car insane, got so much change
I made a hundred mil' and never been the same (Goddamn)
I gained everything 'cause I've been through the pain
Now if my day is cloudy, I just make it rain
I keep a hundred bad hoes
Take the smell on my clothes
She hit my phone, said she close
Shop in the store and it's closed (Damn)
I'm only there if it's hoes
They say I'm doing the most
Ever since I've been in first class, I ain't ever went back to coach
Started playing for the team, now bitch, I'm the coach (Ooh)
She ain't like me, see my chain, now the bitches approach (Ooh)
I give her different strokes (Damn)
I put the dick in her throat (Woah)
I get the paper and go (Oh)
I get a mil' and get more, woah, woah

'Cause you's a lame, you's a lame (Goddamn)
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame (Oh my God)
You's a lame, 'cause you's a lame (Hahahaha)
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame
'Cause you's a lame
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame (1017, double M)
'Cause you's a lame (You a lame), 'cause you's a lame (You a lame)
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame (Let's go, nigga)

Brick boy, I'm whipping work up like I'm Nick Gordon
In a purple 9-11, still in a bidding war
Belle Harbor, Neiman Marcus, I bought the fifth floor
Took her shoppin', need it all 'cause fat boy just gettin' more (Me)
Mailman, he keep peelin' a nigga, Pell Grant (Uh)
Pants fell, TEC-9, who wanna deal in? (Bang)
Swimming pool, my shit bigger than at Six Flags
I just flood all on my hundreds with my rich ass (M-M)
Bend over, I got a bitch I pay to wipe my ass
Caught a seizure, I'm the shit, this time I peed my pants
Check his vital signs, I heard he goin' broke
Couple cases of champagne, I hear she snortin' coke

'Cause you's a lame, you's a lame  (Maybach Music)
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame
You's a lame, 'cause you's a lame
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame
'Cause you's a lame
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame
'Cause you's a lame, 'cause you's a lame
Stay in your motherfuckin' lane 'cause you's a lame

'Cause you's a lame1Embed
