27 ContributorsWhew’ Chile Lyrics
This shit sound like motherfuckin' Final Fantasy, goddamn
Zelda, some shit like that
Nintendo 64 type shit, no cap, ha
Go

I don't wanna be friends, that's the old me (Uh-uh), ayy
Diamonds in my ears like anchovies (Ice)
My big brother by my side like Ginobli (Uh-uh, boom)
He a shooter, his percentage just like Kobe (Uh-uh, perfect)
Whew, child (Uh-uh)
She was suckin' my dick like wow (Uh-uh)
Bein' broke never was in style (Uh-uh)
Lil' boy, go get your ass a job right now (Uh-uh)
Uh-uh

Niggas tryna stop my grind
Sixty racks into number nine's (Number nine's)
And I renegade y'all like Columbine (Columbine)
I be paranoid, move wisely (Oh)
Now my brothers got my back like Isley (Oh)
Just like ice box, got my brother's new ice piece (Oh-woah)
Now hundred horses in that whip, it's like lightnin' (Skrrt)
Ooh, so enticing (Oh no)
Got that bitch up on her knees like the dice game
Got the money in a chokehold, no fightin' (No fightin')
Diamonds bitin', I know these niggas hidin'
You might also like
I don't wanna be friends, that's the old me (Uh-uh), ayy
Diamonds in my ears like anchovies (Ice)
My big brother better by my side like Ginobli (Uh-uh, boom)
He a shooter, his percentage just like Kobe (Uh-uh, perfect)
Whew, child (Uh-uh)
She was suckin' my dick like wow (Uh-uh)
Bein' broke never was in style (Uh-uh)
Lil' boy, go get your ass a job right now (Uh-uh)

It's automatic (Auto), transcending (Tran—)
My bitch know that I am back bendin' (Bend)
Rack spendin', Bentley slingin' (Slingin')
Often totin', quick to cause commotion (Commotion)
Rob from my brother like the last time
Play with me, he flashin' red like a stop sign (Frrp)
Fuck a bad bitch, don't care her skin tone like I'm colorblind (Frrp)
Don't make 'em suffer, bro, spare that lil' boy, he ain't know

I don't wanna be friends, that's the old me (Uh-uh), ayy
Diamonds in my ears like anchovies (Ice)
My big brother better by my side like Ginobli (Uh-uh, boom)
He a shooter, his percentage just like Kobe (Uh-uh, perfect)
Whew, child (Uh-uh)
She was suckin' my dick like wow (Uh-uh)
Bein' broke never was in style (Uh-uh)
Lil' boy, go get your ass a job right now (Uh-uh)
Uh-uh
Whew, child (Uh-uh), whew, child (Uh-uh)
Whew, child (Uh-uh), number nine, whew, whew, child (Uh-huh)
Don't go (Uh-uh), whew, child, whew, child (Uh-uh)
Whew, child (Uh-uh), I let it be, whew, whew, child
Whew, child (Let me be), I'm not your friend, don't call me so (Uh-uh, whew, child)
Whew, child (Uh-uh), oh, no, whew, whew child (Uh-uh)
Child (Uh-uh), whew, child (Uh-uh)
Whew, child (Uh-uh), whew, child (Uh-uh)3Embed
