18 ContributorsWake Up Lyrics
I wish I had another chance, another place to die
I wish I had another chance, my life has just begun
Verse 1: 
What you expected from this next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
The lesson from the Smith and Wesson is depressin
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake

I am here, I'm watching you (if I should die before I wake)
Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through (if I should die before I wake)
This, can't be, reality (if I should die before I wake)
Wake up, my dead face, I see (if I should die before I wake)
My dead face, I see, my dead face, I see!

I wish I had another chance, another place to die
I wish I had another chance, my life has just begun

On your mark, get set, when I spark you're wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked wit death
Should I, start your breath or should I let you die
If Biggie start to cry, ask why?
Lyrically, I'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stomped quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I'm punishin
I'm done wit them, son I'm surprised you run wit them
I think they got cum in 'em, 'cause they nothin' but dicks
Tryna blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Man, I smoke hydro, rock diamonds that's slick
Got paid off my flow, ride wit my own click
Take chicks to Cairo, layin wit yo' bitch
I know you prayin' you was rich
You fuckin' prick, when I see you I'ma..

I am here, I'm watching you (if I should die before I wake)
Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through (if I should die before I wake)
This, can't be, reality (if I should die before I wake)
Wake, up, my dead face I see (when I see you I'ma..)
My dead face I see (when I see you I'ma..), my dead face I SEE!!

I wish I had another chance, another place in mind
I would've done shit different if I had time
I wish I had another chance, my life has just begun
I wouldn't have been in no bullshit, I don't have to run
I wish I had another chance, another place in mind
I would've done shit different if I had time
I wish I had another chance, my life has just begun
I wouldn't have been in no bullshit, I don't have to run

I don’t have to run!
I don’t have to run!
I don’t have to run!
I don’t have to run!
When I see you I'm a
I dont have to run!
When I see you I'm a
I dont have to run!
When I see you I'ma.. when I see you I'ma..2Embed
