I'm just tryna get a bag
I need a bag
I need to get a bag
I gotta get a...

I gotta get a bag, I want it bad
I need a fucking bag, I gotta spend that bag
I gotta get a bag, I need it bad
I gotta get a bag, I gotta get a bag
I need to get a bag, I gotta get a bag
I need to get a bag, I gotta get a bag, get a bag
I gotta get a bag
Get it and spend it back
Then I get it back, that's that bag

There that go, that swag, yes
Damn, there go your bitch, ayy, yes
She shaking her ass, ayy, yes
I ain't throw no cash, ayy, nah
I trade you your bitch for some bands, yes
It's me and Ben, I don't got no friends, nah
Get that bag and count it with no hands, yes
Went in the club, walked out, left a damn mess
If you're counting blessings, nigga blessed, yes
If you got a weapon, nigga, blast it
If you smoking Tooka, nigga, pass that
I'm just kidding, I don't wanna hit that

I gotta get a bag, I want it bad
I need a fucking bag, I gotta spend that bag
I gotta get a bag, I need it bad
I gotta get a bag, I gotta get a bag
I need to get a bag, I gotta get a bag
I need to get a bag, I gotta get a bag, get a bag
I gotta get a bag
Get it and spend it back
Then I get it back, that's that bag

I love B-A-G's
I love T-H-C
No L-O-V-E for a T-H-O-T-T (Thotty)
I love B-R-O-W-N slash B-A-G-S
Come through with this chopper, B (Bang, bang)
Just like some T-A-P-S (Bang, bang)
Heard you smoking R-E-G (That dope), I swear I don't need that (No)
I be smoking L-O-U-D, I B-R-E-A-T-H-E that (That dope)
If you got some G-O-A-L-S then you better achieve that
Come through, 3D 4K TV glowin', you gotta see that
Smokin' on this T-O-O-K-A, I cannot breathe, yeah
You smokin' on that F-O-O-K-A and yeah, I see that
I'm ridi'n in my B-E-A-M-A to go get these bag
S-O-S-A-A-L-M-I-G-H-T-Y, he the man (Almighty So')
I gotta get a bag, I want it bad
I need a fucking bag, I gotta spend that bag
I gotta get a bag, I need it bad
I gotta get a bag, I gotta get a bag
I need to get a bag, I gotta get a bag
I need to get a bag, I gotta get a bag, get a bag
I gotta get a bag
Get it and spend it back
Then I get it back, that's that bag1Embed
