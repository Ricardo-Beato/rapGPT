If you illegal with one's that's petty (that's petty)
If you begging me for money that's petty (that's petty)
Small rims on the Chevy that's petty (that's petty)
And you short $80 dollars that's petty (that's petty)
Gucci Mane I can never be petty (Nope!)
VVS bracelet known to look real (Yeeeaaah)
VVS chain known to look real (Yeeeaaah)
VVS frames I am not petty (Nope!)

$10,000 dollar in a old school whip (???)
Chain still blinging, swanging and banging
Niggas going crazy and so are the bracelets
Watch cost faces, I mean faces!
White girl, black girl I am not a racist
Bought the black girl but I'm pimping the white bitch
So Icy boys better turn off the light switch
Brought in all that ice so we shining like a glacier
Crib look bigger than the lips of Fantasia
Doolie hips bigger than the hips of Fantasia
Stupid crazy swag you better ask Fantasia
Tamed her and blazed up, but she like the flavor
(???) booty telling people that I paid her
Hit her, quit her, split her man you know how I played her
(???) old man but it's all gravy
Big mane shawty I can never be petty
You might also like
If you illegal with one's that's petty (that's petty)
If you begging me for money that's petty (that's petty)
Small rims on the Chevy that's petty (that's petty)
And you short $80 dollars that's petty (that's petty)
Gucci Mane I can never be petty (Nope!)
VVS bracelet known to look real (Yeeeaaah)
VVS chain known to look real (Yeeeaaah)
VVS frames I am not petty (Nope!)

60 on the doolie quarter mill for the Ashton
60 on the vette but the rims cost me 10 bands
90 on the (???) cus it's sitting on the grown mans
Old school burning up looking like a murder man
Gucci mane (???) kush it superb man
Tryna see my ex she sell the works
(???) 10 car but that make no sense
(???) car coming cus I need 11
