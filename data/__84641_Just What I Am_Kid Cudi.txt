151 ContributorsJust What I Am Lyrics
I'm just what you made, God, not many I trust
I'ma go my own way, God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga, don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on", she said, "No, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

I (I need) need smoke (Oh, oh, oh, I need)
I (I need) need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I-I wanna get high y'all (Woah)
I-I wanna get high y'all
Nee-need it, need it to get by y'all (Woah, yeah)
Can you get me high y'all? (Hey)
I-I wanna get high y'all
I-I-I wanna get high y'all
Nee-need it, need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all? (Hey)

I'm just what you made, God, just what you made, God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made, God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-nee-need it) I'm just what you made, God
I'm just what you made, God, I'm just what you made, (Mmm)

Let me tell you 'bout my month y'all
Endless shopping, I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don't think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain't wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain't working fam
In-In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray, but if you had my life you'd understand
But, I can't fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We're all troubled in a world of trouble
It's scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I'm what you made, God, fuck yes, I'm so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren't my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Every day to find sane's a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

I (I need) need smoke (Oh, oh, oh, I need)
I (I need) need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I-I wanna get high y'all (Woah)
I-I wanna get high y'all
Nee-need it, need it to get by y'all (Woah, yeah)
Can you get me high y'all? (Hey)
I-I wanna get high y'all
I-I-I wanna get high y'all
Nee-need it, need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all? (Hey)
I'm just what you made, God, just what you made, God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made, God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-nee-need it) I'm just what you made, God
I'm just what you made, God, I'm just what you made (Mmm)

Nee-need it to get by, yeah
