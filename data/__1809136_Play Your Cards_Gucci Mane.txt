7 ContributorsPlay Your Cards Lyrics
Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt

I'm on my hustle, I'm bout my grind
I got a plan to make the whole Atlanta mine
One for the money, two for the show
Three dollars for the soda, I mix it in the coke
I'm icy in the summer, I think I need a coat (burr)
I'll drag you to the river then throw you off the boat
Cold dirty shame, low down dirty games, I use to have them thangs
But now I'm on the screen
Play it how it go, take it how it come
Fuck how you feel cause my feelings numb
Play it how it go, take it how it come
Fuck how you feel cause my feelings numb

Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt

Gucci mane I'm hard to kill
Ain't nobody murkin me
Niggas think they hercules, have they ass in surgery
Viagara flow, cialis verses, ain't nobody hard as me
He may have more money but he'll neva have more heart than me
Its big dog, bulldog, leapfrog, jumpoff
Sawed off pump, nigga this ain't what you want
And we goin all out, all out for the yola
I owe it to the soda
I cut the music down just so I can hear the motor
I open up the sun roof so you can smell the odor
Play your cards right or they'll find you in Dakota
Suckers get trampled, snitches ran over, snitches ran over

Round here you play the cards that you were dealt
I could give a fuck about your feelings or how you feel
I can't see you in my rearview cause you left
I'm so hot I'll touch your bitch and she'll melt
