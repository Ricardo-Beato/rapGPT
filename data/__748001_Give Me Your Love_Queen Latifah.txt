5 ContributorsGive Me Your Love Lyrics
What's this madness in my mind
Never really knew love before this time
Boy you'll take me where I've never been before
Now I what to explore more and more, just

Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love

I'm your woman, you're my man
It doesn't matter if the world can't understand
I know if you stay right here by my side
I'll have no fear, I'll never run and hide just
Captivate my soul, hold me
When I'm down I need your love to console me
Some weakness tells me when the morning comes
It's hard for me to try to see you're not the one
For the love of you, I just might just do most anything
It's the sensation the slightest touch can bring
Baby, I adore you this is not a fling
With every breath I sing for you to
You might also like
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Bring it to me right now, baby
Give me your love, give me your love
Bring your love to me right now
Right now

When I was a very small child
My mother told me
Hold on to the things that you love
And never let them go
Love is too precious to be wasted
And that is why I want you to know

What's this madness in my mind
I never really knew love before this time
Boy you'll take me where I've never been before
Now I want to explore more and more and more

Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
24\7, every minute, every hour
Give it to me and only to me, only me, yeah
Hey-yeah
I want your love right now and i can`t wait
I can`t wait
No love before you, baby
Won`t you bring your love to me?Embed
