3 ContributorsPerfect Plot Lyrics
Uh huh, uh huh
The Mobb comin' through, no doubt kid
Schemin' and layin' with the +Perfect Plot+ (+Perfect Plot+)
We the first ones awoke and the last ones asleep
And that's why we got the drop (got the drop)
Rip shows, hit hoes
I'm the type of nigga that a have your baby father vexed
Whatever you say bounces off of me and right back to you
And if it get back to us then we clappin' you (what do)

Born to be wild, push to the front of the crowd
Top of the pile, state of the art rhymes a hundred miles
I lay down on chocolate clouds
Then pull out and let blow on any clown
Listen to the globe go round
'Cause my silence is the most powerfulest weapon yet found
Hold it down, my tongue that is, I bring the biz, keep it tight
My mouth piece dispense my clips
Fuckin' wit me, the scenery get highly intense
Intelligent, gun buckers, duck fucka, you get bent ova
I'm not signin' out soldier, rocket launcher
Shank musketeer, face carpenter
You need to downshift to slow down kid
Or get surrounded and pounded out, real quick
Hey yo check out what the storm blew in...
You might also like

Check the main attraction of this rap shit
The Infamous slap some shit
On the track and get this whole atlas wide open
And stuck on it, you need to hang it up like a warnin'
Your shit borin', rap be pourin' on your head like its stormin'
Hell fire, Vietnam, your whole outfit get re-rounded
Yo you 'bout it, 'bout it, though I doubt it, doubt it
While you Girl Scout it I be reppin' QB drownin'
Boxes of Heinekens, gin bottles with the handles
Rubber handles, then crack paper
Gettin' flipped to stack paper
The beat's flavor make your pile more greater
Fuck y'all Mobb haters
We got y'all wives on the Beta, while you playin' wit her
We makin' her loose and turned on
She love when the thug is blowin', she get aroused
When I walk around with the gun showin'
The Mobb steady blowin' with this '9-8 shit
Before I had my clip, before I had my clique
A nigga wasn't shit
Y'all niggas wasn't feelin' this shit
Now you hearin' it, get off my dick
Y'all niggas sick like a virus
I wish one of y'all niggas try this...

The Mobb got it locked down
Still heavyweights and it's the VI
New niggas was shook, ain't it ill how we can read eyes?
No stoppin' this, it's approximate that you be coppin' this
Head lockin' shit bring it back where it's suppose to be
Take a dose of this, guarantee cats'll be stuck
Check the QBC just to cop from us
M O B B, make no mistake it's us
Thought it was hashish but the shit was laced with dust
You all fucked up, share the bread, no one to trust
Walkin' the streets with a bag o' choke and it's still Dutch
Rep the 41st side, I hold the title with pride and when it's on
Use the infrared for guide, aim it at your inner
I'm like liquor in the winter, keep it warm, but make things
Extra hot when you enter, fuckin' faggot
Have you hoppin' like rabbits for carrots
No need to yell the name, we already established
 X2
The Mobb comin' through, no doubt kid
Schemin' and layin' with the +Perfect Plot+ (+Perfect Plot+)
We the first ones awoke and the last ones asleep
And that's why we go the drop (got the drop)
Rip shows, hit hoes
I'm the type of nigga that a have your baby mama wet
Whatever you say bounces of me and right back to you
And if it get back to us then we clappin' you (what do)
