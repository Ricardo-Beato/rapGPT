Crazy
Shit crazy
Crazy
Bitch, you ain't the one to have my baby, you crazy (Okay, believe)
Ain't the one to have my baby, you crazy (Lil' bitch, crazy)
Baby, bitch, you ain't the one to have my baby, you crazy (She crazy)
Crazy, crazy (808 Mafia)

I need to smoke some earth, I'm goin' crazy, crazy
Pour a four of Act', I'm actin' lazy, lazy
Had to find my bitch, she actin' crazy, crazy
Bitch, you ain't the one to have my baby, you crazy
I'm a Glo boy, gotta make these niggas hate me, hate me
Flexin' on these niggas on the daily, baby
And I got a K to make these bitches crazy
Got a million ways to make these niggas hate me, shit crazy
