Don Dadaa, uhh, uhh, yeah
You can't see me, but you can feel me
You can feel me, you can feel me

It's the world, famous, supreme team show, supreme team show...
Uhh, look at me

I be the one that you love to hate
I be the one that's from out of state
I be the one with the nickle plate
I be the one with the mean face
I be the one with the bad taste
I be the one that you worry 'bout
I be the one that make ya hurry out
I be the one that make your mama shout
I be the one that's the cleanest (fo' sho')
I be the one with the niggas and guns that's the meanest (let 'em know)

Supreme hustle (uh huh), I got supreme muscle (yep)
I call em team tustle (whatcha call it?)
Supreme hustle (uh huh), I got supreme muscle (yep)

You be the one that we laugh at (ha ha)
You be the one that can't have that (uh uhn)
You be the one to get your ass cracked (crack!)
You be the one that's takin' live rounds
You be the one thats got to run from them bloodhounds
You be the one with the eight babies
My seven ladies, still dressin' like the eighties
You be the one that just checked in emergency
You be the one that's in dire need of surgery

Supreme hustle (uh huh), I got supreme muscle (yep)
I call em team tustle (whatcha call it?)
Supreme hustle (uh huh), I got supreme muscle (yep)
I call em team tustle (yeah yeah)
It's the world, famous, supreme team show, supreme team show...

We be the ones that your fellas hug
We be the ones that you jealous of
We be the ones with the big guns
We be the ones with the six-uns

We be the ones with the dirty spirits
We be the ones with them bomb ass dirty lyrics
We be the ones that your kids like
We be the ones that make you beat your wife
And hate your life (tell 'em)
Supreme hustle (uh huh), I got supreme muscle (yep)
I call em team tustle (whatcha call it?)
Supreme hustle (uh huh), I got supreme muscle (yep)
I call em team tustle (yeah yeah)
