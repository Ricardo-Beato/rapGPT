I'm-I'm-I'm Mi-Mi-Mi-Missy (Yeah!)
Radio play me all the time
Write my own rhymes and I swear I'm fly
This flow here from '83
From a to z you can't fuck wit me (Aww)
Me and Timbaland man I'll be damned
Remember when Lyte was in love wit Sam
I used to be in love wit this guy name Sam
But to me oh my gosh he was one in a million
I came through cause I rock the show
Wack MC's get kicked in the throat
Keep on sleepin' cause you think I'm a joke
Uh, Uh, Uh
Let it bump (Let it bump)

I'm Missy
I'm-I'm
Let it bump (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
Let it bump (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone (Gotta cut the music up man)
I'm Missy
I'm-I'm
Let it bump (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
Let it bump (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone

I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm stupid fresh that's the shit I'm on (come on)
Sucka MC's come new in the game
Swear ya hip-hop you just a new jack swing (uh)
Remember when Chaté was live on stage
Chanté was live on stage
Let me back that shit up
For ya for ya no hip-hoppers
I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm stupid fresh that's the shit I'm on
Sucka MC's come new in the game
Swear ya hip-hop but don't know Daddy Kane
This time Missy rhyme crazy dope
Haters wanna know my antidote
Try to catch up cause ya mind is slow
Uh, Uh, Uh
Let it bump (Let it bump)

I'm Missy
I'm-I'm
Let it bump (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
Let it bump (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone (Gotta cut the music up man)
I'm Missy
I'm-I'm
Let it bump (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
Let it bump (Let it bump)

I'm Missy on the microphone (Gotta cut the music up man)

Me and Timba-Timba-Timba-Timba Timbaland
Me and Timbaland man I'll be damned
(Cut Cut Cut-cu-cu cut the music up man)
(Cut Cut Cut-cu-cu cut the music up man)

Me and Missy come fresh on tracks (oh)
5 albums deep can ya handle that (that)
We came from the basement to platinum plaques (plaques)
We sittin' on something this black on black (oh)
Jimmy D, he's the engineer (neer)
A nigga been down for about 10 years (years)
Fixin' that stuff to make it sound so clear (clear)
Uh, Uh, Uh
Let it bump (Let it bump)

I'm Missy

Let it bump (Let it bump)
