When Ghost threw this rhyme at you
He made up his mind
That every little thing he does
Be designed to entertain you (Yeah)
Ooh (Yeah), his whole life through (That's right)
He's been walking through the rain (Rain)
Until the day he rhymed for you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And the sun came pouring down (Tell 'em, girl)

Ayo, my rolls be Liberace
And my bedroom is off the hook all day, designed by Versace
Y'all just watch me, this is how I blow up
Right when y'all finna leave the joint then I show up
Star-spangled up and my chain got cuts (Uh-huh)
Mr. T looked, saw my shit and went nuts
Starks stays in luck, truck
There's a new gangster in town and he's coming up
Staten Island's capo holds the most info
Crown Royal bottles in the back, blowin' Indo
Fly shit like Curtis Mayfield and his intro
Throw this in your whip, convinced? Your tints blow
Yo, I kick the ill rhymes like this
Y'all niggas really never wrote rhymes like this
C'mon, stop frontin' at a time like this
Pretty Tone in the house, you better hide your bitch
You might also like
Ghost Showers, just a sign of the power
You feel in you, oh, baby
Ghost Showers, got you by the hour
You're dancing, too, oh, baby

Behind the wall action, barely spaghetti jewels
Machetes for y'all, little Debbie say "I bet he do"
Big bellies to big tellies, Jim Kelly's, we flip cellies
It's Lils, dusted out heavy in the big Chevy
(Kick the ill rhyme) Nah, nah, I said it before
I keep the club moist, ladies throw they panties on the floor
Action, Atlantic City lights, main attraction
Slick talk, jiggy at the door, got the gat in

Ooh, you know that rhyme from him (Yeah, c'mon, we 'bout to slow this down right about know and)
Makes your day worthwhile (You know, wait for the drop to come back in and all that and, uh)
It takes your day that's sad and blue (C'mon baby girl, sing that, uh, c'mon, didn't y'all like that?)
On a ride to a far away moon (C'mon, didn't y'all like that? Yeah, say what, say what, say what)
On that dark and troubled sea (Uh, ma', that's right now)
Ghost showed you the light (Tell y'all, didn't I tell y'all, didn't I tell y'all, didn't I tell y'all?)
And now you're dancing so fast and so free (Uh huh, ayo, hold on, I got you baby)
They're leaving stormy skies behind (Check it, I run it back with you, boo, come on, let's go, here we go now)
Yo, who got the biggest burner?
Ask the Terminator, Wes Snipes shit plus Ghost meets Vegas
Stage show magician, dip with with a bunch of candy (Uh-huh)
I got a lot of babies, y'all ain't family
If y'all don't hear me, y'all don't feel me
My album is bulletproof, y'all can't kill me
In 2003 the lease is up
We on the block now, no need for y'all re-in' up
Pop your seat up, chop the weed up, excuse me if I'm horny
No doubt, I might knock the beat up
Florence style, all up on the set freezed up
All player haters get Swiss cheesed up
Motherfucker, if you with me, throw your hands up
Look, money at the bar, pick your man up
Me and Reese Piece is like diamonds in the rough
I need Viacom money but rhymin' ain't enough

Ghost showers just a sign of the power (Yo, Starks Enterprise, yeah, c'mon)
You feel in you, oh baby (Theodore, yeah, Theodore Unit, uh-huh)
Ghost showers got you by the hour (Yeah, that's right, you heard? Party motherfucking people, yeah)
You're dancing, too, oh baby (Yeah, catch on, it's like that)

Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go, go now from here? (Where do we go, motherfuckers?)
Straight up, nothin' but the top, bitch
Ghost showers got you by the hour, holding you, taking you, blessing you, oh, baby (Yeah, that's right, that's my shit)
This shit make you wanna go, yo
Heel-toe real close, heel-toe real close
High flow it, high back, hop, hop, hop, word
You know what I mean? Might gotta double that, know what I mean?1Embed
