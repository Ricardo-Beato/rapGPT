Damn, that's how you're dealin' with me, damn
Damn, that's how you're, that's how you're

Who the fuck is that? It's a disguise
You ain't who I thought I recognized
Twenty thousand pound on your rent

I don't like you tellin' just one side (Shit I don't like)
I don't like the fact you never cry (Shit I don't like)

And we gon' be givin' away some Drake tickets as well
You know he comin' to the H-Town to tear the roof off that motherfucker
