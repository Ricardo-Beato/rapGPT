17 ContributorsWe Are Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah
Yay, Young Thug, bitch
ROC Crew, bitch

These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, Tar'
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shinin', star
Baby, we are, baby, we are

I'm a coach, I keep a red flag
Twenty-twelve 'Cat, Big copped the red Jag'
And I be in the coochie with Lil' Mikey and Big Smash
And I promise you can't stare at my jewelry, it's like a flash, ugh
You square like a graduation cap
And I guess I'm on a Six Flags ride 'cause I'm strapped
And the house is very large, you can spot it on the map
And the racks so very big so we keep 'em in the knap'
Sack, I am not whack
Please bring it back like I sent you to go get it
But don't come quickly like I sent you 'round the city
And if a nigga play he get beats, Nitti, ugh
And I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of money
Which is the opposite of what you thinkin' which is a whole lot of nothin'
And y'all niggas doin' a whole lot of frontin'
But when I'm gunnin', man, you know I do a whole lot of bunnin'
You might also like
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, Tar'
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shinin', star
Baby, we are, baby, we are
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, no Tar'
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shinin', I'm a star
And we are, baby, we are

I'm so better than y'all, I mean all of y'all
Jump up and knock your ass over like a volleyball
Or I'll knock your ass down like a bowling pin
And this is Ace of Spades, that's a bowling pin
Boy, we came to win and y'all beginnin'
I left the club, they still swimmin', you and your women
And y'all still rentin', we steady buyin', bitch
And I bought a hundred watches, can't waste my time, bitch
Girl, you ain't a dime, bitch, you can't get a dime, bitch
Get off of my line, bitch, but it'd be a crime, bitch
Yup, I will have your mommy cryin', bitch
And she be actin' like a fan, so I hit her with that iron, bitch
And I've been wrappin' a whole lot of dummies
No friends sellin' but I been servin' a whole lot of dummies
You can call me fan 'cause I'm blowin' a whole lot of money
And your jewelry is cheesy, you got on a whole lot of sunny
And these niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, Tar'
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shinin', star
Baby, we are, baby, we are
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, no Tar'
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shinin', I'm a star
Shit, we are, okay

I might be crazy
Kick the front door in and fuck your old lady
Kidnap your baby
"Bitch, where them racks at?"
By the way shouts out to Rackset, private jet
I ball hard and I ball smart
Which means I flood the club, lifeguard
You gon' need a lifeguard 'cause I'm at your throat, ho
And you need an extra band, can't rob me solo
I'm smokin' indo', I will leave you outdoors
With the dogs, bye, bye, y'all
I shot him up and watched him shrink and run, micro crawl
Then I picked him up and chopped him up, hello, hogs
And you been thinkin' about a whole lot of nothin'
Which is the opposite of what I'm thinkin' which is a whole lot of money
And y'all niggas doin' a whole lot of frontin'
But when I'm gunnin', man, you know I do a whole lot of bunnin'
And these niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, Tar'
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shinin', star
Baby, we are, baby, we are7Embed
