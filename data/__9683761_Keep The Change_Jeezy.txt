8 ContributorsKeep The Change Lyrics
Tell them niggas, "Keep the change"
Expectin' somethin' less of you, nigga, would be insane
I always thought the best of you, nigga, so this a shame
Open up another bottle, gotta charge it to the game
Tell them niggas, "Keep the change"
Expectin' somethin' less of you, nigga, would be insane
You went out like the rest of them niggas and that's a shame
Put it on my black card, gotta charge it to the game (Let's go)

Seen the writings on the wall
Did everything for that nigga, I bought him drawers (Damn)
Takin' carе a grown-ass man, I ain't your daddy (Nah)
Livin' in my shit rent-free, this ain't your addy (Haha)
You know what the fuck time it is, I bought that watch, nigga (Ayy)
You ain't еven had no motion, I upped your stock, nigga (Nah)
Yeah, you was a nobody, nigga, nobody knows you
Never did nothin' for nobody, nigga, nobody owes you (Yeah)
And what about the time the feds froze all my chips?
I was payin' for your condo, you left with all my shit (Shit)
Where my main man at when I was at my lowest? (Lowest)
That coward skipped town on me when I was at my poorest (Damn)
Look at fat boy runnin', know he need to hit the gym
He thought my run was over (Nah), but I am not one of them (Yeah)
You lookin' real stressed, better get your shit together ('Gether)
They asked you how I'm doin', tell that pussy, "Never better"
Yeah
You might also like
Tell them niggas, "Keep the change"
Expectin' somethin' less of you, nigga, would be insane
I always thought the best of you, nigga, so this a shame
Open up another bottle, gotta charge it to the game
Tell them niggas, "Keep the change"
Expectin' somethin' less of you, nigga, would be insane
You went out like the rest of them niggas and that's a shame
Put it on my black card, gotta charge it to the game (Let's go)

Knew he shouldn't have been trusted
That's why you out here lookin' all dusted and disgusted
See, karma is a ho, nigga, life is a bitch
Niggas left me for dead, they forgot to dig the ditch (Haha)
Bounced back, you see me out here livin' on they ass
Niggas stuck in '05, they still livin' in the past (Ayy)
Sad part about it, nigga used to be my brother
Daddy should've wore a rubber, you old jealous motherfucker (Yeah)
Stuck to my side, should've known that you was leechin'
But I was thinkin' with my heart, didn't practice what I'm preachin'
No accountability, can't blame me for everything
'Cause they ain't wanna see you shine, I bought each and every chain
Just a hatin'-ass crew and a real-ass boss
They ain't make it 'cause they ain't make it, yeah, that's real-ass talk (Yeah)
Since you actin' like a bitch, I'ma treat you like one
And next time I see you, I'ma greet you like one, nigga
Tell them niggas, "Keep the change"
Expectin' somethin' less of you, nigga, would be insane
I always thought the best of you, nigga, so this a shame
Open up another bottle, gotta charge it to the game
Tell them niggas, "Keep the change"
Expectin' somethin' less of you, nigga, would be insane
You went out like the rest of them niggas and that's a shame
Put it on my black card, gotta charge it to the gameEmbed
