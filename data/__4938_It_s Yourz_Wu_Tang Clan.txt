81 ContributorsItâ€™s Yourz Lyrics
Machine-gun rap for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flash stacks
See through yellow lines, rock a fly jersey in the summertime, God
Magic marker rap, bleed Benetton
Relaxed, wrote this, comin' at you crab-ass culprits
Snatch your ice off, chillin' in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feelin' like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris?
Melodic single, darts snap a nigga just like fish
You fucked up, some rich niggas you done test, yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggas pulled up your 'dress
Style, molest that, Canal chain, nigga, where your vest at?
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo
Saddam Hussein niggas, light the torch, we flamin' niggas
Autograph that, flatten all the main niggas

(It's yours) The world in the palm of your hand
(It's yours) Twenty-three million of useful land
(It's yours) The seed and the black woman
(It's yours) Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(It's yours) Yo
(It's yours)
You might also like
Super freak physique like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf every day of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the la, smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hellbound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultraviolet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, stop your breathin', it's huntin' season
Honey eye-ballin' down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws 'cause tonight, it's yours

Yo, stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them camps better revamp their shit or get blamped
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your skull like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands, bitch, the RZA
I stand close to walls like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels, blast off like roman candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog
It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact'll blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit, explicit
I crystallize the rhyme so you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off the shit like bricks of C-4

(It's yours) The world in the palm of your hand
(It's yours) Twenty-three million of useful land
(It's yours) The seed and the black woman
(It's yours) Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(It's yours)
(It's yours)
(It's yours)

Check out my beaver, baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the Garden gettin' skied, row eight
We hold a belt, son, that's my word
Spot a rapper, run him down, throw him out in the third
Yo, check it, I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smokin' estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go, flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of rap politic with Sade
Avengin' eagle crooks, rock the W and Spiegel books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through and stopped your whole juks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearin' the news like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times, watch the room
Sexy girl love the shit out the song, now watch her water break
(It's yours) The world in the palm of your hand
(It's yours) Twenty-three million of useful land
(It's yours) The seed and the black woman
(It's yours) Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(It's yours)

(It's yours)10Embed
