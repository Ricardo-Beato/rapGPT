The streets signed me
(Taurus, Taurus)
I gotta remind you, I never liked you
In the streets, nigga
I love you

Streets turnin' boys into men
Take several down, lock it in
Got a stash spot in Lauderdale
Pay you off before I shot and kill
Drive them up the trenches, it ain't fair
I throwed 'em away, didn't give it one wear
I met her on sight, she got clapped
I was playin' with a check before I rapped

Treatin' this music like I'm sellin' keys
Off the thermometer, one thous' degrees
Young nigga 'round me, slimy and greasy
I bought her diamonds, she keep it a secret
Knock your shit down, you know I'ma agree with it
Take off flyin', goin' off a G6
I got that cooler with me when I'm whippin'
Rollin' with demons when I'm in your city
Couple of pink toes gettin' nasty
Send all the Fentanyl to Cincinnati
Gone on a mission, niggas ain't really havin' it
Like I got a fishin' rod, that bitch bite
Whole lotta racks on me be precise
Lil' one gon' whack somethin' when they bitin'
We been on demon time, say I'm nice
Ain't been gettin' no sleep, I'm outside
Kick down the doors in some Dior Dior
Put double numbers on the billboards
I take the flowers, we gettin' awards
Too many shoot-outs, I was paranoid
Young nigga poppin' off anywhere
Catch up and spray, nigga, anywhere
I gotta make sure I ante up
'Cause I'm in touch with the mob
A goonie ready, yeah, she anywhere, Jada finish up the job
But to the hood I'm a god
I did residentials, I was loitering
Just another product of poverty
Hit them niggas up, no recovery
I had Benjamins, Frank callin' me
Got them demons with me, ain't no argument
Swappin' out my pain with Givenchy
Forever wish death on all my enemies
The minute I was born, I was sinnin'
Chasin' a hundred billion, that's just the beginnin'

Streets turnin' boys into men
Take several down, lock it in
Got a stash spot in Lauderdale
Pay you off before I shot and kill
Drive them up the trenches, it ain't fair
I throwed 'em away, didn't give it one wear
I met her on sight, she got clapped
I was playin' with a check before I rapped

Streets turnin' the boy to a millionaire, ayy, yeah
Took all the struggle from the game and it got me here
Drinkin' on muddy, smokin' herb by the pound, ooh, ooh
Wish I could fall in love but she been ran through
Who the flyest?
Ain't no goin' back and forth, ain't no debatin' with me
Keepin' the drum on me
Gotta keep fifty brothers for my many men
These streets they prepared a nigga for everything
Everything I ever wanted in my life
I hustle and I'm grindin' up to earn it full
For the Bugatti, sign me up
Charge one thousand just to line 'em up, line it up

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Young nigga pop (Young nigga pop)
Catch up and spray (Catch up and spray)
I gotta make sure I aim (I gotta make sure I aim)
Woo
Goonies ready to
Just the finishin' (Just the finishin')
Hood (Hood)
Pluto (Pluto)
Catch another b—(Catch another b—)
Hit 'em up (Hit 'em up)
I call (I call)2Embed
