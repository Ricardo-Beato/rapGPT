Now, look here (Now, look here)
I wasn't gon' do it at first (Do it at first)
I wasn't even gon' come to the metaverse (Come to the metaverse)
But, I mean (But, I mean)
We goin' apeshit crazy (Shit crazy)
I mean, I mean (I mean, I mean)
Haha (Haha)

One, two, three, four, please turn the beat on
Baseline so fine, young nigga, spit it
Turnt up, turnt on, came to get my party on
Like that, right back, like that, and hit it
Smoke on, looks on, everybody's in the place
On a case, in your facе, nigga, we bored apes
Pink coat, mеan mug, show love
On a real, five bills, that's what it does

Boy, does she love the way that I rock
On the mic, crust on, 'cause I rock it this way
Make up, take up, break up and shake up
Take a fat puff from Dr. Bombay

If you feelin' like I'm feelin', then you feelin' high (Feelin' high)
If you feelin' like I'm feelin', then you feelin' high, woo (Feelin' high)
You might also like
Timin' is everythin', so is rhymin'
I done done everythin' except went diamond
So now it's time for the unwindin'
Steady grindin', yeah, you know I'm shinin'
Ten toes down with nothin', that's for sure
You spit your game and she said "No"
So I slid up on her and she hand me her vape
She said she'd rather spend time with a bored ape

Boy, does she love the way that I rock
On the mic, crust on, 'cause I rock it this way
Make up, take up, break up and shake up
Take a fat puff from Dr. Bombay

If you feelin' like I'm feelin', then you feelin' high (Feelin' high)
If you feelin' like I'm feelin', then you feelin' high, woo (Feelin' high)

Oh, boy (Oh, boy)
OpenSea (OpenSea)
So G (So G)
This is produced by Nicolechi (Nicolechi)
Uh (Uh)
So funky (So funky)
So chunky (So chunky)
Itch that monkey (That monkey)
It's a bored ape (Bored ape)Embed
