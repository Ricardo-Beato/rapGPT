Dog

Remember one time, dog, this fiend owed the boss
Put peanut butter on her pussy, let his pits lick it off
Back when I was living on Flanders
Seen another dope fiend beat another with a hammer
Remember at the park, seen a nigga at the payphone
Got rocked in his dome, Mama picked me up and ran home
Was like fucking seven years old
When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove
Damn near burned his top lip off, so my mind ticked off
Desensitized to a lot of things, mind would drift off
Wish it was what I seen on TV
I snapped out of that, unc' beating on my auntie
Gunshots outside was sorta like fireworks
We know they ain't fireworksâ€”it's December 21st
Cold winter with a kerosene heater
On the couch, so cold, can't take off your sneakers

And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen, nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen, nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen

I feel like a prisoner of war
Reacting sporadically to what the mind absorb
Probably need a shrink, can't get a wink
So I smoke a lot of kush and pop a Xanax to sleep
Close my eyes, look up, fiend said, "One for eight"
Can tell that I scared him by the look on my face
Reached in my pocket, served him, nervous as a surgeon
Can't believe where I'm at, 'posed be writing verses
Heard a knock at the door, 'nother fiend wanted four
Gave him what he came for, told him, "Go to the store
Let me get a box of Swishers, Faygo Cola"
Gave his ass another stone, now, guess what? It's over
He ain't coming back
Before I could look back, I heard the wood on the door crack
And they yelling, "Police!"
With this work up in my jeans, man, this a bad dream

And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen12Embed
