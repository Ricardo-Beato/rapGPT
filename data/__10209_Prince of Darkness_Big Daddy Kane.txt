5 ContributorsPrince of Darkness LyricsIntro:
Give it here... uhh
Mic testing one two
Right about now I wanna have a little fun with this
And just talk a little bit of junk ya know
Be-because it's OK, ya know, it's OK to brag and boast
From time to time, ain't nothin wrong with that
So I'm gonna have a little fun with it
Check the Prince of Darkness y'all, here we go

Four times for your mind the poetically inclined
Genuine and divine can still climb
When you thought that I wouldn't go the length
But I cut my cameo and I still got strength
So make room cause I'm sweepin up like a broom
Cause I'm the straight up wholly original yeah that's right mmm hmm
To be blunt and lay my cards on the table
You'll be Gone With the Wind for messin with Dark Gable
In comes the era of the chocolate types
Like your Bobby Brown, Aaron Hall and Wesley Snipes
Including myself in the cipher the Big Daddy Kane is a part of it
AKA, your prince of darkness

When it comes to the girls they know the program
Cause when I get through it's pure Silence of the Lambs
So ladies grab a hand and join the caravan
That's bein ran by the hoochie cooche man
Then don't miss a breath of my kiss of death
An A plus in lust while your boyfriend is a F
I come tellin you Tales From the Darkside
And seperate the men from their women like Apartheid
You say am I a, vam-pire
That will react to ya just like Blacula
But when I say Prince of Darkness I don't mean a bloodsucker
I'm talkin about a black lover
So mysterious and serious the women are curious
So when I walk inside of a place it's like "Ooh, there he is!"
But slow down, there's enough of me to go 'round
Huh, I'm givin girls more Temptations than Motown
And tonight's the night for me to get right
And give girls the feeling of love at first bite
So here's a lesson of what the don art is
Taught by the big you know, Prince of Darkness
You might also like
Stop, hold up, pause, quit
Change the groove and funk it up a little bit
Now back to the subject of how the
Kane became the bigger modern day mama wild deep
Now the question is do I really carry it
Huh, well baby I swing low like sweet chariot
Still a few of them thought that I was lame
And then the big brown shah came!
So let me send a dark shadow right through ya
To prepare you for all of the kniky things I'm gonna do to ya
And yes my dear if you got the goods
Then you might just see my face up in your neck of the woods
Ahh word life y'all, a word life y'all
That's how I, shoot off arms just like a rifle
So just, pass the mic and let me spark this
So you can say that it's been blessed by the Prince of DarknessEmbed
