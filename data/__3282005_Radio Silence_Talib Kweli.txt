11 ContributorsRadio Silence Lyrics
I know, we back
We home, let’s go
I know, we back
We home, let’s go!
Check it out

Born this way
The universe wasn’t formed in a day
Praise the Lord and pray
We the children of God, better learn how to walk this way
Try to walk with faith but it’s hard, what more could I say?
I feel I’m cursed so I talk this way
Gotta write what I’m livin’ in graffiti
It’s the hood hieroglyphics so I’m lookin’ for a wall to spray
You could picture me rollin’, you could picture me holdin’
You could never picture me foldin’
Refuse to beholden to your racist image of a Black man
Kiss my entire colon
Great mind, even though the legacy is stolen
It’s all for the silver and gold
You can tell you in the ghetto from the litter in the road
Man this middle-of-the-road shit really getting old
Which one is the real you? I don’t know, it’s still you
How can I tell if you under a spell? Did the fake you kill you?
Better pass the mic in the afterlife
If so, let me spit flows, good enough to offer to God as a sacrifice
Born again like I passed away, castigated for being honest
Caught bail like a castaway, cause I feel like I’m swimmin’ on an island
When I’m gettin’ introspective: that’s radio silence
When I’m fuckin’ up program directives: that’s radio violence
You might also like
You were the one who wants to slow me down
I’m a criminal when you’re around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to unplug me?

Born this way, woke up like this
The midpoint between science and religion
Is tryna find out what the meaning of life is
October 3rd, '75, my birth is a blessing
Ain’t no spoken word could ever describe how the flow get better
I live on the edge, I’ll send you a postcard
Fuck a phone, I got a chip on my neck that’s a close call
Turn the lights off, see how we glow in the dark
Or we growin’ apart or tryna survive the flood like we in Noah’s Ark
We battin’ down the hatchets and we set sail
Tryna get far away from inhalin’ them chemtrails
My intel says they makin’ people out of the stem cells
The gun's our sunflower seed, we love to spit shells
When them super soakers get let off, it don’t end well
"I ain't know you like to get wet, dawg", like Denzel
They hype it up like marketers, sparklin’ like a fish scale
'Til you chasin’ a high like Captain Ahab after that big whale
It’s criminal
You were the one who wants to slow me down
I’m a criminal when you’re around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to unplug me?


Born this way, Capricorn, L.A. on the day of January 15
Dr. King, his dream torn from a warm womb formed from the clay, existing
Shifting from the essence, uplifting in the presence, just drifting, gifting
Through this mortal coil, with mystic lessons from the sage
California spoiled a blessing, blissed up, my first breath in outer space
I kissed death in the face, no identity complex, it gets left in its place
I’m proud to say, no aborted torment to my rejection
Miffed, dismayed and somewhat befuddled
I struggled to hustle and come up when the blood corpuscle boils
I'm pressin' issues, it's business that's mixed with pleasure
It's plizness to play and get paid during this clone war for DNA
You should know more about the donors confessing my doula from prenatal
I'm off fire, water, elixir of liquor with soft or hardcore drugs in my system
Sicker desire to be delivered wisdom, pour black, white sexy texture of lovers
Like jungle fever, wild zebras to make this fetus, brother
The son of my father, I want to hear my one Shawki and my daughter Aja
Lecture selections in musical meters in physics, you should explore and visit more
Exquisite shores and districts, take a breather
Believe in your epic eye memory, you are descendant of natural leaders
Extended from before the Nephilim, Bethlehem, even Eden
And new testaments, Heaven-sent, energy, books, messages read them
Scriptures, look at the various sizes of giants in Egyptian pictures
Stonehenge endured the mathematics of Mayans and megalithic structures
Evidence frequencies Vedas, we're just the latest reproduction
Created out of pure star dust and made in his image but God is greatest!Embed
