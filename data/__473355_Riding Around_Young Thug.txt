11 ContributorsRiding Around Lyrics
Yung LA
These Thugger Thuggers know
I gotchu brodie
I'm with you

Baby girl want a 12 play, shop a lot and get it on the stairway
I don’t want to fuck I want that damn face
Pass her to my brodie John Elway
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA

Headband​, gas, weed stuffed in my swisher
Imma get your girl, drill her, hit her, then flip her
After that, dismiss her I won’t call her, call her, call her
Look at all these chains on my collar, collar, collar
Trap , like Mike Jordan fadeaway
Moonwalk like MJ, Forgiato made wheels skate
More money, more hoes, more clothes
More shows, more chicks, more weed
More flight, get piped, got molly on spite, more plain, more Gs

Baby girl want a 12 play, shop a lot and get it on the stairway
I don’t want to fuck I want that damn face
Pass her to my brodie John Elway
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA

I'ma pull a Thugga stugga, LA, Leland Austin
Pockets stuffed with stanking weed, creek, no Dawson
Imma head pleasers, 3d, with scotty and scottys
Look at my iPhone 5, missed call from Miley
I be riding round with whatever lay
I don’t play with Thugga, hit you in your face
Fuck around the car, had a Phantom bang
Now I’m two stepping like a Cadillac
DK, DK, DK, got a K, gon spray anyway
DK geeked up, geeked up, can’t see you through my shades

Baby girl want a 12 play, shop a lot and get it on the stairway
I don’t want to fuck I want that damn face
Pass her to my brodie John Elway
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA
T H U G G E R-eh
I’m gonna pull up on her and slaughter your daughter
I’m gonna pull up in Bentley, and hop out and hop on martyr
I’m gonna eat it, beat it, eat it, beat it, I’m smarter
I just seen my dope come up out the baby’s nose
Aaliyah, Imma rock the baby’s boat
How can you take grammys of the Miley and don’t smoke
I think they’re the reason you call me Lil Pacquiao
No fish filet, I told lil mamacita I don’t fuck with fake
She fuck me too fast, I just call it race
I'ma turn to Christian like I’m fucking Ma$e
Blah!

Baby girl want a 12 play, shop a lot and get it on the stairway
I don’t want to fuck I want that damn face
Pass her to my brodie John Elway
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA
I be riding round here with LA4Embed
