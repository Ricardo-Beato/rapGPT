(What Juicy say? He be like, "Shut the fuck up")
Real hot girl shit
Ah
We outside
Ayy

I got every purse, every color, shout out to my ex-nigga
Thinkin' 'bout what I want now from my next nigga
Same background, now them bitches know I'm stayin' with you
Flew me out to Turks just to flirt, we ain't takin' pictures
We can keep it low, nobody gotta know
If you ain't wanna pimp, then what you fuckin' with me for?
I know them other bitches probably say they ain't like other bitches
But I guarantee it's something 'bout me that be breakin' niggas

I ain't for the streets, 'cause bitch, I am the street
And I ain't on these niggas, all these niggas be on me
And I'ma be outside 'til I don't wanna be
And I'ma show this ass 'cause it's what they wanna see, look
I ain't for the streets, 'cause bitch, I am the street
And I ain't on these niggas, all these niggas be on me
And I'ma be outside 'til I don't wanna be
And I'ma show this ass 'cause it's what they wanna see, ayy

Put the car in my name so I know it's real
Buy me the same chain that you got when you say, "Let's chill"
I know how much that cost, them diamonds in your mouth
I told him buy the house, but don't be comin' in and out
Baby, can you tell me have you ever heard of polygamy?
It's only me and you, but I got many personalities
Sometimes I like to shop, sometimes I like to bop
Sometimes I like it from the back, sometimes I be on top
I keep tellin' niggas

I ain't for the streets, 'cause bitch, I am the street
And I ain't on these niggas, all these niggas be on me
And I'ma be outside 'til I don't wanna be
And I'ma show this ass 'cause it's what they wanna see, look
I ain't for the streets, 'cause bitch, I am the street
And I ain't on these niggas, all these niggas be on me
And I'ma be outside 'til I don't wanna be
And I'ma show this ass 'cause it's what they wanna see

I checked your bitch out and she basic, that's why she hatin'
She rock designer, but it's old, that shit is dated
I'm rockin' new runway Gianni, Versace hottie
And anything that come behind me is fuckin' sloppy (Ah, ah, ah)
Every day I switch it up, I give 'em looks (Looks)
I switch my hair up just to fuck, we be havin' fun (Havin' fun)
I ask him do he want a blonde? Do he want a redhead? (A redhead)
I can switch my shit to blue or I can wear my real hair
I keep tellin' niggas
I ain't for the streets, 'cause bitch, I am the street
And I ain't on these niggas, all these niggas be on me
And I'ma be outside 'til I don't wanna be
And I'ma show this ass 'cause it's what they wanna see, look
I ain't for the streets, 'cause bitch, I am the street
And I ain't on these niggas, all these niggas be on me
And I'ma be outside 'til I don't wanna be
And I'ma show this ass 'cause it's what they wanna see
Ah, ah
