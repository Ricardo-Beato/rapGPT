Okay, this right here ain’t for everybody
I heard y'all was talking, I don't care about it
I could give a fuck 'bout what the fair amount is
Damn right, hopping on the AM flight
She gon' say I'm right, she the bigger person
I don't get the same vibe from you when in person
I don't get the same vibe 'cause you been imperso-
-natin', y'all can't, take it, I'm gon', take it, uh
Ay, welcome to the winners circle
And we balling on these pussies, y'all just intramural
Said she tryna' pull up, she gon' split the purple up
Told her don't be tryna' f-k me till you get the verbal "yes" from me
And I know they tryna' come for me
When I sign the check, all I ever put is 100s
I can't fall in love if I think you want the funds from me
‘09 Young Money, how I’m going dumb, dummy
(Oof)

Going stupid in this bitch
And she came in with her friends, y'all should loosen up a bit
She ain't used to getting lit like this
It's okay, me neither, I'm slizzed
Righteous, that's just how it feels every time she ride it
She said like this, I said yeah let's do it just like this
You might also like
All your friends is goin' out
Fill the club with teenage love
Screamin' songs and smells of drugs
Oh, oh, oh
I can tell you're tryna' go
We should spend some time alone, yeah
We should spend some time alone
Oh, oh, oh

I need some
I need some solitude with ya'
I got all type of things that I been tryna' do with ya'
Keep it honest I ain't tryna' screw with ya'
But I'm tryna' screw though
Get it fine tuned with ya'
And I'm feeling like I might just  made a mistake
I don't really listen what the kids say
Make ‘em do a spit-take
Can't believe what y'all been seeing
Play this in The Colosseum
And it's, going up
Talk a lot, don't know enough
Spent my adolescence wondering when the girls are showing up
And, sure enough, they finally pulling up
You must think I'm on some stupid shit
You tryna' pull a stunt on me
On I, it's gon' be, a long time ('fore I fall for it)
And I'm balling like a small forward
Asked her could she get on all fours, said she all for it
Going stupid in this bitch
And she came in with her friends, y'all should loosen up a bit
She ain't used to getting lit like this
It's okay, me neither, I'm slizzed
Righteous, that's just how it feels every time she ride it
She said like this, I said yeah let's do it just like this

All your friends is goin' out
Fill the club with teenage love
Screamin' songs and smells of drugs
Oh, oh, oh
I can tell you're tryna' go
We should spend some time alone, yeah
We should spend some time alone
Oh, oh, oh

Going stupid in this bitch
And she came in with her friends, y'all should loosen up a bit
She ain't used to getting lit like this
It's okay, me neither, I'm slizzed
Righteous, that's just how it feels every time she ride it
She said like this, I said yeah let's do it just like this
She ain't used to
She ain't used to
She ain't used to gettin' lit
She ain't used to
She ain't used to
She ain't used to gettin' lit
She ain't used to
She ain't used to
She ain't used to
She ain't used to gettin' lit
