9 ContributorsTell â€™em That Lyrics
I did a show in Macon, said that I couldn't go in there
Pulled up with ten Memphis killas with pistols everywhere
Probation violation shit, must had to stay in there
But if they knew about my life I'd get the electric chair
Uhhhhhhhhhh
A Gucci party 10,000 for our section in there
(Shhh) Watcha call them for they just might run in there
You know I'm running dope dont  money squares
You know I fuck with real niggas, dont fuck with randoms or squares
I can buy and pay, I got pale guaps
And I buy the drop, and coming out hip hop
I'm a trap-rapper and I'm bringing it back
Gucci Mane, I kidnap rappers
Trap God, Trap Lord, Trap Boy, I trap hard
20 chains they all rock, a thousand pounds my old watch

They say Guwop back
He snatched a pack and he finna get his money back
Dont tell em that, dont tell em that
They say my trap house roll so hard
I might not even need my door attached
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Dont bring your bitch, she double bag
She seen me when I served a pack
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Remember way back in the trap
When I would buy like every strap
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
You might also like
Jonesboro South, no strap no trap
I'm strapped, seven bales in the back of the apartment
Don't tell em that they wise
I snatch your ass call up 
I'm too piped up the bitch had to go back
I'm the richest young nigga in the project
Longway riding in the foreign object
Goons riding behind me with chopsticks
Perfect timing 
I'm a goblin, I rob you
I want that pack I come for it, top shottas smack 
But its peewee Shawty lo and Guwop
Double right back for the guap
In the rari 448 drop top its extortion, its our block
MPA 1017 double down FN extendo
So don't tell me you bout that gangster shit
Or my nigga let a nigga clip go
Have a bag where your shit go
, shoot you in your big toe
Double cup where my peach crush go
This ain't mines  boy I let it go

They say Guwop back, he snatched a pack and he finna get his money back
Dont tell em that, dont tell em that
They say my trap house roll so hard
I might not even need my door attached
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Dont bring your bitch, she double bag
She seen me when I served a pack
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Remember way back in the trap
When I would buy like every strap
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Yaaay, big shooter out to do the club
I'm in this bitch shooting and booty money
I love to see em way they pick it up
She say Im sick the way I throw it up
Dirty birds, show them how they fly
No brown, only Roddy White
And he say I'm fucking with Shawty Lo
You know I'm probably just gon fuck this hoe
Short hoe I call it Mighty Mouse
I give her cheese she give me mighty mouth
Pay money tell them show back
(Pay a key runner?) tell em that

They say Guwop back, he snatched a pack and he finna get his money back
Dont tell em that, dont tell em that
They say my trap house roll so hard
I might not even need my door attached
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Dont bring your bitch, she double bag
She seen me when I served a pack
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Remember way back in the trap
When I would buy like every strap
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that3Embed
