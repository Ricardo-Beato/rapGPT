6 ContributorsTeary Eyed Lyrics
Two thousand five!!
There will be no room for y'all with no originality
WHOOO

You're the reason I don't trust no one (No one)
And I don't love no one, from the places I've come
The sad songs, I've sung, all the times I've been stung
Boy you, bring the worst out of me (Holla)
And I can't count these tears I've cried
The emptiness inside that left me so petrified
Tried to keep, love alive, but I became too tired
Cause you, bring the worst out of me
Hey, hey, hey-ay-ay

And, I wish I coulda changed the way things have gone
And start life through a lie maybe once again (YES!)
I don't know when or where but somethin' must have went wrong
And all I have to say, is now...

When I sing this song I get so teary eyed
Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you (Holla)
But look what you've done to me (me)
You might also like
I, compromised all my time (My time)
And rearranged my life, to make sure you was fine
Cause our love, was on the line, and I became so unkind
Cause you brought the worst out of me
(You brought the worst out)
This is, how the story goes (Whooo, it goes)
The others want to know, when it's out of control (Control)
You work, and you work, but someone gets hurt
And I guess that'd be me (When I sing)

When I sing this song I get so teary eyed
Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was 'posed to marry you, kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you (R&B)
But look what you've done to me (me)
Hey, hey, hey-ay-ay

I wish I coulda changed the way things have gone
And start life through a lie maybe once again
I don't know when or where but somethin' must have went wrong
And all I have to say

When I sing this song I get so teary eyed (Oh-oh)
Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was 'posed to marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me (me)
