59 ContributorsParty People Lyrics
I been fucked since my early days
I been stuck in my worldly ways
Propaganda, press pan the camera
Please don't look at me in my face
Everybody might see my pain
Off the rail, might off myself
Bored with life as I board this plane
Stewardess ask if I need help
Maybe, baby, what's your last name?
Hopefully it still ain't been changed
Somethin' 'bout ya make me not doubt ya
Awkward silence, my brain scream louder
Askin' when I'm gon' blast myself
Couple problems my cash can't help
Human issues, too strong for tissues
False bravado all masked by wealth

Move your body if you came here to party
If not then pardon me
How I'm supposed to have a good time
When death and destruction's all I see?
Out of sight, I'm out of my mind
The sound of sunshine is callin' me
Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need
You might also like
Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, move
Party people I like to see you groove
This is how we do, this is how we do

Deja vu from my bayside view
I see black cats in the daytime too
I see black cats on the daytime news
With handcuffed wrists and their skin turned blue
I met God once at a rendezvous and felt star-struck
"Vince, the car's out front"
Got things to do, got to make my moves
I can't miss my flight and miss you too, boo
First class seats is overrated
Won't go 'less they overpay us
Nowadays I'm over dating
My dick is strict for procreation
Her lips, my lips stay well acquainted
Her morning moanings is callin' me
Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need
Move your body if you came here to party
If not then pardon me
How I'm supposed to have a good time
When death and destruction's all I see?
Out of sight, I'm out of my mind
The sound of sunshine is callin' me
Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need

Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, move
Party people I like to see you groove
This is how we do, this is how we do8Embed
