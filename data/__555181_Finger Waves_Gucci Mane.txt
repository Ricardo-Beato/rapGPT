10 ContributorsFinger Waves Lyrics
Who the fuck you think you fucking hollering at pops?
Talking disrespectful will get you shot on this block
He gon fuck around and have more fucking gut shots than 2Pac
So call the cops cause they gon whack you whether you call them or not
They call me Gucci Mane, Big Guwop, got more blocks than Ibaka
And all my home boys got ten bricks up but I still hang with robbers
They say I got a warrant out for aggravated finessing
Next charge I'ma get flexing with deadly intentions, it's Gucci!
I'm in a Bentley on a Wednesday, same clothes, I been wearing this shit for 3 days
Fucking hoes, I ain't bathe and I need to shave
I had a sun valley babe getting that section 8
Flat Shoals on the stove, not the microwave
And I ain't never in my life had some finger waves
A big bad herringbone, I was catching Js
And I ain't never in my life had some finger wavesYou might also like4Embed
