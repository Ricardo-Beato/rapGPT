18 ContributorsDid It on My Own Lyrics
I buy a rollie, my dog he buy a Audemars
Cop off, cop off, we havin' a copoff
You the type off nigga to tip a cop off
Miami nights and I'm riding with the top off
Two bitches on my dick they havin a top off
Have 'em screamin' in the ghost, phantom of the Opera
Please excuse all these diamonds in my Tic-Toca
All this gold on me lookin' like a fuckin' Oscar
You claim you Thug but you friends with the judge
And that tellin' shit yeah its probably your honor
And I'm finna put a slug up in a pretender cause these haters'll be the one that'll be the main jocker
And I'm colder than winter but
I'ma  winter shop at Lenox  ATL balling with my whole damn blocka
Don't owe a nigga or a bitch shit
All my old hoes actin' like they miss me
But they need to stop it
Now they found out I got a few dollars
Now they wanna holler
But I still make a bitch chew and swallow
Sippin' champagne out the motherfuckin' bottle
Swear to god I almost fell in love with a model
Til' I found out she fucked the whole 2 Live Crew, wait
She fucked the 2 live crew?
I ain't even know they still had a deal
Shoutout to Uncle Luke I wanna be just like you
Rest in peace to my cousin Kurt
I swear to god I wanna get those niggas
The same way they got you
You might also like
Yeah I did it on my own

Told my momma the rap shit was a joke
Til I came in the crib with that Givenchy coat
My grandma been with it from the jump
Fuck the slice she can have the whole loaf
Member when my cousin grind all night
Ran out of work, so he started choppin up soap
Wish I was there the night he got shot, R.I.P to weat
Now me Sia and gonna fuckin' toast for all the niggas didn't make it out the fuckin, makin sure its all good
I need to put a lot money on my Uncles books
So I keep making tracks by the fuckin' flood
Now I get a lil fame now all the bitches lovin' us
Man I swear thats how it never was
Philidelphia niggas we all animals
They tell me to slow down I start sippin' mud
And the shit I never was into
Stage divin', 50 thousand in the fuckin' venue
Niggas talkin bout they know the real you
Listen to you're track, say you're trash, but they feel you
Listen to you everyday but try to grill you
Write the worst verses on your instrumental
I make the speaker bleed like a fuckin' menstrual
Same crackers paying me a beatle wasn't in to

Yeah I did it on my own
Yeah I did it on my own
Cars cribs and the money
Yeah I did it on my own
Yeah I did it on my own
You can hate I think its funny
Yeah I did it on my own
Yeah I did it on my own
Cars crib and the money
Yeah I did it on my own
Yeah I did it on my own
Cars cribs and the money
You can hate I think its funny
Yeah I did it on my own
Yeah I did it on my own
Cars cribs and the money
Yeah I did it on my own
Yeah I did it on my own
You can hate I think its funny
Cars crib and the money
Yeah I did it on my own

You can hate I think its funny
Yeah I did it on my own
Yeah I did it on my own8Embed
