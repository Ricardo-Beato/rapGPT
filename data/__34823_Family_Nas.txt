40 ContributorsFamily Lyrics
Yo..
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Island hopping getting right on them 747 Boeings
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo, yo, yo, yo
40th side, 41st side ride

Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at
You might also like
Ayo, I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate, they read your obituary in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, "Freeze black kids!"
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it (uh), put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?

Yo..
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Island hopping getting right on them 747 Boeings
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo.. yo you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo you fam to me, and only fam to me
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid
Rap niggas shit they drawers

Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest, we hit you
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
Yo, yo, yo, yo
40th side, 41st side ride

Yeah, youknahmsayin'
Not for nothing baby
Knahmsayin' wanna give a shout out to my peoples
YouknowhatImean, Yambo, Ill Will
Killa Black, my brother
It's never gonna be another, word up..
Yeah, you know how we do dunn, word up

The future is nothing but a series of probability made up of decisions that we make right now but these decisions leads to certain events into the future and every human being has a capability to determine their own future
Some are just more into it than others...4Embed
