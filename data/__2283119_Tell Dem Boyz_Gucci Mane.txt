12 ContributorsTell Dem Boyz Lyrics
Tell the tattoo guy where to meet me at
Coz my neck n back im inkin that
Dirty sprite im drinkin that
Never seen a sprite more pink then dat
So much threats got an asthma attack
So much ice got an ice attack
Baby girl went into cardiac
When she saw me come in my air max
Gucci  mane call me gucci game coz i dun change the slang
And i dun changed the game
What's the name? it's gucci mane wit flocka flame
Ain't a damn thing change
Tote a 9 still on the grind
I got what you need i got all kinds
Lemon lime, sour dee i got wat you need come shop wit me
Im like a cali man i got cali tree
Trap under sun valley trees
Took your girl on a shopping spree, neiman marcus n  bloomingdales
She all on my coat tails
What the hell, east Atlanta smell!
I'm not going back to jail
I gotta go make me some mils

No matter how many times i tell dem boyz
They can fuck around and smear dem boyz
Im right off that Gresham boy
I got something to sell them boyz
Ridin' around wit choppa toys
Im so fucking paranoid
No matter how many times i tell dem boyz
They can fuck around and smear dem boyz
Im right off that Gresham boy
I got something to sell them boyz
Ridin' around wit choppa toys
Im so fucking paranoid
All i gotta do is tell dem boyz
They comin its gucci boyz

Your apartments we shoot em up
Your crown vic we shoot em up
Your trap house we shoot it up
Your new coupe we shoot it up
We shoot it up

No matter how many times i tell dem boyz
They can fuck around and smear dem boyz
Im right off that Gresham boy
I got something to sell them boyz
Ridin' around wit choppa toys
Im so fucking paranoid
No matter how many times i tell dem boyz
They can fuck around and smear dem boyz
Im right off that Gresham boy
I got something to sell them boyz
Ridin' around wit choppa toys
Im so fucking paranoid
All I gotta do is tell dem boyz
They comin to get ya, boyEmbed
