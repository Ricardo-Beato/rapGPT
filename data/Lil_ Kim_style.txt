Live at the spot now is our prison correspondent Heywould Yablowme
Heywould, take it away

Thanks Dick
We're standing here in front of the federal detention centre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Where Brooklyn's own, Lil' Kim is scheduled to be released from incarceration
As you can hear behind me, her loyal fans are anxiously awaiting her release
And, needless to say, they are hyped
Hold, on Dick
She's coming, right now

I'm all about my paper, ain't messin' with the majors
Told my nigga Un get the one's we can do this
No more J.M., it's La Bella to the death
That's the clique, so get with the movement
Now I'm collecting cheques, settle for nothing less
Same broad, the awards, exposing the breast
Y'all been frontin' and lyin', snitchin' and tryin'
But now I'm free
Need more than honey to try and catch the Bee
Actually, I'm internationally known
No HIV but my status is full blown
A few rocks and stones, but I'm keepin' it grown
Got my own Gucci store, up inside of my home
And if you don't understand my actions
Just know there's a method to my madness

Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

Some MCs are bold and arrogant
Try to make a name by dissing and competing
Niggas just like to spend cash
Cum fast, cos my pussy's so sweet
A diabetic wanna eat it, huh
Some people hate, and choose to talk trash
I brush it off then let it pass, like Steve Nash
Quick, fast, I get up in that ass
Kim spaz, and put hoes on full blasts
Boss bitch, what you make I take half
And dare you to put your hands in my stash
Dudes dates girls that try to be like me
My pimp game so good make you leave wifey
New York's finest, call me Your Highness
And know there's a method to my madness

Outta all the ladies, why he chose the Queen Bee
And this is what he said y'all

I need me a fine ass motherfucking bitch, with some pretty ass eyes
I need me a bitch, like I need some cash

I need me a bitch, like a need a 6-4

Love to have a Queen on your arm if you could
Take them wings off the Bentley, and put me on the hood
Oh, I'm what niggas want, I got what niggas need
I keep my coochi in Gucci, and you best believe
Get it on anywhere, no matter I'm looking
Sophisticated, I'm sexual so

I need me a bitch, like I need my crew
I need me a bitch, a bitch to pass on to my boys soon as I get through
I need me a bitch, this I can't deny (I can't deny)
I need me a bitch, I love when she wildin' out, 'cause she still look fine
I need me a bitch, and a Coupe de Ville
I need me a bitch, a car with a big back seat, so I can make her squeal

It's Queen Bee, Sex in the City
Representing up top, brought the block wit' me
Custom Versace dress, showing one titty
In Brooklyn, New York, grimey and gritty
Men see the vide-oh, and go lick the TV slow
I show 'em things, they never seen before
Cause the way I move, is so flexible
I'll try anything, Imma try sexual
The blindfolds and handcuffs, a bit rough
When my thighs wrap around his head, like earmuffs
Doin' freaky weird stuff, talk tough, face down
And step into the Queen with the diamond laced crown
The Jewel of the Nile, I'm romancing the stone
I said "look bitch I got your man on the phone"
But you can swing through, if you want a peep show
Just bring a hun'ed grand and some Veuve Clicquot

In Iceberg jeans, that ass looks mighty nice
And this is the fabulous life of Kim Jones
I got chinchilla covers on my flip phones
To match with them furs, baby got back with them curves
A female matte, with makeup on my words
Flow, mascara and blush
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
Comparison, what? Ain't nobody close to me
I'm on top, right where I'm supposed to be
And now, haters all kiss my bikini wax
And if you've seen the facts, you know the Queen is back!

You can have it, you can eat it, just lick the plate
Cause the taste is great, and my panties are edible
Incredible, Natalie Cole, Unforgettable
How are you? Big squirt, little muscle
Keep grindin' I got a non-stop hustle
And don't quit, you can't push without pull
And you know you can't talk, when you got your mouth full
Now put your face in it, and just nod your head
Go on work it on down, too my thighs and legs
Put your face in it, no bitch can see me
Got the whole block buzzin', number one Queen Bee
Put your face in it, men gather round
Laid back, hypnotized, I'm the talk of the town

See to everybody listening, if it's on I'm a get at 'em

These S1 keep the don on chill, I just blew 50 like the shady deal

Fatigue belt, 45 made for the navy
Young niggas ready to grapple down ya buildin'
I'm living chilling, arms wrapped around a Brazilian
In the presence of a Don, be cautious but calm
Can't be faded, two pills a charm
She licks on my chest, reading tatts on my arm
Hit her from the back, same time my mind blown
Speechless so she scream in silence
A real bad boy and all my speeches violent

CT got your back, you know what it is
Shout out to the whole Tri-State
Shout out to all the websites, shout out to all the blogs
Shout out to all the radio stations
Most of all, shout out to the streets

It was love at first sight, everthing was right
I didn't know, him had another life with a kid and wife
And he bought me a ring and he bought us both the same cars
What started out as a simple love affair
Ended with someone inside an electric chair
And the same man that she was in love with's now in love with me
I didn't mean to hurt her, could've been somebody's mom
But she took his heart when, she pulled out that gun
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down

But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what she was thinking
But I know what she was feeling
And now he's no longer around
I didn't mean to hurt him, could've been somebody's son
But she took his heart when, she pulled out that gun
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
But hear me now

I never thought she'd do it
I never thought she'd do it
I never thought she'd do it
Oh gosh
Why ever do she do it?
Why ever do she do it?
Why ever do she do it?
Why do she pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger? Boom!
And end this, end this life so soon
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger, boom
Now what you gon' do? Me say, what you gon' do?
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam
Me say one man down, oh god
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam
Me say one man down
Now you are a criminal, criminal, criminal
Yes you are a criminal, criminal, criminal
Yes now somebody hold the gun, whilst she run out of town
Before it be another: one man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down

If Peter Piper pecked 'em, I bet you Biggie bust 'em
He probably tried to fuck him, I told him not to trust him
Lyrically, I dust 'em off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledge-hammers
Bitch with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch, murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease-free bitch, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A., remember them?
Tell 'em when I used to mess with gentlemen, straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta, nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas' wives for one point five
While you struggle and strive, we pick which Benz to drive

You can't see her with binoculars (You cannot see her dawg)
I'm keepin' it Holly-hood, out in Hollywood
Put ya lighters up if you rollin' that backwood (put 'em up, put 'em up!)
Once again it's on, your girl's back in the zone
Maybe it's the beat or the seven shots of Patron
Like Cypress Hill, I'm 'Insane In The Brain'
My niggas, clear the lane, I'm comin' to bring the pain (she comin')
Time for a change, ya'll all sound the same
Ya'll all makin' it rain, we makin' it hurricane
Like a good meal, I hit the spot
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot
What you cowards forgot, is stayin' on top
I'm kinda like your album, it ain't never gon' drop
Y'all got guns, and they never gon' pop
You already know the motto, "Ain't Never Gon' Stop"
I'm always on that green light, tryna get my team right
Back to back 5-50s, that cream white
Red diamonds like a infrared beam light
My soldiers masked up like it's Halloween night
You know the apple-bottoms got the jeans fittin' tight
Marciano bra got the titties sittin' right
JT had a sexy track, but it's gon take Lil' Kim to bring sexy back
It's me the trendsetter, 24/7 Star sweater

It’s funny 'cause, you know, we've been asking people what they wanted to know
I mean, clearly, you've been having this thing with Kim
And I don't know, just thinking about you and where you were from and that you're a rapper
And I'm thinking, sure, I know things have gotten crazy and people are assuming
Even though you say it's not specifically about her, that "Roman's Revenge" is for Kim
Umm, you know, she just really jumped out the window, and you gotta be careful when you pick fights
And that's what I've learned in this business, you just never know—
Shut the fuck up!

Who the fuck want war?
FedEx beef straight to your front door
It'll be a murder scene
I'm turnin' Pink Friday to Friday the 13th
A'ight, you Lil' Kim clone clown
All this buffoonery, the shit stops now
Time for you to lay down, I'm sick of the frauds
I put hands on this bitch like a spa massage
We all know your last name's what got you your job
You's a put together gimmick, somethin' like a collage
Since you puttin' on a show, you gon' get the applause
Clap, clap, lift your frame like a fucking garage, yeah
This hood shit, you and Drake ain't built for
This the shit the other bitch almost got killed for
I'm still countin' what Hardcore generated
Bet my shit keep spinnin' like it's syndicated
Corny broad, I'll leave you bloody like you menstruated
You hot air ass bitch, should have been deflated
This ain't a championship fight, I've been the greatest
See, the fact is what you doing, I did it
Lames tryna clone my style and run with it
That's cool, I was the first one with it
You's a Lil' Kim wanna be, you just hate to admit it
I'm the blueprint, you ain't nothin' brand new
Check your posters and videos, you'll always be number two
I seen 'em come, I seen 'em go, still, I remain
Sweetie, you goin' on your fourteenth minute of fame
I'm over ten years strong still running the game
Cut the comparisons, I'm in the legendary lane
Fighting for a spot, child, please, I'm solidified
With my hands tied, you couldn't beat me if you bitches tried
Either you're high or sippin' that shit Wayne on
I get top dollar for whatever my name on
Go stick your head in a tornado, brainstorm
I drop bombs, Flex, napalms
Black and yellow, we'll pull up in your ghetto
Giuseppe's when I step out, posted up in stilettos
Pussy so pink, like my kitty sayin', "Hello"
If I whistle, they'll pistol whip you in all five boroughs
I'm from Brooklyn, I be everywhere comfortably
Now who pumped you and told you to come romp with me?
You're the type to run your mouth and then run from me
I'm poppin' off in your hood with no company
Come on, Queens ain't showin' you no love
I was there the other night, poppin' bottles with the thugs
You're like Washington, heffer, I'm Benji
You got a buzz right now, I had a frenzy
Oh, yeah, welcome to the fam, Fendi
You need to stop, you're not hot, you're a burnin' match
That means the end is near soon, copy that?
Oh, I see, they really got you gassed like I'm a thing of the past
Better slow down, dummy, you 'bout to crash

Leave your whole head red like Pegg Bundy
You're hilarious, thanks for all the laughs
You're garbage, so I'm takin' out the trash
You, shit on me? Come on, baby girl
Ain't enough ass shots in the world
You're a nuisance, you'd probably steal my new shit
But you could never fuck with me so chuck it up, deuces
All around the world, I ball like a ball team
I stack chips, call me Mrs Rothstein
Tricks is for kids, silly rabbit, you're my offspring
Kim more anticipated than a Lebron ring
I mean, I know, I know you guys asked me if "Roman’s Revenge" was about Kim
And no I, it’s not about Kim
Actually, if Kim thought it was about her, I’m so sorry
I’m so sorry, I apologize, Kim

I know a dude named Jimmy, used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Rémy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him, "I'll be back," go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer
Ho hop, raw top in my man's drop
Then this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', "Gimme"
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Called suckin' his dick, "rockin' the mic"

Leavin' cum stains, niggas remain in awe
When I brought a Derringer, throw it to your jaw, uh
Never a flaw

Flow's phenom, I'm the bomb-diggity, ask Biggie
Keep a dedicated squad with me, call us the Gabbana girls
We dangerous, bitches pay a fee just to hang with us
Trust, niggas lust
Without a bank account, I doubt we could swing that route
Feel me out, uh, I'm used to
Hangin’ with boosters in the best name brand
With the insane clan
Man, listen
My position is lieutenant
Like a block of hash, got the burners up in it, percent it

Entrepreneurs, Cristal pourers, be glad we ain't takin' yours
Boring, huh? I'm warnin' you
Style waits for no bitch, I dream rich
When I fuck with scratch and sniff

Yeah, uhh
In the M.A.F.I.A.'s land, y'all
Where loyalty is everything
The M.A.F.I.A. forgives, but never forgets
Heh, let me tell you

In the M.A.F.I.A.'s land where there's one boss and one clan
Yes mans, they surround us like steaks in pans
All 'em wanna be the man, right hands wash the left hands
Loyalty's priority in this fam
Where life's initiated, ain't no givin' it back
Once you in it, like Bennett, you'll soon be lieutenant
Like me, the Don Juan, that's Yvonne
The sweat-a the money getter
Coppin' mad cheddar
Stevie was Wondering how I got in this position
One day Frank was fishin' for competition, expedition
Number one, his name is Barry Madanno
Push the phat Milano, '96 stick-shift 'cross the Verrazano
I lay gently in the Bentley, through binoculars he seemed popular
Givenchy socks, Cartier coolats
H-class rocks and charms like Bohemians
Sick like leukemians, receding hairlines
Watch how genuine this gold mine recline
When Frank pops the wine, I cocks the nine
Niggas peeped it from behind and slipped they clips in quick
One chick named Nick thought she was the shit
Tried to play Big Poppa, don't worry
Minutes before I drop her, the *blow! blow! blow!*
Like a parolee, the bitch violated
So how you like it: coffins or cremated?

Street murderers, thug parasites
We official, no fake gators
Coppin' firearms with dud missles
We leavin' scar tissues
That nigga Barry still aggy about that slut
Mob nigga, what! threw the gang sign up
The nigga chuckles, just slip the loot
On my belt buckles and cracked his middle knuckles
Damn! How could a deal for a couple mill
Result to such violence
And throw our whole shit off balance?
But still, they pat me down from all angles
Trapped inside the Devil's triangle
Like Bo I had the Jangles
And movin' slow to slide up on these Mexicans
One cross-eyed and hunchbacked
The other must be mixed with Black
The third nigga had missin' teeth and tattoo teardrops
Long hair, chest felt like a bag of rocks
Before this chops
I grabbed the keys to locks, the jewels and the rocks
The cream in the box, et cetera, et cetera, and it don't stop
I got away with everything, the cash and the stash
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by

My man was astonished
He looked as if there was a foul aroma in the air
Stinkin! I know this nigga's thinkin'
"Damn! She too little, too pretty, too quiet
The bitch is hired," mob's wife for life
Diamond heist with Trife, contracts on your life
We increase the price, uhh
So guess who the bitch is?
But for now I be the mistress

But I'm ready to take care of you now
Now, after three years?
Three motherfuckin' years, nigga? You know what?

Hasta la vista, bye-bye, kiss your kids
It's the gangstresses
What you think this is, nigga?
Calm yourself, it's just a little robbery
You got stricken with the poverty, starvin' me
Call me Sunshine, pussy spread like the rainbow
Spectaculous, miraculous
I practice this for a livin', like the Buddhism
Nam myoho renge kyo
Ask Tina, love ain't got shit to do, with me and you
Or the .44 under the pillow
Put in the dildo I like to play while I'm workin'
And that's for certain
Keep jerkin', I ain't done with you
Lights, cameras, curtains
In a second
The show begins
Invite your family and friends
They gotta see this

I heard about the carjacks and all the contracts
Out on me by your man Big D
Stink cucarachas, I bought his life for 3 G's
Then some watches, then wet him like galoshes
No need to be mad, they already gone
Him and your hitman had somethin' goin' on
We caught him down at the Shark Bar up in Mark's car
You know the place where the willies are
Always frontin' in they Moray's, sippin' Dom P's and Cristies
I reminisce how it used to be
On the run from po-lice we bust shotties out of Maseratis
Bloody bodies in the telly lobbies
When in need I lied for ya, I cried for ya
You know this down-ass bitch woulda died for ya
I used to sweat you, but now forget you
I'd rather dead you, and wet you like I never met you

And I remember, how you said you loved me
With the passion
High fashion
Who you askin'?
To keep the tum numb, from index to thumb
Push the V's with the coke from the DT's
Dope take the titties from city to city
I ain't see a G off none of them ki's
At ease, when the cops came you gave them my name
Said if I didn't snitch, you'd make a shorty rich, bitch
I copped the one to three just to see
If all the yayo and boy carryin' on the Peter Pan to Maryland
Was worth the bitch marryin'
This nigga I so worked so hard for
Chose my life to be hardcore
Laws didn`t appeal no more
Gats I couldn't feel no more
And now I'm the shit
Go by the name of Lil' Kim, the Queen Bitch
And M.A.F.I.A.'s lieutenant
Instead of playin' Don Dinero
I shoulda been scheming on your cream and dinero
It don't pay to be nice, but it's nice to pay
And if you die before you wake, may your soul God take
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too

My Aunt Dot
Left a Glock and some blood on my sheets
Told me clean the shit up, then she hit the streets
Even though I'm her niece, she copped me a piece
Wack-ass caliber, nickel-plated with the silencer
What? She don't know I like my guns pretty?
Like my boy Castor Troy with the twin-glizzies
I heard a knock at the door {*knock knock knock knock knock*}
To my surprise I saw these two familiar eyes
Who are you?
Whattup? I'm Shanice, don't remember me?
She called me by my government name, Kimberly
Who sent you?
My mom sent me; her name is Dottie
She packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie
Hmmph, she was cute; and mad fly
She had the Prada knapsack, with the hat to match
Bvlgari hiking boots, with the mink bubblegoose
And I could see she was admiring my mink ski suit
Then she handed me the note
Here, read this
I just stared her up and down
'Cause I couldn't believe this, then I opened it
It said, "Bitches is out to get you
Your so-called friends, put a bomb in your Benz
I'm on a mission now to do some harm to your friends
They know where you live, so evacuate the crib
And oh, the little girl, that's your cousin Shanice
Since I can't be with her, I need you to babysit her
Besides she looks up to you, you're her idol
And tomorrow is her first violin recital
And she would be, more than happy if you could take her
Peace, my number's on the back of the paper, hit me later"
Damn, what went wrong?
Can't we all just get along, and make hit songs?
Bitches all up in my ass like a thong
If this was a show, y'all hoes would get "gonged"
'Cause if it's on, then it's on, bring it on
What the fuck you waitin' for? C'mon, let's get it on
What? What's takin you so long? I got plans for the future
To bring back your head like Medusa

C'mon please, I wanna be just like you
600 Mercedes, and 380's in my doll babies
Crazy baguettes in my barrettes and
H-class rocks inside my Baby G Shock
Fuck Barney and Lambchops; I don't love them hoes!
But anything goes when it comes to bankrolls
Diamonds on my toes, X-and-O's
Versace hottie in designer clothes
Scoop Lil' Nique and Jus, then take 'em to Toys'R'Us
Make em spend they cheese then kick 'em out and take the bus
I'm the S-the-H-the-A-the-N-the-I-the-C-the-E
But all my friends call me Miss Little Queen Bee
What what? I like the green, know what I mean?
Ever seen The Professional? (uh-huh) Well I can clean
You know what? I like you, little big person
But rule number one, no cursin'
Anyway, what you know about that?
You too young for that, when I was your age
I woulda got hung for that
Then I picked up the phone, to call my Aunt Dot
So she could fill me in a little more about the plot
Hmm.. nine-one-seven, eight-five-eight, two-one-two-two
"Hello?" Yo, what's the deal?
Why these bitches buggin' out;
I mean, what's this all about?
"See it's sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy
They don't want you to win no more
Soul Train they don't want you to attend no more
And I guess that's why, they ain't your friends no more
The other day, when I was comin' out the grocery store
I saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door"
For real? "Yup, then I choked the bitch out
At least one to the heart, tied up her hands and feet
Through her in my backseat
Then I dumped her on a dead-end street
The other two? Yeah they still linger
But don't you lift a finger, I'ma get 'em
So just pray I come home
And when we hang up, get rid of your phone"
Whoo! When Aunt Dot comes, oh brother
It's like five Bloody Mary's, one after another
Hmmph, she have you stressed, no wearin' white, no sex
And when she get vexed, you guess what happens next
'Cause them other two girls, that's still on the menu
Is the reason why the story is to be continued
Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
Y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a "Humphrey"
I know it hurts (I'm killin' y'all)
Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny

Uh, uh

I gets right to the point (no time to play around)
When it comes to this cheddar (lay a nigga down)
Bust shots at his Rover if he dare come back around
Pay me on time or I gots to take mine
At first I seem friendly but that's just in me
I warn you, when I blow, it gets a little windy
You make me wanna fight you, I ain't nothin' like you
Y'all paper thin, my shit recycled
They call me Lil' Kim a.k.a. Cover Girl
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another fuckin' world
Niggas buy me glass slippers and diamond fingernails
And aw, shit, I got it all in this bitch

Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin' in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash

My Billboards is nice, one day gon' be a classic
I fuck with dudes, with members only jackets
That sleep on brass beds with money for a mattress
Gettin'-money bitch, and I roll with dimes
Take pictures with our nines on the cover of New York Times
Tattoos down our spine with the picture of a dime
Cuttin' niggas short like inmates for phone time
Everything I get is custom made
Niggas wanna get laid, I gotta get paid (the papers)

Even though I was a bitch playin' hard to get
'Cause see I never felt this way in my life
It didn't take long before you made me your wife
Shoppin' sprees and puttin' money in my pockets
Pictures of you inside my heart-shaped lockets
And my girls, knew you wasn't no good
They told me 'bout them broads you was fuckin in the hood
You said I was a diamond, and you was like a pearl
So daddy how could you do this to your baby girl?
Memories, is all it brings when I look at my rings
And "Heartbreaker" is the song I sing (c'mon, c'mon)

Oh, how it hurts, like childbirth
The wounds heal slow, you just don't know
At times, I don't know what to say
And all I do is pray, day to day
But still, I feel my strength might die
Like right now, I'm tryin' hard not to cry
Even when I close my eyes, I still see it
Damn, I just don't believe it
The bad times I buried, like the cemetery
Unworthy people playin' beneficiaries
A lotta people eatin' off of one man's death
Don't you worry B.I., I'ma ride to my last breath
You killas, caused a lotta devastation
You have no idea what you did to this nation
I fuckin' hate you, excuse my frustration
But just when I'm about to quit, God tells me to just

Will the court please rise?
Judge Funk Doctor Spock residing
Your honor, Lil' Kim is a threat to society
She has shown a blatant disregard for the law
And has killed six fine law enforcement agents in the line of duty
For the vicious acts, she should be punished to the fullest extent of the law

Pardon me your honor, may I address the bench?
They tryna assassinate me like they did to Larry Flynt
Excuse my persona
I may be hardcore but I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer
Ever since I killed 'em, I ain't been in trouble since
It wasn't my fault, I acted out of self-defense
He killed my best friend (Who's him?) I mean them
They was all dressed in blue and they want me dead too
They had real grenade bombs inside of their palms
And a whole bunch of guns wrapped tight in their arms
See them bastards woke me up when they broke my alarm
I was getting my ass licked by this cat named Tom
(Stop!) I heard three guns cocked, that's when Tom dropped
They sent the bow and arrow right through his tank top
(Oh, she's lying!) Lying? Blood was gushing on the floor
Fingerprints all on the door, need I say more?
Pulled out the remote can and shot blows after blow, ploom!
Queen off her toes, they fell down like dominoes
I think it was the Matrix, I mean it was the Matrix
What was I to do? Sit back and just take this?
Yo, I'm tellin' you now If I lose this debate
Like in Dead Presidents I'm going out like Larenz Tate
See I ain't gon be stupid, I'ma take all y'all to the shift

With so much innocence we have to implement
She was slightly out of place
But if you grant us a grain of your grace
I'll assure you it's only stress due to the severity of the case
Imagine for a minute, yourself in the same shoes
The same sense of survival and the same nothing to lose
Your children, your lovely wife, I mean look at her
The only thing she's guilty of is having no choice in the matter

Lord I cry (I cry) from the things I've seen (that I've seen)
And Lord I cry (I cry) from the things I've seen (ooh)
If you only knew (only knew) the things that I've been through
(Oh yeah) you'd know why (you'd know why-y-y)
You'd know why I cry, I cry, I cry
(Order! Order! Order!
Order! Order! Order!)

Order in the courts, I'm examining her thoughts
And the notes on why you started slaughtering the fort
The men dressed in blue, they were undercover cops
Hungry to see another black motherfucker shot
They ran up in your spot and no one gave the orders
Even Tom was tapped with a mic and a tape recorder
(He was in on it too!)
Yeah
(Yeah, I guess I should've knew)
Yeah
(Objection, your honor!)
Yo, objection overruled!
I know the news they tried to pay the grand jury
To give you life sentence with parole up in thirty
Now that's dirty, surveillance and you debate
Fuck Will! Now you're the new Enemy of the State
Angela Bobbett's cake compared to you
And Junior Mafia, that clique ain't scared to move
So, they took precautions
Grenades from all force and
Professional marksman with four fours of war hymn
But you stopped, dropped, rolled and duck
Shot back other bitches would've folded up
Now, that's my kind of bitch
I know I'm the judge
But I love that bitch
And I'm coming with her
Creme of the crop, and me, I'ma hold her down
Resign with A-K's so we blowing the trial
Look, it's a setup

No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Shake your body to the rhythm)
We are the number one
(If it drives you crazy)

Everywhere I go red carpet
Gave the keys to valet tell 'em to park it
Then I jumps out the Azure, a Lil' Kim aura
Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R-L-S is in the stretch LX
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bvlgari perfume from a mile ya smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'ma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill', uh

I been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell, I even fucked with different races
A white dude, his name was John
He had a "Queen Bee Rules" tattoo on his arm
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark 'til the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

Lunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list

If I tell ya, I'll tell ya how I feel
(If I tell ya how I feel)
Would you keep bringin' out the best in me?
Stop stressin' me1Embed
Fuckin', fuckin'

Fuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy

Ms. White, that bitch with a thousand looks
Come through with a thousand crooks
I just know what it takes to get this money like Blow
Catch a body, get a face lift, disappear like Pablo
Ya'll niggas think I won't jump in the heap
Well let's dance, you lames are finished
I serve all ya'll cowards like a game of tennis
Act like you want some of this and I'll give you the business
You see the yellow and black, you know what it's about
Wrinkled assed niggas gets ironed, to straighten you out
I got thugs in the east, thugs in the south
That'll stick you with an aids needle and piss in your mouth
I kept 'em on a leash and now it's time to let 'em out
Better pray to Jehovah, the game is over
Don't ever, ever, ever, ever underestimate
Lil' Kim the postergirl at 718
Ride outta town with my nigga, holdin' his weight
After it's cooked, chopped in eights the size of plates
You bitches ain't been through shit, you just minors
What you know about stuffin' half a bricks in your vagina
It's the dick licker, it's the baby sipper
Ain't a bitch alive can make a nigga cum quicker
Baby girl's pussy get wetter than a shower cap
Got my mans back like a Jansport napsack
And Queen Bee gon' bring you nothin' but heat
Homicide is lookin' for me for killin' these beats
You in the wrong department, this the upperclass section
You hoes is startin' to irritate me like a yeast infection
Good heavens, somebody get the Monostat 7
And hit me why don't cha, hit me why don't cha
The boss lady, I hold it down for my badies
Rappers better run and hide cause here comes the Beehive

It's your boy, Money Cash, I get love in the streets
Breathin' dro colored Benz's with dutch colored seats
Lay in the crib on Tuesdays, duckin' the sweep
Nigga jump off, then get pumped off your feet
I'm like Rostein, low key and brilliant with numbers
I'm tryna blow sticky in Brazil with the Hummer
If you spittin' and I'm grippin' this tech
Then that's 32 shots, our throwback's like Mitchell and Ness
Man, I'm a project nigga, still piss on the steps
And keep the brim on my fitted a little twist to the left
I play the block, fifth in my sweats, reppin' my set
It's Rossie from the pharmacy, get it correct

You ain't a thug cocksucka, you a coward to front
Fuck your project, your building got flowers in front
Every chick I roll with, OZ in the cunt
I was OT in Mass, pushin' flower for months
Sprinklin' gun powder, oughta put a haze on my blunt
I spit a hundred and fifty bars when I'm blazin' 'em out
Cause I can do that with razor blades stuck in my mouth
Forget a hotel, I'm fuckin' shorty right on the couch
Any rap shit I ever barked on, to hot to handle
And my rims bigger than lower Manhattan manholes
Listen up for 2003 tan rover
Stash box hold guns like Afgan soldiers
Wanna murda 16, well we the niggas you call

Cause my bars so hot, it be burnin' the beats
Melt my pen, I have slugs meltin' your chin
When I throw you over the bridge, they helpin' you swim
And you better wear a metal hat when you rappin' on stage
Or have my bullets like e-mail, packin' your waves
Or snatch your face off like I'm Nicolas Cage
And it could be five of ya'll, puttin' eight in your grave
Cause niggas think they hard, but they softer than bread
When them shells hit your throat, you be coughin' up lead
The next step is to off you, dead
I'mma cut your fuckin' head off and have Kim auction your head (Beehive)
See the kid don't rap for love, I rap for cheques
Even if I know you, I demand respect
And if I put you in the body bag, your man is next

Enough ammo to blow the earth from under your feet (Beehive)
And we got cake for killas like Hyde and Jeckyl
Snippers put red dots on your face like freckles
Don't make me have to reach for the lead
You'll think the bullets was rain drops how they all hit your head
I'm that slim kid that they say is probably hot
She only with me cause of what she think I probably got
Am I gon' be with her for long, probably not
Unless you're cute and suck a dick like a lollipop
Niggas talk about guns and they just bust caps
Niggas talk aboit ki's whey they just flip packs
When it come to my money, suggest you gimmie that
Cause you know bullets fly in pairs like Petey Pab

You say, "What is it that you want?
You've got everything that a woman could ever need in life"
I got a closet full of minks, chinchillas
I got a bureau full of diamonds, I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne, now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread baby
Now you know if anybody know, I know
But since you feel like that this evening, sit down and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
I am the one and only Queen Bee
After me there will be none
But you could call me Miss White
Most people know me as Lil Kim, the head of the La Bella Mafia
Oh, shoutout to my girl Victoria Gotti and the whole Gotti family, stay up

This time around, I ain't takin no shit
This time around, I'll never get bit
This time around, I switched up my flow
Got rid of the Pits and put Rotts by the do'
This time around, it ain't like befo'
This time around, I'm gon' crack ya jaw
The feds is watchin' me so I can't do much
Speak the wrong words, bitch, and you will get touched
I'm back on the scene, my favorite color is green
I'm buildin' a empire, got a whole new team
Pimp game is strong, raps is just harder than they ever been
You can never win

Music's my first love, a nine to five bores me
Love me or hate me, Lil Kim come through

Like the sand in the hour glass, you out of your time
Tryna go against the queen, is you out of your mind?
Even bein' number two, your chances is slim
'Cause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim
I gave a few passes, but I never forget
It's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick (Uh)
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides
I'm gettin' money, don't think I just be lettin' shit slide
I'm very concerned with fashion, ain't my fault y'all don't know how to
Rock this Hollyhood thang, y'all need to let me style you
Come back to the light ma, I started the shit

So keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days
As long as I'm around, you gon' bow down

The blue Hpnotiq, martini, mimosa-sippin'
Y'all better team or get it together
Or you, you and her can get it whenever
Huh, I got a army, y'all can't harm me
If the shoe was on the other foot, you'd probably try to stomp me
Don't get your life tooken (Tooken) I know I got you shooken (Shooken)

Niggas be like, "Here come the IRS!"
Kick down doors, shoot through walls
Queen Bee's a movement, fight for the cause
Got a bite that's bigger than "Jaws"
With or without my boys, I still make noise

New York - when Kim say, "Can you hear me now?"
That's when y'all turn it up
Midwest - when Kim say, "Can you hear me now?"
That's when y'all burn it up

Live guitars, nigga fuck cars

Look out the window, and reach for the stars

Them boys ain't bad and ain't no bitch greater
Stop tryin to use me as a respirator
I'm the same bitch on the escalator
And I still ain't got no time for you fuckin haters

Or with a Mafia meetin at the Brooklyn Cafe

It's a new day
And all you gossipin backstabbin habitual haters
You're all history (hissss-to-ry)
So you can hate, or hail the Queen (all hail, the Queen)
But it don't matter (but it don't matter)
Cause you ain't got nuttin, for us (you ain't got nothin.. for us)
So as long as you live, remember this

You can't fuck with Queen Bee.. Queen Bee.. Queen Bee!
All you haters will see.. see.. see!

Don't be mad, I can't put this - money in a casket
I can't put these - cars in a box with the ashes
I can't take these diamonds with me when I die
I can't build that pretty white house in the sky
I know you wishin that you wrote this song
But these same words comin from you, would be a joke
You better off takin heed from your boy Jada
I know you, hate dyin' but you gon' die a hater
I got a vision, I think for the future baby pah
Y'all nearsighted, lotta y'all, can't see that far
Rocks like the street light - baby watch 'em glow
Red yellow and green - don't know whether to stop or go
I'm a chameleon, I got many styles of rhymes
Like a bottle of fine wine I just get better with time
From "Hardcore" to "Notorious" you studied my flow
And still..

The industry, down to Wall Street
They ask:

What is she like, what does she need?
What is her type, I wanna give it to her, tell her please
Be my girl, I'll give her anything
Whatever her heart desires, in this whole world

Just cause you ain't a millionaire don't mean you can't compete
You ain't gotta be filthy rich, but you can't be cheap
I like a man that can stand on his own two feet
Got a strong business mind, straight out the streets
He gotta have security, power and wealth
Cause I can do bad by my God damn self
And if you spiritual, got a good heart and can make me laugh
And can fuck..

So like it or not, I am who I am
When I die hold my body in the Brooklyn Museum
Now take it to the bridge

Heavenly father... Creator of all things
I humble myself... As I bow to the throne
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness

I pray for love... I pray for love...
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness

They say the closest ones to ya
Be the ones that sneak up behind ya and stick the knife through ya
That's why now I keep my friends to a minimum
Check for the ones wit the venom on they tongue
'Cuz niggas is snakes, they hugs be fake
Steal from they best friend at his own wake
I did all I can do and I took all I can take
This is it, crossin' me was ya biggest mistake
And was it enough that I split 20% of what I make?
Was it enough that I cut niggas half of what I bake?
Ain't enough that I almost lost all my bread
Bailin niggas out, keepin' a roof over our head
Enough is enough I wash my hands I'm done wit it
I ain't playin' wit you motherfuckers, come wit it
Keep the fam together God knows I tried
But shit ain't been the same since B.I. died

Every day... and every night
Shit ain't been the same since B.I died

Lil' Kim the first rap bitch to shake up the charts
Act like I ain't the leader of this Million Bitch March
Who got y'all rockin' the Prada
The Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Versace and Louis
Please, I'm the reason this rap game is unisex
I'm the reason bitches want bigger breasts
Show some respect where respect is due
(Without who?) Without me there'd be no you
These next few lines it to you women abusers
Last nigga I was wit... straight fuckin' loser
Niggas think 'cuz you give 'em ya heart
They can... dissect it and rip it apart, mm-mm
Not I, one nigga's in my eye
Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy
You lost a good bitch nigga you can't front
Lil' Kim is EVERYthing a man could EVER want
And that's real
(I pray for love... I pray for love...
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
Every day... and every night
Mm-mm, not I, one nigga's in my eye
(I pray for love... I pray for love...
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
Every day, yo... every night
Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy

When the... money is gone (So is ya friends)
When the... gas runs out (there goes ya Benz)
They just don't make my breed no more
Nobody lives by the code of the street no more
I don't deal wit the nonsense, I'm keepin' it real
Wanna do business wit me? Get in touch wit Hill

That's right any questions? No you can't ask me
Put ya name and ya number on a letterhead and fax me
U want Kim? Name the location
75 grand and that's just for conversation

I'mma remain loyal while y'all crumble like the foil
It's tradition to rock diamonds in my crown, I'm royal
Niggas ain't believe in me, they thought it was over
Baby girl risin' up like the early mornin' sun
Y'all think y'all know but y'all have no idea
What the fuck I been goin' through these last 7 years (Ahh man)
(I pray for love) Everyday yo, everyday yo
(I pray for love) And every night, and every night
(I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
(They just don't make my breed no more) Word
That's it (I pray for love)
(Every day, yo) (I pray for love) I'm the last of the Mohicans
(And every night) After me there will be none
(I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
(Nobody lives by the code of the street no more) Word

I'm sayin'
I just wanna be happy
That's all
I don't ask for much
It makes me happy to see my people smile you know I'm sayin'
I ain't a hater
I don't even like sayin' the word, *chuckles*, word
(Nobody lives by the code of the street no more)
I'd sacrifice everything I got right now to have my man Biggie here wit me
See that's just how I am
'Cause I'm a rider (Keep the fam together God knows I tried)
What good is it to have everything
If you can't share it with the one you love?
If you can't be wit the ones you love
Then love the ones you wit
Don't take nobody for granted, you ain't promised tomorrow
Karma's a motherfucker
Unappreciative fucks (Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy)

(Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
I introduce to you (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
The Queen Bee (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
She hold the crown in this game (Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?)
Ladies and Gentleman...

It's the worlds famous, Lil' Kim, Queen Bee
I am who I am, you just can't change me
No matter what you do, you can't take the hood out me
People been around me for years, don't know shit about me
Dedicated, like Muslims makin' selat
People steady try to make me into somethin' I'm not
That's why I had to cut the grass, so I could see the snakes
Copped the house on the hill so I could see the lakes
What you thought? I'm a girl, couldn't make it alone
Time to turn the heat up and get back in the zone
One day my hairs orange, the next day it's green
The trendsetter's back on your TV screen

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

About five feet even, kinda small in the waist
Rap's sex symbol, real pretty in the face
So what I got even bigger titties than the lakes
Still a sophisticated lady with millions in the safe
Switch up flows like I switch up my clothes
More than Wilt Chamberlain switched up his hoes
I'm a profectionist, gotta stay on my toes
Anything goes when you play with the pro's
I got everybody rappin' about jewelry and cars
Lil' Kim give you a platinum sixteen bars
I'm the real thing, ya'll kareokee stars
This is who I am

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)

No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

I'd rather be dead and rich than broke and livin'
Without rap, I probably woulda been sellin' dope in prison
With some Vera Wang khakis and Nolteychucks
Suckin' the warden's dick in the back of the bus
But God made me what I am today
So I say things ya'll afraid to say
Just cause you got a head start that don't make you strongest
He who burns last, burns the longest
Fuck what they say about me
Fact is I'm the legacy of B.I.G
The Queen of New York, let's get this straight
I'm about to be elected mayor of 718
This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)

If you in the club

Ride the bar, Queen Bee baby
Mashonda on the hook

Swizz Beatz
You are listening to the Queen Bee

(Ah, ah, I get it, yeeeeeah, I run New York)

The bank don't stop cause they put me in cuffs
Still made money up in the can, what the fuck
I'd have a baby by you, baby, if you a billionaire
Write the check before I cum, just sign right here
I'mma stay rich
I ain't gon' die tryin' to spend my shit
I'mma die tryna spend your shit
Nowadays these rap niggas on some feminine shit
So I guess Queen Bee gon' be the man of this shit
Laughin' at these rap bitches on some amateur shit
They better off makin' a livin' on some janitor shit
Who the hell is this chick? She been out kinda long
Had one hot song, I'm sorry I missed it
Too busy being conceited, puttin' on my lipstick
Takin' trips out in Cali, chillin' with the Hiltons
Yeeeeeah, I'm chillin', Kim top billin'
With the top down, throwin' money through the ceilin'
I get it, the lifestyle that you only rap about
I live it, my man buy me cars that you hoes be rentin'
I'm classy like a Phantom, you a Honda Civic
Lil' Kim got your whole bank stopped, I get itYou might also like1Embed

Get it poppin' all night 'til like 4 somethin'
And then we right back at it 'round 6 somethin'
It's supposed to be girls night out
So you know he got my girlfriends cursin' me out
Sayin' that I'm whipped and he turnin' me out
No need for the gym 'cause he be workin' me out
For me, he got a huge appetite
Lick my ice cream like a tasty delight
The bond between us is tight
I heard duvet poppin' tonight but

I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight

Tonight it's just me and my boo
Candlelight dinner, sippin' some wine too
Lingerie see-through, you know how I do
Playin' slow jams to set the mood
Some Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, a little Anita
In the bed laughin' at Martin and Gina
All eyes on us like Brad and Angelina
No one can come between us
The things he do give me the chills
Like writin' out "I Love You" on hundred dollar bills
He don't even think about playin' the field
He in ecstasy without takin' the pills
He treats me like a queen I love the way he courts me
Makin' love in the Ferrari he just bought me
Playin' PlayStation Fight Night
I heard stereo poppin' tonight but

I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls

From the bed, to the kitchen, to the living room couch
We done blessed every room in this New York penthouse
Miami estate, house by the lake
We ain't watchin' pornos, we watchin' our own sex tape
I pour the Henny all over his jimmy
So when he stick it in me, he's drunk off of Kimmy
I make a nigga bust faster than a semi
'Cause Kimmy get the jimmy rock harder than a penny
Full body massage, champagne bubble bath
Then we make love on a bed made of cash
He can't get enough, he always ready to smash
He love how I'm shaped just like a hourglass
His niggas is tight, he chillin' with his wife
But they don't come before the love of his life
We in the crib havin' a pillow fight
I heard Lotus is poppin' tonight but

I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go

Yo, yo yo

Mis-Education of Queen Bee
Shout out to my girl Lauren
Yo, yo

It's funny how money change the situation
Some talk greasy on the radio station
They hatin' 'cause I'm the creation
My song spun in heavy rotation
Some wan' play Queen Bee like she dumb
I burn rappers like tannin' under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I'm the first lady there's no comparison
Since the trail I've tried to avoid violence
But if they come test we run for me gun
Let the Bee buzz if you don't wanna get stung
Kim been this way since, day one
I fear none but my status will scare some
Haters keep makin' false accusations
Always got my name in they conversation
Disloyal fools I'm still the champion

Dudes floss cash and they know they in debt
Never play the hoe, Queen Bee be the pimp
Can't slick talk I done heard that shit
Can't lie to a liar I reverse that shit
I run the club called the Players Residence
I'm not only a client, I'm the president
Did the crime, now the time you can't handle it
But I'mma play it out to it's full out extent
I came from the Stuy' project tenement
Style wild like a child off punishment
About me everyone got opinions
A lot of rap chicks but I'm still number one
Must be prepared 'cause the rain soon come

Let's smoke some lah, to this Mardi Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
It don't get no betta, than the trendsetter
Got a track for these rats (Tryna steal her cheddar)
Shake my thing all the boys start to sing
Shawty is a ten, think about me in his dreams
Nymphomanic, head like a brainiac
For those who slept Lil' Kim is back
And better than before, you thought it was impossible
Haters is sick need to check into a hospital
Prayin for my downfall like it was a Sunday
But it's over, you only get five minutes to shine
Now the game is mine
The streets crowned ya girl Miss Greatest of All Time
So follow me and I'll lead you the right way
Just sing along to the words I say, C'mon

These chicks sour, getting worse by the hour
And at the same time I'm cakin' up by the minute
But when you sick of hoeing, I can show you about pimpin'
I'm tryna put you onto game, pay attention
To how to grind, I'm bout a dollar not a dime
I'm color blind, to everything except a dollar sign
Bottom line, your career I break up
And take your shine like the feds did to Jacob
Well well well, I'll be damned
I shouldn't have to tell you who I am
But I'm the Notorious K-I-M
Your flow's got flaws like a chipped diamond
Oh yes, I've been watchin you, copy me
My spot's safe, got it on lock and key
I'm who you wanna be, but you can't be who you're not

Lyrical murderer, I'm servin' these haters like a waitress
Back to the basics

Sleepin' on Kim is a no-no (UGH)
The capital Q-B, now take it to the E-E
I'm bringin' things to light but you still can't see me

Can't stand the pain here's a Motrin child

So you mad motherfuckers mutter what you wanna
I ain't worried 'bout none of ya and I'll say it in front of ya
I hear the snakes hiss, talkin reckless
Thought I'd let it go and I wouldn't stress it
Haters in the street, y'all worse than the press is
And they all wanna hang like the charm on my necklace
Guess things just ain't the same for gangsters
How a snitch nigga make a record called wankstas?
Everything these haters do just to degrade ya
Only made me strong, I say thanks for the favor
Now the D.A., wanna give me time in the feds
I'm from Brooklyn, I could do that time on my head
Come down with my weave straight sittin on bread
At the gate, gettin picked up in a new Coupe Phantom

See I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, my nigga need bail
It's been a couple weeks and he been sittin' in a cell
The only way to reach him through phone calls and mail
Balloons stuffed with luh up in the chocha
Now my man in the can gettin' money and gettin' high
He used to keep my fly he had the 6 I had the 5
So you know a chick gon' ride or die for her guy
At age 14 I was puttin' on weight
At age 16 I was movin' the weight
Gettin paid for drivin' state to state
Smugglin' weight, prayin I don't bump into Jake
I travelled through a few places with the burners
In the suitcases, thank God for Big
Damn right I love the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all

Cowards huff and puff but won't blow shit down
I come through like two airplanes in midtown
Nigga my get back's the get down
Hit the big nigga first and make the rest sit down
They all talk loud, when they see you they quiet down
Faggots violated I wish they'd try now
Just watch how they bitch up, story start to switch up
Punks gettin left off right where I pick up
Picture in Vogue, Spring/Summer issue
Shoot game official like a ref with a whistle
You know when I do it I'm doin it monumental
Leave you speechless kinda like an instrumental
They ask me if I know what true happiness
Do I ever feel regret for all the things I did?
Hell no I love the life I live

On the red carpet in Marc Jacobs clothes

In your favorite fashion magazine they feature the Queen
On the cover of Don Divas, doin spreads with Eva

You see I'm somethin you never seen befo'
I know you see me cause I'm somethin that you can't igno'(ignore), ohh

Dipped fresh, hoppin out of a Rolls
In the town, ballin out of control

While you on your grind I'm on, beachfront property
Thirty-eight snub nose, keep the snitches off of me
Look the rest of your life, ain't gon' find a bitch as raw as me
Grateful's what you oughta be
I heard somewhere it cost to be the boss and I paid it
Floss with the greatest
Ball outrageous the broad is amazin
In the 6, grippin woodgrain lane changin
You coach flyin hoes need boss bitch trainin
I'm muy caliente, sizzlin hot flame
In private planes to Spain and you barely maintainin
You ain't talkin millions you ain't speakin my language
The Queen of the game and can't a damn thing change it

When the sun goes down and them guns come out
Them niggas that was talkin' they won't run they mouth
When them shells start poppin', bodies start droppin'
(It's so quiet you can hear a rat pissin' on cotton)

Do you see what I see, can you hear what I hear?
All these studio gangsters, year after year
With these gimicks I can't take it, they ain't real so they fakin' it
How did they make it in this game for so long?
I know what's right from what's wrong, I know what's soft from what's hard
I know a federal case from a publicity charge
Man I fought tooth and nail to keep them punks out of jail
But hoes wanna go to court 'til I pay them for their nails
Who you tryin' to be? Man, it couldn't be me
My man spent guap and bought me my Continental T
You spent your advance on your Continental T
I know you sick when you clean your rims you still see a Bee
And we see you a liar, tryna deny her
Jackie O. proved you far from a fighter
Comin' at me bitch, you playin' with fire
I ain't gon' come back at you, I'm comin' at your ghostwriters

When the sun goes down and them guns come out
Them niggas that was talkin' they won't run they mouth
When them shells start poppin', bodies start droppin'

I hear 'em talkin' like they gangster material
But I don't see it man their gangster's invisible
The hot iron's what them gangsters put into you
'Til you laid up and your gangster's on critical
Shots get into you bleedin' like my men-e-straul
And if I don't like you then I won't pretend to
It's the ones that befriend you that turn up against you
In the court of law and drop a dime like Sprint do
Supposed to be tough, huh? 'Til them boys touch ya
Chump muh'fuckers start confessin like Usher
I cut you off 'cause I knew I couldn't trust ya
Lame ass busters, backwards-ass hustlers
You fake phony, you always was lil' homey
Big lil' son baby' boy like Jody
I put you under my wing, bought you your first Roley
Nigga I helped raised you, why would I play you?

When the sun goes down and them guns come out
Them niggas that was talkin' they won't run they mouth
When them shells start poppin', bodies start droppin'
(It's so quiet you can hear a rat pissin' on cotton)

You see it always be them ones talkin' this and that
How they knife game ill and they gun go clap
Them niggas rats, they run and they trap
'Til they run in a trap, and there's no comin' back
It be the same ones talkin' 'bout the guns they sparkin'
The dogs never bite but do a whole lotta barkin'
A whole lotta growlin' 'til the wolves start howlin'
They pitbull shit, man them niggas straight cowards
Got 'em scared to death, pissin' in they trousers
Always was a bitch that's why I sent his ass flowers
Thanks to the queen he can share 'em with his team
You can run top speed but you can't dodge the
Got a clean 16 and my spit game mean
Don't be fooled and deceived, everythin' ain't what it seems
You act like you don't know what side of town this realer
Niggas softer than chinchillas but on wax they killers
When the sun goes down and them guns come out
Them niggas that was talkin' they won't run they mouth
When them shells start poppin', bodies start droppin'

When it's my last day, then it's my last day
But until that day, you can't take away
How they scream my name, how I pimp this game
Critically acclaimed, until my last day

Y'all better stand up or sit down, cause I'mma be here
Pull up a beach chair and pop you a Becks beer
I'mma live it up, 'til I'm a hundred with gray hair
Glass house in Bel-Air that's, high up in the mountain
Golden gates, and the brass water fountain
'Til my last day, I'm goin hard
And I ain't slowin up, 'til the Heliport's in my back yard
'Til my whole team sign they name on that black card
'Til I bring New York back, 'til I show you where I'm from
'Til I show you how it's done, show you why I'm number one
'Til my peeps is out the hood, 'til I buy my moms a jet
'Til I own my first island and cash a trillion dollar check
'Til I'm at the top of Forbes' richest lookin kosher
With my name and my picture, right next to Oprah
In negotiations with Bill Gates and his broker
'Til I'm with Jehovah it ain't over 'til it's over

Besides God, what the fuck should I fear?
The only one could stop me is that chick in the mirror
I built my career on, blood sweat and tears
And I'm still here, gettin stronger each year
Cause what don't kill me, could only help build me
I guess all that dirt just made me more filthy
If being loyal's a crime, then I'm so guilty
If you was missin a spine you'd still have to feel me
Some came and went but your girl is everlasting
'Til the day I'm gasping (gasping)
And niggas droppin tears on my Versace casket
And I'm, reunited with Big, like nigga what happened?
Shit got drastic, I missed you with a passion
By now they should realize I'm not the average rap chick
Ain't nuttin they could do now to stop my shine
This is God's plan homey, it ain't mine


Until my heartbeat stops, my flesh goes numb
And the last breath leaves my lung, I'll be
The big Q.B., the problem in Prada
The bitch that these rap hoes wanna become
I been hated on many times, adored and idolized
Check your stats, I'm all that, bottom line
It's all there in black and white, read it and weep
I'm the, perfect example of keepin it street
Cause when it's all said and done and at the end of the day
My actions spoke louder than whatever they say
Yeah I'll rep the hood, stood the test of time
So a cell'll hold my body and never my mind
So, never mind any of y'all petty tactics
I'm gettin fetty, movin through them tax brackets
Bitch you gotta be kiddin me, Kim's the epitome
I'm the ghost of Big so you could never get rid of me

Gotta get that money, that money, that money, money
You don't want no problems man, none if you get outta lane
We comin' like the Taliban, poppin' like a collar man
Cowards want to violate, then we got to demonstrate
You faggot niggas tellin', when we see you we be yellin'

Bitch I been trill ever since the day I came out my momma's cot
Come on down to that Dirty South, you gon' see I got it locked
I can go on any block and on any hood and on any town
Runnin' deep with money and jewelery and holdin' myself down
Connected to every heavy nigga across the U.S
My cocaine is the whitest and my diamonds are the bluest
My city is the trillest and my niggas are the truest
Got everything to gain and nothing to lose, so let's do this
We load 'em up, cock 'em back, let 'em go we knock 'em off
Cut off all his cake, rocks, and eggs, this nigga block 'em off
It's B-U-N for UGK, straight up out that B-A-T
Holdin' it down for K-I-M, reppin' for Pimp C, let's see 'em bitch


Big cars, big trucks, big nuts when it comin' up off the dust
Think it's funny 'til he comin' up out the club
Gonna getcha money when I'm comin' up out the cut
If I catch a nigga slippin', I'mma tell a nigga know that shit
Then I snatch that chain
When he leave his friends, I'mma get him out his ends
And his Benz, make him cash that train
Come out the dark and get the lights on
Turn together, get it up
Take his watch, take his bracelet, take his dust, take his truck
I can't help it to get itchy if I see the nigga ballin'
Nigga yes ya'll then I gotta get a piece of that
Steady figure with the Jacob in the bezel with charm
Well come over hear I got a little heat for that
AK-47 and the Desert Eagle with a sawed-off pump
Got a what, an E-95 with leather grip
And a Mac-11 comin' out the trunk
Got what, a black ski mask and leather gloves
And duct tape I can get what I want
Got what, when the Queen and the Twist ride on them bitches
We don't give a fuck

Now don't you know that they want to, catch you
Slippin with no protection
Lead you in the wrong direction
Every nigga around you is a reflection
Of you when you were at your lowest point in your life
Cause niggas wanna catch you slippin
(Don't let 'em catch you slippin)
They wanna catch you slippin (you've been slippin, slippin)

No more Mrs. Nice Bitch
Niggas done, flipped the script and got on some sheist shit
Sellin they soul when love is priceless
They kicked me when I was down and stuck in a crisis
I kept it all in and now I'm 'bout to erupt
Man, FUCK the law the whole system's corrupt
A street grudge put me in front of a judge
But I stood there like what, the Bee don't budge
It's a foul game, no such thing as fair play
And real niggas get railroaded everyday
Words misconstrued and used against you
Then you get screwed when it's time to sentence you
World cavin in, it's a shitty sitch-i-ation
A year and a day, three years probation
Public humiliation, poor representation
Guilty by association

I'mma stand up type, grew up in the projects
And that's worth more than material objects
A lot of things happen when they know you got it
You a target, and now they tryin to get in the pockets
Lawsuits, lawyers prosecute for profit
Meanwhile the media promotin the gossip
I had to say it, cause I'm that real with it
You shinin like a star, then you gotta deal with it
And dudes pick to take these groupies to bed
Better watch it 'fore they write a book about like Superhead
Fuck 'em and leave 'em then they after your paper
Put a hole in the condom and say that you raped her
See you can be a rapper, athlete or an actor
Believe me, these devils find a way to get at'cha
All it takes is some green and your face on the screen
Fuck it, just say I took one for the team
Now don't you know that they want to, catch you

In these streets you gotta sleep with one eye open
And watch for the snakes and the Jakes approachin
Cause it could be the ones that you laugh and joke wit
The ones you smoke wit, and sold your coke wit
I set you up for the right piece of change
And have your brains on the dashboard of the Range
Too often, I seen a nigga layin in the coffin
All cause some shit was blown out of proportion
Everywhere you go you gotta move with caution
Cause the rap game ain't much different than the crack game
It's the new hustle, gotta have brains and muscle
Get too much money and these haters wanna touch you
Now I can see why they all on me
Niggas do dirty work, the shit fall on me
Not only do you gotta watch the boys in blue
But the niggas in your crew you gotta watch them too
Now don't you know that they want to, catch you
Slippin with no protection

Shit is all different now man
Back then, they used to pay homage
For paving the way, for making it easier
To do what they do now
But they do now?
They run their mouth
But you know what?
Actions speak louder than words
(She's your queen to be
A vision of perfection
An object of affection
To quench your royal fire
Completely free from infection
To be used at your discretion
Where they owe me for your direction
Your queen to be
Queen to be, queen to be forever
To quench your royal fire
She's your queen to be, queen to be forever
To quench your royal fire
She's your queen to be, queen to be forever

Her feet are killin' her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime

And all my ghetto bitches in the projects
Comin' through like bulldozers
No, we ain't sober
Bum bitches know better than to start shit
Niggas love a hard bitch
One that get up in a nigga's ass quicker than an enema
Make a cat bleed then sprinkle it with vinegar
Kidnap the senator
Make him call his wife and say he never comin' home
Kim got 'em in the zone, beatin' they dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbin' their tits
What? I'm lovin' this shit, Queen Bitch!

While I get you fucked up off the T.O.N.Y

(On and on and on) like Erykah Badu
Once he drink the Remy down, ooh, I got this nigga now
He asked me did I love him I said what came to mind
Like niggas be doin': "Yeah baby, I love you long time"
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya, I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this
Niggas know he gave me all his cake
I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face

Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick
I'ma keep it real, for the dough I might kill
I'm tryna see my face on a hunnid dolla bill
Met this dude name Jaleel at this Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said "Whoa! Who's the other guy?
Hope you know you payin' extra for this fuckin' third eye"
Something about him, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth: "Fool, Give me my money!"
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars
Niggas ain't shit but they still can trick
All they can do for me is suck my clit
I'm jumpin' up and up after I cum
Thinkin' they gon' get some pussy but they gets none

Ay yo, come here, bitch

Yours is like Evander, seventy-seven slow

Two for five spots, I tear the rocks out
Pop the tops out, then clear the spot out
Nigga or bitch, you don't want no problems
My revolver is a quick problem solver

Cause bitches wanna start with Kim and I ain't with the arguing

Getting my Martha in while these broke hoes borrowing
I guess it's back to stashing guns in the bra again
Pulling bitches out they car again
These swagger jackers give the game a bad look
Pop shit on Twitter and apologize on Facebook
And now they wanna send me requests
Telling me that I'm simply the best
I won't stop till I see my enemies rest
They probably get locked up for identity theft
I ain't got time for bum bitches, the gun get it
I come with it, anything you tryna do, I done did it
I'll let you live for a while but I'm dying with the crown
The queen's back, bitches, come get it

If you spittin candy bars then it's fucking Pay Day
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, ayy!
20 bricks apiece, set the whole clique straight
It's more in the oven, we let them pies bake
And this is my party so we all eatin cake
A Rolly apple red now  in my drank
Like Cheddar Boy rapped, I keep a trap boy

Even titanics get washed away
He put his head between my legs
And he washed his face
Come and scuba dive
Inside my deep blue sea
Wanna ride this tidal wave?

Lick on the clit, I'll lick on the dick

Can't get it wet, I spit on shit

Suck it up sit back on the dick
Doggystle back it up on the dick
Get a grip on them hips, bite on my lips
Take it out cum right on my tits
