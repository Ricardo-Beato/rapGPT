10 ContributorsWhatta You Know Lyrics (3x)
B-Real:
Whatta you know? The nigga stole my dough
So I reached in the closet for the 4-4
 Jus' hold on, just wait a minute
It's gone, along with my big bad nickel-plated
Whatta you know? The fucker took my phone
I still can't believe that he robbed my home!
Whatta you know? I think he got to the herb
And the ferria, and the jewlery, and the Mossberg
Whatta you know? I can't find my keys to the 6-5
All the way live on D's
Whatta you know? I can't find my Rolex
With the 21 diamonds, shinin' on flecks
Whatta you know? When I find that mark-ass nigga
I'mma cut out his fuckin' heart!
Sen-Dog:
Whatta you know? I came up on this baller
For the dollar and the weed sack, and his Impala!
Whatta you think, when you can't trust your so-called homie
Like me, and you thought that you know me?
Whatta you feel, when you're lookin' in the closet
And the gat's gone, and so is your cellular phone?
Whatta you know? I took your loot and the jewels
With the buddah and the laptop in the nickel-plated tool!
Whatta you know? Now I run the show
With the phat pockets and the nigga's fly gold
Wahtta you think, when ya ass gets jacked
By a homie who was supposed to have your back?

Whatta you know? I'm rollin' in my zone
And I think I see the puto who rigged my home
 I got the Glock in the glove
Should I dump on the man, leave him lying in the mud?
Wahtta you know? He pulled out my 4-4
Now I got no choice, so I let it all flow
 The motherfucker's all blastin'
4-5 equal, in time for some tractions
 Slide action, no question
Forty-five slug is bad for your complexion
 The puto's cryin' like a bitch
Now the puto's lyin' in a fuckin' ditch!
B-Real (spoken):
 You can't even trust your fuckin' best homeboy these days, homes
 You got to sleep with one eye fuckin' open ...
 Payback's a motherfuckin' bitch!
 That puto should've watched his fuckin' back
