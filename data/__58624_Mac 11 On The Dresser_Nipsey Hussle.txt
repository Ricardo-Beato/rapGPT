17 ContributorsMac 11 On The Dresser Lyrics
It's like 2 o'clock in the studio
Backed up on the leaks, man, my shit crasp
But I'm back at you niggas though, you know?
I guess this fifty five thousand
So we gon' do it like this
Uh, Hussle, nigga
One take too
Look, uh

Mac 11 on my dresser drawer
Model bitches like, “Nipsey, what’s the weapon for?"
Niggas tryna take, I give 'em nothin' less than war
So what’s understood there is no explanation for
Put the box in concrete, then put the safe in floor
Extra thick carpet, that's what we laid it for
Young niggas gettin' money's what I make it for
Play this out your Range Rover and Mercedes door
Uh
I graduated from havin' haters
Now I see it all as fake love, so don’t congratulate us
And thank god for my imagination
I seen the vision, I’m in it, and now I’m after greatness
I know that God got me so I practice patience
Most the time I look inside and find the answers waitin'
Been tryna change my life but it’s aggravating
Making the same mistakes twice, I'm shackled to Satan
So Let's make a toast to the real niggas
Self-made success, know how it feel, nigga
Uh, now raise your glass to the real women
You know the one who man in jail but she still with him
Out here on her own but she deal with it
So I'm gon' tip my S-dome 'cause I'm feeling ya
I represent that any means necessary
Chopper in the window pane, lifestyle legendary
Been treated a lot of ways, it was never fairly
So we gon' shoot before we march like February
And they don't like when I rap like that
They rather I talk about the crime that's always black on black
And say, "Neighborhood of sixty Crip," in every rap
So they can play my tape in court and try to lock me up for that
But I'm cool
Tell them judges, "Look, I'm never goin' back"
It's a marathon, nigga, run a lap
Uh
You might also like
Fifty six thousand
All Money In, in
All Money In, in
No motherfuckin' money out, nigga
Alright, that's it, they good

You think I don't know that?
You know, what I know
How many times I been on the other end of that fuckin' phone?
Twenty six times
Ray, but you just got done saying you and Sonny Black are friends
You were, you know?
Donnie, I got sent for
In our thing, you get sent for
You go in alive, you come out dead
And it's your best friend that does it1Embed
