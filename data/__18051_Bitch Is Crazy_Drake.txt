21 ContributorsBitch Is Crazy Lyrics
Aww man
Ho! Yes!
Hahaha
Yeah... Can y'all hear me out there?
It's a lovely night tonight ain't it?
Yeah I know
I know what they thinkin' they ain't heard the beat they aleady scared
You know how I get down
But look I'm just gon keep it real

I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yeah
(Gotta be something wrong with you baby)
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up
(Ohh Yeah)
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)
You're the only one
That's causin me this drama
And then expect favors (Yea)
When you come in town
And I know if I see you guaranteed it's goin down

Too stay with this girl (Ho!)
You couldn't pay me!

But this bitch is crazy (Hahaha)

She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was sayin sometimes

I wanna wear the wife beaters
With the slit at the top so
