46 ContributorsSweet Dreams Lyrics
Turn the lights on

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on, yo)

Yo, Young Money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger, I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I’m rich, I could buy you
Kill bitches, leave their body in the Bayou
More brain than a IQ
More head than a dread, my youte
And my bank account ain’t hardly empty
That’s why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who’s next to go? My flows so flexible
Get gas, then get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plaxico
White jag wit' the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but "This Is It"
B-b-b-boo, I'm everywhere
You're like balloon boy, mama, you was never there
I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose, then its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander
Please, you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn’t even dare to be
So that's all folks, badabadee
I go hard, pause
Hospital flow, get more gauze
I'm a bad bitch on all fours
The President be like, "It's all yours"
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem and the ring, the queen and the king
You might also like
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part (No Ceilings)
What kind of dream is this?
You could be a sweet–

Uh, kush it out, red bone, pussy, mouth
Eat you up, spit you out, fuck your girl in yo' house
I’m terrible, be careful, you might want say a prayer or two
So cold, I need theraflu, I'm so high, I need parachutes
I'm error proof, I'm never spooked, got my coupe, heaven blue
And my flag red as hell, think you're sweet as devils food
I never lose, my weapons use
Fuck wit' me wrong, shit get ugly, Devin Dude
And she’s the queen, two’s a couple, three’s a scene
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams, get the pussy wet, Abita Springs
Hah, I'm Easter clean, shout to my home girl, Mika Means
Anything we want we redeem, you niggas gassed up, ‘93 Supreme
Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch, more than an artist, bitch
She talk a whole lot of shit and walk around like she President Carter's bitch
She be on her Barbie shit, and me? I'm on Tha Carter VI
And I can turn crumbs to bricks, and I can turn nuns to tricks
Hah, Young Mula baby, f-fuck your feelings
And this is No Ceilings, yeah
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

Either way I don't wanna wake up from you5Embed
