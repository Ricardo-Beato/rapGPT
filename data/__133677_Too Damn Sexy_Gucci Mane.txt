Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shawty show me something good
Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shawty show me wassup, wassup
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call

All the money I pass out and make a skinny girl get ass shots
Baller team you the mascot and wear gucci shoes to take trash out
Got a yellow bone, and a yellow car, and a yellow watch like lemonade
3 girl lemon like a dinnerdate
Big gucci don't discriminate
Got a black chick and she love Lenox
Spent 30 grand in 30 minutes
I stop hitting then get back in it
A strong back is recommended
She a shopoholic I'm a trapaholic
I capatilize she a capricorn
Put a bracelet on her that'd break her arm
I'm the last equipped and she the first to call
She a classy chick with nasty thoughts
Heads turn quick coz' the way she walk
I beat it up and then act all soft
Ever get caught cheating then it ain't my fault
Standing tall like Pau Gasol
I love to fuck and she love the mall
I drop the top and I drop the drawers
She love to text and I never call

Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shawty show me something good
Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shwaty show me wassup, wassup
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call

Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Hop in my ghini' like mario and dreddy
If I gave to you you can have it I don't want it back that's deadly
Got black girls and got white girls and got red girls that's lesbi's
Every night like new year, Money like I'm Freddy
Hoes kissing in my section, New York perfection
I'm so high undress it, Got up in the morning step in
Took her out for dinner and she here cooking me breakfast!

Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shawty show me something good
Too damn sexy
Too damn sexy
What's all the talking shwaty show me wassup, wassup
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never call
Baby girl you ready, Know that I'm ready
Drop the top and she drop the drawers, she love to text and I never callEmbed
