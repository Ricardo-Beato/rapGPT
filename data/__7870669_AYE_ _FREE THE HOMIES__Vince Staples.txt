39 ContributorsAYE! (FREE THE HOMIES) Lyrics
Ah, ah
If everybody over here stopped so much hurt, stopped so much anger in they heart
We done lost a gang of homeboys
A lot of people, a lot of my friends got hurt
Nobody's got a lotta anger in here, so first thing, we gon' snap at it

Trophy in the hood, ayy
Wish a nigga would, ayy
Got my weight up (My weight up)
Now I'm feelin' good, ayy (Feelin' good tonight, yeah)
Now a nigga on, ayy (Feelin' on tonight)
I done came a long way
If I had one wish, (Free the homies)
I'd free the homies

Shoot a nigga momma if she out while we slidin'
Go up in the house, cuh, this shit get violent
Better keep your mouth shut if we hear sirens
I'ma be on Death Row just like Suge Knight and 'nem
I stand ten toes, I'm not no buster
Seen him by the WinCo, worked on my jumper
Baby know I'm hotter than the city in the summer
'Fore I leave the house, I gotta tell her that I love her, yeah
I don't know if I'ma make it home
These niggas ain't gangbangin', they just singin' songs
I done seen it all, bloodshot eyes
Broke my heart, then decided that I'm still outside
Took a loss, took a risk, now I'm back in the mix
Watch who you keepin' around when you wish
Money ain't make me
Still thuggin' 'til the Feds come take me, mean muggin'
You might also like
Triflin' in the hood, ayy
Wish a nigga would, ayy
Got my weight up (My weight up)
Now I'm feelin' good, ayy (Feelin' good tonight, yeah)
Now a nigga on, ayy (Feelin' on tonight)
I done came a long way
If I had one wish (Free the homies)
I'd free the homies

Foot up on the gas, hunnid on the dash (On the gas)
Lowerin' the stats, thirty in the mag (In the man)
Hung on Cherry Ave, I ain't go to class (No way)
They don't say, "Wassup," 'cause they know it's that (Dead homies)
In too deep, I ain't with the peace
Wanna end the beef? Tell them niggas, "Bring my homies back" (Dead homies)
Free the killer, he was on attack, yeah (Free the hood)
Bitches wanna know my zodiac (Ayy, ayy)
Every time I fall in love, baby do me bad (Bad)
Givin' up while I woulda gave it all I had
I would never chase the cat, rather chase a bag
Have fun, life short while you livin' fast (Have fun)
I'm a nigga in the set, baby, go and ask (I'm a nigga in the section)
Never go out sad, give the boys my last (Uh-huh)
If I die today, they gon' go and crash (Ayy, yeah)
That's on Tiny Scrap, that's on Lil Half, ayy
Trophy in the hood, ayy
Wish a nigga would, ayy
Got my weight up (My weight up)
Now I'm feelin' good, ayy (Feelin' good tonight, yeah)
Now a nigga on, ayy (Feelin' on tonight)
I done came a long way
If I had one wish (Free the homies)
I'd free the homies
