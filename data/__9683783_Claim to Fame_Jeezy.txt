Yeah
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League
Yeah

The ups, the downs, the highs, the lows
The love, the hate, the love, the hate, the pain (Pain)
You win, you lose, you lose, you win
You win, you lose, it's all just part of the game (Game)
You grind, you grind, you grind, you grind
You grind, you shine, until you build a name
You cap, you fake, you snake, until they need you

I been known lil' Jay, I used to go to school with him
Lil' dirty niggas wasn't on shit
Least two times a week, wore the same outfit
Back when him and lil' Meat was on some same house shit
Right across from the ball court, 616
Back when Rod had the Volkswagen rabbit, it was clean
Him and Corey in that dusty blue Regal
Barely kept gas in that motherfucker
Headliner fallin' from the ceilin'
Still act an ass in that motherfucker
Now he talkin' all the bricks, I remember rocks, nigga
All this motivation shit, what you think you Pac, nigga?
You don't keep it one hundred, you don't rep the block, nigga
We love you like our own, but now you just an opp, nigga
Your lil' time runnin' out, you better check your watch, nigga
I got a mixtape droppin', I'ma need a drop, nigga
You might also like
The ups, the downs, the highs, the lows
The love, the hate, the love, the hate, the pain (Pain)
You win, you lose, you lose, you win
You win, you lose, it's all just part of the game (Game)
You grind, you grind, you grind, you grind
You grind, you shine, until you build a name
You cap, you fake, you snake, until they need you

Yeah, look, look
Seen him on BET the other day
All that leather on like he Max Max or somethin'
Real nigga always talkin' 'bout he real
Then why the fuck I gotta come and ask for somethin'?
Weren't for niggas like me, none of this would happen
Whole entire world would've thought that boy was cappin'
I'm a real nigga too, shit, I should've been th eone
I am shinin' every day, shit, I should've been the sun
I ain't gon' lie that boy used to get a bag
Back when G Boy and Tone Capone used to get a half
Hop in Brent car, you used to take it there his self
Now he actin' all funny that he got a lil' wealth
Nigga, you'll never be a legend like Biggie
Nigga, you'll never have a billion like Diddy
Nigga think he on top but he ain't went far
Nigga, you just like us, nah, you ain't no star
The ups, the downs, the highs, the lows
The love, the hate, the love, the hate, the pain (Pain)
You win, you lose, you lose, you win
You win, you lose, it's all just part of the game (Game)
You grind, you grind, you grind, you grind
You grind, you shine, until you build a name
You cap, you fake, you snake, until they need you
