Drumma Boy
I got dope, I got dope, boy
I got dope, I got dope, boy
I got dope, I got dope, boy
I got dope, I got dope, boy

I got work, I got work
I got work, I got work
I got pills, I got pounds, I got syrup to serve
I got work, I got work
I got work, I got work
I got pills, I got pounds, I got syrup to serve
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, work
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, work, work, work

Like a nigga turned around, I'm goin' back to work
J's in my hood call me Gucci Captain Kirk
Get you higher than a motherfuckin' mountain lion
Who knew at 9 I'd live a fuckin' life of crime?
Young, black and proud, send a bag of loud
I got a van, but I really need a tractor trailer
Tryna murk the swamp, I'm tryna flood Decatur
Had a team full of girls just to count the paper
I'ma bag the paper, then smash the haters
When I'm whippin' up show like mashed potatoes
I'm a orchestrater, I'ma choreograph
Get to tell 'em where to take it, telegraph
It's so much work, its got me laughin'
If you don't pay me, you'll have me spazzin'
If I don't front him, then I'm crabby
If you don't pay me, then I'll stab ya
Ten years goin' with no complaints, Pyrex pots in kitchen sinks
I'm cookin' 'caine and pushin' pints, since sellin' green done made me bank
You might also like
I got work, I got work
I got work, I got work
I got pills, I got pounds, I got syrup to serve
I got work, I got work
I got work, I got work
I got pills, I got pounds, I got syrup to serve
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, work
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, work, work, work

Smoke a blunt, kush break, then I'm back to work
You would think I'm carpoolin' when you see my vert
'Cause the paint is so wet, it make her pussy squirt
26's on the skirts, it took a lot of work
Stupid diamonds, yeah, they had to dig these out the dirt
The white girl in the trunk and I let her flirt
A couple bales of marijuana get a nigga hurt
He found out I found his boss man and now his feelings hurt
She like, "Damn, you got some nerve," I just like to splurge
I didn't mean to pin you, baby, I just like your curves
She want me to be her man, but it won't work
She know I spoil all my bitches 'til they won't work
I got work, I got work
I got work, I got work
I got pills, I got pounds, I got syrup to serve
I got work, I got work
I got work, I got work
I got pills, I got pounds, I got syrup to serve
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, work
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, I got work
Work, work, work, workEmbed
