4 ContributorsWilt Chamberlain (Part 2) Lyrics
Trash can, kush bag, got the club fucked up
Told Icy ain't rich, bitch, you got me fucked up
Hustlers, hustlers, y'all niggas is suckers
You a bad bitch, but I wish I never fucked her
Straight drop, glass, got me takin' all your 
 got me clear as snow bricks, call me cash out
 havin' ass, nigga, why ya got your hand out?
Aqua, teal paint, did it just to stand out
Bouldercrest Road, nigga, Sun Valley trap house
Like a bitch, yeah we call that bitch the mansion
If you fuckin' underage girls, you a Chester
One thing Gucci is not is a molester
Twenty-nine year-old lady, she successful
Fine in some jeans, but look better when shе dress up
Girlfriend fine, but shе ugly from the neck up
Pillow on her face, and I beat her like she stole some
Gucci Mane rich, everybody wanna hold some
Two big balls and a dick, wanna hold that?
Baby girl suckin' on my dish, she need to slow down
Hold down, baby 'cause you just too muchYou might also likeEmbed
