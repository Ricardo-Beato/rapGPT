3 ContributorsSky’s the Limit (Radio Edit) Lyrics
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight? (Alright)
I'd like to welcome to the stage (Alright, alright)
The lyrically acclaimed (Woo), ha (Woo)
I like this young man
Because when he came out (Hahahaha), he came out with the phrase
"He went from ashy to classy," haha, I like that (Alright, alright)
So everybody in the house give a warm (Uh)
Round of applause for The Notorious B.I.G. (Ha)
The Notorious B.I.G, ladies and gentlemen, give it up for him, y'all (Uh)

A **** nevеr been as broke as me, I like that
Whеn I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pinstripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While **** flirt, I'm sewin' tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You wanna see the inside? Huh, I'll see ya later
Here come the drama, "Oh, that's that **** with the fake"
Blaow, "Why you punch me in my face?" Stay in your place
Play your position (Uh), here come my intuition (Uh-huh)
Go in this **** pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And **** clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with 'em, stole with 'em
I mean loyalty, **** bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch
'88 Oshkosh and blue and white Dunks, pass the blunt

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go 'round
Plus I'm ****, **** ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in ****, **** packin'
Nickname Medina, made the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés, pass off a global
The only **** with a mobile, can't you see like Total?
Gettin' larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' **** with ****, real-life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Begin to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart
Break it down into sections, **** by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & **** like my **** was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustler's Prayer
"If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand"
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase "Sky's the limit"
See you chumps on top
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep onEmbed
