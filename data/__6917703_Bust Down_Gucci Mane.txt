I'm icy, bitch, the reason that it's froze up
Got lil' kids wanna be me when they growed up
Wrist all rocked up, charm all chunked up
Ring so big, got my pinky finger swole up
Pull up to my club, red carpet roll-out
Feeling like a star player, I might pull a whole lot
Bitch in a Lamborghini, she just did a donut
DropTop Wop, got more Glocks than a pawn shop
Hoes so fine, in the summer got the toes out
Niggas gettin' money, get drunk, they like to show out
Shout out to the landlord who know that's the old house
Put some diamonds in the golds like the old South
Asked me for a diamond in her nose, I said "Woah, now"
Pay attention, diamonds in the Rolls, we in the truck now
I just put some diamonds in the ceiling, what the fuck, now
Keisha got ice, got everybody bust down
You might also like
Bust down, bust down, everybody bust down
I don't got much feeling in my heart, who can I trust now? (No)
Bust down, bust down, everybody bust down (Wop)
Playin' with my money, lotta people gotta duck down (Bow)
Bust down, bust down, everything bust down (Bling)
Rolling with some certified hitters in the truck, now (Woah)
Bust down, bust down, everything bust down (Huh)
Hit him in the gut, he ran, they shot him in the butt, wow (Yeah)
It's Guwop
The iciest man alive
They askin' me how do I survive
Burr

I keep an assassin that's on payroll in the cut, now
I got that hush money, say the word, your business shut down
I don't put my sniper in IG, he play the background
I can't take him every place I be, they check his background
Nigga tried provoke me, I done bust, so now it's that now
He used to be my dawg, but now he act just like a cat now (Pussy)
Used to be stuck but now I'm up, I got a sack now
Treat me like a king, this Atlanta, this ain't Sac town (Atlanta)
Every time I cop a new piece, it's something to chat about (Chat)
He tried to play bully on the bargains then got scratched out (Stretched)
Gucci Mane took all his juice, handcuffed him, and went cash cow (Cash)
On jewelry I done spazzed out, my watch, it cost a stash house
Bust down, bust down, everybody bust down
I don't got much feeling in my heart, who can I trust now? (No)
Bust down, bust down, everybody bust down (Wop)
Playin' with my money, lotta people gotta duck down (Bow)
Bust down, bust down, everything bust down (Bling)
Rolling with some certified hitters in the truck, now (Woah)
Bust down, bust down, everything bust down (Huh)
Hit him in the gut, he ran, they shot him in the butt, wow

Yeah, the ice like Richie Rich
Icier than a bitch (Bling, blaow)
Dig what I'm saying? (Diggity)
Big Guwop (Big Guwop)
