Yea, sound good too
The piano man

You should come around my way!
Let  stay, everyday's a holiday
Already know we don't play
But you could come around my way

Pimpin' in the worst way
I fall up in this bitch so quick
Happy birthday!
Celebrate, drink up, get your cake up
Baby pick up your bank up
The music is cranking

Laws outdoors plotting and thinking
Dip off through the backdoor in a 7, 6, lincoln
Flammable, flavour, flavourfull baby
Interchangeable and available, baby

Combination like fries with fishsticks

It's my birthday, so break my gifts off
Computers screens and buddha green
Doggy Dog is the king, baby boo you the queen
And I'm, I'm much meaner than 
I'm feaning her body
Lodi dodi convening her potty
Extremely naughty
Go ahead and beam me a 
Cause this is a D.P.G.C party
Happy birthday!

Everyday's your birthday if you fuck with me

Yeah, it's your birthday
Happy birthdayEmbed
