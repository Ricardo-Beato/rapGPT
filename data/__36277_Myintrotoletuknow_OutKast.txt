Boy

Time and time again, see, I be thinkin' about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out
Or even pull your fuckin' heater to make his whole crew believers
You harder than a bitch, you're full of dicks
But that don't be soundin' like King Shit to me
Seen out in the ghetto, or should I be sayin' Lakewood?
You better be strapped 'cause them niggas over there just ain't good
Just bein' a hustler, servin' the loyal customers
Rent was due on the first of the month, so I'm hustlin'
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggas be wantin' drinks and shit from the fuckin' sto', yo
But that's a'ight, though, 'cause I be gettin' paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm diggin' through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that dime

If you smoke a dime, yeah, then I'll smoke a dime, yeah
If you smoke a dime, yeah, then I'll smoke a dime
(Big Dre, let 'em know what's up)
You might also like
Time is slippin', slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm havin' a ball, makin' my nickel sacks crawl
'Til my niggas got to servin' when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rollin' reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
From bein' rough, from bein' tough, from bein' dangerous?
I'm hangin' with the P.A. niggas, ain't no changin' us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke
If you got some fire shit, yo' niggas gonna always toke
Dope is not what I be slangin' on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right? You bite, you fucked up
You won't be gettin' away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up?
I rip shit wit' pimp shit, I'm slangin' it from the South
Talk bad about the A-Town, I'll bust you in your fuckin' mouth
It's true that, that's so true that
You smoke one... yeah
If you smoke a dime, yeah
(Like that for the A-Town)
Say I'll smoke a dime
(It might be a while, just to let you know)
If you smoke a dime, yeah
(Yeah, like that)
Then I'll smoke a dime, yeah, yeah5Embed
