5 ContributorsShe Loves My Not Lyrics
I was a sad boy, I liked the sad chicks
Protest the process, problem addicts
She holds me accountable for all of the damage
But we were both digging through the trash trying to find a sandwich
Back when a kiss used to taste like a Camel
Back when we used to play the game just to gamble
We used to ride around the city on a surfboard
Working towards trying to afford a spot on the first floor
Yeah, I guess if you say so, we was comfortably numb in the back of a Rainbow
Choking on the same smoke, looking at the same show
Can't even remember what I came for
What? My name ain't known in the traps or the streets
But it rolls off the tongue like fuck the police
And now you're back up in the city getting sniffy
You only miss me when you're tipsy

She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not

Ain't nothing changed but the coping mechanisms
There ain't an algorithm that can hold you in position
And when the bars close, we can drink it in the alleyway
When my heart goes, give thanks to my family
You're trying to use my soul as a weapon
I stole it back and took a selfie of my own reflection
And y'all can eat me and suck the skeleton
After I climb into that hole and go to heaven, seven
There's nowhere to stand and no space to share
Used to hold my hand, I used to hold your hair
Stay over there
You're still acting like I'm, I'm supposed to care
You might also like
She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not

Let's make a wish on a falling star
Like please don't let the star fall on me
Gotta handle my biz and try to catch a little bit
So I can teach my kids the same impractical shit
Must be something in the gutter running with the rainwater
Everybody wanna be popular with the name-droppers
They'll find me on the side of the rode
A la mode, don't even look at me, v√°manos
I remember when forever didn't seem like what took you so long?
Got me counting down the numbers trying to push it along
And if I'm wrong, I'll admit I was wrong
And probably try to make it fit in a song
I don't know what to do, there's so much info
The sky is the roof and my phone's a window
Just put your hands in the air and hit follow
What a time to be alive and scared of tomorrow

She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not
She loves me, she loves my not5Embed
