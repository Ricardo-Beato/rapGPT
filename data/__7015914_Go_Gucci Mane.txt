22 ContributorsGo Lyrics
Go, go, go, go
So I fuck her one time and I let her go
Go, go, go, go
All them twenty thousand ones and I let 'em go
Go, go, go, go
Got a stupid bankroll and I let it go
Go, go, go, go
Who need to talk when on top you can let it go

Sitting low on the wood floor
But you can see me from the nose bleed
Red diamonds, they a nose bleed
Zay done turned me to the old me
Back to business and I'm back to speeding
Back talking about these birds and V's
Yellow Ferrari, y'all know me
Crawling down the street like centipedes
Bitch sucking me up like Dracula?
Diamonds on spectacular
Flipping this work like spatulas
Gucci Man and I'm a bachelor
Trapezoid so I'm paranoid
All this time I just avoid
Since I'm a star and I'm up to par
She kissing on my private parts
You might also like
Go, go, go, go
So I fuck her one time and I let her go
Go, go, go, go
All them twenty thousand ones and I let 'em go
Go, go, go, go
Got a stupid bankroll and I let it go
Go, go, go, go
Who need to talk when on top you can let it go

First to run it at Benihana
Me and a gun, sharper than piranhas
Cold world and they trying to farm us
Get all these numbers like ten something
Fuck a bitch and erase her number
Foreign bitches, I don't do Hondas
I keep the runners I go hiding, ninja
I make so many damn commas
We at the city in the day time
Me and Big Gucci make big cake
Freebandz and Bricksquad
Got free bricks and you niggas hate
Broke niggas get out my way
Or I'll throw a hundred dollars in your face
Let a hundred ones fall down your face
I'm an astronaut, get out my space
Go, go, go, go
So I fuck her one time and I let her go
Go, go, go, go
All them twenty thousand ones and I let 'em go
Go, go, go, go
Got a stupid bankroll and I let it go
Go, go, go, go
Who need to talk when on top you can let it go

R-O-C-K-Okay okey-doke man that's all I know
Living life too fast, heart can't go slow
Oh yeah, no brakes, I was born on "go"
Can-Mex-City I fucks with Sco
Get all the attention when I walk in the door
Throw it in the air, watch 'em get it off the floor
Then stop keep score, I don't count no more
I'm so G, I'm too G ho
B.O.G., I was born on "go"
Whole world waiting on the G.O.G
Y'all niggas be cool everything g-o
Yes, yes, yes, that's all you gon' hear
Never met a ho yet ever tell me no
Two things I ain't never seen before
A U.F.O. and a hard that won't go
Go, go, go, go
So I fuck her one time and I let her go
Go, go, go, go
All them twenty thousand ones and I let 'em go
Go, go, go, go
Got a stupid bankroll and I let it go
Go, go, go, go
Who need to talk when on top you can let it go1Embed
