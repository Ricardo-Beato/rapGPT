8 ContributorsSo What Lyrics
Ayy, Cardo, I ain't go level ten yet
Please let me go level ten
Shoot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo
Please
Cardo got wings
Yeah, woah
Yeah, woah, woah, woah

Big who, blue dice, big money, that’s nice
You poppin', so what? So what? So what?
Top down, pull up, hot boys, that's us
You poppin’, so what? So what? So what?
Big who, blue dice, big money, that's nice
You poppin', so what? So what? So what?
Top down, pull up, hot boys, that's us
You poppin', so what? So what? So what?

Every time I fall up in this bitch, I go up
Oh, you got a bad bitch, so what?
Oh, you got a fast whip, so what?
I'm offended, man, that shit is not us
She beat a bitch up if I'm too apologetic
Whippin' white bitch, that boy smokin’ Kylie Jenner
She want a pet, hop on a jet, yeah, pussy my dinner, woah
Hit then I dip, checkin’ my phone, blowin' me up ’cause I did her, woah (Ayy, ayy)
Yeah, she put Baby Keem on her license plate (Ayy, ayy)
I am way too real, I can't hang with fakes (Ayy, ayy)
Put that ass to bed, I call that a date (Ayy, ayy)
Make some fuckin' room, bitch, you in my way
You might also like
Big who, blue dice, big money, that's nice
You poppin’, so what? So what? So what?
Top down, pull up, hot boys, that's us
You poppin', so what? So what? So what?
Big who, blue dice, big money, that's nice
You poppin', so what? So what? So what?
Top down, pull up, hot boys, that's us
You poppin', so what? So what? So what?1Embed
