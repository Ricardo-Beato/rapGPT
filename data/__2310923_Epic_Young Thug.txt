11 ContributorsEpic Lyrics
She say she like my Audemar
Beemer coupe, take off the top, baby no Mardi Gras
Standin' in this kush with all this cash on me
I got goons in this bitch with red rags on 'em
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down

I'm a motherfuckin' martian
Spend a whole mil on my closet
Try to sign me for 1.5? Only put 500 on marketing
What the fuck is you talkin'?
Baby my whole crew, we're the bosses
Baby my whole crew really flexin'
Baby your whole crew just barkin'
Whew, my pinky ring came from Venus
Whew, my earlobe paid with Serena
Whew, yeah, we fiendin'
My whole young crew we the bullshit
They'll wet a nigga up that Katrina
Uh, okay, check me how, how I ride the beat
And I ride a freak
20 years old with an old soul, I survived the streets
No apology
Young Future, she noticed me
Cause her boyfriend not cold as me
I guess my jewelry mean somethin' like it's a trophy
You might also like
She say she like my Audemar
Beemer coupe, take off the top, baby no Mardi Gras
Standin' in this kush with all this cash on me
I got goons in this bitch with red rags on 'em
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down

Ugh, you piped down so I turnt up
I'm a geek monster, need two cups
I'm a big freak, need two bitches
Get so much dope money nigga I ain't got time for livin'
And my big coupe but forgot the top
Made 100k like a (?)
In South Beach on Ocean Drive
I got goons with me and they bleed that five
Spent 500 on some Robin Jeans
Got a groupie bitch, she'll fuck team
Got three main, no (?)
Not turned up to the MAS
Spent 500 in LAX
(?) so free my ass
She say she like my Audemar
Beemer coupe, take off the top, baby no Mardi Gras
Standin' in this kush with all this cash on me
I got goons in this bitch with red rags on 'em
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down

Have you ever counted 200,000?
Straight cash in a project house
And these school boys would know nothin' about it
FN on the Holy Bible
Paranoia won't take a shower
Spent 50 bands in a cool hour
I'll drop the top man word law
Sellin' dope, she knew double R
Smokin' kush blunts while I double cup
Louie belt hold the pants up
Duffle bag with that tan stuff
Got two spots rollin' like the blunt
But that Zone 3 what I represent
Red beam in my residence
Protect it up like the president
Say the wrong word and gone kill shit
MMG what I represent
125 where I live with
Still hand in hand with that white shit
Big bells and them clean bricks
Turn a regular bitch to a bad bitch
Drink a whole nine to half a brick
Turn a rental car to an M6
Nigga I been rich
She say she like my Audemar
Beemer coupe, take off the top, baby no Mardi Gras
Standin' in this kush with all this cash on me
I got goons in this bitch with red rags on 'em
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down2Embed
