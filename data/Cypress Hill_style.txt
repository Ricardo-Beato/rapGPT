Who do what you do?
You're the tip of the fucking speer
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

I'm at a strange point of my life, my spirit ignites
I'm destined for heights, I'm so solid with the quest of the life
I'm under pressure but the time is right
For me to look inside of myself, time passes by every night
I'm searching for answers meanwhile my faith is a prize
And my neighbors are looking at me with hate in their eyes
Grinding their teeth, the streets filled with death and lies
Was set up to die but we plant seeds to rise
So when the day comes pray some miracle will keep it protected
Some of us have gotta go but you know it you expect it
I gotta believe in more than I see
In something better than this, whatever it is
I need it quick before my feeling is gone
Maybe my feeling is wrong
But I'll embrace it like a beautiful song
I feel something strong coming along
I can't explain what it is, but I'm relaxed till my mind is gone

Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away

This feeling is hitting me hard, my soul is scarred
The feeling is all like I'm getting a message from God
Believin' in cause, no one believes in the laws
The reason the straw breaks, a soul is lost
I'm searching for my soul in the mist of all this insanity
Out of vanity my home is a war zone calamity, randomly
Tragedies happen I'm sick of this life
I'd give in a minute if it could free us from strife
Gotta bond with the new brothers, leditucci and
Cheddars survival of our mothers would be proud of us
When the day comes and we rise to the height of our faith
And nothing can touch us, we don't the feel the mothers
Now the beast inside of my head, the life that I led
Left me for dead and lost on the path that I tread
I've laid so many to rest, from family to friends
We pretend it doesn't happen, but when will it end?
Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away

I gotta new thought in my mind in a matter of time
I'll be in a sublime state of the spiritual kind
My family is holding me high, they're nervous inside
I can see in their eyes pride but the eyes don't lie
If the celebration continues I'll follow my heart
And my home is being infected from the poisonous dart
It's fallin' apart, I don't wanna see its demise
So I'mma have to make a difference to remember I tried
My brother and sister smiling as I leave in the night
My mother kisses me on the cheek and my father is quiet
No words need to be said as my patters begun
'Cause nothing can break the chain of a father and son
As I take a step in the street where my destiny lies
Trying to focus, my nerves got my stomach in ties
Rollin' in a club, goddamn these people are young
What needs to be done, so I'll reach you over the ho
Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away
Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain awayEmbed

Si la lluvia cae, pronto miraras

Atrapado por mi clicka en el auto

My steel is stainless it will leave you brainless
Young and famous, we run LA
Its all city and can nobody take it
Honey's are waitin'
Backstage at the show they wanna run with the crew
Half-ska but as cool as a fan
With theis moc in my hand Imma stay true to my friends
With this gun in my hand, I stay true to the streets
If you say you are a dealer you have to prove it me

So much game, fools beggin' for a seminar
You want a bong hit, homie what you beggin' for?
I bring the static when you act dramatic
Got a mix up my sleeve call me Mister Magic

It's automatic, Pete Rock and the Hill
Now that's a classic, ya gots to have it
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
We'll put you in the dirt if you fuck with' us BUST

I'm a natural and I ain't neutral
Come and learn somethin', homie, you can be my pupil
Get out of pocket? Sorry! Yes, my homies'll boot you
Film it on the cam then we put it on YouTube

They try to say I operate with a screw loose
And who am I to say I ain't packin' a deuce-deuce?
Last day out quick to give you a new suit
And a pine box that you better get used to

I was listening to those watto's Cypress Hill!
You ever heard of them holmes?
(Yeah, I heard of 'em... They fuckin' suck!)
Are you fuckin' stupid, eh?

Those watto's are feed man, Holmes! (Naaaahhhh!)

This is for those haters and imitators
Take your medicine, you won't like the flavor
The taste ain't sweet, we lace that beef
Never forget how we play in the street
Never forget what you say in the street
If you talk too loud, get laid with the heat
We want that cake and Jay. - You can't stop us
Out the gate we take those dollars

Me and the dogs we rock steady pushin' the Hill shit
We flip scripts like dough boys clip bricks
Get money like lottery quick picks
We stick with it and homie, I'm quick witted
Still in the game and sane we still spit it
Top level, livin' like a rebel
Settle down bitch while we skip that medal

I came up in the game doin' my thang for the paper
Never gon' change, bringin' bang on the haters
They used to gang bang on the corner black came out
Drop then sayin': "Not the world for this flava"
I remember when you niggas used to front on me
Everywhere I ride, kept the gun on me
I only used to listen to my one O.G
He said: "Get money, but stay low key"
So it's a payback with pain in the back
The whole world gettin' high when I say it on the track
And I say it with a gat, I never gon' slip
Fuckin' hit 'em up, if you ever wanna trick
All it takes is a hit and you never forget
When you smoke on the Hill, wanna kill level twist
Fuck a shot, we drinkin' the whole fifth
Then I ride with them killa G's, know we don't miss

Came back to life for your protection
Back from the dead of resurrection
We came to change the whole complexion
Take this game a new direction

Last stop where the gas popped
When the kush blows free and the low-lows drop
This photo-op, no flash, we smash, get cash
Cash out the fuckin' spot

It’s a new day to build, expect the Hill
We grab the wheel, the trip is real
Don't make me pull out the steel
And cause a commotion, emotions kill

Heat-seekers, if you come seek us
Serve your asses through your weak speakers
Anyone, anywhere, we on jack
Blowing up another spot with the bomb track

Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Kill em up, tear em up, put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If he acts tough, shut him up, gun 'em down
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Gettin' high, let 'em ride, put 'em down
Jump jump jump jump
If you don’t give a fuck, throw 'em up, put 'em down

Still print that real shit
I'm the dog in the cut that's real hard to deal with
How long have we held you down
And broke down doors with that grimey sound?

No surrender, we push and enter
Take over the scene and blaze the green
Put a chill through ya body when you saw my teeth
Find yourself in the middle where the pit convenes

Don't slip on the misfits
'Cause the minute you pop shit, the mic gets twisted

Anytime, anywhere we blast off
The riot starts as you party your ass off
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Kill em up, tear em up, put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If he acts tough, shut him up, gun 'em down
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Gettin' high, let 'em ride, put 'em down
Jump jump jump jump
If you don’t give a fuck, throw 'em up, put 'em down

We blow smoke in the air to heal the nation
Gettin' you high no hesitation
So hard to charge, no complication
Take another hit for inspiration
Legalize don’t criticize
'Cause one day you might understand who we symbolize
Any man, any woman gotta like that
FEDS trying put a case, gotta fight back

We flip shows, like Flipmode
We make you bounce on the track with sick flows and get doe
Don't trip in the mosh pit
It's a danger to strangers, results are toxic
We're phenomenal, so unstoppable
Unlimited, you're just comical
Stay back, with slayed jack (way back)
Payback's a bitch and we know how to play that
Bounce bounce bounce bounce

Ready, set, go, I'm ready to run
Steady we get doe under the sun
About to let go, show me respect though
This will effect your soul and your mental
We came from the bottom and rose to the top
Like the cream in your coffee - burning hot
Climbing the Billboard for the number one spot
King of the block - stop for a second to watch
Look and learn and loose your knot
No more bottles to pop, no birds in the drop
But - we still rollin'! (we still rollin'!) - Pocket's swollen. (pockets swollen!)
We're locked and loaded, then the scene exploded
We solid as ever on any endeavor
Cypress Hill forever, doesn't get any better
We - came and saw, we conquered it all
But we're hungry for more like the kids in Darfur

We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We on God, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just say it with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us

I'm the dog and I'm undisputed and you've been recruited
I'm the general that your boy saluted
Give you a minute to see how we do it
You've never seen such finesse cause you're so polluted
I'm the king in the city of Stone Gate
Knocked 'em out the park when I'm standing at home plate. (c'mon!)
So many years of blood sweat and tears
Without  the dogs steady switchin' the gears
But I'm still the same man from back in the day
And I'm still gettin' luck from Africa to L.A
Jake One hit play; burst started to sway
Every time I leave the city fools want me to stay
'Cause they stay loyal, so it's harder to go
And like the weed under the lights I gots to grow
That means I'll roll (I'll roll!) but I'll return later
Give props to my people, buckshots to haters (buck, buck)

And everybody scream like you're on a rollercoaster
We're down with La Coka Nostra
We smashin', we Sick Jacken and the Soul Assassins
The hip-hop culture - we fuck you vultures
You caught in the rapture, all I hear is laughter
In a year's time some of you punks, won't matter
Let's see if you can hang as you can climb the ladder
You ain't a rapper, you're a fucking joke
A one-shock hack on a track, get your pass revoked
I got keys to the city and we lockin' you out
We come hard for the paint and I'm blockin' you out
So run for the hills and hide when you can
We just put the mic down and be that fan
With your pen in hand outside of the lobby
I'm a pro, get my signature, this ain't no hobby

Full-time fate dealer, some say renegade
Part-time psycho, sippin' on lemonade
Don't want trouble but I'll give it to you anyway
Yes, I'm insane, put you in pain
My mind has been trained to live in the fast lane
Should I slow down? Fuckin' speed up
You better take a hit from my weed, you need some

Go hard, go hard, live hard, die hard
Rape one, cap one, fake one, slap one
Break one, jack one, save one, gat one
Rise up, rise up, take me higher

Got my hands on the wheel
And I'm never lookin' back in my rear view mirror

Sorta like a hand off, then you really handle

We lead by example, you know that we are showin' proof
Gonna beat them whose are over you beat down overdue

Beat down overdue - Had to learn the hard way
Homie started flippin' and we left them in the hallway
Gonna puff all day - Shut 'em down late night
Motherfuckers wanna play, but you got stage fright

Chill, I'll bust that grill
Grab my gat, and load up the steel
And if you wanna get drastic

Synthetic material, burial plots in order
Heading down to the Mexican border
Smokin' that smelly, Northern Cali
Gonna put a slug in Captain O'Malley
Ho, hum - hear the gat come, boom!

In my vehicle with the belt unbuckled

This one goes out to all you punk motherfuckers out there
Yeah, eat a bowl of dick-up, putos
Do you wanna get crazy?
Comin' at ya in '93

Through the crosswinds, the firin' pins
Go click when I duck behind the trash bin
Ran out of ammo, no doubt
My gat is dry like a fuckin' drought
Got to make my way home
Hit the gate and get my chrome, hot damn, it's on
They got me cornered, let me just warn ya
I'll pull this trigger, make your family mourn ya
Boo-hoo
Where ya gonna run to when I pull out the Scooby-Doo?
Run, let me break ya off some
Hit the floor 'cause it ain't no fun
But here they come, they must wanna get done
No frontin', punk, I'll break ya off somethin'

One, two, three, that copper goes down
Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'

What the fuck I'm rollin'
In a Mack truck that's stolen, guess what I'm holdin'?
Ammo to bust my load
Still, I'm easin' on down the yellow brick road
What do ya know? A pig in a plain brown
Wrapper, he wanna bring me down
I'll hit that corner, let me just warn ya
I'll run your ass down, make your family mourn ya
Twenty-one gun salute
Trying to take my loot, don't make me shoot
I'll hit my blunt and pass you a lump
And, punk, let me break ya off somethin'

Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'

I got to roll with the self-control
In the green tank when the shit unfolds
Hold up, I got it sewn up
Me and my niggas are about to blow up
Got the pigs on my tail
What they get is the hollow-point shell, caught in the cell
Servin' my sentence, got my apprentice
In the hood, but the nigga is senseless
Out on parole
Now the nigga has turned to my foe, now the punk gotta go
That punk got shady, wouldn't repay me
Let the punk know that ya still can't fade me
Maybe the frontin' would stop
But nothin' would stop me from havin' to break 'em off somethin'
On to the next spot, kid
Break 'em off somethin'
We ain't havin' it, y'all
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm 'bout to break your ass off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'
Comin' from a whammo
Break 'em off somethin'

Break 'em off somethin'

I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high

Well it's the funk elastic, the blunt I twist it
The slamafied, Buddhafied funk on your discus
Oh, what, you missed this? You got to bear witness
Catch a ho and another ho, Merry Christmas
Yes I smoke shit, straight off the roach clip
I wrote shit for the blunted ones to approach it
Forward motion, make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion? Yo, I'm not jokin' around
People learnin' 'bout, what they're smokin'
My oven's on high when I roast the quail
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale
Exhale, now you felt the funk of the Thai
Wanna feel the effects?

I want to get high, so high

Inhale, exhale
Just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin' me stoned
Home skillet, there's water inside, don't spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet, still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky, funky, smelly, green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long

When I pack a fresh bowl, I clean the screen
Don’t get me stirred up the smoke, through the bubbling
Water is makin' it pure, so I got to
Take my hit and hold it

Cruisin' through the neighborhood, some say I'm no good
Claiming I'm a criminal, but lets make it understood
I'm just one man with a whole lot of homeboys (Hol' up)
You get the click and a pop when I pull out the chrome toy
Jack me and I'll jack you back (Jack you back)
Then jump back to my big Buddah like
I'm not a bad guy but don't take advantage
I'm throwing out the garbage, just show me where the can is
All I was doing was searching for the boom
Then some punk tried to hit me with the broom
Lucky I ducked quick or else I'd be assed out
Last thing I wanted was have to pull the gat out
Here comes a nigga and he's got a .38
Well like Grandma said, "Ayo, I'm shooting up straight"

'Cause I put away the shotgun, bought me a Glock
Took a little trip to the funky weed spot
Tried to jack me, but homie got shot
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Rolling in the hood that you already shot up
But let's roll again and see if we can spot the

Let me find his ass, I'm gonna unload the clip
Then take a little trip down to Rio
Now my hood's hot so I gots to go chill

Now I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
Should've put the Glock down (Glock down)

Bitin emcees in their tracks I stop em

I jack fools up and stick em like dirty coppers
Like I said before I'm takin you lane of whores
Down to the phone, knock his ass on your good balls

Take they ass out like heroes and they flossin

Bitin' niggas clonin it

Suck it hard swallow easy, put a soul in it

The weed master, rhyme killer, mic controllin' it
You still fuckin' but your wack, ain't throwin' it
Stepped in shit, now your chillin' all alone in it
Head full of hair, still ain't combin' it
Five child in the world who's ropin' it
Never know if i'm high or i'm throwin' shit
I got you stuck in the Twilight Zone on shit

Don't let nobody treat me like crap
I'm pullin heads off sharp and smack em off francs
The best in these days I smoke on these tracks
Gonna mash your plan for holdin me back
Jump up rush the office with the gat
Lettin the niggas see where my mind is at
Hurry up to the walls see how I react
But I keep comin back and that's for a fact
I got the beef, but no road I got dropped
And take each day the bullshit don't stop
Got to act with the man cause I don't suck cock
No matter how bad I wanna get to the top
The music go out like a fuckin lot
With the key and the dat I rap and just stop
Come and see me on a Soul Assas trip
Hittin stage, generate, pumpin all that lip

You can't fuck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fuckin man!
You can't fuck with me

Breakin off chunks off of what I create
I see that liquorice all over your face
Back-stab a nigga in the mist of the chase
Fuck the bullshit let's get to the bottom
Stompin punk styles, agein rock got em
Only thing I don't wanna say when I drop em
Loadin my shells so don't try to hock em
Hittin the heat with the jig-ass beats
Bite my style, is the only way to compete
Smoke anybody if I ever lop heat
And anybody else that wanna fuck with me

You can't fuck with me

Got a women crazy, when I beg
And hip-hop styles with the SX-10
Trust no one ain't nobody your friend
Cause this business hear all about to end
Don't mean comin back when they bust the raps
And all the little things of the nicer tracks
Hangin out in the uniform

You can't hide from the man with the master plan
Huntin' for your head, "How I Could Just Kill a Man"
Ayo, where you at, baby? Keep your head low, damn
Got you on the camcorder in the black minivan
You crossed line, time for the light to blind
You can run but I never be far behind
You never know when it's gonna come, paranoid
'Cause the mentality is seek and destroy
Better look around before you come out your door
'Cause shit catches up but you don't want no more
Only time will provide the right sign for real
You might die 'cause you hesitate to find the steel

You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on, keep, keep, keepin on!
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin' on!

Listen up, motherfuckers, I got shit on my mind
The spotlight's on me and it's time to shine
I smack any brat that be jumpin' outta line
I smoke any fool try to diss on my rhyme
I get y'all when no one can't protect y'all
Wash your brain and have you infiltrate the
Same bunch of suckers that be tryin' to hate me
Wanna take me out so they can try and replace me
Fuck what ya heard, have ya seen lately?
The size of my clan is improving greatly
No holdin' back, bringin' the big heater
Watch a nigga run scared, faster than a cheetah
Speed of light, move faster than sound
But I'm still on they back and I'm gaining much ground

Represent for all the people still a part of the scheme
Playa haters, imitators wanna roll with the team
But they fade away, hate away, all for the cream
They wanna instigate and get me to forget my stake
Take advantage of the Real-a, rob killa who scrapes
Stupid motherfuckers who don't know who I am
Better step aside suckers watch the heater expand
Get outta hand, see the light, you and your clan
Better scram outta here before you get slammed
I stand strong, keepin' on, when I'm rollin' alone
But you sorry bitches hide away, place unknown

You better never let me catch you alone!

Uh..uh...yeah....
These voices up in my head...

All these voices up in my head
Makin me dread, when I sleep at night
Visons of people with evil intensions wanna fly my sight
Visons are changin, engagin, and ragin', I'm in a stage and a fight
Listen, the system is pissin' me off, you wanna feel my pipe
Fingers pointed, annointed people, day better up to the knight
Whispers, darkness the hardest, time ain't never gonna feel alright
Feelin' my soul in the hole
I can't breathe, and I'm frightened for my life
Think I need help or I dwell in hell, cuz I got a grip too tight!

Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?

Through every dimension as tension ahead, I gotta go my main
Dreams are like beans up like coming through my brain
Then I know I'm baked
For every single minute that's in it, each and every brand new day
Denial of trial I'm vile, whatever that bullshit they say
I'm sinking so low in my self, help me gain, never give no break
Confusion is usin me sinkin me up, now the sky's all grey
I'm blazin and liftin my mind with kite, let me hit that J
Holding, controlling my self over, but the shit won't stay!

Uh, uh, yeah..
Do you know who I am? (3x)

I'm in a deep yo
Peep though
Things are on the fallout
Kids all lookin' to peel my wig back
I figure that shit out
The other day
The rearview mirror
When things are closer than they appear
Tear shit down hit the corner
Cut through the alley
Seen a fine chick
Didn't have time to rally
I remember you but I gotta dip
Skip the fuck out
These niggas are following me from behind haters
They can't fade us or eliminate us to get famous
It's all painless
I'll show 'em what insane in the brain is
Maybe they'll run, or find out what the rain is
They want beef fuck giving it to 'em shameless

Motherfuckers get wicked in situations
That causes a nigga to react
More to the back hit the corner
Know what they say
Caught a nigga live on to fight another day
Maybe fight and not appear
Maybe they want it
Maybe you niggas following my attention
I dispatch the troops quick didn't give 'em time
Didn't give 'em a second to push me over the line
Between that the humiliation I saw my life flash
Gun blast, all out confusion
The smoke clears
Foes crawlin' outta here
Snap fingers like magic, they disappear
These bitches had it no question they're all bloody
Never fuck with nobody who's crazy!

I'm in this world hell called life
Willin' to risk it
Pop the disc and you ain't bustin' a biscuit
Fools think they heavy weight
They never wait
Like a nigga tryin' to get pussy on the first date
They featherweight, whatever hate if you want to
Kill me in my soul will come back to haunt you
You never sleep, never get rest
Feelin' the cold breath, you're the opposite of everlast
You never last!
Pass 7 days of madness
After my soul path
Your spiritual plane is weak, nigga you need to fast
Cause you're bitin' my shit
Mouths full but don't swallow
My shit's acid burning your stomach making you hollow
Best learn who you're fucking with
Before you try shit
You might die with my name caught in your eyelids
See that, weave that, inhale the weed sack
I be that nigga willin' to die for what I'm feelin'1Embed

You're a lost soul rollin down the street
Hustlin, scramblin, money you eat
You wanna jack somebody, never look at me
Cause I'm like you when I'm holdin heat
You don't want to think about re-percussions
Cause you don't give a fuck about who you rushin
So what you gonna do when the blood is gushin?
You're playin Roulette without the Russian
The stakes are high; can you feel the pressure?
Lookin at the club on top of your dresser
Born for the big bank robbin your own
Thinkin your stone but your weak ass throne
Bitches like you ain't got no heart
Paranoid, you're settin in, fallin apart
How many times will you take to see it?
You fallin away, but you don't believe it
(Chorus: B-Real & Sen Dog)
Jack me and you'll never go back
Jack me and I'll jack you back
Where y'all bitches got the scheme or the stack?

Handle it, handle it
You know, motherfuckers need to have some weed etiquete
True, true
You see, motherfuckers try to come up and bogard your weed
At the club, and they don't wanna share theirs
Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed
Can I get a hit of your weed

You know I hate it when I roll a joint and give it to somebody
Who ain't got weed but they wanna be up in the party
Laughin and gigglin, sippin on a Heinie
Son you need a Tic Tac your breath is gonna blind me
Talkin about you wanna hit, spittin in my eardrum
Oh you new in the cypher, step to the rear son
Still they manage to hit it, and put they grip on it
That's when they wet the tip and put they lips on it
Then when you get it, forget it, it's been wetted
Who gonna hit it now, not me, you got me
Thinkin about these fuckin jokers, double tokers
Smokers who hit it like they suckin a dick, fuckers
Flippin it, lovin it, smokin it to the head
Givin it to me half way down, "thanks again"
Then when you see 'em later smokin they own stash
When you ask 'em for a hit, they say, "sorry this is my hash""
I shared some with you, "Sorry that's not my problem
Talk to the hand but I got plenty if you wanna buy some"
These people piss me off, this is true indeed
But nothin's worse when someone's askin for some weed
What do I look like a tree where the bud grows
Here pick my left nut and smoke it in the bowl
Or better grow your own leave mine alone
Here I'll give you a clone now raise up outta my zone
I know I got the best weed, but don't make me
Make your burnt chest bleed what you need
Is weed etiquette, please don't be offended

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you don't know
About the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers
And losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
Shit's deep, 48 tracks
Studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will till he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way

Long as you sell everything will be okay

So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
They're too worried about them honies at the Palladium
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
Till the next rock superstar with no shame
Give him a year, he'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin' ignored, I warned him
Assured him, this ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal

Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at The Palladium
Who just wanna cling on and swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world

Spit on yo name, shit on it, and burn it
Suckas wanna floss and play the big boss
What movie you livin in and how much did it cost?
What role are you playin? I'm only sayin
You're the record gettin played and I'm DJ'in
Playin you, playin you, and playin you
Decayin you, I'm tyin and breakin you (Ah ha ha)

Catch a glance of the legendary brother who carries
Your body and buries two more lyrics in styles varied
Fool what?  You ain't got nothin' to say

My gat's in my right hand, my plug's in my left hand, punk
Cypress Hill worldwide, you just a local
Don't anger me, or you can hear it in my vocal

Cut you up, with my scissors
You wanna get us, yeah, the venom spitters
Your style's trash: don't litter
You got the jitters the hardhitters
No quitters your soul quivers

There ain't no use for you beggin' to turn the heat down
You label me coldblooded
You wanna warm me up with hot lead the gat thudded
You can't cut it
You wack, but it's, no use your mouth shut it
Shootin' arrows diamond-studded, and still budded
You got to love it, you better chase the paper all day
So you can walk down the long platinum hallway
But now the fools are minutemade;
They get played for a minute
Then played out they never get back in it
Gun park I bring chalk for your body outlined on the floor
You got hit by the 4-4!

You're in the game called life, son, how you're livin' it
Street corner kids growin' up, blowin' up
You chase dreams you want the highlife, with the skylights
But in the end your soul's lost, you lost the shine right
Never turn your back ever, on niggas true to you
Stand alone for the cheddar, and they'll be through with you

Can't stand unoriginal cats with minimal
Skills that's criminal - you fake bitches!

The faces of death look you in the eye, cut off your breath

The bones breakin' with your weak blatter
Pissin' on yourself it don't matter
Dead weight, the bed waits for you on the set date
Dreams gone instead fate didn't hesitate
To put you away, close the gates now you're locked out

Comes very handy when it comes to pushin' shovin' and stuff
Then ask who is he though, I'm not the sissy
I'm stiff to neutral brother, and I'm born to get busy

The, physical effects of marijuana
The first sensations may be felt instantly after having smoked grass
Or an hour after having eaten
Usually, they creep slowly into this stoned condition
Inch by inch, sliding upward, but to beatnik
The effects may come upon you, suddenly, and startle you full force
(The, physical effects of marijuana)
(There are four basic types of marijuana)
Psychologically, sometimes the early psychological stages
Coincide with the early physical stages experienced while stoned
The famous "mind expansion" comes after the famous physical sensation
Grass, heightens and distorts
For example, profound revelations
You may think you have profound revelations, only to discover...

Let me tell you what happens when you squeeze, you're juiceless
You can't get loose, so now you're useless
Can't feel the funk so I guess I'll pump the wrist
How bout this ma kiss my blunt?
Right into ya, now you're feelin', the chemicals vibin'
Are you realizin', that it's gettin' better?
Surprisin' you, whether or not, your shit's together
From the high-pitched levels (comin' from my "huevos")
Cypress Hill imported it, boiled it in steam
But yo everything ain't what it seems
Cause the Cypress Hill material luxurious superior
Glory or memorial, historical physical
Ingredients, gettin' that immediate blend
Yo Sen take aim, and let the juice now extend
(Yeah I'm still comin' atcha, but you don't need to duck down
Cause this is somethin' different than a Psychobetabuckdown!)

 The Funky Cypress Hill Shit!

Intellect filthy en lingo
Dissed you, I control elements, suck on slow

This ain't Florida, so put away the O.J
Never in your life will you wet this
This crazy business, now you're thinkin' ay que pinga
Tremenda, re cinda it's good like some cheeba
The formula will run ya I'll start takin' up a list
So you can get blitzed and you feel your head's twisted
Now insisted, you fill it to the brim
Yo I ain't him, I could never be them
This ain't poison, so let's go out on a limb
For the boys and girls who haven't had it yet
If you get too much, and roll it too straight, oh
It's a fatal blow, somethin' like a K.O
Yeah it'll sting ya fria cojones
See ya, I'm on it, somethin' for the blunted
Just what you wanted, so you can feel the high
Smokin' the buddha thai
Lungs expandin' and now you're feelin' it
Yeah, the funky cypress hill shit!

Well, I'm an alley cat, some say, "A dirty rat"
On my side is my gat, see I'm all of that
Spittin' out buck shots, boy I'm gonna wet'cha
Run and hide, but I'm still comin' to get'cha
Thinkin' like a peace smoke, comin' on a homicide
You talkin' shit, tryna take me for a ride
I'm not a bad guy, but I'm the funky feel
Finger on the trigger when my hands up on a steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is goin' boo-ya
You're stuck in my hood, so what ya gonna do now?
Bein' the hunted one is no fun
Here I come son, yo I think ya better run
Better run more, and move a little faster
Second of thought and I'm comin' to blast ya
With my...

Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Left hand on a forty, (Puffin' on a blunt)
Pumped my shotgun, (Them niggas didn't jump)
Lala la la lala la laaaaa...

Comin' at you like a stiff blow, fuckin' up your program
Ain't takin' shit from you him or no man
Master mind maniac and a menace, soooo
How they want to pass the sentence
All because a nigga tried to play me on the trigger
He missed, so now the nigga's hist
Rude and crude like a pit bull, get to the point
Your fuckin' card will get pulled, now
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns (Get your face down!)
Put me in chains, try to beat my brains
I can get out, but the grudge remains
When I see ya punk ass, I'm gonna getcha
Get some through ya, shotgun go boo-yaa!

Think I'll light another for the blunted to chill with

They stepped to the Hill "What's up?", I had to kill one
Now I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Livin' like a nigga who done lost his mind
'Cause I ain't goin' out like a spineless jellyfish
Some say life is a bitch
Ask that punk who dug his own ditch
Up on the Hill fuckin' up at a party
Tried to get funny, put a hole in his body
Lala la la lala la laaa
Look at all of those funeral cars
'Cause I'ma

It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
You know what I'm sayin?
And it goes like this

Hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin', the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin', when suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me drivin'
By, hangin' out the window
With my Magnum takin' out some putos
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street gettin' paid from my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something ya can't understand

And you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Sen got the gat, and I know that'll gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said "Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed-out
How you like my chrome?" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway...
Hahaha... that young punk had to pay
(So I just killed a man!)

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down: bullshit!
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next ya hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
So how do ya know where I'm at, when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
When you're up on the hill in your bigger home
I'm out here riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, ay yo I gotta say "fuck it"

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

Are you ready? Ladies and gentlemen, y'all ready to get down?
Ladies and gentlemen

Well I'm the Real one, yes the phuncky feel one
Cypress Hill has come, any questions ask them
'Cause we are answerin', any brothers that've been
On the dick swingin', and straight gatherin'
Enter all the info, cause yo what you're in fo'
Is a crazy day, strapped in a pimp mode
Trapped like a prophet, but I still profit
Even when you're off it, bank's in my pocket
'Cause of my music, what you call me chumpy?
In my trade, the Tribe is known to get funky
Hif is here to hack you down, Son is here to buck you down
Joke's on you, cause you're the biggest duck in town
You've got to relax, we got to kick back
Brothers just sit back, enjoy me like a six pack
As I let the rhyme flow into the hook, yo
Where you gettin' took, but that's another story black

Cause I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one
I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one

Flyer than the other broad, hookin' on the fish rod
Isn't that odd, instead of sayin' my dick's hard
It's not about knockin' you, do you feel like clockin' loot?
Forget it, act stupid little sucker I'll be clockin' you
With the right or left hand, duck they was still stand
Troopers on the side step, bucks him down to death man
With the greater lyric, if you can spare it
Just an ass kickin', is what you inherit
So don't try to snake off, you know I can't be shook off
Why the suckers took off? Well that's another story black

Standin' on the corner, close to the real estate
Homes I really feels it get when brothers try to imitate
Meanin' when they simulate, but they can't stimulate
Like a fatty joint, straight from the breath I take
Make me act loco, then switchin' up my vocal
Out to catch you so-called MC's with a roll call
Then you gotta close your eyes, you can't stand the sunlight
There is just one light, the Tribe's buckin' heads tonight!
Buck buck buck ya head! Sorry that Fred is dead
Deader than a doornail, someone cold made his bed
Didn't just break out, the sucker got cracked out
Hit the pipe and blacked out, with the shit from back down
So much more integrity, greatest deal I hook up
Was a funky looker
But that's another story black
Cause we're the real ones, yes, the phuncky feel ones
We're the real ones, yes, the phuncky feel ones

Head in the casket, your body in a basket
A tisket, a tasket, I told ya I'm gonna blast ya

As I kick a trip, it comin' straight from my sinus
Crazy nasal vocals, cannot make the hotties loco

Used to sell me buddha outta fucked up little baggies
Honey'd up a twenty even when I had no money
She said "Pay me back with some Latin dick Sonnie"

Conozco una muchacha y ella es fina
Tremendos cocos y también es linda
A veces me la cojo en la cocina
Esta muchacha me chupa la pinga
Yo le dije "dame tu bollo"
Me dice "negro loco tu no eres mi novio"
A mi me importa un carajo
A mi cuarto meterte un palo
Por tu culo o por tu chocha
Y ya tu sabes que no me importa
Y ella me dice "Suavecito"
"Yo pienso que tu eres bien rico
Cuando me toca por mi frente
Ya tu me tienes bien caliente
Y cuando me tocas por detrás
Ya tu sabes sin parar"
Acabe de singar y me levante
Fui al baño y me bañe
Salí del cuarto y me esperaba
Con los ojos negros y bonita cara
Me pongo mi camisa y mi pantalón
Se ríe y me dice "Negro sedentón…"

Estaba fina
Nóteme, hay güeys con suerte
Esta muchacha estaba tan pinga
Uy! Cuando se lo metí...
Cuando se lo metí, gritó: "!Papi!"
Estaba del carajo, brother
No olvídate, olvídate

How many times have we been thru this
I can tell you that it's getting harder everytime I try to resist
We go way back and you held me down
And you helped me keep my feet moving in the ground
No matter what situation occasion
You were amazing, you knew just what it took to keep our love blazing
The thug in me, but when we separated I was thinkin foolishly
Remember when your ex boy tried to bug on me
I told him: "bring it on, I'll buy you a slug on me"
He didn't like that but didn't want the fight
Fuck 'im, he didn't know how to treat you right
We go hand in hand they don't understand a man
But you do and I really respect that, damn
We been down so long but it's all good
That's why I dedicate this song

Till Death Do Us Part
I do

Who would have thought it would last so long
So many loose-sighted think that they can't go wrong
I know I make so many mistakes
I know you felt neglected, you called me "outta line"
If you thought I didn't respect it - I heard ya
But I never showed an emotion
If I haven't ever said it, you got all my devotion
When I fell hard you picked me up
Made me think about my life, where I'm going, a little tricky - huh?
I know at times, that you thought I would change
But I'm the same motherfucking brother even in spite of the fame
There might be some times we don't agree on somethin'
But don't never feel your thoughts don't mean nothing
Some'll try to steer you wrong, I'm not one of those people
Always tell it like it is, cos the truth will free you, but don't get mad
When the truth is lethal, I'm only telling you cause I got your back

You got my mind right and I don't know how you did it

But you still there, still care, so rare - oh yeah
Got so much love, when you need, you can go there
I appreciate what you're doing for me
I had to open up my eyes so I can see the minutes we lost
Whenever I was out on tour, or gone, we can make 'em up, like never before
You want all the little things, that make it worth it
Why not, we can get it, we can both deserve it
It's hard, but nothing good, is ever so easy
We have a bond that won't break, no mistake, believe me
Till Death Do Us Part, like I said from the start
You're the light that guides me thru when I'm in the dark
They said we'd neverlast but we're still strong
That's why I dedicate this song - C'mon
 - 4X

Reflections of my own life flash like a fire
Powder burns the memories life seems a bad dream
Fall for cenetries physical and the mental
When I crashed through work
I was cursed but still I
Quit my curse found my hustle
Stack paper made it world wide
Feeling the dream, dont be a hater son
Think you the greater one
Gotta put you on the fader son
Cut your ass up see you later
Gotta drop till your praying nigga
You ain't a player hust a frail nigga
I'm the slayer in your nightmares
Unstoppable
When you see me on the street
Call a audible
I got you covered, face it
And you can't dodge this bullet baby
This ain't the matrix
Got to put you in your placement
Hide your body in the basement
Your boys wonder where your face went

Homey we keet those on us
Smoke like mufflers

I lit that kush up and got doughed up

Well here's a little story I got to tell
About a thugged out homey I know so well
It started way back, when I was a teen
In the hood, on the corner, slanging dope to fiends
Had the little stash that could serve your need
You can do what you want but I got weed for me
Riding for my fam, trying to hit a grand
CRASH unit on my ass, now I'm in demand
One lonely family I be
All in the hood, I got nobody
The sun is beatin down on my red dark hat
Pigs are roaming through the alley so I gotta toss my gat
Forgot about the sack, looking for a place to hide
If they ask me for my name - fuck 'em, I'mma lie

One O.G. gangster I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangster stash
When they caught me with the weed and the dope and hash

He said a little something, I wasn't so impressed
No more running homey, now you're under arrest
The sack was in my hand, felt like a sack of bricks
I swore he couldn't see it when I threw it in my whip
He said he wanted some, I said I don't have none
Found it in the sun on the floor next to my gun
Next thing I saw was the gun to my head
Now the lead will make me dead, and yo this is what he said

My name is Sgt. Slacker with a license to kill (uh-huh)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get real (yea)
Now what do we have here? A banger and his peers

He cuffed my hand you understand he threatened me with tears
Sorry motherfucker had his gun out with a grin
You think the story's over but it's ready to begin

One O.G. gangster I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangster stash
When they caught me with the weed and the dope and hash

Now I got your crack and most of your crew
You got a couple choices of what you can do
Better make the right decision if you know what I mean
You can do some time or fork over your green

I said I got no green he started looking at me harder
I said I don't have nothing you can go fuck your daughter (what?)
He hit me with the fist, he hit me with the gat
He put the night stick to my back, so
I think I'm done, the pig's got my gun
It isn't lookin good, I got ink on my thumb
Another pig walked in, said "He's playing games"
He gave another look at me, found out my false name
One O.G. gangster I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangster stash
When they caught me with the weed and the dope and hash

Sitting there pissed as I dwell in my cell
The place smells like shit in the County Jail
Homey looking at me like he seen me before
He started throwing up a set, then he spit on the floor
I think ay-yeah yo, I know this kid
It's the same motherfucker cocktailed my crib
This dude said, "Get ready", pulled a shank on me
I said c'mon homey you a bit too sloppy
Fool tried to stab me, socked him in the eye
The guards yelled, "Give it up!" and let two fly
The guards said down and we hit the floor
If you make a move after you won't move no more
He said I see you once again best protect ya neck
I said eat a dick from me you don't get respect
I said you wanna come with it, any time and place
And I'll leave you like Pacino with a scar on your face
They put him in the hole, and all the bullshit stopped
But when his boy had beef, yeah he got dropped
P.D. had no witness, D.A. dropped the load
I got probation for the gun and the dope, case closed
One O.G. gangster I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are coming down on my gangster stash
When they caught me with the weed and the dope and hash

Yo
I got this plan to make some money
I want you to keep this shit to yourself
At 6:15 am the truck pulls out the post office on Lakershim and Wilshire
Now it makes one stop before it goes to Sacramento
Which is a mail drop-off at First Federal Loan and Savings

I did whatever I could to get by
Slang dope, jack people, hands in the sky
When you livin' on the edge, yeah holmie it's a high
You get caught up in the drama and eventually you die
Livin' in a hard world some are livin' lies
Son you better wise up and open up your eyes
Shit it never easy, homie people will connive
Better have a hustle if you mean to survive
Why you're so greedy, can you tell us all why
Look homie believe me, you're fuckin' metal ply
For the Dollar everybody is a target that's real
Talkin' is smog you're fate's signed and sealed
You could be the next one cross 'em in the path
What maybe if you do the math you can avoid the blood bath
All the Money that we stole too weak to take greed
Give it to an honest man the Money is still deep

Work hard is fuck, for everything to rock

Fools got game floss and drop names
My move's faster than a runaway train
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit

He decided to jet, it could happen with no discussion
Straps of all pain, fool's fuckin' eruptin'
For the green little papers, jackin' your neighbors
But what if your neighbor put arms in his favor
Moved up the heater to mash you punk bitches
Don't wanna earn shit, you wanna jack for the riches
Nothin' in life's for free, my nigga learn that
You burn someone, they might just burn back
Scorchin' niggas to the third degree
Auh y'all triggers deserve to be
Put out of you misery, you're history son
When your body disappears then the mystery come

This pig harassed the whole neighborhood
Well this pig worked at the station
This pig he killed my Homeboy
So the fuckin' pig went on a vacation
This pig he is the chief
Got a brother pig, Captain O'Malley
He's got a son that's a pig too
He's collectin' pay-offs from a dark alley
This pig is known as a narco
If he's a pig or not, we know that he could be
This pig he's a fuckin' fag
So all his homepigs they call him a pussy
Well this pig he's really cool
So in this class we know he rides all alone
Well this pig's steady eatin' donuts
While some motherfucker's out robbin' your home
This pig he's a big punk
And I know that he can't stand the sight of me
'Cause pigs don't like it when ya act smart
And when ya tell 'em that your a group from society
This pig works for the mafia
Makin' some money off crack
But this little pig got caught
So when he gets to the pen it's all about the pay-back
'Cause once he gets to the pen
They won't provide the little pig with a bullet-proof vest
To protect him from some mad nigga
Who he shot in the chest and placed under arrest
An' it's all about bacon or sausage
Do ya feel sorry for the poor little swine?
Niggas wanna do him in the ass
Just ta pay his ass back, so they're standin' in line

I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits
She didn't wanna be one of those hoes
In clothes exploiting her body from head to toes
She had glossy lips she was swaying her hips
On the dance floor and every nigga's flashing her grip
Trying to impress her in vain she gave no play
Niggas hit her up for numbers and she said no way
I thought to myself let it go and roll on, B
But like Smokey said she really had a hold on me
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya
Even if I moved to the other side of the party
I had pictures in my head of her moving that body
I was beside myself with hunger pain
So I slowly walked over and I asked her name

What's your name, what's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, girl give me a chance!

She gave a smile but I got no answer though
I took a while before she gave a chance she's acting cold
I offered her a drink she turned me down flat
She said if you want my name you gotta do better than that
I said OK, now your shit don't stink
I'ma walk away only tried to buy you a drink
As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for real
But every guy in the club tried slipping me pills
I don't trust guys each and every one will lie to you
I said I understand but it's not what I try to do
I wasn't even gonna come to your table
But if I didn't I knew that I'd regret it later
I go after what I want but I got class
For me no need to slip a pill if I want ass
She gave me a funny look I couldn't tell what it meant
She let her guard down and on our conversation went


She said I want a man with a plan and ambition
Not an immature nigga on a "pussy-hit mission"
I'm too good for that I have so much to offer
Got a good job working at my mom and dad's law firm
You got goals, that's what she asked
Yeah I wanna fill my home with platinum plaques
It takes hard work but you know it's coming after
She said 'oh my God you must be a famous rapper!'
I do all right but I'm never satisfied
I'm told when you still love what you do it never gets old
I strive for more but that's enough about me
Why don't we skip out the club and take a walk on the streets
We slipped out of the club with no worries
Seems she wanted to get out in a hurry
We hung all night till we lost our friends
Till they caught us bangin in the back of a Benz

I send a few girls in the hall to talk
Crusty old man never called the cops
No pistols, if you get my drift yo
You pull one and miss better slit yo' wrists bro
This ain't a gangsta party
But if you turn it into one a bullet might pierce yo' body
Relax, there's a lot of girls in here
You shitfaced niggas, don't earl in here
Don't break shit or take nothin, mind your manners
Or your head goes BOOM like it's fuckin skanless
But we ain't for all that right now, just chill out
We can pop bottles or let the blood spill out
Cuanta, suck it up, shut your trap
Before you lose that fine-ass girl on your lap

You wanna room?  Let me clear one out
But while I'm gone, just don't let the beers run out
In the morn' we can watch all the tears come out
When the pigs come, a nigga wanna hear one out
For now, we can pass the time
Blazin it up, if you slow you the last in line
Got a roach, so what?  You ain't spent a dime
You ungrateful-ass critter, back the hell of mine
You can, lose the life or lose the knife
Use the pipe, but I can't lose tonight
All the girls bein picky who they chose tonight
You better hope you chillin with the right crew tonight
See that girl over there?  Yeah she like your style
Probably seen her on the video "Girls Gone Wild"
Hesitation is constipation
Of your game when you're in for a night of elation

As a kid, I was known, son of a thug
Snub-nosed .38 in the glove, who can relate with us?
Never had an easy life, shit's way out
Clips spray out, fools pay out or play out
Any scenario, been there, done that
Gone where some of y'all niggas, couldn't come back
Been through the hottest parts of hell
Came back with a hard shell and, hard as nails
I went through it all, do it all, screw it all
Small you recall, the hard times as a juve-nile
Often misunderstood
Some joined the military, others just joined the hood
Street corner combat, part of the dark streets
Your heart beats pump when my slugs release
And there ain't no tellin, don't be the one yellin
These birds are deadly, they can shatter your melon

When the street wars jump off, there's only one thing to do
Grab your gat and squeeze one off
This ain't the life of the soft ones who run off
You got one shot to get you a knot

At the crossroads, sick of holdin the badlands
Where street wars, kick off quicker than Van Damme
Mistakes of mad man, I remember the old ways
The old days where fools clapped yo' {?}
No quarter, you feel me?
Life expectancy's just a little bit shorter
G's gave the order, you carried 'em out
Quick fast, you the last nigga I'm worried about
Get that street lead, that was one step over the edge
Much closer to death, every step I kept on
Learnin about the dark paths, made a hard left
Prayed to God death is swift and painless
This life ain't for everyone, stay out my shoes
You can't trade your fate, I hate to break the news
The young won't respect the fences these days
You a marked man if you get caught up in these ways

Sho' you right
You want a cigarette nigga?

You was a good kid, your parents musta loved you
They got you out of trouble no matter how big the bubble
They gave you everything, nah you never needed nothin'
We used to get high, 'member we was weeded cousin
We used to go to clubs, blaze it up and act crazy
What made you turn around, was it drugs or your lady?
We had good times, committin' hood crimes
We drew lines but you never understood mine
You don't go fuckin' homies, just like my momma told me
I held my hood up boldly, you were a fuckin' phony
I guess it manifested when I got the call early
They said you bunkered down in the hood with ol' girly
She had your back covered, but that didn't matter did it?
I know you're livin', but you put your fuckin' self in it
Don't try to make a move, nigga don't go fuckin' 'dere
I know you're hurtin' cause you're tied up to the fuckin' chair
You never loved your family, you robbed that mall gladly
They tried to love you sadly, you let 'em down badly
Just call me Death's angel, but we were never strangers
You 'bout to get mangled, that's truer than Kurt Angle
Now it's time to pay, any last words to say?
I know your mind strays, son I think you need to pray
Don't even need to tell you, you were a smart nigga
Save your teardrops, yo don't even start nigga
You shoulda thought of that long ago before you fucked me
You dodged me long enough, homey now you been lucky
But now it's pay the piper, no fuckin' traps or snipers
Just the gas and lighter, caught up in the web of spiders
But now you get devoured, burnin' in the flames you coward
This is the very hour, I send your family flowers
I'm sure they all will miss you, but they will be good without you
They'll reminisce and light a candle as they talk about you

My game so strong, I can't go wrong
My dough so long, baby why prolong
Baby we get high, Baby we get dough
Baby we can party all night till death come

We been in the game for a long time
Yes we're battle tested
With the time and the emotion, and the money invested
And if you think hard
No one elses game is tighter
Check the network, up in ya fucking service provider
I bought you thug shit
Thought you drug shit
Got you bugged shit
Tell me what we haven't done
We run you through course son
Leave you understanding what the street life is
But you haters never understand
So eat my dick
You better
Get on your concentration
If you ready to roll on me
And good bitches if you wanna unload on me
Cause if you miss you won't get that far
Ill have you jumping fences
And running down the treet like a track star
I'm at the finish line, its essential

Well strip you of your street credential

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fuckin' pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growin without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Ayo, Dr. Greenthumb, come on back one time
People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the kush plant brush in a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut clones
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
DEA, never wanna leave me alone
But never ever ever gotta warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get locked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

When I swerve I'm bustin adjectives and verbs at curves
Hear the thunder then I melt the frozen tundra, sank Titanics
Crack solid granite, initiate global panic
Harlem got me branded, rhythms jingle like bricks
These niggas face it or face off, give up or break North
My lines petrify your mind's third eye, when I'm high
I pull the trey in your insides, I strike blindside
Rip inside, my syllables simmer for every criminal
In prison whose an individual lose that struggle
My stories burst niggas bubbles, make new niggas mumble
Ready to shed blood up in the jungles
Aiyyo we livin it, magnficent
Cypress, worldwide!

I take the micraphone cord, use it as a rope
To hang all the weak rappers for leavin the bullshit they wrote
Counterfeit fools all in the pot, let em boil
When we go platinum they go, aluminum foil
The worldwide clicks and the parties with no parties
Cause niggas'll get you quickly like the skin off a blunt
When they get burned and smoked, put out and used up
Niggas don't know how to act when they lit the fuse up
Abuse them up, usin the nut, I'm usin buck
Fearin of the shit, that's covered the script, deliver cuts
Cypress Hill, Soul Asassins, all up in the club
Showin love to everyone of you real niggas
Cause the hip-hop's pumpin through the blood in my veins
Like a junkie, fuckin with 'ron and cocaine

I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it
(You get the gloves bitch!)

I used to know this girl that slanged the green shit
Had it all goin on, but it didn't mean shit
She wanted to be a star, with big cars
And all the fame that came my way I gotta say
That she was all that, and a bag of indo
With no seed, such a delightful weed
I wish she was still around but, no she's gone
I guess she got blessed and she got put on
Aiyyo I miss that girl, she had the bomb, was the
Bomb-diggy bomb bomb, and nope, I'm not Qu'ran
Had all the holy books, and notes to get still
I never met another dealer with that appeal
With those electric eyes, hypnotized
Any wise man surprised, the queen of the lye

She got her fuckin clit pierced, chained to her anus
Professional for wettin niggas up, suck em first
Til they bust, swallow nut, then she's quick to strut
Right out the projects, been a whore since ninety-one
Suck a niggas dick for fun, holdin guns in her buns
Type of chick tell you 'fuck me in the ass' talkin shit
While she goin WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA on your dick

I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs

No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it
(You get the gloves bitch!)

Yeah since I seen the queen of green on the screen
So I stepped up, to her screen door, like a dream
Or better yet like a fiend needing a fix
She wasn't like other chicks, pullin tricks on the scheme for chips
She was like, Run-D.M.C., _Tougher Than Leather_
Raw bitch, but then she was soft like a feather
Never again will I meet a woman of her nature
SkyPager turned off, datin one of the Lakers
Lucky-ass nigga with the jump shot
He got that hot shit, all in his pocket on lock
Damn I guess I'm jealous that another fella's got with her
But her sister's, bangin too, what should I do?
Fuck it I'll do like my nigga Smooth with the Princess
Plantin my seed in the next Queen of Buddha Bless
Fuck playin the second string, on the squad
I'm blowin up, all in your face, word to God
Yeah I fucked her in the Hershey Tunnel, deep inside
It made her pussy bubble, aiyyo she told me that it loves you
I told her 'arch that back, let me see that ass'
And then I kissed it, licked it, stuck my nose all in position
You tell me baby listen, can't you see my fuckin dick is throbbin
She started slobbin and gogglin, spittin burblin burpin it
I told her 'just don't matter baby, just don't bite it'
No hold barred, my dick was hard enough to dent a car, I stuck it in
Between to spread the Red Sea apart, the pussy fart
Was a motherfuckin work of art, she rode my dick
Just like a Kawasaki til the pussy started soundin sloppy
Like an old jalopy, time to nut
Took off the condom slapped her on the butt, then I bust
On her face in between her lips
Then she started lickin it, cause it was good shit, protein!
Hot and rich.. damn I got my shit freaky, Mr. Ricks

Now lately I've been findin myself, pourin my guts out
Expressin my thoughts, lettin my nuts out in the walls
Of sleep, I can't keep it all in the hall clear
While others keep it inside for the pride they hold dear
Shoulda been, woulda been, coulda been the cops
Stop look and listen, you'll get a vision of hip-hop
Individuals lookin to the battle the shadows of man
See it all, be it all, you need a plan
It takes one man to understand this
Learn fuckin with a deadly gas, you get burned
From the window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Of living it's all given to you, don't lose it
Every man's given a tool, but don't use it

From the window of my room, assume all's lost
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burnin up see

There it goes, the pride, you missed it
I ain't upset with the motherfucker dissin
Find me in Watts when you wanna come hit me
Some shit ain't what it seems, in the land of dreams
Some sell their soul to get the cream
From the teens I don't sling or slang no crack
I'm known for bringin in funky ass raps
See those magazine crews and I'm a goner
Dull interviews with these damn primadonnas
Unlike some of these fools on the turf
Look like the real thing, but they soft like Nerfs
So unrehearsed that it shows in the product
Need to get the fuck out, before you get caught up

"Ladies and gentlemen
We would like to present to you
A group that is simply just marvelous, just marvelous
Ladies and gentlemen, Cypress, Hill"

16 men on a dead man's list
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!

So many fuckin' emcees claim supremacy
On whose got hip-hop locked, it could never be
One who is solo, runnin' the whole game
That's bullshit, like cops never sniffed cocaine
But I'm taking on all comers, droppin' bombers
Reducin' numbers, makin' it hot like the summer
This, one emcee he couldn't deal with the skill
Like Jack did Jill, I rolled his ass down the Hill
Beaten broken and coughin' and chokin' on the rhyme
Like a hooker, suckin' a dick for the first time
His, rhyme was hollow with no flow to follow
Bust a nut, all in your mouth, and made him swallow
I take 16 emcees, lock 'em in a room
Make 'em feel the contact, eatin' the mushrooms
Playin' with your mind, makin' you feel the Force
Had to cancel out, two punk niggas up in The Source
Tried to get XXL, they still fell
Bitches go tell your troubles to Montel

The physical, better run to the spiritual
Ass-whoop critical, or you can get it
From the lyrical, bitch-made niggas are invisible
Dysfunctional, hypocritical, smile in your face
The fuckin cynical shit brains
As I sit back and say, TALLY-HO!
One of these days your punk ass gonna go
Guess you had a key to figure the fuckin' flow
But you're locked out, and the bomb's about to blow

16 men let me see who's next
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho and a bag of indo!
Twelve punks to go, who's next on the list
Matter of fact I got one in my head to fix
There was one particular fool in the circle who fell off
Greed overcame the nigga who at all costs
Changed up to gain it all, but shared none
Who made him all the money to overcome?
Niggas up on the Hill, in the lab
He was rollin' big balla style, high profile
Oh child, make me wanna act juvenile
All smiles, right in my face, but wait a minute now
Welcome to the 360, degrees
Pay a fee when you fuckin' your people over the cheese
No soul, no conscience, no loyalty
To the niggas who got him treated, like royalty
Aiyyo time's up, you're gonna end up seein' visions
Of everybody, you fucked over, you're Scared Sober

16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho them niggas has gotta go
16 men till there's no one left
Yo-ho-ho them niggas has gotta go

Fuck the hater with the symbol and no soul
And that bitch nigga who stole my car stereo
Trick Deez, gets no love, she gets nuts
Like Ass Miller, and that fuckin ex-dealer
Can't forget the nigga who was down with the Hill-a
And that punk who tried to dip into the squealer
You get bucked like C. Tucker and Will Bennett
Let me step, over the hump, and represent it
You go down like Jerry, and get smacked
Like Trick Leo, now here's your fuckin eulogy-o!

Now this some baaad weeed...

The very first time I hit the weed I was young
Coughin up a lung, high strung, back in '81
Goin to school, hittin the buddah behind the bleachers
Comin to class high, sellin the lie to the teachers
Nickel bag, nickel bag, dime to a nickel
Sellin joints to the honeys suck it like an icicle
Others wanted the 40 but I wanted the weed
While everybody was runnin out, I was plantin my seeds
Homegrown, backyard boogie, I'm still stoned
Got my weed plants taller than your telephone's pole
I can remember when I could only get ses in those days
Now I'm rockin that chocolate thai, skunk and the haze
Roll a fat one, pass it to the left don't front
But I hate it when they don't take the seeds out the blunt
A bunch of blunt-rollers are like rookies on the field
Spillin the weed plant fuckin dookies with no skill
I should write a book, how to roll it then pass it
Light it, grow it, sell it and then divide it
Mr. Greenthumb, Dr. Weed, I proceed to give the herb man what they need
True indeed, blow your fuckin smoke up in the sky
And get high with your bong or your Phillie or Dutches, give me a light
You might also like
Grab the weed up, pack it in, put it in the pipe
Light it up, smoke a bowl, we puffin the lye right
Put your finger on the hole and hold it in brother
Take a puff, that's enough, and pass it to another

Get the weed sack, smoke it up, til it's all gone
No roaches up in the ashtray, smoke up all the bomb
I used to spend money but now I'm growin the crops
But I hate it when the pigs throw a raid on the spot
It was once said I smoke so much weed, by a brother
That I look like the nigga on the zig-zag cover
Maybe I used to look like that way back when
When my nigga Sen Dog was around sippin on the Hen
Let the fly rhymes smother you with the scent of the skunk
We got the High Times cover shows you how to roll a blunt
Quarter pound, quarter pound, pound to a quarter
Makin trips to Mexico runnin down to the border
Long hairs, bald heads, dreads and punk rocks
Kids of all colors be puffin it down the block
I got the weed on lock with all the hydro methods
Call me Puffy cause I makin and takin a hit record
Blow your fuckin smoke up in the sky and get high
With the bong, Phillie or Dutches, give me the light
Grab the weed up, pack it in, put it in the pipe
Light it up, smoke a bowl, we puffin the lye right
Put your finger on the hole and hold it in brother
Take a puff, that's enough, and pass it to anotherEmbed
I wake up every morning, kiss my wife goodbye
Hug my kids, tell 'em I love 'em, I'm out, hit the ride
I'm out on patrol, in my squad car, do I lay
Where you never know, if you'll be makin it home today
So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hardened and scarred tonight, feeling nobody's loss
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why
Don't I get hurt, cause there go my nerves, I got the urge
To merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain
What a fuckin shame, I don't wanna live, or paint the wall
With the bloodstains, eye of the pig, I see it all

The eye of the pig
* DJ Muggs cuts and scratches 'This pig' from _Pigs_ *

I've been on the force, over twenty years, I can say
That I'm worse, than some of these motherfuckers I put away
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I see it all
Drug abusers, drug dealers and the gang-bangin
Pieces of shit who should be on the fuckin noose hangin
These days you can't tell who's-who in the world
Is that a whore, or is that, an innocent young girl?
Fuck, I need a drink, and I'm almost off
At the precinct, it's like an AA meeting all gone wrong
I.A. got an eye, on my close friend guy
For takin a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me, we never rat on each other
We went through the academy, just like frat brothers
Midnight, I only have an hour left on my shift
Think I'll get my dick SUCKED by this basshead bitch
My marriage is all FUCKED, my wife is with the neighbors
Subpeonaed, now I gotta sign these fuckin divorce papers
I recall, happier times, before the fall
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I see it all

So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about
My abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt
Lookin through the eye of the pig, I'm all fucked
No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
From the innocent man down, to the pedophile
No one gives a fuck about me, I'm slippin
Into darkness, I'm comin to grips and feelin heartless
What's this?  A dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside
"Pull it over to the curb, take your keys out of the ignition..."
.. and raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fuckin head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talkin about is slangin and shootin off the scraps
OK, Mr. B Real, get the FUCK out of the truck
I love it how all you fuckin rappers think it's so funny
Hit the FUCKIN floor, I need no probable cause
You got a big sack of coke in your truck (what?) so take a pause
You find it funny?  Get that smile off your face
Motherfucker take this

Geeyeah, Soul Assassins two times, stick em!
Geeyeah, Cypress Hill three times, come on!
Geeyeah..

Infiltration be our daily operation for chasin'
Cross the seven seas eased, clockin' much compensation
Penetration, you know we gets busy, no hesitation
Greenery, hand-picked from my own plantation
Feels the heat under the sombrero
To any amigo that's tryin' to stop the dineros
Chills with señoritas like Charo
Get drunk off tequila, lay low 'til tomorrow
Follow my flow, get the cash and go
Call my homey B-Rizzy in Mexico City
Loose lips sink ships, faker faces got guilt
Didn't mean to call you late, I need a hideout 'til
Cool, homey I'll bring some fuckin' skunk
The homey smuggle me across lines in a trunk
Just like a bird I'm free, in a land
With no fuckin' extradition treaty, I'm out, geeyeah

Just sit back, look at the show, and see that
Display the raw power, black out

Leave it alone, the unknown fury, blind rage
Move aside, get wise and make the front page

"Make certain that no stone stands
That no creature crawls
I command you to let loose the last of the Titans"
"It's time to strike!"

Let the rain pour down from God above
With the blood of my blade, no love, begin the flood
Open the gates, let the battle begin, we're in
With the wind at our backs, ready for any attacks
Sound the horns, prepare for war, begin the storm
The flaming arrows hitting your body, keeping you warm
With the uniform of my sworn enemies
You raped and pillaged my city, and spread disease
Feel the sword of the warrior's wrath, the path you take
Can lead to the math that the masters break
The clash of the titans, are you frightened of loss
Fighting with the cause to free, you and yours, in God law
Look in the stars, aligned with the sign in Mars
Destruction, what's your function, you roll with God

The life's memories, strife bringing the thieves
Cut the heads off, hide in the loft, don't even cough
Or breath, pay the cost, move and your life's lost
Let the spirit reunite, with your weapon, you wanna fight
Hear the sound of the warriors stepping into the night
The eye in the sky, looking to punish ya, never hide
No cover to shelter your lives, the souls begin to rise
And to clash

"Attention"
"Attention"

God's enemies, falling upon, the knees crawling
Beheading the dead souls, who run away from their calling
Behold, the white horse, remorse, never the case
Every corner of the world, the battle is taking place
Let the war drum set the pace, you face fire
Resume, from the Temple of Boom, and seek higher thought
Maybe you live, or maybe not, the blade's hot
Many renegades ready for battle die on the spot
With one shot, one whole city becomes rocked
The clash rages on, people remain calm
Good, bad, all in the balance, you going mad
You can never tell, heaven or hell, the blood shed
And it's all around, you can't run, sit in the cell
When the war's over, the light will shine, clearing the spell
Celebrate now, put the blades to rest
No wickedness, only the blessed will hold down

I was an outcast, outsider, trouble maker
A lost soul, outta control, in danger
Didn't have a care in the world, my feelings were numb
Never showing emotion, it's easy for some
I don't know how it happened, how I got to this point
But I needed a way out, I was stuck in a ploy
I needed another path or I'd self destruct
I was down on my luck, my head was so fucked
A menace runnin' the streets is what I was
Holdin' my heat and rollin' with the serious thugs
You couldn't tell me a thing, I was like my brother
Words went in one ear and out the other
Slangin' and bangin' with a chip on my shoulder
An insane in the brain certified street soldier
So close to the grave, you at an early age
Can't tell you the price I've paid

Oh, the sky overhead, it's like a canvas of grey
I don't know how much time I'll be given to stay
From the first spring to light 'til the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life 'til they come carry me away

I've been there in LA nights in the block where I came up
My pops used to hate when we hanged with them bangers
Guess he knew one day that we'll become us
That's just how it is when you live where we come from
"Fight, don't run!" is the motto we live by
Get 'em on the ground and stomp 'em out ten times
Sure we was just kids back then
I had no remorse for what we did back then
Six of us, one call, we'd all pack in
Hit the strip and go and get the shit crackin'
Gun wars and drug deals, I seen 'em happen
When I started losin' homeboys, I wasn't laughin'
I looked all around and seen none of 'em there
That's when I figured out that nobody cared
If we lived or die, we'll just get high and ride
And I wasn't gonna let this happen one mo' time

My mother would stand for me every step of the way
She didn't judge me, she told me I'd win some day
When I was at my lowest, when I had no focus
She pulled me out the gutter, said I wasn't hopeless
Every night she prayed for me I was out in the street
Chillin' on the corner with the hand on my heat
Eyes open wide for the pigs and foes
It's an every day hazard when you hustle for dough
So many nights I didn't come home, she thought the worst
Maybe somebody shot me down without any remorse
Maybe I hurt somebody and I was stuck in a cell
Well, I regret all those times that I put her through Hell
When I reflect back on those days, my heart aches
And everybody I lost or let down, I wish I could take it
All back and make it better but I can't, so I try
To make amends and be there through thick and thin

Oh, the sky overhead, it's like a canvas of grey
I don't know how much time I'll be given to stay
From the first spring to light 'til the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life 'til they come carry me away
Come carry me away

I used to carry a Glock on the waist line
Man I don't waste time
I'm strong on the bass line
You'll never taste mine
See me on the screen
Fuckers beggin' for face time
Get your own tape
But don't bother to chase mine
I got a block, man, we havin' a great time
You couldn't fill the shoes
Anytime that I laced mine
Light up the stage
For the homies we make shine
Sick the dogs on you get more by the K-9
Homies on the yard never walk in the main line
The manes find that they can never be in the game
I'm lettin' off rounds
Hittin' blunts at the same time
Pick a crew homie
You a neon to save time
Bitches like you always spittin' the same rhymes
We put you all to shame
You never went through the same grind
Put you in the bind the minute you came by

And I ain't changed since back in the day
Get your shit split quick if you get in my face
You wanna run with the dog
Better stay in your place
Cuss your little ass name, don't hold no weight
And your little ass safe couldn't hold my cake
Get your asks denied down the road I take
And let me tell you one more thing before I skate
If you a fake or a snake, I'mma send you to your grave

I'mma do my thing. let me tell you right now
'Cause I don't know any other way of living my life now
Some of you know the struggle, some of you live in a bubble
Some like you hustlin', some of you just looking for trouble
I don't follow or lead, tommorow's a dream
Pray to God to intervene on all the sorrow I've seen
You want out of here, you can leave when you wanna
Nothing can stop you, if that's your type of persona
Life is shorter now, don't make me say it ten times
I keep going for mine, even in the end times
I can beat the system, come on and say it with me
Show me some optimism, we can take over the city

This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway

Regardless of the climate, I'm gonna get it everyday
Even if the bullets spray, I'm gonna get it anyway

This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway

So let 'em hear us holla or we'll guide us by the collar
Making it harder for you, don't wanna make an honest dollar
You wanna sip a little to make your pain numb
Tippin' that bottle, got you forgettin' where you came from
But I'm the same one, where you think my name's from
I'mma keep it moving and never stop till the game's done
Forever we live it, forever we spit it
Remember the minute you witnessed the realest that ever did it
(Quit it)
Still I'm committed no matter what I hear from the critic
People can see through a gimmick, I'm putting on a clinic
We in troubled times, swerving through the double lines
You run ahead on collision course, now you served your time

This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway

You shoulda bought
Then you know the rules before you hit it once
When you catch my blunt
You know which way to pass it when it comes
(Pass the joint on the left hand side)
Don't ever pass it on the right
Never ash it on my Nike
If you sprinkle hash in it
Just don't let it out your sight
'Cause if you take it outta sight
Well ya just beggin' for a fight, aight
Give me a lighter
So why you can't decipher, ignite it
Puff Puff Pass homie
Don't just stand and try to hide it
I smoke a bowl or a spliff and uplift my spirits
Then I take a bong hit
Hit it fuckin' hard and clear it
Hit it with the left hand
Pass to the next man
Feel the buddha bless
And his weed is from the west
And you'll never get it done
Your bitin', you can bet it on your life
It's 4/20 every night, who wanna get high?

I'm center stage high
Civic center stage dive
Even summer, winter, spring

Of smoke then I choke and laugh
Then toke on the left hand side
No joke work
Can touch these Los Angeles souls
We twist herbs up
The word's a dangerous flow (Go!)
(Only on the left hand...)
When I smoke, I'm tilted to the side like a kick stand
Roll up a rock and call me a middle man
I'm sinkin' a riddle like it was quicksand
One *snort* clear out your nasal passage
Wit the medicine of Dristan
Voila, my mind at ease
The Policeman (Whoop-Whoop) wanna come find my trees
Hashish from Iraq

Tearing up the studio just tryin' to find my keys

"Say what?"
"Say what?"

"Say what?"

I be that, short-temper, hostile rhyme bringer
Lifestyle gone wild, similar to rock singers
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dreams
Cypress, Assassins, SX, latin thug thing
Fools think they get bad, I ain't really with that
Flavour of the month, bro, (?) try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down, an' stripped butt-naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it

And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin', without a hit single

Since  the Watts riot of 1965 has the city seemed so out of control. Los Angeles is still on the edge

Living in the big city, the American dream
Is far roaming in the streets of greed
Everywhere I turn I'm on a mission for more
But I ain't selling my soul
With the dope there's no girl
I'm on a one way box to the top
Hitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block
I'm in the fast lane and I won't stop
You ain't nothing but talk
You couldn't hang on the rope by ball

This life that I live, it ain't for the weak
I'm a roddy ass gangster that came off the street
I'm trying to keep the peace, but I gotta keep my peace
Got these drunk police want me all rappy
And I'm searching for the higher ground
I want my head in the sky
So high that I can't come down
Leave your lies in every town across the nation
'Cause you can never stop to play

Cruising in the drop Chevy
Got my foot on the floor
I'm hitting switches and my brain is heavy
You wanna look inside and see who's crossing the brine
Curiosity is killing you with stick in the prime
I get high from the brim in the set
Never gripping the script
But all you haters couldn't hold my dick
Don't need a clip for my nine is straight
You should leave it alone
And check your toe 'cause my line will spit
This right here's as high as it gets
Somebody likes the split the hell
Cause you stepped on the sex
But guess who will show you, you gotta pass the check
Got my clock on deck and my custom vest streets
You came, for me I'm the best
And you can keep the dress
'Cause I'm smoke at the less
Turn a step back I'm tired of getting pushed

Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)

I go psycho, crazy Michael Myers
I set the stage on fire, go higher
'Cause when my name's on the flyer
There's so much more to make the whole city rise
This defines a man to get the whole world lifted
One man trying to make a land with a mission
There's no way you can stand in this position
You can't take the heat, get the fuck up out the kitchen
Born with the will to hustle, see we hittin' the floor
You'll never stop it, you ain't got the muscle
We're on the world tour, homeboy, this is for sure
We got a tour, blow the stage up, we out the door
Sometimes we all need an escape, so when we fall off track
You get your mind while we make a stack
I made a pack with a crew on the hill
We continue to build with all the people who believe their bill

You spit my name and use it like an obscenity
You got more skulls in your closet than a Kennedy
You on my nuts so you better hold tenderly
I can tell you what's crackin' and done get splitten
You corrosin' on the floor, shaken and snake bitten
You in a cold sweat like James of the names you knew
Don't mean shit to me and you ain't got a clue
Of what's about to happen - interaction
Two worlds collide - one survives the reaction
Hold tight, keep yourself together
Cause we're about to storm you like shitty weather

Gun spray, gunned away, cut from the roster
You're just an imposter, you lost your composure
Respect your exposure to bring you to your closure
But you're in denial and still remain vile
In a place within last style and senseless wild
I take you down the long trail you failed to keep up
That's when you get introduced to the street sweeper

Some of y'all will smoke anything, but me, I'm picky
I throw it out if I don't see that it's green and sticky
No stress, no bush, I'm pushing the kush
When I harvest put a K on the bag like the Nike Swoosh

'91, Cypress Hill burst upon the scene
Three crazy, gun-totin' niggas smokin' weed
Talkin' about life on records was the whole plan
So we put out The Phuncky Feel, but you were feeling Kill A Man
That was about the time we was openin' up for royalties
Didn't know shit, we were jus' tryin' to rock the party
'92, a year later, 'bout a million records sold
From doin' shows like Lollapalooza on the road
Buildin' up momentum, whilst spittin' deadly venom
Takin' pictures for High Times, me, Muggs, and Senen
Chillin' with the Beastie Boys, smokin' lots of weed
But it was time to hit the studio for another LP
'93, Black Sunday hits, with critical acclaim
Had a monster hit from Insane In The Brain
Topped the charts, held the spot, for six weeks to boot
It was a trip to note, that we was the first ones to do it
In rap music, but it was a feat none the less
So we started gettin paid and I stopped smokin' stress

'94, still in the door and we conquered many tours
With Rage Against The Machine, House Of Pain and many more
Was even invited to Woodstock, some niggas from the block
Called up Eric Bobo and half a million rocked
How could all this happen at 24 years of age?
Half a million bouncin' to your shit from off the stage
'95, I was alive and survived so far
Still tryin' to cope with bein' a Rap Star
'Cos that's the type of shit that can really affect your mental
This was evident, in the way I broke the tempo
With confusion, (I'm havin' Illusions) pain, and hence illusions
But I still kept my set up with the critics bein' abusive (yeah)
Even the record company, they became illusive
When it comes to showin' support for the Cypress institution
'96, with no support we were still makin' moves
Cypress Hill, in the summer, we were on the Smokin' Grooves
But like every legend every clique, someone had to split
So the Dog left the house, shit was gettin' kinda thick
I was with the electric lady, we was talkin' about babies
But the groupies on the road don't help me from misbehavin'
You don't know no real shit, nigga (it's the real shit!)
This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga
We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga
You ain't on no real shit, nigga

'97 was the trip, it was the year we killed the feud
Between us and Cube, over shit nobody knew
The Dog came back home but after Smokin' Grooves 2
Chillin' with George Clinton and Erykah Badu
This was a crazy time, we were flowin' off the boo
Niggas on stage, trippin' on the 'shrooms
'98 was kinda great, cos it felt just like before
We hit the studio, recorded Cypress Hill IV
But someone dropped the ball, as I still recall
'Cos it felt Cypress Hill got no support at all
We did the last Smokin' Grooves, but did it all with Sen
And the old chemistry, just reared it's head again
'99 I got to recline, because there was no doubt
That the first year was a success, of the Smoke Out
'99 was even better than the year of '98
And Skull And Bones was comin' out, kickin' from the gate
2000, 15 million records sold
They broke the mould, but there's others along the road
But we still keep rollin' on from Heaven to Atlantis
Droppin' shit in English and makin' albums in Spanish
2001, goddamn, who knows what's in store?
Just as long as motherfuckers know, who's knockin' on the door
We remain unjaded and still we go unfaded
See how long we made it and never ben outdated
We ain't goin out, motherfucker (That's right, FUCK that!)

I remember times I hustle, times I struggle
Times I had to get over the everyday shuffle
People trying to muffle my thoughts and all my dreams too
People who I thought were down, and see true
But I blame me too 'cause it's a Chronicle
My life, I realise I'm responsible for obstacles
In front of me, my own self to blame
But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame
It's a worthless game, but if you're willing to play
There's sharks in the water who are, willing to pay
The price of your soul, but if you give it away
You silly motherfuckers are all committed to stay
It's a cold world, but you still want a part of it
So then you'd better fuck around and learn the art of it
Don't walk through life with your blinders on
'Cause you'll keep going crazy till your mind is gone

It Ain't Easy
But you got people trying, to put you down, believe me
I keep gaining ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you deceive me?

I been around for many days, of musical mainstays
Cypress, is Worldwide and we like it that way
You can't fade-ER, or compare TO
The Original Pyscho-Baiter
Got the next rhyme and we'll check you all later
Can't nobody fuck with them Cypress Hill Raiders
Heard it all before and I don't need no more
Advice on the game and how to kick hardcore
Played the game out here with the best
Toured around the world and got big respect
Now, what's (?) all with this year 2000's?
We putting the Smackdown and we ain't clowning
Not many have lasted
Since we first blasted
Up on the scene, singing about the dream
Recruiting for our team, niggas know what I mean?

Still hating, creating all the evil now

You're tripping on me and showing emotions too
Don't you spend your life full of envy, it's deadly
Heed me, as I spit the venom believe me

I keep my guard up, and always let you see my rage
I get pissed, like a pitbull in a cage  (*barking*)
Not that many can deal with the fury
Attack and ransack and kill in a hurry
I kill and observe and go in an instant
I bring the pain like the Rampart precinct
I kept it right for the brother in the chullo
Something I bump when your gates in the (?)

I lost my innocence at birth but I make no excuses
For the trivial things and the pain life induces
Bitches are wild, and so was I, young and stupid
It's incredible, what a shitty circumstance produces them
Criminals, led by the originals, high strung, motivated by the, principles
Some of us out - he used to think we were invincible
On the corner bangin' and slangin' the habitual
Deadly rituals fill my head, nothin' spiritual
Bullets filled up bodies like hands from my physical
I got touched by the hot hands of bitter fools
Divided and tempted snake bitten by the ridicule
Frustration and hate filled my adrenaline
I play doctors here's two bullets for your medicine
I carry those days like a weapon close to me
The memories of hot lead rippin' a hole through me

Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Stand...

You're in a ghost town and home alone like Macaulay nigga
Don't say my name nigga, don't even think of me
Fire start spittin' from my grill piece, ya scorched up, touched up
I'm the C4 that blew up your porch
I spit venom quicker than the punch on your Porsche
Venom so deadly I'll make your fuckin' life divorce ya
Ask for Alamoney, bitches, you all phoney
I'll make you sing the blues like you're Paulpau Coloney
Go ask Moley, you in the middle of shit
And anything you say I'll be known the shit
The force drops hits a ball, makin' me die of laughter
Cause I know what these son-of-a-bitches are after
Your mind and soul, if your blind and cold
Then your true sign is shown, then your fuckin' mind is blown
Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but we're still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong

Aww, comin' through fo' real we Cypress Hill, ohh baby
Got that crunk, for yo' trunk, goin' gangsta crazy
We some real life hustlers, playin' games in the street
We got that low-ri-der, scrapin' dippin' on three (low-ri-der)
So pop your collar, give a holla, throw yo' dubs in the air
We tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Playa do that thang, that make you feel alright (low-ri-der)
Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin' freaky tonight

Now when people are done, bumpin' they head to this
You wonder why you wanted anything instead of this
We been makin' you bounce, for many years already
Rock steady and cut, many niggas to confetti
But I just want to blaze it up; whether it's the mic or a spliff
Yes my gift is to amaze you all
Thought I couldn't come for ten my friend, but guess what?
I slay niggas and still savin' my best nut (low-ri-der)
But you better cover your eyes, cause you never know when
I spit it out and start some flowin'
I drop rhymes that grow like trees you're smokin'
Ear drums feel like lungs, your brain's chokin'
Just let it soak in, seep in, creep in
I'm keepin', all you motherfuckers in the deep end (low-ri-der)
You wanna trip? Then I got luggage
I stuff you in and send you off, cause you ain't rugged

The "I Don't Give A Fuck" committee's just arrived
With millis and fifty-fives
Homicidally, I've separated the busters
Blasted the snitches, broke the switches
Fucked the bitches, invaded the glitches
Stole the riches, booked the bitches
Like fuck ya interests, nigga

Poet in the streets, niggas livin' on the edge
We take it to the Darkside, gettin' in your head
While you haunt us like a fed, we twist you like a dreadlock
Has I got to hammer talkin bitches in the bed?
While you fuckin' with the Soul Assassins and the Dog Pound
And all my latin dog-niggas get to hold it down
Now your violatin' 'cos you haters know i'm waitin'
In the silver stack in the parkin' lot
With the handle cocked

I'll admit, I was a wild seed when I was a kid
Slangin dope, poppin Shroomz and droppin lots of 'cid
Psychodelic visions would ensue my view
Feelin the alter-states as they altered my fate
But our sordid due, all that distorted shit brought it up
I came short and couldn't afford to store it up
So I began to record it on audio
The autobiography of Luis Mario
Something that's unbelievable, inconceivable
That half the shit I set out to do was achievable
But alas, look at all the shit come to pass
While we remained strong, others broke like glass
Cos you lack style, and you need all the help brother
Cos you're fragile, and it should say it on your cover:
This side up, for the celebrity
Who lacks intelligence, integrity, intensity
Oh it's true, I got you in that angle like Kurt
But don't go gettin your fuckin feelings hurt
I spit many bars of heat, that burn like a furnace, I pour rhymes out like
Coffee spillin out your thermos

I don't walk around with bodyguards, that's not me
I'm hangin out with the people as my posse
Used to have a lot of enemies with bad intentions
Spreading gossip like disease, creating lots of tension
People turn around when you become a star it seems
But others hate you all cos you've fulfilled all your dreams
They smile in your face and act like nothing's wrong
When you turn your back, they hate, and play one of your songs
Why don't you take your mask off, look me in the eye?
You afraid I might blast-off and call you on your lie?
Take a deep one, and peep son
Retribution comes around more than once, like a re-run
You're a cheap one, the hill's so steep, son
You're just another one who gets thrown in the quay, son

You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
Cos you know you're just dead-weight
But at the present day they gettin stalled out for some reason
But not from me, because it's punk-hunt season
Charged with high-treason, I'm easin the blow never
The body that you're leasin, ain't gonna roll forever
So think about that, is it worth the pain?
When you flirt with pain, bitch it'll hurt your brain
But you're thick-headed, numbskull and rig-setted
It was the moment you feared, when my venom spreaded

A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It ain't no need to fight
We may squeeze the pipe, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with shark fin off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the farm
Home-grown, thick, dirty
My family feud dudes who pack 2's on survey
Jersey and house
Gun like an elephants snout
Pull ya ambulance out
Ya whole team'll get bombarded
Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, RUN
Doc with the shotty and we both catch a body with Cypress Hill

My mind is my Glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked
Now who's hot and who's not

I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You wanna be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cos you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten
Star stricken, Glock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You wanna roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You wanna test with the sess, well first off

It's been awhile now, been around the block many miles
Many faces, many places, that I found friends
Places where I spend time, places where my mind roam
Places I could call home, places I could get stoned
I just wanna be alone when I'm feelin' in my zone
People want to knock me down, 'cause they never have their own
They won't get the best of me, but they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit' me? I'm not, what you 'posed to be?
Used to not give a damn, coulda just killed a man
Sawed-off in my hand, but I had to kill the plan
Think I've found my peace of mind, feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself
It all goes around me and others who would down me
Who I don't give a fuck about, trouble always found me
I know used to welcome it with my arms open wide
Trouble's hand's on the door, but it can't come inside

You got to be a real nigga in the Cypress Hill pit
Like the critics talkin' shit, but I'm not concerned
A hundred G's for sixty minutes is the bank I earn
I try to put it to you bluntly so you bitches can learn
That nobody get tired when it's time to burn
With so many phonies out there lot of you have been fooled
Into actually believin' that some shit is cool
Take the blinders off and go look for yourself
Fuck hearin' about shit from somebody else
I'm down for myself, I back up myself
Put in all on the line make sure that I'm felt

Felt the walls closin' in, and my shoe's wearin' thin
Had to be the biggest clown, man you couldn't comprehend
Some hated on my game, said I wouldn't be the same
Called me "Rock Superstar", "Insane In The Brain"
But I know I haven't changed, so I brush you to the side
Trouble's knockin' on the door, anxious just to come inside
'times I gotta block it out, no one likes to talk it out
Trouble keeps comin' and I can't seem to lock it out
Got my hands on the phone, I don't wanna have to talk
If you're feelin froggy, son, then I guess you gotta jump
I can see it in your eyes, you don't seem to recognise
I wouldn't fall into your trap, for many lives to compromise
I'm not fallin' for your shit, you ain't gonna take me there
You can talk all you want, but I don't got your weight to bear

You know, there are times when, you run out of weed
There's no one you can call
But at last there is one person you can call - Weed Man
(B-Real)
I've had drop dates with no weed to smoke
No roaches, no nothin' when I need to toke
Damn, where can I find some shit to puff on
Damn I need the kye cause it's gettin' tough on me (me)
Cause I'm a lumberjack and tree's
Get chopped up and packed up and sold to D
Bolo's are free, did you hold one fee?
Herchers for the herbics no waterin' the seeds
Some of your friends just really see me
Cause sussin' this, losin' no GHC
The pigs always wanna PH me, my gush hits harder than some GHB
But some of these swine wanna hit off mine
I just sit back, recline, and never waste time
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man
Call me and all inhale- "The Weed Man"

So many try to compete to take my spot
Caked out, how many dimes dropped?
How many times I lost one of my plots?
The competiton was to knock me out
The D.E.A. want to lock me out
Broke in my home tryin' to sock me out
But the true blue stoners never locked me out
I'm easy to find, call me whenever
You need some green and I'll make you feel better
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man

I'm the most well-loved, bringin' the bud
Stickin' the club up, everybody ridin' my nuts
What? You say you want credit? You must be high
There's no free rides on my supply
Unless you're one of my friends you need no ends
Just sit back and wait for the joint to begin
But if you know someone in need of this weed leaf
You can take my number down and beep me
I'll hook you up if you look me up
Just don't give my number to a rookie huh!
Then I'll cut you off and brush you off
Never trust you and won't dicuss your loss
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man
Call me and inhale - "The Weed Man"
(Chorus: Sen Dog)
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(Outro: B-Real)
There it is motherfuckers, you run out of weed
Call somebody like me and I'll hook you up
No stems, no seeds and things that you don't need
That's right! I'm the Weed Man
Don't trip I got gush, for a high price ho...Embed

And groupie niggas bangin' for passes to the show (Can I get in?)
Big-ass cheques wit' plenty of O's (O's)

It's a rep thing, haters feel they chest pain
They feel it in they heart, I was there to test things

But really, niggas get money out here
And hey, everyday is sunny out here

As I sit in my silver stack thinking about way back
Even before I started blazing the chronic sack
I was a young wild unfocused troublesome kid
Looking up to all the gangsters and the shit they did
I was at an impressionable age through a faze
An unmentionable stage deranged full of rage
Walking through life in a haze with dark clouds
Hanging over my head being wicked and loud
And sometimes those demons haunt me and taunt me
Follow me pursue me confuse me they want me
They come at me from all angles and dangles
Memories in front of me, but I won't run away
I put the gun away but sometimes my hand ditches
But I don't want to get locked away cause I whack bitches
I left those ways back in the old days
So go away I don't got no time to throw away

Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (We fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (Got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I got my education on the streets
And I learned how to spit rhymes out with or without beats
To say whatever I went through or going through
Tripping off people who acting like they been knowin you
Learn how some of these record companies be holdin you
Attaching an image in the end controllin you
But we set out to set ourselves apart
And let these people know just what they had from the start
It's like Ghostface said we studied our art form
We turned the mike on and spit a fucking dark storm
People slept on me and doubted my skill level
But I'm tenacious and I got a strong will level
You been introduced to some of the real rebels
Injected with venom from god to kill devils

They follow me to the day I die (Got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

I remember my days as youth
Teenage gangsters with somethin to prove
See man amuse and we creep and we strew
Catch your ass slipping and dump on their crew
Just -- having fun but you crazy kids
Never thought about no prison beds
Got gang-sters twenty-five and alive
Never see the kids all fucking wild
But that's the game and shit don't change
Get respect for smoking brains
You get a name and you build your rep
You courting fools coming in your set
Before you know we're having fun
Slamming doping and packing gun
Leaving mad traces and blasting their faces
Got a hundred years for all my fucking cases
Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (We fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (They haunt me)
They follow me to the day I die (Got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)

Living in the city of the Scandalous
Shiesty motherfuckers, can't even trust my own brothers
So who can I choose to trust, me, that's who
Niggas want a piece of the pie, fuck off and die!
Jealous, envious fools want to rush this
Loco, Cuban ass nigga with the cash, shit
Motherfuckers just get your own, and leave mine alone
Forty-five ways to get sewn
Send out the invitation
To the party of your elimination
I got creeps that play for keeps, (Hardball)
Now I'm laying your ass down to sleep
But every hustler wanna be balling
But I got the balls for the shot calling
I pull strings, the Don King, only in America
Can I hustle, and flex my muscle

-Yeah, man, I've been out here
Running game for eight years
-I know I'm getting tired of standing
On this corner
-Nigga, I want a fat pad, and fly ass pool
Finest motherfucking bitches, jewels
And all that shit, if I got to take it
From a nigga
-Shit, let him run for me then
-I can work for myself, don't have to
Work for nobody, I'll be my own hustler

I don't know, but if you coming on my corner
I think I'm gonna bust
You can't handle us, devious, dangerous
Criminal mentality, insanity
I move weight, from state to state
All the niggas moving weight, can you relate?

-Damn, what's up, I see you
Pushing that big time weight
-I told you, I wasn't bullshitting
-You coming up, aight!
-When I seen you three or four
Months ago I told you
-Got respect for a man now
-Handle your shit!

Where can I choose to get my hustle on?
In the alleyway, lighting up all night long
Fuck working at McD's, I'm rolling with the O.Z's
In the QP's, puffing on trees
Who you gonna trust?, who can you trust?
Not that shady motherfucker in the city Los Scandalous
-Well, well, little man came up a little bit
-It feels good having money in the pocket
-Fuck that nine to five bullshit, right?
-Yeah, kick that shit to the curb
-But you got to look out for the scandalous motherfuckers
Cuz niggas is tricky than a motherfucker
-Yeah, but motherfuckers got to look out for us too
You know what I'm saying
I'm just as shisty as a nigga
-Shit, set me up and niggas are gonna die

Fuck all y'all
I'm comin' of the wall

Swingin' from my balls
Ugh!
Ya want me to set it
Well my MAC-11 takes unleaded
Let it rain

What you're seein' when I'm takin' shit another level higher
Now it's on
Ain't gettin' domed
Buckin' all these niggas 'til they all gone
Now we can roll to the east side of town
And I'm lookin' for a fat boy and a lotta (State of clown)
You better move your ass to this MAC-11
Pointed at your ass for the one eight seven

I ain't fallin' off like Humpty-Dumpty
Nigga you still wanna bump me
Still got the hand on pump
And now I'm thumpin' on 'em
Thumpin' on 'em
See
Somebody, anybody scream
When I got the gatt with the big red beam
Now what if I moved it up right between your eyes
Now your chances are never
When you're lookin' at the slug at the of the barrel
Where ya gonna run when ya can't move further
Seven 81 redruM with the Murder
Tie him up
Throw him in the trunk
Let the funk
Blow his eardrums out
'Til he's bleedin'
Then let's get him weeded
It's the punk Buddha
Let me do the
Ceremony up with the hoota
And the shooter
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'

Some people tell me that I need help
Some people can fuck off and go to hell
God damn, why they criticize me
Now shit is on the rise so my family despise me
Fuck 'em! And feed 'em, cause I don't need 'em
I won't join 'em if I can beat 'em
They don't understand my logic
To my gat to my money and I'm hooked on chronic
I never wanted to hurt a nigga
Unless ya come flexin' that trigga, I dig ya
That grave on the east side of towwwwn
Lay ya six feet undergrounnnnd
From man, to the dust to the ashes
All I remember tell me where the cash is
Click-clack, barrel at my dome
Give all your loot or you ain't goin' home
But I ain't goin' out with a bang
Wa da da dang, wa dada daa dang

I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind

(Ahhh) They all fucked up now
Cause they let a nigga back on the streets somehow
I'm lookin' for someone like me
Livin' in my own world to my own degree
On the loose in the city lookin' at the ho wit' the big titties
Lookin' at me and I feel shitty
A little tensed up gettin' hot
Cause she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot
I'm tryin' to find ways to cope
But I ain't fuckin' round with the gauge or a rope

Boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye

Step back as I'm kicking up dust for a while
As I put motherfuckers to rest and pull their files
Out from the cabinet with the picture
Get the .45 and settle it with this punk nigga
Slow your roll as I take control
Take your toke from the Indo', then hit and hold
Now let it out–how you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls, and you're coughing up a lung anyhow?
You can't shake that nigga that's gonna break, fool
On any one member of your bitch crew
As I pull the trigger on my nine
Say goodnight nigga–Boom biddy bye bye!

Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome, and you start to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die?
Boom biddy bye bye

Still handin' out beat-downs wit' my sawed-off
'Cause every now and then, I got to knuckle up, buckle up
Chin checking, It's on, I reckon
It's the wild, wild West
Get your 40 and your blunt and your Glock and your bulletproof vest
Let me guess, everybody wanna test?
Everybody running up, gonna get burned like Ses
Lodi Dodi, we fucking everybody
Boom biddy bye, sing the lullaby in the party

'Cause the nigga gets so funky
Fool, I'm the one from the big bad Cypress Hill clique, a
Number one son of the funk freaka
Yes, yes y'all
I'll be the one with the mad Buddha blast, y'all
Comin' from the West, y'all
But I figure you'd cry like a bitch
Don't twitch 'cause I just might pull the trigger
Now lay down, stay down
Don't move a muscle if you see your homeboy's brains on the ground
Don't fuck, don't say nothin'
You fuck around and I might get ragamuffin
Boom biddy bye bye
Lined up on the floor, now you all gonna die!

Smokin' MC's like a bowl of Buddha
Burnin' in my bong now
You don't want to step to the rhythm of the funk degrees
You'll be a prisoner in the temple of thieves
Movin out, just movin on out, no doubt
We the number one crew
Kickin' mark ass niggas out the house
Puttin' up an argument, just don't bother
'Cause I'll whoop that ass just like I'm your father
Take heed to the master's call yes y'all
(Break yourself fool cause I fade 'em all)
Bullets fly, but they don't give a fuck about who dies
When you're in the middle of the buckin'
No question, confrontation
Nowhere to run from the assassination
Let the rain come down
Whoops there goes another body on the ground
Watch out for G hound
It's the undisputed Cypress family
Kickin' up dust, can you handle us gradually
Growin' inside your mind like a tumour
Spreading in your head like a rumor
Venomous sound from the underground, I take care of business
What the fuck is this?

My army grows like buddha I sold ya

Number one mission, opposition
Get thrown sent home in dead position
In the casket, best wishes
At the bottom of the lake, sleepin with the fishes
Full out search for the body
Of the MC's who be comin to disrupt the party
No wins, no ends, no way
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again!

Check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
Sabas get blasted for words he packaged
Peep the sequence; crab adolescents, on his defense
Power-U niggas talkin fast like Puerto Ricans
What you seekin, son I catch cream like Dominicans

De ellos mismos, en las manos de ellos. Un día, va a ser sangre
Mucha sangre. La peste de los cuerpos muertos, van a oír
Que se va a hueler hasta los Estados Unidos, estos cabrones
Que con la democracia, que nos 'tan chingando en el culo
Todos son unos mismos cabrones..."4Embed
This sure is
I got that-a old crazy shit from round the corner you know
The homeboys and the brothers be slangin' this shit
But anyway, (everybody must get stoned (x4))
You over there singin' some shit, talkin' 'bout
Everybody must get stoned
I don't know but that shit sounds good to me

Hit the joint, of the bong, take a puff
Till you just can't get enough of the skunk
A punk nigga named Dough wanna take control
But to free
My soul, puff on the endo (keep puffin')
Let me take it in then I let it out (let it out)
One of you motherfuckers pass the white owl
Peace to the niggas in all the Buddha spots
Slangin' fat bags o' weed and runnin from the cops
(runnin' from them fools)
I hit the leño then pass it on
To the cypha' of dreadlocks gettin' stoned
(All the dreadlocks lya')
Roll a fat joint, twist it at the end
'Cos I get high with a little help from my friends (from my friends)

"Bitch-ass motherfucka! Peter Pie ass nigga! Stand on your own two feet, bitch! How the fuck you gon' bite somebody else's dick, nigga? Yours ain't long enough to put in your mouth, punk! What's up with that shit?"
(Background): "'Turn that shit up louder!'"
"Muggs, make it rough."

So many fools swingin' from my sack
Let's talk about the one who had my back!
Down in the west coast, so lemme kick it
To the motherfucker who calls himself "wicked"
No rest, no peace, no sleep
Doughboy rolling down the hill 'cause it's so steep
Jackson... lemme figure out the name
Jack cause you be stealing other niggas' game! (Lying-ass motherfucker!)
But I'm the wrong nigga you wanna fuck with
On my dick so hard, now ya wanna suck it!
Go on the head, gobble up the nuts
Get your lips ready & tear this motherfucker up!
Talk about Eazy, correct yourself
Cube, better step back and check yourself!

"Yeah, nigga! My homie thought he had a homie in you. He let you listen to our motherfuckin' cut, and you turned around and put some old "Friday" shit out. What kind of shit is that?"

Hmmm... let's talk about this
First solo album on the east coast dick
The east coast niggas all showed ya love
Especially the one known as King Sun
He tried to warn us niggas about ya
But nobody would listen
Even began dissin'
Two albums later, you callin' my crew
All because you wanna be Cypress Cube (No way, motherfucker!)
Shoulda known you couldn't hang in the alley
Good boy went to school out in the valley
Fuck it, lemme make this understood
Speakin' on mama's little Boy N the Hood
No Vaseline
Just a rope and a chair and gasoline (burning your ass up!)
Lench Mob is a friend of mine
But you talk about them niggas from behind
"You know what a chazzer is, O'Shea?
A motherfucking pig that don't fly straight"
Where ya gonna run to? Where ya gonna hide?
Taadow! Look at who's waiting outside! (Cypress, motherfucker!)

Natural Born Bullshitta
Lemme hit ya with a dose of reality when I get wit' ya
Your homie came knockin', he had to chain my suit
You put a pipe on your cover, even though you don't smoke Buddha
Let me take you down under on a plane
Where everybody was going insane
Took a look at the Real one: afro gone
The next morning, you didn't have yours on
How many ways will you bite my shit?
Would ya wet me or start throwing up a set?
Caution, when you enter the zone
Never used to bang 'til you heard the microphone (Studio gangsta!)
I got Cube melting in a Tray
Pulling up his card and fucking up his "good day"
Unoriginal rap veteran...
The nigga who say he don't steal from his friends ("I don't steal from my friends!")
Don't trust that nigga named O'Shea
Fuck him, and send him on his way!

Cypress muthafuckin' Hill, the hardest mothafuckin' posse there is out here, nigga. So how d'you figure you was gonna step to this? Yeah nigga, the big damn-wham-bam Cypress Hill, tibby-tibby-toe fool, all for your mothafuckin' dope! Nigga, you can't hang with the Hill! What the fuck you was thinkin' about?

So bring it on, if you wanna test it!3Embed
I got the sawed off shotgun
Hand on the pump
With the fucking red bastard
Snitching like a punk
I had the operation tight the flaws
Faded doors
Indo growin room on the basement floor
I'm holding weight every 30 days
Business pays
So many ways
Many methods of moving my white haze
I got the cellophane, get this money tonite
I got the shipment goin out
Got to be air tight
So when you fuck around
No time for me to fuck around
I got the ballin niggas waitin on me
At the compound
So get the trucks ready, and let's hit the back roads
To scam this motherfuckin' ass border patrol
I got my cousin Huey paid
For lookin away
Back on the 405 on the way to LA

Yeah, homes
Rob up and fuckin' come up, homes (Motherfucker)
30 miles to L.A

I'm multiplying in my head
Just how much stash it's gonna take for me
To double and triple up all my cash
I hit the city limits, time for me to check myself
Cause I don't wanna sit inside no fuckin cell
Slope the rolls down, hold down, I see the gate
So I'm pulling up, and I hope these fools ain't late
Or I'm outta here, wait, no, I see them in the rear
With 3 or 4 fools holding 2's in the real
I got the double barrel shit, hidden under my coat
For any crazy eyed motherfucker rockin the boat
I got the big boss hoss, just sippin the sauce
You got the shit? you got the money?
Then break the shit off

Check out the herb man smugglin' (Smuggler)
Bright and early in the mornin' (Smuggler)

It's my ass that I'm risking (Smuggler)
This is for the herb man sumgglin' (Smuggler)
I know it's your daily livin' (Smuggler)
I came a long, long way from slangin the herb
Sometimes I think about when I was kickin it to the curb
Now it's dirt in my pocket
But shit done changed
Tatoos on my body and fat gold chains
Got the mega shipment that must go out
On the same route me and my cousins started out
Head back to Mexico for a friend of mine
We're gonna bring this shit load back, 4-0 pounds
It's like clockwork, cause we done this shit before
Now I loaded up the stash on the hollow floor
Double checkin everything, now it all looks cool
Now we rollin to the border like we used to do
We pulled up at the border, but something was wrong
I began to realize that the swoop was on
I had the DEA and immigration closin' in
They had dogs all around my shit, no way to win
They lookin in the truck, now I know the shit's for blast
DEA agent sayin "now I got your ass"
It's been a long time smugglin, now I'm done
It's all over now, it's lookin' like I'm Audi, son

Now I'm headed up the river with the boat and no paddle (Smuggler)
And they got me in lock down (Smuggler)
Big up to the herb man smugglin' (Smuggler)

Homie, I'm the one with the shotgun, in the closet

I ain't got no kind of love for a brother
Who comes to the party with no bud

First it started with the nickel, then the dime
Then the twenty, spendin' up all my money
Now, I roll with an elbow
With the pound in the pad smokin' up the indo

Look at all the M.C.'s trying to get down
But all you get is a peeled back, dome cap

All these punk niggas better bow down and submit

Only if you niggas know the real deal
Fuck all the bullshit, Cypress Hill

Bringing the blood stains
Smeared on the sidewalk, one mark dome
Of the prejudiced skull, hanging in my home

"Straight to you dome sucker
So what you wanna do fool"

The Big Game hunter, fucking shit up
Get your ass back while the Hill's on the cut
Who'll get in the circle, let's see if you're raw
Hardcore, last vato might hit the fucking floor
Glocks and sigs and M1 clips
For any buster who wanna flip
Fat ese ring shining in your eye
Soul of an Assassin, until I die (Por vida ese!)
Red light visions in your dome piece
Nightmares running through your head, won't cease
Look at you now, broke down and done

I never rapped on an R&B record, and I never will
I got these phoney motherfuckers, talk about lets keep it real
But they don't know how to take they own advisement
Going out, do it solo on an advertisement, commercializing
Fuckin' sell out, nigga, this is hip-hop, not fashion
Get the hell out
I'm taking out these so called gangsta niggas
Takin' pictures, modeling clothes for small figures
And I never took another fuckin' MC's shit
And made it my first single, for a hit
Fuckin' hypocrite, you can get the dick, when I lick a shot off
I'm gonna, and all of it

No pop singles, and no actin' foolish
To the studio gangsta with the metaphors
In them magazines with the bitch editors
Keep it real in the game
Niggas got no shame
Now A&R executives want all the fame
Based on the videos, just a gang of silly hoes
For the fucking industry that's taking all your dough
I never stole it, stole it all
Just hard work, and sweat, for them platinum records on the wall
Fools want me to fall
I won't cause my roots are to thick and strong, like the chocolate thai stick
I hear niggas say no, but, I know they front
Cause after they shows they want me to smoke a blunt
I don't respect a hypocrite, motherfuckers I despise
Cause me I tell the truth, even when I tell a lie
All you brothers in the game run a check
Cause you get checked fucked off, with no respect

Can't feel me, if I was crack you'd try to steal me
Heard you, and your little crew, wanna peel me
Keep your hands on your hood, you get got

You wish you could hang, like I hang

B-Real:
Whatta you know? The nigga stole my dough
So I reached in the closet for the 4-4
 Jus' hold on, just wait a minute
It's gone, along with my big bad nickel-plated
Whatta you know? The fucker took my phone
I still can't believe that he robbed my home!
Whatta you know? I think he got to the herb
And the ferria, and the jewlery, and the Mossberg
Whatta you know? I can't find my keys to the 6-5
All the way live on D's
Whatta you know? I can't find my Rolex
With the 21 diamonds, shinin' on flecks
Whatta you know? When I find that mark-ass nigga
I'mma cut out his fuckin' heart!
Sen-Dog:
Whatta you know? I came up on this baller
For the dollar and the weed sack, and his Impala!
Whatta you think, when you can't trust your so-called homie
Like me, and you thought that you know me?
Whatta you feel, when you're lookin' in the closet
And the gat's gone, and so is your cellular phone?
Whatta you know? I took your loot and the jewels
With the buddah and the laptop in the nickel-plated tool!
Whatta you know? Now I run the show
With the phat pockets and the nigga's fly gold
Wahtta you think, when ya ass gets jacked
By a homie who was supposed to have your back?

Whatta you know? I'm rollin' in my zone
And I think I see the puto who rigged my home
 I got the Glock in the glove
Should I dump on the man, leave him lying in the mud?
Wahtta you know? He pulled out my 4-4
Now I got no choice, so I let it all flow
 The motherfucker's all blastin'
4-5 equal, in time for some tractions
 Slide action, no question
Forty-five slug is bad for your complexion
 The puto's cryin' like a bitch
Now the puto's lyin' in a fuckin' ditch!
B-Real (spoken):
 You can't even trust your fuckin' best homeboy these days, homes
 You got to sleep with one eye fuckin' open ...
 Payback's a motherfuckin' bitch!
 That puto should've watched his fuckin' back

(Intro)
What's up we gonna go down the line baby
Brand new one from the Call O Da Wild
Give big shouts to money makin Manhattan
145th street crews, 155th street crews
All my niggas on the East Side
We gonna flip the track baby, flip the script like this
Big shouts to all the weed spots and all that who know how we do
Moon-Finger Willie slap hard, Monie' chicks
Spillin' Barcadi on club seats
Harm's from the DK-crease-NY fully featured
Harlem incriminate
You dualistic heathens of the street all malfunction seats
Crews stand like mannequins sportin damaged Timb's
Army Cam' and flat burn in self-discipline
And supportin the medicine
Few convinced they fit descriptions of movie-men
Experience and heart with cinematographers having captured raw footage of this
Mischievous black kids dipped in black hooches
Ruthless shotgun car swindler stupid used to pump Luther in ya cougar
Now let the card hold the futures
(Chorus)
(B-Real)
Don't want to do it but they wanna

Keepin my enemies close and all my niggas at a distance
What is this?
Slicey characters spreadin my business
Fragments that can't manage that do damage yo I had it
Environmental pressure causing static
In fabric of the asiac cabbage it's madness

Big shouts to the LES baby we see you

Re-model frames and changin rusty engines and courting
And while you Forman fools wanna shorten my life
My life is like survival organs

Tossing lineal (????) break your vinyl
Chronically spotting spiral perhaps spinning out wax
Yo ?Nas? put the black wars on elegant floors
The teachers got operations make em insecure
Gypsy cabs I flag Donnas DC slam that ass take a detour
Affiliates with my predominately black landscape
Hop the squad I watch the sling shot from rotting up your pin spot
Jostling nigga (????) playing possum

Ain't nothing poppin while the tears who interfere
And the fears they disappear

Pero a este puerquito lo cogieron
So cuando llegue al bote le van a partir su boca
Por que cunado llegue al bote

"Am I a good maaaaaaan?
Am I good maaaaaaaan?
Am I a foooool?
Am I fooooooool? "

It was a cold dark night in December
Running from the po-po's the alleyway I enter
Trying to hideaway - when I stumbled on a gun
And nobody's knows nothing about - where it came from!
And nothing hotter then the summers in June
Who knows how many souls - they put in the tomb
When I picked it up man, I felt alot of pain
Like a shot  thru the brain - for reasons I can't explain!
After it went away - I felt a sudden change
Like - I can do anything. - And don't get in my way!
I'm scared for my family! - They couldn't understand
With gun in my hand - I became - another man
No more running and hiding away from the cops
No more getting robbed from the dudes on the block
You're looking at a new man in the light of the sun
You're staring down the barrel of a dead man's gun! (dead man's gun...)
You might also like
Cause you never know what's around them corners
Enemies try to run up on us!
So I keep that gun right by my siide
If you want it you gotta take my liiiife
And if you got problems, I got answers!
"One shot from the Revolver  - can solve it! "
Anyway you want it, it don't mat-ter!
"If you got hard. - I'm a go harder! " - You gotta take my liiiife!

You walk into a dream and shit feels like a game
Everyone is different - but they all end up the same
Even the places - and the faces all change
At the end of the dream - I could see - the bullets rain!
I thought it was me who brought these people to the death
'Til I noticed a funny thing, I was standing on the left!
Looking at other people with their hands on the gun
And pulling the trigger - until their enemies were done!
And with each hand that held the gun it got deeper
They ended a question against the shoulder of the Reaper! (yeeeahhh!)
They all look invincible with the weapon that was cursed
Until it was their turn - to ride in the hearse!
Seems like the history - is passing down to me (GO!)
Cause my finger was itching (GO!) to go after my enemies. (GO!)
I welcome them all (GO!) with the best on my chest (GO!)
Because I put 'em (GO!) to the test and laid those bodies to rest. (bodies the rest...)

Spring for more pimpin' - it's time passes by
And people are telling me about the look in my eye
Sayin' it seems there's a chip on my shoulder
And for some reason my attitude has gotten bolder!
I knew it was true - cause I felt myself changin'
But I don't care what they think cause I'm still the same man
I don't show weakness - anymore without a question
Don't wanna be stressin' and have to teach them rappers a lesson!
Never a time - I felt so alive (GO!)
An' situations (GO!) I thrive - like bees to a hive. (GO!)
I murder these (GO!) new kids - who got something against me. (GO!)
The thought of you (GO!) talkin' shit - really fuckin' offends me! (GO!)
In no time at all we come back to each other
Seems like I've seen it before. - I swear it on my mother!
A shot  rang out - and then my hands went numb
Seen my body on the floor - with the dead man's gun! (dead man's gun...)

You gotta take my liiiife... (liiiife...)
You gotta take my liiiife... (liiiife...)
You gotta take my liiiife... (liiiife...)
You gotta take my liiiife... (liiiife...)  Embed

Late night creepin' through the alley with six deuce
Strapped up everybody focused no mixed views
A sawed off pumped in my hand with two shells
The other four holmies on the scene with cocktails
One nigga lookin' for popos and foes hell
Someone lookin' through windows the door bells
Goes off followed by the punk you gas bomb
Adrenaline pumped up still I remain calm
House lit up you could see it for eight blocks
Runnin' through the hood run in front of the fade cops
The game chase but they couldn't cover the streets up
Rolled out ran into the spot to meet up
Strapped down covered up the tracks and back home
Laid low earned me a stripe perfect no

Shoot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the head nod
Soot 'em up
Bang bang
Another body dropped
You can't stop the hip-hop

A mad dog with a bob in the reagle
Go into mode and just kill all your people
Coast to coast ain't a nigga more evil
Now made me act a lot and call Sen Diesel
Rock the block with the M one six
.44 mag like a east war fit
This here granadilla break you off right quick
Be prayin' up to Jesus and all that shit
Uh niggas be jackin' when they see my bucket
Roll down they block they hide and say fuck it
Come back in form of an assassin
Three hundred yards with the infrared action
Troop is the layer black Doc Holiday
Cuancho raider the modern day huh

I manned all missions when I was a youth so thoughtless
G ride no fingerprints it's spotless
Six bows hittin' all the Gs and we got this
Rag top down like a stripper that's topless
See me hittin' the corner you meltdown
Slugs fly thugs die moment ya fell down
Somebody's screamin' you hangin' the hell down
I'm certified nigga when you're sittin' there spellbound
No thoughts barkin' just hearin' the hellhounds
Burn you with the heaters spittin' out twelve rounds
It's life in the hood no escapin' the gunplay
Buy one day I'm out gotta figure out some way
Rats in the park all scatter when guns spray
Got you locked in now where do the slugs stray
I found ways out but the street be one way
Got a dark mind no thoughts blacker than Sunday

ياعم يا بتاع الحشيش، أنا عايز حشيشة طرية
أستنى يا بي ريل، دا الواجب دا عليا
الحشيشة اللي في جيبه غير الحشيشة اللي في إيديا
الحشيشة اللي في جيبه غير الحشيشة اللي في إيديا
ونصطبح أنا وأنت ونولع الدنيا
ونشرب سطفا حلوة ونسميها: كايروفورنيا

You're lookin' at the last of a dyin' breed
Weeded up, please, speed it up
Sittin' in the Cali sun heated up
Inked arm needled up
Rocket style, Don Cheadle'd up
I put the fear of God in people, what
People lookin' at me sideways like I'm on the verge
Like them on the purp that's blazed, I don't say a word
You don't wanna follow me, son
You ain't got the nerve
You just wanna swerve with a little herb, absurd
Got you paranoid in the paragraph when I paraphrase
Got a pair of Jordan's dancin' on your fuckin' face
Paralyzed, see the paranormal paratroops
Summoned by the Grandmaster as he prepares to loose
Temple doors open up, smoke billows out
Now you hoping, what, for mercy? Get your soul brilloed out
From another hood, you ain't really fuckin' with our brotherhood
Even if another could, I wish a motherfucker would
Clip it up or sip it up
Listen, I prefer to trip it up
Chem skippy ya'll bitter fucks
I can take a bigger chunk
And if I'm callin' dark figures up
Don't make a move, they light triggers up
Muggs, cut 'em up, chka-chka, what, huh
(This is for the-)

Ever heard of me?
Wicked as you ever seen
Heavy on the throttle
Smoke when we hit the scene, rollin' unseen
Under the cover of night
Spirit flying free, niggas higher than a kite
You got nothing on me, we some nomads
And my clan goes way back to the Cro-Mags
Run together, unbreakable bloodline
Too much to fuck with when all the brothers combine
Everything you ever heard of is not a myth
Crazy dogs you don't ever wanna deal with
Which smell? It's the hash that we left around
Smoke a whole pound when I feel myself comin' down
Live how I wanna live and answer to no one
Similar to the ways of the shogun
Think again before you try and come and get me
Or you'll be shot up by a gang of gypsies (shot)
وعنينا قفلت ودماغنا سافرت، سافرت في حتة تانية

Step out the door like a warrior facing up (what)
Embrace fate, can't wait till I see your brains
You can't look into my eyes, try and you'll see
I'm made of stone, you got a heart of glass, keep your distance
I set the tone on the crescent moon soon, bitches
Growing up in the cut, soaking gangs vital
So insane, pick your brain cannibal style
The nightmares that I'm livin', wouldn't wish on you
Piece is rare like a steak, man, piss on you
Puttin' up bombs, bitch, I hope you fall off
Squeeze, click, bang, body gets hauled off

Staying hungry but your fear is what I fed on

Lights out, see the ex or a family crest
Broken dreams what I see when my eyes open
Life's mundane, I'm just going through the motions
See the dream, I want the nightmares come to life
Fighting my demon, heard a voice coming to the light
Soul burning like coal in a steam engine
Silence my enemies swift with a clean endin'
The way Tammy looking for somethin' upliftin'
Intoxicated by the bloodlust, fuck slippin'
I was raised like a Nomad, stay driftin'
Two wheels, sideways bitch, heart skippin'
I'm fire with the ice, hit you twice, no quarter

Jesus was a stoner, uh-huh

Lying out on the corner, uh-huh
While they're tryna stone us, uh-huh
You wanna stone us, you wanna stone us
Come on stone us
They wanna stone us, they wanna stone us
Come on stoners

I'm called the weed messiah, grab your lighter
You're transfixed with the spliff and your lips higher
Like smoke rises, your sex is heightened
Inhale, embrace Mary, but don't be frightened
I bring the God flower, uplift the people
Holy sacrament communion, take and let me feed you
No superstitions or crucifixions or false prophets
Crosses burnin' in my hand, call it burned object
Smoke gathers like holy masses
Take a hit, pass it to the left, it's in the passage
You know my disciples, this is a new revival
Judas rose and took the soil to enrich the cycle
Smoking Mother Earth, blessed is the herb
Mother Mary save us, thankful for what you gave us
Roll it in my papers, share it with my neighbors
High as skyscrapers, a cult of cultivators
We got the multitude, our sisters and our brothers
How I break my bread like it's the last supper
I'm the blood of stoners, I'm the higher after
Believe me, elevate, hear the sounds of laughter

Pass the knife, I'ma take a life
Seems I'm on a bad one, every night
More attention to the light
Burning up at the very touch, runaway train
I perform the ritual, take away all the pain
Free you from this life, from my hands I release you
If the end is what you pray for more than women to appease you
Another chapter starts and more darkness fills the ages
And another stage is set for many names upon the pages
I can sing you all the lullaby and nullify the threat to me
Then disappear, no one knows my whereabouts, presently
Blend in with the masses, now I'm fittin' in society
Hide behind the mask, overwhelmed by the anxiety

Set the bar high, stars in your eyes
Far as I can see, I can see those little scars that you hide
You one of the rock gods
This is only the beginning
'Cause the ghost is in the shadow
And this patience slowly thinnin'
Sweat drippin' down my face
As I'm waitin' for the moment
When the metal's flyin' blind
There's no chances for atonement
It's my life and I own it
Ace up me sleeve and I've shown it
I have skill to survive
All my life I have known it
I'm the one you should look to
If your enemy shook you
I have the skill if you need it

Choppin' 'em all down, burn in the breeze
Then I'm at so much ease, feel like I'm floatin' on the ocean, please
Don't fuck up my high
Chillin' in the zone, in a trance with my eyes shut

Five, and four, and three, and two, and one
And we smash through the door with our weapons out
Looking for the crop that I heard you pussies talk about
Don't try nothin', if you lead me to the crop, anda despacio
Don't say a word, it'd be over, suicide of the smoked out
(Where the cash stashed in the room?)
Five, and four and three, and two, and one
That's how many seconds left before your ass is done
(Click-clack)
Now you heard the sound, tell me somethin' new
This homie here won't hesitate to put a hole in you
(That’s right, get your ass up)
That’s a good boy
Would you rather put the cameras out, or we playin' coy?
Don't even think about the strap up in your backpack
Cooperate and when I leave you're still alive, in fact
I only want your cash crop, not your life jack
(You can get another crop), but not your life back
So settle down, I don't wanna let the metal spray
Lead the way, give it up and live another day
Trees and sacks, backpack full of cash, out the door
Hit the ride, hear my tires screechin' in the back

Light done struck me, see I'm feelin' lucky like I know she'll fuck me
Life's a fickle bitch and there's no tellin' if she loves me
Sometimes she smiles on me, I could see her light shinin'
But when the light is gone, it's dark, it's cold before the diamonds
Life's about timin' it, and time, it waits for nobody
It's like a fuckin' drug controllin' your mind and your whole body
Burnin' from your soul, yearnin' for more in this, how come he
Livin' the life of royalty? I take what I want, naturally
You're the casualty as we casually take you tragically
Magically make you disappear, randomly cause calamity

Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up

This is the insanity, get this dose of anarchy
Soak in all of the vanity, devoid of all humanity, examine me
Break apart your family, randomly
'Cause what ahead of me? This is a rhapsody, a tragedy
Examine me, take a close look like a man, throwin' the ghost hook
Got you fuckin' shook, and now I close the book

See, I started as a soldier in our culture, in the shadows
My approach with every note is like I'm copin' with the battle
Every move is calculated, celebrated, no more lessons
Hit you quick, I don't get caught, I got no time for no confessions
Never move in one direction, no detection, I ain't slippin'
If you question where I'm headed, then your body comes up missin'
Bullets hissin', bodies twistin', in the ground you will get buried
Mercenary, visionary, don't become my adversary
Took the dare, I'm in a trance, when I advance the seal is broken
Send you dancin' with the Devil, holdin' metal, barrel smokin'
Hand of God, I am the rod, I am the staff that keeps you humble
I'm the hunter that you run from, I'm the lion in the jungle

I got my hand upon the gun, I'm on the run, they'll never catch me

The sinner sings a song, plays all day
Will it bring peace, to the hearts of men?
Spending life on the frontlines of life, to no end
Waste of time, wasting away
Wasting the day, tasting the bitterness of hate
Face of decay, lead 'em off into the dark
They follow me from the start
With the light chasin' the demons, runnin' from the spark
I'm the sword, guns clutch, swingin' at the unjust
Just one touch from the blade that cuts us
Leading the rat race where losers are born

Fear the reaper when you see his face, in this case, you're lost
Wicked dreams of glory, tell me what your soul has cost
I'm the vengeance of the meek, with the hammer of the people
I'm the tip of the spear thrown by God (At the evil)
As I move upon the wicked through the mist with one objective
Send 'em back into the fire, then you gon' be resurrected
Sickened soul taken quickly from the shell (From the ruly)
Angels cryin' up in Heaven for the path that I have chosen

As the wind blows swiftly, fire rises in the night
With my blade takin' flight, souls are reachin' for the light
Your favorite beat, go 'head and get it
Tell 'em I'm the one who sent you
If the one who brings the rain and pose as evil that you men do
Heard the sounds of the trumpets blown, a king rises to the throne
God saved the king unless God wants me to bring him home
Stick the razor's edge in the light, my blade is clean
Until it's pressed against your neck, and now you're eternal dreamin'

And only God could judge me for those things I had to clean away
The tidal wave, it came and washed every single thing away
And as I stray, lookin' for the day the maker makes a plan
I'll be lurkin' in the shadow with your blood upon my hands

All you devils plotting on the god and on his throne
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again

Blood on my hands, hands, handsEmbed
Yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah yeah yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah

I'm building my stairway, stairway to Heaven
But I keep finding my way back down (Down)
One more brick

When I die, I probably won't make it to Heaven
No singing no sad songs or kind words by the Reverend
No one sheddin' tears with happy thoughts to think of
The sufferin' and pain, I bring the one you need to speak of
I'm a bad seed, cultivated from anyone in need
I become cheap, one speed
Hit the target and leavin' your souls free
Call it the night, you never stood a chance
Dance with the Devil, two hands on the metal
Two vans in the shadow, one man in the battle
So I slam, I could kill a man, put my foot on the throttle
Tomorrow is gone, headed for the border
No sorrow for those left in the wake of my disorder
My fuse is shorter than most men
Pre-game, you livin' a dream
I send 'em off with no strings attached
I cut them off like a puppeteer, outta here
Don't ever see me again, I disappear
On the run, I live in isolation
These eyes in the mirror feel like the men we facin'
When it's over for me, the reaper surely waits
Standin' with my victims, waitin' by the Pearly Gates
Lookin' like they locked me out, I'm lookin' through the keyhole
Wishin' I could be inside, the life for never me, no
Runnin' 'til my numbers up but now my soul's in Limbo
I look into the darkness while I'm starin' out the window
And it goes

I'm loaded like a shotgun
Got one under my coat
It’s late night no stage fright
I'm going for broke
While I'm hittin’ my smoke
I'm contemplatin' how to hit em hard
Hit em fast
Get away it's all she wrote
It's a heartbreaking habit
When you gotta have it
You grab it
Stare at an album
So good at it
Certified
Good magic
Look at it
In your face
Money's gone
So am I so long
But now my hustle's changed
No more stickin' you up
I’ve got some weed I know that for sure it can lift you up
Just spark it up
I gotta dime or a twenty sack
All sales are final
Don’t ask for your money back
Don't even look at the money sack
It’s funny that
It still wasn't enough
I like still searchin' for honey flack
No I'm servin’ the boulders
Looking over my shoulders
Every step that I take
A rock might knock me over

Drive by homicide
Shit I gotta roll a dime
Ever day I ran away
My life one helluva time
I like to see heads get busted
A problem
That's how i solve em
No discussion
Go for my mind
Task force rush em
Until that day
All i gotta say is fuck em
Strike the match

Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit em hard hit em fast

Post it on the top son
Claw some
Makin' my way
Through the jungle
Living with the life
Call something
Evolving with each hustle
The street sweep
To a heatseeker
With ambitions to be a ring leader
When you're in the top spot
You better be top notch
If not watch the haters take pot shots
It's non-stop shit talkin'
Beat off the conflict
Ready to harm him
Disarm him
Send his ass away in a coffin
My game is silent you don't see it that often
But every passing day I see the time slipping away
Ticket on a train 'til an early grave
Reap what you sough
Never had a handout
Had my hustle's planned out
Worked to get the brand out
You wish my luck would run out

Start the fire that burns down the system

Some boy wan reach, cloud ninety
We're smokin' like a genie

On the ganja bus, they comin' after us
We makin' stops all over Los Angeles
On the block, where the weed that get scandalous
When we run around, police can't handle us
They wanna clout the bus, and on the top be us
They never wanna come around, just a rowdy bunch
Tengo el poder, tu no aguantas
Yo sé, que el juego es dificil para usted
Despiertate, no dejes tu gente ver

En fuerza que nosotros, enseñale
Deja tu vida sin rastros, escondete

First, I claim my city — puro Los Angeles

Vatos waitin' on me, along with their heinas
Catchin' all the sweat for what I said to one-timer
So when you see me at the party or the baile
Before I got here, I was gaffled in the calle
Who's that gabacho who said I was borracho?
Had an attitude, why you tried to play me macho?!

Eat the worm motherfucker
Tequila spice, hot nice
Feeling right, sipping on Jose Cuervo
Down in Tiajuana, Mexico
Thinking of the big score the night before
Met the connect, who was impressively dressed
In high fabrics
With troops like Beirut, up on the mezzanine
Brandishing sub-machine guns, aye-yo
It's all about the money, son
Now that's the only reason
We came south of the border, to complete this work order
We gotta get it, no looking back, going all out for it
Ready to attack, die in a minute flat for it
As God is my witness, we got ditches
For all you motherfuckin fake bitches
It all boils down to the business
Nothing personal, when niggas acting like they helping you
I fuckin blast you like Frank Castle, motherfucker!

'Til I met the man with mad hook-up, and big plan
Every where you look'a, he got everybody shook up
Running for cover, the big bad wolf (WOOF), motherfucker
He was like a father figure, show me the bigger picture
Fuck slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you
Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bit in the pen
You got that? Getting your cup, I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shit
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question
Just do what I say, and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame
Why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
Always be aware of what's around you
They wanna down you, and fuckin' clown you
Keep your shit in order the money won't stop
Pretty soon you'll be on top

For my enemies who wanna murder me
Eat the worm, mothafucka, while you burn, mothafucka
Better kill me, don't let me return, mothafucka
Trust no man, 'cause I'll be back, you understand?
With a plan, and my ice in hand, I want it all
I recall the words from Jesus, you are the Juice
Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die
Now take a fucking sip, caution it, but I never lie

Territorial glorious story I've heard nothing but hate for me
Coming from ghetto the gueros are holding the metal

Down to the floor and the horror is starting to pour
Everything I just threatened your blood you can't take it no more
Why did you try to forget it I said it to FUCK OFF!!
Now you'll be headed said I'm making you try to do laws

Think of how that'll feel Sen will gladly build up your high
And going through changes the pages keep turning and burning
The rage is concerning the stage is becoming the sermon
Searching for harmony you wanna be balling me
But you never get no where cause I'm killing your whole philosophy
Rising like temperature a signature flow when we just scavengers
And wait your posse watch I'm truly tipping ya
Must be sipping the liquid to try to get with the sickness
Only the hardest will limp in and only the thrill when we get it?
I'm an assassin of soul out of control when I roll
You better hide in your hole I got your name on my skull
There ain't no running from me assassin are cunning you see
Blasting at those who obey clashing and lashing the weak!

No Pierdo Nada (Nothin' To Lose)
Juega con las reglas o si no te rompo
Bien apretado estas en mi luz
Si vienen los puercos te pongo en una cruz
Nada que hacer nomas esconderte
Entraste, tu pacas siendo tu viente
Cuando conviene esto me da sabor
Si estas en mi camino te enseño mi calor (ahh!)
La pongo en la mesa laten las tijeras
Raperos son esclavos de compañia disquera
No puedes perder, nomas escoje
Un grupo de matones que no son ladrones
Has lo que tiene que ser y no te rompas
Cuida la salud y comparte con las compas (compa)
Ten cuidado, con la pista
Si estas en la loma usa tu vista (vista)
Que se cuenta? que soy cuento...

Te doy mi todo, no pierdo nada
Pasa que ayer, el tiempo se acaba...
Te doy mi todo, sabes como soy
Me meto a tu cabeza, te destruyo hoy
Agarro mi pluma la meto en tu cerebro
No voy a parar hasta que quedes muerto
Estoy en mi zona corro y te destuerco
Pongo en un palo a cocinar, dia de puercos
Yo soy el loco, agarro una foto
Entiende la foto me importa poco
Me llamo Sr. Trueno Tremendo
Y no entiendo como sigue mordiendo
Sigo escribiendo, yo me defiendo
Mi rima y estilo son pingareños
Tengo mi puesto, yo lo manifiesto
Te doy mi todo y siempre te afecto...

Do you know the meaning of survival when the rifle is trifle
Not a gun or a rifle not a knife for them to stifle
Put my hand upon the Bible open it and get an eye-full
Tryna keep my head above water and not be spiteful
The humanity, vanity, replaced it's insanity
So many casualties casually forgotten and randomly
Thoughts stricken on beaches and you soft bitches are panicking
Black Milk on drums man this shit is so fucking menacing
What the world needs baby we feed them the truth
Lead them into the booth kicking this shit for the youth
They won't play it on the radio fuck 'em
If we stand together we can always overcome 'em
They won't play it on the radio fuck 'em

I'm having visions of a bunch of bad decisions
That I might regret later but this is the life we living
The streets are unforgiving man they colder than ice
Gotta be holding while i'm rolling at night
This ain't right
All I hear is guns shooting, police chase alluding
Robbing, stealing, lootin' round the projects I just moved in
Feel like what the fuck i'm doing
I'm really 'bout to lose it
And if you come for mine i'll bring your life to a conclusion
I rode the streets and my hood is just like a warzone

Hit a lick to help my mom
We riding without no dad around
Life is about pussy, basketball and having this rapping crowd
Kill em with kindness and they starting killing my happy smile
I didn't tag em down and tie em up and try to wrap no fucking
Cord around his neck, started looking for that check
Seen a little homie die young feel like I was looking at myself
Hold on, and I know pain and I ain't talking 'bout them whoopings by the belt
Trials and tribulations be all grow and we all need help
But yo these things we meant preventing
Political strategies looking like
Open terrorism, hold on Dizzy don't get 'em
Talking in third person as I let my personalities split 'em
Like M. Night Shyamalan i'm talking mental divisions
They been tearing families down since before Abraham Lincoln
Rip facts, these vocal dubs i'm really just thinking
And we finding out that life is real, I don't know how to feel
Making all this money just to get us out my mommas crib
I rode the streets and my hood is just like a warzone
You died if you put your use in defending your home
If you hustlin' everyday, hold on

You know, what we do we do because we have to do

Cypress block, we plotted the takeover
This is the return of the Hill, the wait's over
Since day one, we represented for them corners
This is the return of the Hill, the wait's over
The street life has turned my niggas to some soldiers
Frontline riders that will die for the culture
So if you're with me, let hear you count it down
It goes five, four, three, two

Raised in a place no one thought was safe
Police made sure that no one could get away
From night to day, I've been wild since a juvenile
Got that reckless snatch your necklace type of move around
And you could smell the loud cruisin' down the street
In my trunk I got the pounds movin' 'round to the beat
Guns by the feet for any contenders
Long barrel, short tempers, there's no surrender
See, I was raised with that SoCal vocal
Where you could choked out at your neighborhood smoke-out
Always roll 'round with homies that you hold down
And we all rep L.A. 'cause that's our hometown
But now it's on, see the stages we control now
Go get your tickets, we wreckin' shit up in your town
Shots go off, turn this shit into a ghost town
And catch a contact high as it goes 'round

I'm higher than Space Stations, our minds in different places
Let my dogs out the cages, armed and dangerous
Home of gang affiliations and altercations
You came to L.A. on a family vacation
And they pulled up on you with that 12-gauge ultimatum
Like "Give it up, all that shit, yeah, give it up"
They call me Dr. Greenthumb because I got the Midas touch
Roll it and light it up, they call us the higher-ups
Masters of the stage, hit the crowd and divide 'em up
I grab the left and you go grab the right
They got a need for destruction shit, so let's just feed their appetite
The shots'll send a hater to his afterlife
And this kush'll send your head up to the satellites

Turned it into my mission
Sick of busting boxes
Washing dishes

Not a problem I will fulfill it

Hands up to the ceiling

But we never harm civilians
Strictly the herbal healing
Celebrated by many

This chain is fucking broken
People remain open
They fight the fucking system
Resistance is now in motion
On the gas, we never coasting
Not tripping by emotion
Everything calculated
Bare witness to the explosion

Blessed by the desire to create the fire
I must get you higher
You're required to enjoy it, it inspires
Ninety days in the haze crops that will amaze
Trimmers gettin' paid, so many joints arе gettin' blazed
Got your CBDs growing in the back, no THC
Ph.D., cultivation spree, you must pay a fee
Insanе OG, to the brain low-key
Maybe it's just me but I think you need some weed

Grow from a seed to a whole industry
So many clones to feed for the high we achieve
Blessings received from Mother Mary
Raising crops 'round the clock, now the stock is legendary
Smokin' (La-da-da-da, da-da, da-da)

One of the reasons I've made it through many seasons
Is this weed that I breathe in that keeps my brain dreamin'
Mind reaching for higher levels, I never settle
I was a young pup from out of the ghetto that set the tempo
God bless the leaf, rest in peace
To anyone that stands between the legalization that we want to see
Good green and papers, that's the recipe
Phuncky Feel Tips and a lighter, let it set you free

If anybody tries to question our integrity, I'm flexin'
Let me give you the protection, heat is comin' in your direction
Hit you in your solar plexus, it's the power of suggestion
Look at me now, never stressin'
Liftin' 'em up, give a lesson
Smokin' 'em out in the sessions
Better believe they feel the essence

Untouchable
Before you could touch a made guy, you had to have a good reason
You had to have a sitdown and you'd better get an okay
Or you'd be the one to get whacked

All I smoke is OG, ridin' 'round low-key
Higher than the nosebleeds, reppin' L.A., that's the home team
L.A. original, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
All I smoke is OG, ridin' 'round low-key
Higher than the nosebleeds, reppin' L.A., that's the home team
L.A. original, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

It's Senny Sosa, ridin' in the Roadster
A Brand You Can Trust like La Coka Nostra
Boy, I thought I told ya, watch how you approach us
Cypress hold it down for the coast like we supposed ta
When I spot a vulture, put him on a poster
"Have you seen the body?," said the pig, "I don't know, sir"
I'm reppin' for the best coast, I'm reppin' for the hometown
Where money, weed and bitches make the whole world go around
When gangs pop up, it turn into a ghost town
Where some call it Los Scandalous where it goes down
I do it for my family, I do it for my day one
When we meet up, best believe we gonna blaze one

I know my real ones gonna bounce to this hype shit
We never sleep, keep it tighter than a vise grip
The beat is knockin' on yo' head like a nightstick
Started outta South Gate, nowadays I'm worldwide
Gotta keep a loaded .45 on the 405
I keep my eyes wide, so think before you try
Anything can happen in the city, boy, it's do or die
Where we're from, we had to choose a side
But this music took us levels only few could rise
Shit blew my mind
The streets dangerous, that ain't changin'

You're in the presence of the realest essence
I've been serving lessons since the days of my adolescence
On the Cypress block, young buck holding a Glock
Like we knew it all, not afraid to do it all
Matter of fact, I look back and do it all
I could remember the haters say "The game'll ruin y'all"
What's that to me? Don't give a fuck about a hater
Let 'em roll up like the weed in my paper

They call mе Big Dog riding with the hillbilly
Cuban stallion with the lit Phillie
Rеally became a boss many years back
When I'm gone, hear me, bitches, hold your tears back
We put the bang in bangin', produce the dope we slangin'
You nutless motherfuckers got no chance of hangin'
It's heads or tails when you're flipping the quarter
We ain't slowing down, we're crashing through the border

"Time, one—, one time"
"One—, one time"
"One—, one—, one time"
So let the rhythm hit 'em, just let the rhythm hit 'em
'Cause when you feel it in your soul, it's the sound system
Now turn it up, up, a little louder

False friends and loose ends make me wanna snuff a fool
Fuck that, we got another world tour
Touching every shore, from Cali to Singapore

Every day I'm seeing more motherfuckers in the temple
As we rock uptempo instrumentals
I saw my dream in a dream then I woke up
Put the Dream Team together, now we smoke up

"One—, one—, one—, one—, one—, one time"
"One—, one time"
So let the rhythm hit 'em, just let the rhythm hit 'em

On the streets you feel like nothing
Low and behold

I'll never stop 'till the break of fucking dawn
Just keep pushin' on and on and on
I'll never stop 'till the break of fucking dawn

Stay strong
Hold on
'Cause I won't stop 'till the break of fucking dawn

Big guns, tiny ones
A block of ninety sons
Holdin' a nine and sum
Wildin' out on the corner
On the Terra blocks
Hidin' out
Vibin' out
We never cry about
What we don't have

In all black coming through like the rainers out the tunnel
In the way we gonna rush you, all bite no bustle
Bring the bikes out the huddle
We take off like shuttle
I fall for subtle, yeah my niggas tryna Bumble
Bringing trouble to a city near you
Switching lanes on these lanes
Leave them in the rearview
Because we live this life
Watch me rip this mic
'Bout to kill this show

Late night on the block, I was slangin' the rock
Had the hammer on cock if you tried taking my stock
It only takes one pop if you want it to stop
If some bodies gotta drop, I'd rather not
I'm living numb to emotion, just coastin' like I'm in slow motion
You ain't got a notion of what it is to be in the ocean
Red and blue rags flying like flags and held high
CRASH coming at you from every side and some die
A mother cries, a father is gone, revenge is on the rise
See it through my eyes, another's demise
It's like you're paralyzed, frozen in time, stuck in the mind
Walking a path and blind, doing nothing for mankind

"Some people tell me that I need help"
"Some— some— some— some— some— some—, some people tell me that I need help"
"Some— some— some— some— some—, some people tell me that I need help"

"Some people tell me that I need help"

If I could rewind the hands, I don't think I could change
Anger and depression, they had me enflamed
I was the cause of pain of others and missing my brothers
Couldn't bring 'em back as bad as I felt for their mothers
Little E, Bird and Stoffer are gone
But I could see their faces as I keep pushing along
So many years gone by, I could never deny
The many tears from my eyes when my homies had died
Yeah, I wish they were alive and a part of the vibe
But I could feel their presence here as they witness the ride
I'm laying back daydreaming and reminiscing with plenty visions
Thinking 'bout the many missions, questioning many decisions

I put it on a silver platter, homie, what's the matter?
Give you slapper after slapper, fuck a toe-tapper (Fuck that)
Smoking out the building, yeah, you got the feeling
Came a long way from gangbangin' to rhyme-killing
Time heals wounds, you're needing it soon (Come on)
'Cause knowledge could be found in the Temple of Boom
Let in settle in better than anything that's ever been
Open up the doors and they let you in, you gettin' in
Elevation comes with the sound of the drums

See me in my ranfla, I'm straight bala proof
A conquistador, con crane on the loot
Try to pull a swoop but I got my soldados
Tha soul asesinos vienen preparados

"And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine"
"Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game"
