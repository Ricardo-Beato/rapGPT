9 ContributorsTommy Gunz Lyrics
I'm fresh off the table in Vegas, I'm bettin' big, nigga
Chuck Taylors, smoke in La Brea, brought the crib with us
Soon as we pull up they pay us, that's how it is, nigga
Still wanna kill us, but for now they gotta live with it
Niggas be hating up, it don't bother me none
The homie got some tommy guns, I'm 'bout to buy me one
They got it twisted cause I'm ballin', having lots of fun
But every real nigga gettin' money know that I'm the one
Just check me out, pay attention
If you watch me long enough you see the shit I mention
I really got it, I really live it
I'm really tryin' to play it down cause I really did it
Dope boys in the trap holla back
Smoking weed, cutting crack, counting stacks
Do your thing, just remember it's a fact
All them niggas ain't your bros, all the cell phones tapped
You in the game, and the game is just that
See there's winners and there's losers, when your freedom gets snatched and
What you thought you wanted don't amount to what you had
Seein' that you lost them both feeling like you 'bout to gag and
While you gone, your daughter need a dad
And her momma need a man that could keep buyin' her bags
And it's cold, hurt you so much you gotta laugh
Future fucked, now how you supposed to get over your past
You should just, suck it up and do your time like your man say
Nigga ridin' dick when you had the upper hand
Talking like you ain't shit, and the marathon you ran wasn't nothing
That's how that shit go, but keep hustlin'
Dirty game, see the twist so why shorty change
Think about it every single time I board a plane
It ain't no love, you just ignore the pain
And use the money and the fame as the novocaine
You might also like
Yeah, that's how it go
When you young and gettin' dough
But do your thing, don't give a fuck
We're gettin' money, nigga
We're goin' up

Uh, dirty twenty, fifties, and hundreds
Fast life that I'm livin, marathon that I'm runnin'
Take advantage of everything granted, just keep it coming
On my off day they might accuse me of stuntin'
A-1 credit I don't co-sign nothing
Admit it I'm addicted, can't stop hustlin'
Went from blending in, now my lifestyle's custom
Bail money set aside, I ain't gonna touch it
Motivated nigga, make 'em reconsider something
Lot of niggas hustle, can't keep up with the money
Gotta grind through the winter, to make it to the summer
A risk you gotta take when you on it like I want it
Transition out the game, no longer see opponents
Now I see a business and I'm lookin' like the owner
Handle business from a distance, I don't know 'em, I don't wanna
Snitches on the prowl, matter of fact around the corner
The punishment is heavy and it's getting even stronger
Money coming steady, by the way it's even longer
Take a glimpse at my diploma, graduate as a honor
I'm out here gettin' dollars, and they act like it's a problem
I'm all about a win, losing never was an option
That explains all that champagne bottle popping
You're damn right, my whole gang make a profit
What, we gettin' moneyEmbed
