11 ContributorsPOWER Lyrics
Allow me to kill it
I feel it, I know that they feeling him
Higher than helium
When will it end though?
Need that crescendo
Smoking on that indo
Watching Trigun, made it like I'm Taiwan
Go to war like Saigon
We keeping it real, no projector
Bust like vector, then reload
People we murderin' over the kilos
C-notes like C-low
Food for thought, please do not freeload
Don't know no cheat codes
Bitch niggas we eat those, storm out the ethos
My galaxy mad at me 'cause I created a paradise
Not fuckin' with their advise
No luck like a pair of dice in another dimension
Living life no need to mention extension
My comprehension is inside of me
Poetic robbery is infamy
Out for me, yeah, they always was
We live in a world that's complicated
Finally achieve some form of happiness, they confiscate it
I roll up, then get down, I pour up, then sit down, let me get it now
Got a lot on my mind like a fitted now
Just can't fuck with that lame shit
Man, these people been talking the same shit
I flow like I'm coming to tame shit
Can't fuck with these people, they basic
See through they shit like Lasik
Y'all don't want no problems, can't face it
I remember days with my mama, days with my pops
Remember running from the cops and now we running from the ops
I'm never taking shots, unless we pay to be at Drai's
Rapping is a sixth sense
Shit can get intense on the block 'till its hot like a stove cooking rock, what's up
Get 'em like a freezer, pull it out, watch 'em freeze up
Anime flow, oh, there he go
Never graduated high school but you know he on the roll
Dilla swing with the raps, you know I'm all over the flow
What's the deal? How you feel?
Counting money, getting it still and I will prevail
I know cats that cook crack and, yeah, they still in jail
Logic on a Plato beat, I rise up on it
Ready to give it to who ever want it
Yeah, we blunted this world of Hip Hop, I'm from it
In my own lane, that gas you know I gun it
I just write it then rap it, I get excited then map it out like a bank heist
Liquor and weed is cool but music is my main vice
You know my aim nice, I killed the game twice
Bring it back to the streets, bring it back to the east
Yeah, I'm back for the feast, no cap get a piece, but I just want peace
I hope I reach the person listening envisioning their dreamsYou might also like4Embed
