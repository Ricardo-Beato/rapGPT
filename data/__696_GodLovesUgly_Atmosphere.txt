"Hey, hey what are you doing over there?"
"I... I'm just standing, I..."
"Come here, come here. What are you doing?"
"I'm just waiting for... You know he's... He might come out."
"Left you standing in the rain all wet."
"Wait, I just wanna say..."
"No, no, who are you waiting for?"
"A guy I met at the show."
"Who, Slug? You're waiting for fucking Slug?"
"No! I mean no, uhh, yeah."
"Oh no, you're... You're fucking kidding me."
"He's so hot."
(unintelligable)
"Fucking Slug? Oh my God, he is so fucking ugly."

I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp
I live life like the captain of a sinking ship
The one thing that I can guarantee
I'm like a stepping razor, I suggest you stay fair with me
Been paying dues for a decade plus
Before that I was just another face on the bus
Tappin' my foot, to the beat on the radio
Dreaming 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies
Oh mom, I promise I'm gonna be large
Some day I'ma stop trying to borrow your car
Gonna go far, with charisma and skill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
Atmosphere, it's just a ten letter word
Discretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird
And if you didn't hear, then fuck what others heard
I think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured
Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix
I'mma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek
It's not that I don't like you, I just don't want to speak
You fucking freak, now keep your days out my week
The world keeps a balance, through mathematics
Defined by whatever you've added and subtracted
I'm pushin' on the hammer to trigger the brain
Embrace how I live, 'cause God loves ugly
You might also like
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

Once upon a time in Minneapolis, yo
I damn near had to steal the show
I stepped on the stage - "Who is it?"
My name's Slug, I've come to kill a couple minutes
And what's up with the way that everybody gathers around
Each other, so they can steal each others' sound
If it's all about getting down, with the get down
How long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?
Appears more clear in its simplest form
Nobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm
Abandonin' the norm, and handlin' the harvest
Measurin' the worth by the depth of the hardship
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin' short on rations
I began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'
Make it happen, and take this captain to the gallows
I keep steering us into an area that's shallow
Talking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry
Said, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light, a little love and some liquid
I'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow
I'll float atop the flood holdin' on to my ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

Why scream, when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen
Let life be a bowl of melted ice cream
Or be the deer that's caught in my high beams
I'm rolling with the brights on
Scared stiff, reality is just too much to bear with
Paranoid, walking around, careless
No wonder you're in love with your therapist
Go to sleep my little time bomb

God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly33Embed
