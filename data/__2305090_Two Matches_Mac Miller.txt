93 ContributorsTwo Matches Lyrics
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

In my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long-term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swang like Pootie Tang (Uh)
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade (I have a dream)
But can't we all just get along? (That one day)
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say, "Soulo, you so crazy and deranged", I say, "I know"
Roll that weed, nigga! (Shake that ass, ho!)
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash, Sounwave on the beat
(Wizzo!) And our key is anarchy
Your confidence is caca to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia
You might also like
When I was just a kid (Okay)
Dreamt (Soul,) that one day we'd all get rich (Okay)
No more problems and no more tricks (Okay)
I set my sights high 'cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit (Woo)
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

Yeah, I've seen some shit (I've seen it all)
How'd I end up in a place like this? (In this)
Swear to God, seen some shit (I've seen it all)
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is
In this lifetime, be the time of your life
It's been a while but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike (Alright, alright)
And as a child, I was curious, my mind was the dirtiest (Uh-huh)
Curse words was probably my first words (Affirmative) (God damn)
My home run derby shit (Derby shit), was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest minds will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to right my wrongs, the days short, the nights is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion, divide and conquer
Walk on water, won't be long 'til I'm flyin', that's my departure (Jesus)
I'm a goner
Shoot you down from the sky with eyes of a archer (Ah, yeah)
Better find that thing you die for (Ah, yeah)
(I don't know what I get so high for) (Ah, yeah)
I'm a problem and as hard as I try, no hidin' from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time...
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause In my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?

Take your time
Don't close your eyes
Life happens in a flash
And you don't wanna miss that

Blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Go have some)

Yeah, I've seen some shit (I've seen it all)
How'd I end up in a place like this? (In this)
Swear to God, seen some shit (I've seen it all)
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is
We all grow up to be gangstas (Gangstas), playas (Playas), snitches
Freaks and strangers, politicians (Strangers, politicians)
Good and evil people (Good and evil)
Sinners, saints and everything in between
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, knowï»¿ me
Lately I've been thinkin' (Lately)
I've, I've been thinkin'
What's the difference? What's the difference?
Nothing at all! (Never mind us)
Ayy, let me just add one more thing, Josh
*Match being lit*
Ayy, ayy, watch that shit, man, you almost burnt me, nigga!10Embed
