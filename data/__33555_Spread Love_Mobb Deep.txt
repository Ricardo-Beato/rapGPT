First of all, we the one and only Infamous
Everybody wanna use the name soundin' all lame
We come up in the party with them shanks and things
Have you curled up on the floor feelin' the pain
And nine times out ten we ain't even start the shit
We finish it then they wanna press charges
Plus everybody and their mother wanna act tough
'til they discover how fast a nigga leave them under white covers
Was a thumper 'til he met the 40 thunder
Now I feel strange when I walk by his mother, it's fucked up
That's how the ball bounce, The cookie crumbles
That's what the guns do, dead you on the humble
But God forgive me niggas tryna hit me, what I'm supposed to do
You talk about my life and a nigga got a lot to lose
So I tuck the heaters then proceed to move
We a mob for real, you an example

You should spread love not war
Cause my shit is popping and I'd be goddamned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war
Cause you won't feel safe comin' out your crib, knowin' that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids how they need you alive for your guidance
You need to spread love not war
Cause death hurts whole families, imagine it's your moms that grieves
You might also like
Two in the neck, yes you will, if you not feelin me yet
Outta respect can't stand it man, you niggas is set
Sweatin' hard ain't do shit but run your list
When a nigga get confronted all he do is take the fifth
Not the law, I'm talkin' about the four, niggas is raw
You ain't know, now you know leakin' down on the floor
Never renege with my words, believe what you heard
Never flash a gat and go bust it, that shit is absurd
Cause I be right back to my brother say word
You got to drive, no doubt, I cock it bein tougher for herbs
Cause the plot is power and I do it for hours
Won't save me for a minute 'til I move on you cowards
Direct, drama to us, Infamous be the ones and we rowdy
Million dollar ballad, make an album, get classes

You should spread love not war
Cause my shit is popping and I'd be goddamned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war
Cause you won't feel safe comin' out your res, knowin' that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids how they need you alive for they guidance
You need to spread love not war
Cause death hurts whole families, imagine it's your moms that grieves
Look around you surrounded by the M-O-B-B D-E-E-P
Infamous niggas rep Queensbridge housing P's
My dunns come through with the big long chains
Plus we got guns, to blow your brains
Niggas learn when they feel the pain, know I'm saying?
Straight like that, standin ovation with max
We clap niggas for less, splash niggas for laughs
Shift the game, raise your odds
I need 93 thousand for 16 bars
Put out the movie, the hoods rush the stores
700 thousand from out the doors
We the most thoro, need I say more?
The hoes love the Mobb cause we so raw
Handcuff you whore when P come through the scene
Glowin like a black light on white clothing

You should spread love not war
Cause my shit is popping and I'd be goddamned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war
Cause you won't feel safe comin' out your res, knowin' that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids how they need you alive for they guidance
You need to spread love not war
Cause death hurts whole families, imagine it's your moms that grieves
You should spread love not war
Cause my shit is popping and I'd be goddamned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war
Cause you won't feel safe comin' out your res, knowin' that we got beef
We need to spread love not war
Just think about your kids how they need you alive for they guidance
You should spread love not war
Cause death hurts whole families, imagine it's your moms that grieves
You should spread love not war
Cause my shit is popping and I'd be goddamned if you shot me
You should spread love not war
Cause I don't give a fuck
You should spread love not war1Embed
