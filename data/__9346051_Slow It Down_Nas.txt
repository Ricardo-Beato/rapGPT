Yep, I need money every day
Like a junkie need heroin, you know what I'm sayin'?
And I'm a junkie, and that's my fix, money
You know what I'm sayin'?
I need it every day

Nas like the Nazca Lines, can only be seen from up high
Only the true understand me but I see 'em as family
I saw the shit when I was fourteen, I counted on it
I was born a don with a powerful poignant style they wanted
Never dissing for clout, y'all know what this about
Niggas tryna deflect from the fact people sort of fizzle out
The people saw them try to make hit songs that went wrong
This about the money, right? 'Cause all that shit done been gone
Let's throw a nickel at the wishing well rappers
Watch it sink to the bottom, and I wish 'em all happiness
I'm in the cut, attention needers need to front, see 'em front
The world watching 'em shine, that's all they want
And I always get my cut, imagine that making you mad
I'm just a real version, they don't make 'em like that
Never had to get the youth to relate for the bag
And since they smarter than us, they know Nas was once they age
Made they pay grade, the youngster phase
Same mistakes though times have changed
Trying not to touch the cage but touch interior
In the front is the trunk, that's the custom carrier
Let's play a game, I hand you a king of diamonds
The hand is faster than the eye, check in your pocket
I snap my fingers, I'm up in smoke like The Chronic
Disappear and reappear right in front of your optics
You might also like
Let's slow it down
Was I moving too fast for you?
Let's slow it down then
If you gotta slow it down, I won't laugh at you
Let's slow it down, slow it down
Might be moving too fast for you
Was I moving too fast for them?
Slow it down, let's, let's slow it down

Upon closer inspection
They really are non-threatening, I bomb first then I stretch 'em
Instigators causing these problems, that's why I question
Everything and everybody that's aiming in this direction
That's why I sound like I been spending time at the SPA
Thinkin' 'bout the days I first heard I Became a Star
Words from my A&R, I'm noticing that they notice me
Gun and a mean mug and was slow to speak
Now I hold meetings over cold sake and kobe beef
Hockey jersey, a hoodie underneath
Set up the trust, support the trustee
Corporations is the modern day custies
My flow is the hard substance, mastered it, Bernie Grundman
The stove top and oven, my company going public
I see the puppets, they moving like they the judges
But Nas and all his subjects is hard for you to catch up with
Let's slow it down
Was I moving too fast for you?
Let's slow it down then
If you gotta slow it down, I won't laugh at you
Let's slow it down, slow it down
Might be moving too fast for you
Was I moving too fast for them?
Slow it down, let's, let's slow it down

I might be moving at lightspeed
I landed icy in Iceland to sightsee
This long mink gon' be pricey
I might perm up my shit like I'm Ice-T
American pimp, I'm on timing
Only thing that I pimp is this rhyming
I made that work for me back since the '90s
That's a daily affirmations to remind me
I might be moving at lightspeed
To do what I'm doing's unlikely
This new urgency's perfectly hurting 'em
Send these suckers to emergency nightly
(S-slow it down)2Embed
