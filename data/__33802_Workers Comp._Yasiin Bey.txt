20 ContributorsWorkers Comp. Lyrics
Ground rules

I'll give you all the diamonds and money
But you can't break my heart
'Cause that'll just get you fired
And everybody needs a job

Work is scarce, competition is fierce
Fonzi frontin' in the new leather like they don't care
Word, let's get you an award for that performance
Winner in the category for the best boring
Uh, tell the tough guys we tougher than tough times
And needles in the nerves to make the tighten up unwind
One time, for locking out the light in your eyes
You're searching for your perfect one
Broken down from getting it all to take it however it comes
Plain day, you the specialest one, oh me, oh my

I'll give you all the milk and the honey
But you can't break my heart
'Cause that'll just get you fired
Sloppy worker get your pay grade bust
You might also like
Work is scarce, skilled working is rare
Fonzi fronting at the job site, primping up they hair
Word? Well tell them only staff could drink they coffee
Walking papers at the office, sleep late tomorrow morning
Tell the tough guys we tougher than tough times
And nerves don't snap when the clock touch crunch time
That's right we tougher than tough times
From been narrowing, to the clock just unwind
For sure we tougher than tough times
My proof don't need to lie, my tighten up don't unwind
Sunshine, lifting up the light in your eyes
You're gazing at your perfect one
Broken down from never at all to better than you could ever want
Great day I know that you had to come, oh me oh my

I'll give you all the diamonds and money
But you can't break my heart
'Cause that'll just get you fired
And you're doing such a beautiful job1Embed
