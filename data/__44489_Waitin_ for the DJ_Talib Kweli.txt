21 ContributorsWaitin’ for the DJ Lyrics
Waitin' for the DJ to (It's your boy Kweli, BK MC), let your body rock (My man Bilal in the house)
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got (Party people, woo)

Music is the air I breathe, the prayer I lead
Rippin' in the atmosphere, up there in the breeze
It's stronger than the revolution that you wear on your sleeve
It's all I know, not an idea you believe
I spit bars you can't touch like tits in strip bars
Get charged, man, I drop hits that hit hard
Hit bars with my brown sugar sister
The night just start, I'm waitin' for the DJ to— (Let your body rock)
We all hop in the car deep, we bring Brooklyn to the city
My fellas lookin' sharp, my ladies is lookin' pretty
When the DJ let the needle drop, the beat'll rock beat'll start
Boppin' and my people got it poppin' like needle marks
Three o'clock and it's mass hysteria, 'bout to hit the Cafeteria

Waitin' for the DJ to (Break it down for y'all, and), let your body rock (Come on)
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to (Put it down for y'all, and), let your body rock (Come on)
So I can show you just what I got
You might also like
I read the lines and all in-between, in my mind, I'm rewindin' the scene
The club ain't the place to be findin' a queen
You all in my dream, girl, although I can't sleep on you (No)
You was a star tonight, your light's showin' through
Vampires takin' a bite
I'm in the zone, two hours, end up takin' the flight
Makin' it right for the fam
It's so tight in the jam, a fight began
You always hear about niggas tried to act like a man
The DJ had the mic in his hand, like, "Calm down" (Let your body rock)
Yeah, it was like I was the audience at your concert
You at the converse with a Louis Vuitton purse
Tiger's eye around the wrist with the fly and the prints
Snakin' up your arm, and blendin' where the tattoo begin
I had to catch a plane, but you make me wanna stay
I had to catch your name and I'm—

Waitin' for the DJ to let your body rock (Come on)
So I can show you just what I got (Let me do my thing, let me do my thing, yeah)
Waitin' for the DJ to (Put it down for y'all, and), let your body rock (Come on)
So I can show you just what I got

'Cause they ain't intentional, it's still the same old song
So just pound your hands together 'til they make that sound
Stop that bouncin' heavy 'til my ends is found
Yeah, hot fun in the summertime, Sly said it
Guys see the flesh, they catch a thigh fetish
Honeys smellin' too sweet, it's like I'm diabetic
More stars and the sky, in the seminar, dianetic
Drop the top, beat up the block
On Flatbush Ave where they smokin' tree up
And shots greet the new tunes
Dogs are loose, hollerin' at the new moon for hours
I'm like the sun, your flower in full bloom
When I come out the house, we complete like the number nine
Give me some of yours, I'ma give you some of mine
Knew off the sucka rhyme, the song, it sound like one of mine
I know you love it when I shine, waitin' for—

Waitin' for the DJ to (Break it down for y'all, and), let your body rock (Come on)
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to (Put it down for y'all, and), let your body rock (Come on)
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to (Uh), let your body rock (Yeah, yeah)
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to (Woo, woo), let your body rock, uh
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to (I wanna rock with you, come on), let your body rock (I wanna rock with you, come on, yeah)
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to let your body rock
So I can show you just what I gotEmbed
