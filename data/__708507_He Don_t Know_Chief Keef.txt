18 ContributorsHe Donâ€™t Know Lyrics
Fuck nigga wanna mug
He don't know I got the .40 in the club
He don't know I got my shorties in the cut
Crunchin shit goin' very nuts
Pull up, hop out, shootin' shit, bring cops out
He don't know we got Glocks on us, he think we gon' knock him out
He said that he want war but he don't know
Can't tell that little boy what he don't know

It's me and Dirty Thirty, bullets fly, like little birdy birdy
The only pimps I know is Mac and Dirty Thirty
With a Tec, told a 50 you can't have Larry Birdy
Yeah they say money, power, respect
But bitch its money, power, the Tec
Point at your block and won't even have any regret
You fuck niggas be knowing how we get
So don't get screwed, I got some niggas with a bunch of tools
They come through screwin' shit like 
Like don't be talkin' what my choppa do
Turn your block to Lil B bitch, Wonton Soup, pull off in my Lady Gaga coupe
I got Hannah, Lady Gaga too, lotta bullets fly, that's what I do

Fuck nigga wanna mug
He don't know I got the .40 in the club
He don't know I got my shorties in the cut
Crunchin shit goin' very nuts
Pull up, hop out, shootin' shit, bring cops out
He don't know we got Glocks on us, he think we gon' knock him out
He said that he want war but he don't know
Can't tell that little boy what he don't know
You might also like
He don't know, got so many cars, when I pull up he won't know
He was talkin' to this bitch, she was suckin' me, he don't know
And this bitch want blue dream back, I'm like "you don't know"
What I smoke? Better smoke OG, I like Ben Franklins baby, I don't fuck with no Gs
Can't wife no bitch 'cause these hoes be fuckin' lowkey
'Cause you thought your bitch was your bitch but she was suckin' on me
That thot act like she ain't know that Almighty So got cinnamon rolls
That nigga act like sneak dissin' me gon' get him on
It's me and Ben Frank, I don't like people, me and him get along
Blow your block, givin' out shots for the face just silicone
Cops won't know, unless one of you lil fuck niggas snitchin' on me
Shootin' up houses: living rooms, bedrooms, and them kitchens on 'em
Shootin' up cars: front seats, passenger seats, and them engines on 'em

Fuck nigga wanna mug
He don't know I got the .40 in the club
He don't know I got my shorties in the cut
Crunchin shit goin' very nuts
Pull up, hop out, shootin' shit, bring cops out
He don't know we got Glocks on us, he think we gon' knock him out
He said that he want war but he don't know
Can't tell that little boy what he don't knowEmbed
