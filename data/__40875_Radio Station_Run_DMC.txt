7 ContributorsRadio Station Lyrics
Radio station, on vacation
Wonder where Run was, damn be patient
Comin to the rescue, people won't let you
Forget about my DJ, and my crew
Pickin up the pieces, nephews and nieces
Chocolate in a peanut butter cup, called Reese's
Took a little break, for goodness sake
Gotta chill, get ill, cold fishin by the lake
Take a brain off rappin, 'member what happened
Listen reminisce and cold keep your foot tappin
Darryl and Joe cause the DJ's Jason
Hear no fear, dear radio station

Radio station, around the nation
Run, D, and Jason, made a dedication
To those listenin, we're not dissin em
Recording and rewarding so we won't be missin em
Keep on playin song, LP playin long
Jay, D, and Joe, keep the radio stayin on
I always say to Joe, turn on the radio
Jam Master Jay will know, that is the way to go
While Jay's DJin, I will be sayin
Rhymes that are playin, FM or AM
On hot rotation, a winning combination
AM, FM, music modulation
Rappin on the mic is my occupation
That's what I like, dear radio station
You might also like
AM, FM, thought that I left them
Back and exact never wack no more jetset
Run made a return, D makin me earn
Jay gotta play on the radio we burn
Hotter than a fire, kings going higher
Told you on the album, that require
To be tougher than, nobody rougher when
Run-D.M.C., throwin down like a bufferin'
Relieving all pain, receiving much gain
Remaining entertaining while we entertain
For the black white Chinese Spanish Indian Haitian
Hear no fear, dear radio station

D, Joe, Jason, radio station
Saw that, format, you be placin
Records, other than, Run, go cover and
Put em on your list, people hear and discover them
Take or break the tunes that make it
D gotta be on top and shake it
Keep on rockin it, ain't no stoppin
My alliance droppin science on the radio poppin it
One top ten again, Run's gonna win again
Jay's gonna spin again, on the FM again
I coulda and shoulda and woulda, wrote a letter
But a speech that'll reach the streets is much better!Embed
