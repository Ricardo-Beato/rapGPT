7 ContributorsGood Look Lyrics
Its a good look, Its a good look
Your Gucci match my Prada thats a good look
Shotgun in a Ferrari thats a good look
Its a good look, Its a good look
Its a good look, Its a good look
Your Gucci match my Prada thats a good look
Shotgun in a Ferrari thats a good look
Grinding on my body thats a good look

You can hear me my lingo
The way she pronounce her words compliments my lingo
My wardrobe it do something to her style
My ice glow, her bag game on fire
I’m a hustler she love hustlers and thats just what it is
Get accustomed to the fast life you fucking with the kd
We do parties on occasion you stepping out its big
Got a pop bout ya thats what i like bout ya ya dig
You don’t trip on me thats real shit I can deal with it

Its a good look, Its a good look
Your Gucci match my Prada thats a good look
Shotgun in a Ferrari thats a good look
Its a good look, Its a good look
Its a good look, Its a good look
Your Gucci match my Prada thats a good look
Shotgun in a Ferrari thats a good look
Grinding on my body thats a good look

Designer clothes on me, hoes on me know them hoes want me
Lil froze on me lil ice dripping’ off I’m cold on her look cold don’t I
Here to turn you up wanna turn you out
Hold me down turn me life around
Boot her up threw her down
She put me up won’t put me down
Worship grounds I walk on, Foreign I talk on
Thats some real shit panoramic panoramic help yo seat click
And I’m standing here looking like a chandelier
So much space so much space gear
You can wear a different fit everyday this year
Everyday this year fuck around and cop you gifts
From the Rari to the Lear take you outta here

Its a good look, Its a good look
Your Gucci match my Prada thats a good look
Shotgun in a Ferrari thats a good look
Its a good look, Its a good look
Its a good look, Its a good look
Your Gucci match my Prada thats a good look
Shotgun in a Ferrari thats a good look1Embed
