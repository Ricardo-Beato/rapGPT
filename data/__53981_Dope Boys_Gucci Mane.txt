24 ContributorsDope Boys Lyrics
All Nas need is one mic, all I need is one stove
Homie got a nice flow but Gucci got that white coke
You ain't getting the right dope, you knocking on the wrong door
Last nigga tried me, let's just call him John Doe
And since you short a dime, homie, then park me a old school
I fronted you, you ran off, that's not what you're supposed to do
I'm gettin' my tip fade cut, Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Wish a nigga would run up on me like I'm Brisco
Yeah, Gucci Mane's a live wire
Try me like I'm Yung Berg and I'mma make yo eyes cry
Gucci like to drank, and Gucci like to smoke
And Gucci on the rise while you niggas going broke, Gucci!
(Gucci Mane's a G) Tell me something I don't know
I got court in early morning, I don't really wanna go
I do it for the people 'cause I'm my brother's keeper
I don't feel you 'cause I'm paraplegic, where's my paralegal?

See that house right there? Yeah, make a lot a money
(Who's that knocking at the door?) Probably a couple junkies
That coupé over there, yeah, cost a couple hundreds
See, my neighborhood is bunking, tell my plug to keep it coming
Dope boys, dope boys, with the dope boys
Dope boys, dope boys, with the dope boys
What you wanna get, homie? Hurry up and buy it
Dope boys gon' buy, you gon' get yourself supply

I'm in my M6 Beamer, this is no 645
Like a pigeon in the sky, I just shitted on your ride
So much weight off in my house, you would think it was a gym
Plus my Nikes match my necklace and my necklace match my rims
I got court in early morning, I don't really wanna go
Say I violated probation just because I blew my nose
Blew 300 on my Rolls, 200 more on the Lamb
Million dollars on the crib, car note, don't know what that is
Gucci, you don't know who that i, mama that's just Gucci Mane
That's my boy that's my partner, I'm Gucci Mane biggest fan
Plus she don't know what that is, I'm with it, I don't give a damn
If you think I give a fuck you must do not know who I am, Gucci

See that house right there? Yeah, make a lot a money
(Who's that knocking at the door?) Probably a couple junkies
That coupé over there, yeah, cost a couple hundreds
See, my neighborhood is bunking, tell my plug to keep it coming
Dope boys, dope boys, with the dope boys
Dope boys, dope boys, with the dope boys
What you wanna get, homie? Hurry up and buy it
Dope boys gon' buy, you gon' get yourself supply

Mirror, mirror, mirror, who the realest in the game?
(Why you ask that stupid question, boy? You know that's Gucci Mane)
East Atlanta 6, huh, you know how we roll
I just bought another Chevy, got it right back out the bowl
Tall stacks up in my closet, I can't even see my clothes
And my belly get so big I can hardly see my toes
Got a car in my garage I have never ever drove
It's a four-door black on black Phantom, I call that bitch Dorrough
If she going to the ladies room, I guess I'll let her know
That I got powder in my living room so she don't have to stroll
About a year ago to today, I was sitting in my cell
(Where you see yourself in 5 years?) A so icey billionare
Gucci!
See that house right there? Yeah, make a lot a money
(Who's that knocking at the door?) Probably a couple junkies
That coupé over there, yeah, cost a couple hundreds
See, my neighborhood is bunking, tell my plug to keep it coming
Dope boys, dope boys, with the dope boys
Dope boys, dope boys, with the dope boys
What you wanna get, homie? Hurry up and buy it
Dope boys gon' buy, you gon' get yourself supply1Embed
