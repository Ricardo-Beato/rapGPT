Zaga, Zaganaga, You hear she moans? Boom!
Aye, yo, Monica
Won't you help me and Timb change dis shit up again, yeah, hit'em

Yeah, ooh, you turn me on, so boy don't lie
I will never share you with no other bitches, so don't try
You all I want, like when Prince made doves cry
And all I'm sayin to you is don't be cruel

Yo baby pop, yeah you, come and give me a kiss
Betta make it fast, or else I'm gonna get pissed
Don't you hear the music pumpin' hard, like I wish you would
Now push it (awww), push it, push it real good

No, don't get me wrong, that's just me
I just want you to be all you can be like in the army
Don't try to play me, boy 'cuz I'm nobody's fool
And all I'm sayin' to you is don't be cruel

Yo baby pop, yeah you, come and give me a kiss
Betta make it fast, or else I'm gonna get pissed
Don't you hear the music pumpin' hard, like I wish you would
Now push it (awww), push it, push it real good
