10 ContributorsIn Dis Bitch Lyrics
Yeah
Got me crunk as shit, haha (Yeah)
I'm goin' slump the long way for real, man (Yeah)
That's my partner, please believe (Yeah)

Okay, you snake ass niggas got me ridin' with my garden tool
I'm a martian, dude, you a monkey, dude
Even if you were a couple million they wouldn't sponsor you
If you were Thug number two they'd probably honor you (Honor you)
Young Thug in this bitch
So girl, get over here, show us some love in this bitch
And I'm so about to go ahead and rub on this bitch
And we might just end up makin' love in this bitch (Love in this bitch)

Money comin' home to me
'Cause baby girl, this is where it 'posed to be
You callin' me a dog because I pedigree
But you about everything and you made my food
So what that makes you?
You runnin' 'round fuckin' like you a dude
You try and tell me that I'm boyfriend number two
But I don't wanna be your boyfriend number two
I want the one spot and for that I'll murk dudes
But now I irk you, where the fuck that come from?
Plus when you with your friends you be callin' me bums
I had to tell your ma, you know I'm like her son
You callin' me broke like I ain't write my name on a hundun
I love when we fight then fuck each other
Try to bluff each other, we try to cuff each other
But there were still others that we call lovers
And fuck boy was named Danny like Glover
You probably gave him head, that's why I never ever kissed you
You gone ten minutes, I already missed you
That nigga dissed you, I never dissed you
I would've kissed you, that nigga bit you
With teeth pistol or a tooth chopper
And I was your doctor, call me Doctor Thug
I kept clean shoes on your feet like I used scrubs
I had niggas lookin' at me, they act like it was soap or Dove
I had them ears hot like they was made inside of mugs
That pussy stay wet like a ocean tub (Uh, man)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't forget them days, baby
And when I got hit you came over to face me
Fifty guns, you were the Navy
If I were actin' all lazy
I can't forget them times, baby
But now it's time, baby
I got me a new ho and she's fine like wine
I call her Prison Clock because she has no time
To even play 'bout anything
She like, "Baby, let's go get the ring"
Matchin' tats that say Prince and Queen
And if them niggas play you better spray they head like oil sheen
So therefore I gotta spray your head like oil sheen
You might also like
Hold for a minute
I got a text message
My ho just texted me
I mean your ho just texted me
Yeah, cool
She like, "Okay cool"
She like, "Okay cool"
Yeah, yeah

Uh, Kum in this clique (Yeah)
My bitch down and I'm a nerd (I'm a nerd)
I had to call the abortion team (Why?)
She was really gettin' on my nerves (On my nerves, ho)
These boys thought I wasn't gonna do this shit (What you tell 'em?)
Shout out my nigga P-O-G and shit (Yeah)
Thug in this bitch (Yeah, yeah)
I'm doin' my thing in this bitch (Do my thing)
For all these hoes I'm somethin' like a porn star
I'm doin' this shit (Yeah)
Yeah, and that was Kum by the way, ho (Yeah)

Kum and Thug in this bitch
So get over here, show us some love in this bitch
I'm so about to go ahead and rub on this bitch
And we might just end up makin' love in this bitch
Kum and Thug in this bitch
So get over here, show us some love in this bitch

And we might just end up makin' love in this bitch
