11 ContributorsGooey Lyrics
I got Louis, I got Gucci (Gucci)
I got bitches give me coochie (Coochie)
I wear Louis and Gucci, bitch (Gucci)
Call that shit that Gooey (It's goo)
I wear Hermes, wear Burberry (Hermes and Burberry)
And my Trueys hold my toolie (My toolie)
My Louis hold my cash (Cash)
And my Gucci hold my jewelry (Jewelry, ayy)

When I'm traveling, my Gucci hold my clothes, ayy (Gucci hold my clothes)
When I'm traveling, my Louis hold my clothes
And my pants hold my rolls, ayy (Ayy)
I gotta take off my damn shoes 'cause I ain't got no jet yet, bitch (Ayy)
Still making niggas upset, bitch (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Come through, we shooting at your neck and shit, bitch (Bang, bang, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Like I thought you was with the shit, bitch, ayy
They steady asking why I don't go to the awards, ayy
'Cause I can't go to the awards with my damn pole or my bros
'Cause they gon' act a fool, ayy (Act a fool)
Taking chains, niggas act up then boom-boom, bang-bang (Bang, nigga, ayy)
Money be the color of my veins, nigga
Gold the color of my chains, nigga
Yellow diamonds, white diamonds, ayy
Bling bling nigga, bling bling niggaYou might also like2Embed
