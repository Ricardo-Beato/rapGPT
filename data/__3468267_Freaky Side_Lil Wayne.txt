27 ContributorsFreaky Side Lyrics
Dedicated!
Free my nigga Meek Mill!
D6!

I walk inside the strip club, buy what I want then I go hey
All this snow up in my house, these bitches call me Coldplay
Walk inside the strip club, give the baddest one a big hug
She know daddy been a real one, aimin' at a nigga ear drums
I don't have to beat to my own
Don't have to keep my eyes on your rhinestones
Take yo' watch and kill you if the time wrong, so pop off
We gon' kill a watch dog 'til the top dog knock a opp off
Set his ass on fire, I smell popcorn

I walk inside the strip club, buy what I want then I go hey
All this white up in my house, these bitches call me Colgate
Walk inside the strip club, buy what I want then I go hey
All this snow up in my house, these bitches call me cold case
Wait I fuck yo' ho
Hol' on hol' up wait no they don't go they fucked the GOAT
(Brr) hello hello hello hello I fucked yo' bae
Just like Jodeci she tryna stay I said okay
Okay okay okay okay
I been a real nigga since a mini lil' nigga
Pullin' choppers like a dentist lil' nigga
In my skinnies lil' nigga, lookin' skinny lil' nigga
Fuck a limit lil' nigga like the Millers lil' nigga
Doin' business lil' nigga, risky business lil' nigga
Own plane wit my own flight attendants lil' nigga
Life is splendid lil' nigga, fuck yo' hoe, now yo' hoe on blow
I swear I make her snort more blow than Pinocchio, okay!
You might also like
I walk inside the strip club buy what I want then I go hey
It's all these hoes and only me you bitches gotta rotate
Walk inside the plug house buy what I want then I dip, hey
All this coco in my bando bitches call me milkshake
Wait I fuck yo' hoe, now yo' hoe won't go
Hol' up wait I fuck yo' hoe, now you yo-ho bro
Hol' up wait I fuck yo' hoe, now that hoe on dope
I know you know I know you know
I know I know I know I know you know my niggas shooters
Don't fuck wit' computers, ugliness is cuter
And all this shit from Cuba, throwin' parties in the sewer
Actavis and Buddah, the dancers doin' maneuvers
Come shake hands wit' Freddy Kreuger

Woah I walk up in the strip club buy what I want then I go hey
I give all my hoes the green light them hoes call me no brakes
Walk up in a night club pick who I want then I go hey
All these dick riders in here I don't have time for road rage
Walk up in the strip club buy who I want then I go hey
Bitches know I keep that 'cane on me they call me old head
Walk up in the strip club buy who I want then I go hey
I live in Miami but the bitches call me Snowflake
Hol' up wait a second, you know what I make a second, nigga
All my pockets pregnant, nigga, all yo' pockets naked
Got the sauce I got the method
And of course I gotta spread it on that presidential kush
I'm in here coughin' at election
Hol' up presidential rollie, Clinton, Obama, Reagan
It's all about a check, just in case you checkin'
Got a suitcase full of weapons just in case you trippin'
Niggas out here building cases well I like to plead guilty
Like yo' wifey knees filthy and she likes my seeds milky
I'm a king but can't deal me underpaid but overwhelming, wait
Lit, and my homies they some livewires, quick to do a drive by
Wherever you got Wi-Fi, lit, like a powerline
Get right in a line of fire
Cocaine on the table make her get down to the bottom line
Men lie, women lie, people living lies
Some people cross the line knowing it's the finish line
Some even walk the line knowing it's the thinnest line
Puttin' they life on the line then they just forget they lines
Some people get in line, some try to skip the line
Me I'm in the lunch line, starving like it's dinner time
Before the begin of time, I been in a different time
She pay yo ass little mind, you pay that hoe rent on time
Damn, slime it's Carter 5 time, give me high five, my fire high
I'm waving bye bye, to the fireflies
I got guys on your guys guys, and your guys guys
R.I.P. to Soulja Slim, soldiers die tryin', damn
Purple heart, purple drank, better yet ultraviolet
Couple bitches one Tunechi I let 'em argue 'bout it, damn
I ran out coke last week and now it's time to re-up
All these keys in this Prius now this bitch a Kia
Pray for Cita, the kids and the work
Pray that none of my niggas get murked
Pray that enemy bitch ain't a nurse
Pray that one day I get reimbursed
Pray that one day I get reimbursed
Pray that one day I get what I'm worth
Niggas wanna taste victory first, gotta work to have it for dessert
Bust a nigga head in the mall, shoot a nigga head 'til it's off
Throw a nigga head to the dogs, can't we all just get along?
A hearts for wings to fly, I bought them dreams alive
I pulled my team aside to get they finger size
You shoulda seen they eyes, I got them rings to shine
You bet that we would die, the whole casino tried
Oh but when we arrived, the whole arena cried
I swallow my pride and drive you crazy yeah I drink and drive
Pile of coke on the table break it down and put it in single files
It's Weezy F. Baby and she know that F is for her freaky side
6 shit
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
That's some 6 shi'
Umm to help these multiple generations that look at me as the reason they started rapping or the reason why they rap and into music is ... uh ... it's unexplainable. There isn't a word for it. You can't describe the feeling. Um if there, you know what I mean, there's words that's probably close to it, and when I say close I mean light years away from it, words like amazing, awesome, that's probably the closest, and like I said, that's light years away from the feeling, you know what I mean. I can't explain it, it's crazy just to turn on the television, just to see my own children walk inside and be like, you know what I mean, singing something you know like what is you talking about right now, what are you singing, what are you listening to on that iPad, what are you watching? And they be like "such and such" and I be like, you know, what is that, and they be like, you know what I mean, "he loves you Daddy, he loves you Daddy, he always shouting you out Daddy, he always..." and that's when they put me on, you know what I mean. I just sounded so old just now told you how my kids be, man Drama if you keep that shit, dawg you bad, that should let you know that you're older than me1Embed
