7 ContributorsIntro (Fear of God) Lyrics
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?
Just remember last year at this time
We were in a fucking cage, okay?
You remember
I'd like to forget that
I say be happy with what you've got
You be happy
Me, I want what's coming to me
Oh, well what's coming to you?
The world chico
And everything in itYou might also like2Embed
