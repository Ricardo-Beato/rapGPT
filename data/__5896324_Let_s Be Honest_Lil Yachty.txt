It's beyond what I'm sayin'
Too much movin' fast without plan
Mess up, turn every boy into a man
See somebody fall, don't hesitate, extend a hand

Lets be honest put beef behind us
Let's work together keep on standin' and 
No limits riches we can conquer
Whatever color
You black or white ,you still my brother
Love to your mother
This life we seem to take for granted
Let's understand
Clothes on our backs, food in our mouth
And houses with the hood
You tell your fam you love 'em every night
I think you should
Don't think that you can't go to college
Dawg, I think you could

Love, lifе, peace, health, strеngth
Listen to the sounds
Listen to the Earth
Look at how you breathe
Try to spread love 'til the day that you leave
Dawg, that's what we need
Love, life, peace, health, strength
Listen to the sounds
Listen to the Earth
Look at how you breathe
Try to spread love 'til the day that you leave
Dawg, that's what we need

My soul feeds on achieving my goals
Tryna get to the destination
Keep getting stopped by tolls
My soul feeds on achieving my goals
Seems like the more I do
Feels like the more I Know
They gon' try and hold you down that's on gang
They gon' try and tell you that your name ain't worth a thing
They gon' try and make you feel like your're less than
Prove them wrong make you the one they Invest In

Love, life (Yeah)
Peace, health, (Yeah) strength
Listen to the sounds
Listen to the Earth (To the Earth)
Look at how you breathe (How you breathe)
Try to spread love till the day you leave
Dawg, that's what we need (Need)
Love, life
Peace, health, (Yeah, we need) strength
Listen to the sounds
Listen to the Earth (Listen to the Earth)
Look at how you breathe (Look at how you breathe)
Try to spread love till the day you leave
Dawg, that's what we need (Need)
Yeah, that what we need
Why don't you see?
It's what we need, yeah
