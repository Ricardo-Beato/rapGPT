Ayo, shout out to Black Diamond
I got them Nikes on my feet as we speak, homie
Yeah
Shout out to Mac Miller

All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind (Sinatra)
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

Ugh, yeah
My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind
And at this moment in time, I’m on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he’s passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my
Good god, you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by
See I ain’t signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money, that’s my repertoire
Holla at honeys, "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"
Baby what’s the deal, have you ever heard of some shit so real?
(Cudi what up?)

It’s going down
Feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down
While the rest of the world just stare

All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Al-al-al-all I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

Yeah
This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "That’s my shit!"
Maybe at a house party while you getting lit
Or while you cruising 'round town riding in a whip
One thing’s for sure, you better get all of your friends here
If a shorty like my music, then she a (Bobbysoxer)
Got a booty, know how to use it, homie, yes, I rocks her
The second I jump on a stage, I’m rocking it, ain’t nobody stoppin' it
Whoever goes on after me, I’m sorry, you ain’t topping it
It’s going down
Feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down
While the rest of the world just stare

All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Al-al-al-all I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game
While you worshiped other rappers that leave you less entertained
I was strategizing before the people knew my name
Fame what I shall attain on the road to success
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
Yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito
I know we fight, but that’s poquito
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Al-al-al-all I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind117Embed
