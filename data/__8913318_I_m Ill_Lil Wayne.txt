1 ContributorIâ€™m Ill Lyrics:
"Motherfucka I'm ill" - Lil' Wayne 'A Milli'
"Bitch I'm ill"
:
Let me get it right
Right from the giddy go
I'm for real homie, fuck a rap video
Don't play with me, I'll launch somethin' aerial
Swoop over your roof, poof, nothin' left for burial
But you don't hear me though
Guess you want some more proof
Well it's too late and the bullets replaced the place of your Bluetooth
Bloodsport, Gladiator, full contact
Full course, no remorse, shit'll sound like Iraq
I ain't a goon, I'm a platoon I am a monster
You ain't a soldier boy, you Tropic Thunder
I'll run the world and sun the world, I'm nothin' like them
Y'all vampires, these niggas be bitin'
I am a beast, werewolf, nigga Lycan
Pillagin' this rap game, modern day viking
I am that, I am rap and I ain't holdin' back
I am king
I thought I told you that
:
"Motherfucka I'm ill"
"Bitch I'm ill"

Niggas be talkin'
Haters be talkin'
Keep that bitch shit up, you won't be walkin'
Wheelchair nigga, real yeah I'm that
A product of my motherfuckin' ghetto habitat
Boy I'm the dopest thing since pure cocaine
The raps is legal substance, shoot me in your veins
Junkies love my flow, think about me in their dreams
But you are not fresh, no I am not impressed
So you are Earthbound I'm extraterrestrial
All on my dick like a homosexual
Heart of a lion, mind of an Einstein
Strength of a gorilla
Specially when it's hang time
George Of The Jungle, who wanna rumble?
Shine all the time, I don't care where the sun go
Soon as that album drop, nigga it's a wrap
I'm runnin' this shit, boy I thought I told you that
:
"Motherfucka I'm ill"
"Bitch I'm ill"Embed
