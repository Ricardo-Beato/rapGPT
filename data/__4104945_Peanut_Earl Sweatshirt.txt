Ayy
Ayy, nephew in SA, ayy
Know I'm on the way
Family saw you on the stage, left it not amazed
Thought you'd up and aim? Ayy
Now you done and braised, ayy (Braised, ayy)
Get the fuck back, you moving like they cut your 'caine, ayy
Lick the nut sack, I'm zooted in some tear-aways (Ayy)
Fleshin' through the pain, depression, this is not a phase, ayy
Picking out his grave, couldn't help but feel outta place
Tryna catch some rays, death and hops a sour taste (Sour taste)
Bless my pops, we sent him off and not an hour late
Still in shock and now my heart out somewhere on the range
Outta range, picked the lock and now we elevate
We box 'em out, my shit a million miles away
Niggas featherweight
Like we making food, father's face but I'm not afraid
My Uncle HughYou might also like20Embed
