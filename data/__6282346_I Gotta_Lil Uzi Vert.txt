Yeah
Lil Uzi Vert, haha
I been smackin' so hard, man (Yeah, yeah)
This shit so (Yeah)
Look, this hard (I love you, star boy)
Watch (Yeah)

Little bitch suck it up right in the chair (Yeah)
I don't know that bitch but I told her, "Come here" (Yeah)
I got the guap, my name is Symere (Ayy)
It's nice to meet you, now, who is that there? (Ayy)
That is your friend? Oh, do you share? (Uh-huh)
Won't tell nobody, baby, I swear (Shh, what?)
That is two baddies, the grand finale
I got a check, look like a tally (Yeah)
Stay with the bands just like the Tali'
Uh, Moncler don't matter the climate
Uh, one day, yeah, I'ma go diamond (What?)
Yeah, that's thе reason I keep climbin' (Hey)
Had to run back the swag likе a Heisman
Went to the dentist, that boy like I'm Rodman
Pull up, a SRT 8 like O'Reilly
First car a Lambo' like, "Fuck Maserati" (Skrrt)
