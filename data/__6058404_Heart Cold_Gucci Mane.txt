11 ContributorsHeart Cold Lyrics
(Honorable Court)

Yeah, sippin' on lean, I feel it (Lean)
Bad bitch look like Nicki (Bad)
Ridin' 'round town, no ceilin' (Skrrt)
Heart cold, got no feelings (Brr)
The opps even know I'll kill 'em (Damn)
My grandma know I'm a dealer (Gran)
Playin' with the Ashley Simpson (Simpson)
O's of the dog like Menace

Stash spot look like it's Crippin' (Wow)
Like a nigga got racks in the mididle
Bad bitch and her bag expensive
I can put the whole stash in her titties (Titties)
I'm trippin' off the money like really (Trippin')
I'm geeked like I popped a whole Skittle (Geeked)
I ain't trippin' on the beef, I'ma grill it (Nah)
Lil' ass Glock with a fifty
You lookin' for your bitch, she missin' (Huh?)
I'm chewin' on Percs like chicken (Chewin')
Trap so hot, it's sizzlin' (Trap)
Pray that the feds don't get us (Fuck 'em)
Snakes in the grass, they hissin' (Snakes)
Nobody touch my kitchen (Nah)
I ain't gon' leave no witness (Nah)
Cross his ass out like a Christian (Christian)
You might also like
Yeah, sippin' on lean, I feel it (Lean)
Bad bitch look like Nicki (Bad)
Ridin' 'round town, no ceilin' (Skrrt)
Heart cold, got no feelings (Brr)
The opps even know I'll kill 'em (Damn)
My grandma know I'm a dealer (Gran)
Playin' with the Ashley Simpson (Simpson)
O's of the dog like Menace

Water on me, Fiji or Dasani (Water)
It look like my jeweler just hit me with a tsunami (Brr)
Can't let them copy me, can't let 'em see how Gucci comin' (Nah)
You try to copy me, you know that's gon' cost you some money (Cha-ching)
They think that shit be funny 'til they get hit with the Tommy
My 916s and they be jumpin' like LeBron (LeBron)
You better not play with 1017, we gon' turn you to zombies (Damn)
Like how he from the city but got buried in the country? (How?)
My wardrobe versatile, I put on creatures like Jumanji (Wow)
And all my cars foreign, that mean they come from different countries (Huh?)
Bitch, all my friends dead, I just like Franklins on my money (Racks)
I tell you I don't lie, but if I did, I'd be dishonest (Woah)

Yeah, sippin' on lean, I feel it (Lean)
Bad bitch look like Nicki (Bad)
Ridin' 'round town, no ceilin' (Skrrt)
Heart cold, got no feelings (Brr)
The opps even know I'll kill 'em (Damn)
My grandma know I'm a dealer (Gran)
Playin' with the Ashley Simpson (Simpson)
O's of the dog like Menace
