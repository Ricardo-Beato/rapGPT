(Got it on smash)
(OG Parker)

When that drink kick in, she feel sexy (Sexy)
Flexin' on the 'gram, made her at me (At me)
Cash kicked in on the worst day (Cash)
Quit cap'n girl, you know it ain't your birthday (Birthday)
Ay' who birthday? Put yo' hand up
You get a purse bae, if she bad enough
She get a car today (Skrrt), hit that dash, skate (Skrrt)
Hit that dash skate (Skrrt), hit that dash, skate (Skrrt), skate (Skrrt)

50 bands to 100, get your racks up (Racks up)
Throw it back, get that cash out the Brinks truck (Brinks truck)
New whip, show the slip, it's the pink one (Whip)
Now tattoo me on your ass, so it means something (Oh)
Thumb through it, count that big bank roll (Count it)
Chrome set on my Cartier by 4 (Ice)
She say she gon' say not nothing if she told (Nothin')
Coke bottle shape she got the world on her mold (Whoo)
Pop out with a vibe, but I got her in disguise (In disguise)
Lookin' dead at her, hypnotized, I can see it all in her eyes (Hypnotized)
Pull up with a stick stick, to thick thick in her thighs (Thick)
Gang gang get rich rich crossed the world, y'een havin' ties (Gang)
Be about it, don't talk about it, just walk about it, that's it (Whoa)
Everybody be somebody, til' somebody get hit (Ow)
I can chop a brick like a rider, but I gave it up and made a hit (Hit)
I done came from the coach to the first class, now I'm flying a jet

Make em' mad, make them bitches have a bad day (Bad)
What that tag say, don't make that bag wait (No)
We smokin' pound cake (Cookie), don't need no ashtray (Nah)
Everybody wanna talk about a check, but I ain't seen a check get spent (Where?)
Hit the bih one time, I gave her good dick, and she ain't seen me since (Swear)
She on her first cup, by the fourth one she gon' end up sick (Euhhh)
Tellin' her best friend about the car I got, “He filthy rich” (Richie)
Now you can get a Birkin bag for your birthday (Birky')
Raise your hands high, if you want this shit for certain
She went back to ratchet, cause that cute shit wasn't workin'
We can leave after the party, cause the Maybach came with curtains (Takeoff)

When that drink kick in, she feel sexy (Sexy)

Diamonds on you, you done glowed up

Only come out in the dark and get hit out the park
And she callin' me Sosa (Hit out the park)
Told her she better be smart, better go with your heart
Girl you gotta' be focused (Go with your heart)
