16 ContributorsGot Lyrics
I'm wall climbing, on the rocks
You want problems, what you wanna box?
You got the time? You got the clocks?
You got your 9? You got your Glock?
You got your house?
You got a car?
You got some money?
You got a knot?
I wanna know, tell me what you got
I already know, that ain't what you got

Pull up i8, put up your Hemi
I got the chopper, I got the semi
My little niggas will snatch you out your Fendi
Guns with the Terror Squad call em´ Martin and Remy
I ain't a player I crush a lot, call me Big Pun
'Cuz she can't get in my pool, she call me boring
I be smoking weed a lot, I bought a foreign
Hoe I know you called two times, bitch I´m ignoring
I got 8 hoes in my house, I Flava Flav em'
Doing 80 down my block like fuck the neighbors
They say my car is like I hit the neighbors with tasers
I hit my arsenal like White Castles, bitch what you cravin´?
You might also like
I'm wall climbing, on the rocks
You want problems, what you wanna box?
You got the time? You got the clocks?
You got your 9? You got your Glock?
You got your house?
You got a car?
You got some money?
You got a knot?
I wanna know, tell me what you got
I already know, that ain't what you got

I already know you don't wanna smoke
You already know I'm riding in a boat
Like a  with a cantaloupe you already know that I'm in the dough
In the Gucci store Sosa for the 4, yeah you know how I get it hoe
Hit the block car look like a shotgun you know how I'm bending hoe
Hit the Louis store and you know I paid a couple thousand for some penny loafers
Went in Barneys and saw a all red pair of Margielas and I'm like gimmie those
Aye if you want my house shoes went in the Nike store, give me like 50 of those
100 hoes in the house, but you know Chief So' fucked like 50 of those
He came with an ounce, I need more than that, well at least about 50 of those
Don't fuck kiddy hoes, why they act like that, only Lord really knows
Hey what's the dealeo?
´Member having snot nose, chain got a pissy nose
Boolin with the gang
I ain't got time for these  silly hoes
I'm wall climbing, on the rocks
You want problems, what you wanna box?
You got the time? You got the clocks?
You got your 9? You got your Glock?
You got your house?
You got a car?
You got some money?
You got a knot?
I wanna know, tell me what you got
I already know, that ain't what you gotEmbed
