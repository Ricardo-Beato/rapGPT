14 ContributorsStill Hustlinâ€™ Lyrics
(David Banner)
(DJ Ill Will)

Sittin' in the hooptie, lookin' for a groupie
Bitch, I'm K.Dot, act like you knew me
Got me fucked up, me don't pay for no booty
You looking for a price, bitch, I'm not no fool, G
I'm hot like Cooly, sicker than the cooties
I got all the juice, you something like a Poomby
I'm soon to be the greatest for the ages of the young
Watch the game like a raven, cravin' rappers 'til I'm numb
Novacane can't contain the pain that I brung
Bitch, I shine like a microscope bouncin' off the sun
Words bouncin' off my tongue like a damn trampoline
Hoes manicure, hemmin' up the bottom of my jeans so I kick him off
Got haters pissed off, used to have no bank
Look at my account, you see O's like Rick Ross
I drift off to the moon, martian
Use the Big Dipper as a teaspoon
Parkin' my UFO somewhere that you don't know
Welcome to the C4, you see one, you see four
Bombs in my peak hold, bombs over Baghdad
Son you niggas, you can never say I was a bad dad
Run you nigga like a marathon
This is when Vietnam meets the Babylon
Bring it to yo front porch, tanks on your grass lines
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, jumpin' from the foul line
In order to see the king, you gotta swim through the ponds

Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Bitch I'm on my grind like I ain't made nothing
And to tell the truth, I ain't made nothing
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Started out hustlin' (bitch I'm still hustlin')
Bitch I'm on the grind like I ain't made nothing

K. Dot start it up
You hear my engine bitch
Pussy wet paint sweeter than some licorice
I'm like the homie Nas, I'm on some nigga shit
More chains more whips hell yeah I'm living rich
We chewing MC's, like some licorice
Disrespect, get that ass smoked like a cigarette
And I'm the realest yes, keep these bitches wet
And we don't give em chips, we just give em dick
Got guns on me, cause them niggas hate
Better have insurance, cause I'm giving wakes
I ain't lifting weights, I lift them .38s
9s, .45s, big choppas aiming at yo face
Ha ha

Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Bitch I'm on my grind like I ain't made nothing
And to tell the truth, I ain't made nothing
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Started out hustlin' (bitch I'm still hustlin')
Bitch I'm on the grind like I ain't made nothing
Paint bubblicious, just a lil rusty
It's Friday, been on the donut since Monday, highway
How I touch sky, I Kanye, kill 'em
Like Ali, bomaye, killer
Swap meet shopping till I not need nothing
Or in-between the legs of a knock-kneed women
Say it ain't so, Soul, say it ain't so
I ain't fucking with you like Nazi public
Fuck 'em, fuck it, slide in the bucket
You rolling on adults I'm sitting on the team summit
T-pain on, back seat fucking puffing la la la like a Lil Wayne song
And why would I lie like a nigga in denial?
When I can tell the truth and be free like style
Top-notch TV don't touch that dial
Unless you finna wash up, you niggas better watch us

Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Bitch I'm on my grind like I ain't made nothing
And to tell the truth, I ain't made nothing
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Started out hustlin' (bitch I'm still hustlin')
Bitch I'm on the grind like I ain't made nothing6Embed
