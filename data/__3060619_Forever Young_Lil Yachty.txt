61 ContributorsForever Young Lyrics
All night I've been watching you
So tonight, you're leaving with me
I've been waiting my whole life to give you it all
It's on now, it's on now
I'm talking the big fancy lights
The star studded nights with me
We forever young
We forever young
We forever young

The music's loud and I'm feeling wild
Come dance along with the golden child
I don't know much but sure, let me check your fouls
Two technicals but you beautiful
You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses

But we could be together forever
But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever
Together
Forever young
Forever young
We forever young
You might also like
Shining bright under the shining sun
Like moonshine you keep it 99% with me
I'm feeling all your energy
I know you love to vibe with me
I know you love to ride for me
Your favorite thing to say is, "Boat, I love when you're inside of me"
Your love is like a high to me
I love to go out my way to make sure you stay happy
We forever young

The music's loud and I'm feeling wild
Come dance along with the golden child
I don't know much but sure, let me check your fouls
Two technicals but you beautiful
You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses

But we could be together forever
But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever
Together
Forever young
Forever young
Forever young, forever young
Forever young, forever young
We forever young11Embed
