3 Contributors1 for the Money Lyrics
It's one time
Justin Credible, what's up homeboy?
DJ Sourmilk
Power 106
Uhh, uhh
The youngest in charge
Yah homeboy neighborhood, LA Leakers
Let's get it

Look, it go
One for the money
Two for the pussy and foreign cars
Three for them square ass niggas, who swore was goin' far
Look at yah boy partnah I'm doin' big thangs
That money comin' there's nothin' chump about this change
I'm hoppin' of the plane, in the Benz gettin' brain
Tell the promoter, "we ain't gettin' out til' we paid
When I hit the stage, Red champagne, blue rags, and gold chains
Hussle

That's all y'all gon' see, popped bottles, you already know
Count cash, probably throwin' money
Justin Credible, Sourmilk
Y'all now tuned into the takeover every Wednesday night til' midnight we turn it up like this
Real Hip-Hop, Westcoast
Hussle
You might also like
Look, the takeover, the break's over you sucka's
The king of these L.A. streets is Nip Hussle
I got the right to say that 'cause everythang I drop
On every block, niggas play that, Hussle
My life style explains that 'cause everythang I spend
Is always less than what I make back
Damn it feels good, I was just on BET
Now she see me in the hood, and she like that
So I fuck her one time, I give her right back (here)
You could wife that

Nights at the studio got my buzz poppin'
Now it's only one question, they say when is cuz droppin'
An I'm like hold on homie, failure ain't an option
And you can't rush perfection, be patient I gotcha
It's all money in and it ain't nobody that can stop it
Another day another dolla' and I'm all about the profits
So holla at yah boy uhh
