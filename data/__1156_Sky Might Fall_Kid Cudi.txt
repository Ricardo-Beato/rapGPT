74 ContributorsSky Might Fall Lyrics
Oh
Oh, oh

What a world that I'm livin' in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
(Still I feel my) Path narrow, I run again
Seem happiness is gone again
(And then you see 'em) Grey clouds up above, mane
Metaphoric to my life, mane
(Still I feel my) Heart stronger than it's ever been
Strong will 'til my journey ends
(Until then I roll) More than I ever rolled
Not pills, but the Mary though
(Still I feel my) Eyes heavy when the day goes
Nothin' helpin' when my head doze
(But I ain't 'sleep) Awake in another state
Livin' in a new space
(Still I feel my) Mind runnin' at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race (Until then I go)

(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh, ahh) But I'm not worried at all, c'mon, c'mon
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh, ahh) But I'm not worried at all

Hey, hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up

Grey clouds stuck together, fam'
Lightning piercing through another land
Over the desert where the lost play
Soul searchin' each and every way
(And then you see the) Awesome sound, so profound
When itâ€”it'll grip you
(You can see it) If you hear it you can feel it too
Somethin' special I am runnin' to
(Until then I go) Away, very far away
To another universe where all the people say
It's the new-new place for the special to embrace
Like a Martian who seemingly wandered out of place
Take what you need from the valley of the hope, where
Even if you drown you'll be floatin' higher up, and
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh, ahh) But I'm not worried at all, c'mon, c'mon
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh, ahh) But I'm not worried at all

Hey, hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up

I keep runnin', yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up
And I keep runnin', yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
'Cause I'm gone
Yeah, na-na na-na, na-na na-na
I'm up, and away
Na-na, na-na
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Hey, hey47Embed
