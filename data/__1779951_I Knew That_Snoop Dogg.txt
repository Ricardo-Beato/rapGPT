17 ContributorsI Knew That Lyrics
I knew that, I knew that
You were lookin' at me
That's when the blood start rushing
I knew that, I knew that
You would leave your spot when you got hot
And you're goin' again
I love when you seein' she's goin' to the bathroom
Got 5 minutes to exchange numbers
No I'm not callin' you, what's your sign
I know your name, it must be under cover

Went out tonight, I think of my life
I'm sick and tired of rouge, yea
Then, threw caution to the wind cause F it, who cares
So tonight I'm gon' be

Riding on your, riding on your
Riding on your wave girl
And I feel like, ooh
Riding on your, riding on your
Riding on your wave girl
And I feel like, ooh
You might also like
I knew that, I knew that
You were lookin' at me
That's when the blood start rushing
I knew that, I knew that
You would leave your spot when you got hot
And you're goin' again
I love when you seein' she's goin' to the bathroom
Got 5 minutes to exchange them buds
No I'm not callin' you, what's your sign
I know your name, it must be under cover

Thinkin' to myself if I was a freaky dink
What's crackin' homie?
Ain't you ain't gonna see me in this club next week, no
So tonight' I'm gon' be

Riding on your, riding on your
Riding on your wave girl
And I feel like, ooh
Riding on your, riding on your
Riding on your wave girl
And I feel like, ooh
I knew that, I knew that
You were lookin' at me
That's when the blood start rushing
I knew that, I knew that
You would leave your spot when you got hot
And you're goin' again
I love when you seein' she's goin' to the bathroom
Got 5 minutes to exchange them buds
No I'm not callin' you, what's your sign
I know your name, it must be under cover

I hope you got your rest and you don't need to sleep
Don't be slacking homie
Grab me by the proof so I don't miss a beat
Baby, so tonight I'm gon' be

Riding on your, riding on your
Riding on your wave girl
And I feel like, ooh
Riding on your, riding on your
Riding on your wave girl
And I feel like, ooh
I knew that, I knew that
You were lookin' at me
That's when the blood start rushing
I knew that, I knew that
You would leave your spot when you got hot
And you're goin' again
I love when you seein' she's goin' to the bathroom
Got 5 minutes to exchange them buds
No I'm not callin' you, what's your sign
I know your name, it must be under cover3Embed
