8 ContributorsAinâ€™t That Funny Lyrics
This is another Missy Elliot exclusive

I remember when your ass was broke
And so in love with me
You were always at home, always talkin' 'bout
"Loan me this, loan me that, now gimme-gimme"
And then you got dough, uh
Then decide you wanna leave
Got a few chicks checkin' for you now, huh, you forgot about me
Ain't it funny?

When your man gets money
Yo, I bet you can't find him
But when he come home beggin'
You can't deny him
Where he at when you need him?
He's out duckin' you
But when he need a few dollars
He know where to run to

We would go out
I had to pay for everything
I never had to worry 'bout you fuckin' 'round
You used to tell me "Yeah, I love you, no one above you"
And then I bought you clothes
I made you look like a king
And then them girls started flirtin' with your ass, huh? And you forgot about me
Ain't it funny?

When your man gets money
Yo, I bet you can't find him
But when he come home beggin'
You can't deny him
Where he at when you need him?
He's out duckin' you
But when he need a few dollars
He know where to run to

I'll be the one you runnin' to (Come on)
When your pockets is low (Come on)
And you out of cash flow (That's right)
And the chicks don't want you no mo' (Okay)
Runnin' to (Uh-huh)
When you got no more gas (Uh-huh)
In those buses, catchin' cabs (Come on)
And the chicks don't see you no mo'

When your man gets money
Yo, I bet you can't find him
But when he come home beggin'
You can't deny him
Where he at when you need him?
Uh-huh
But when he need a few dollars
He know where to run toEmbed
