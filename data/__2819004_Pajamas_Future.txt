7 ContributorsPajamas Lyrics
What is Lean?
Future
What that is you got in that sprite fool?
Ayy

I pulled your bitch in my pajamas
I got your main thing giving me the neck (In my pajamas)
Wake up in the morning, thumb through a check (In my pajamas)
Yeah, I do this this shit (In my pajamas)
Yeah, ayy (In my pajamas)
TTG, fool, I hit licks (In my pajamas)
Lol (In my pajamas)
We gon' walk inside the mall and buy that bitch (In my pajamas)

Rolling up the strong loud gas in my pajamas
Pulled a bitch baby momma, Fucked a bitch in her pajamas
Standing on the porch, pulled a bitch in my pajamas
Pulled up with the horse everywhere on my pajamas (ralph)
Versace house shoes I’m inside the Porsche Carrera
Burberry boxers,  boy this bitch look like Ciara (turn up)
She diggin’ my demeanor fully strapped up with a barrel
Ralph Lauren white T this ain’t American Apparel
Iced out in my pajamas, flyer than a sailor
Drinking lean by the gallon the lean man owe me a favor
Count the check in my pajamas I’m a major figure playa
Spent a grip on my pajamas, my pajamas got flavor
In my pajamas, yeah, In my pajamas
You might also like
I pulled your bitch in my pajamas
I got your main thing giving me the neck (In my pajamas)
Wake up in the morning, thumb through a check (In my pajamas)
Yeah, I do this this shit (In my pajamas)
Yeah, ayy (In my pajamas)
TTG, fool, I hit licks (In my pajamas)
Lol (In my pajamas)
We gon' walk inside the mall and buy that bitch (In my pajamas)

The best part of wakin up is goin to get the lumber
I can't wait to get that lumber
I pull up in my pajamas
On my momma I do numbers in my pajamas
G&G pajamas I bought them in Bahamas
The cost a pretty penny (aye ' bout how much)
'Bout 6 hunna
Style on 'em, , think I'm talkin funnel
I was 
I was fully talkin auto
Fully loaded, auto (the car)
Fully loaded, auto
Shoot first, ask questions later
Nigga I be under
I live for the trouble
I pull up in my pajamas
A1 nigga my life fun
You would think we hit the lotto
Nigga we 10 hunna
Get money in our pajamas
I pulled your bitch in my pajamas
I got your main thing giving me the neck (In my pajamas)
Wake up in the morning, thumb through a check (In my pajamas)
Yeah, I do this this shit (In my pajamas)
Yeah, ayy (In my pajamas)
TTG, fool, I hit licks (In my pajamas)
Lol (In my pajamas)
We gon' walk inside the mall and buy that bitch (In my pajamas)

Fendi boxes Fendi draws
Might be drinkin’ Waffle House
100 bands, 100 dollar bills, stashed off in the house
Livin’ above the law, in pajamas cookin' raw
I catch a jugg in my pajamas, then we hop up out the car
The trunk, When the check clear, my trappin’ up to par
Stuff the kush in my cigar in my pajamas no facade
It’s that time of month, with the broads
They in the pajamas out in South Beach
I’m at the Fontainebleau pulling bitches in my Louis V

I pulled your bitch in my pajamas
I got your main thing giving me the neck (In my pajamas)
Wake up in the morning, thumb through a check (In my pajamas)
Yeah, I do this this shit (In my pajamas)
Yeah, ayy (In my pajamas)
TTG, fool, I hit licks (In my pajamas)
Lol (In my pajamas)
We gon' walk inside the mall and buy that bitch (In my pajamas)1Embed
