136 ContributorsGees Lyrics
Uh, ign'ant-ass white kid (White kid)
But I'm still bicycling and recycling ('Cyling)
And I'm still eatin' gummy bear vitamins
All my bitches takin' Vicodin, huffin' nitrogen (Go)
Hyper than Williams', middle son
Since I was a little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Comin' up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speakin' while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothin' left in my will
'Cept, "Throw it all in the casket, it's mine still"
Uh, I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-assed
Set some rat traps, went and took a cat nap
Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, "Master, feed me pipe"
I'm the scotch on the rocks, you the Appletini type
You might also like
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees, woah

Uh, still fuckin' with these hoes, though (Hoes, though)
Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos (Jojos)
Take a bitch to SoHo for some fro-yo
And tell her she gon' blow it: Romo
And now, I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc (Tone-Lōc)
Young boy, but I'm chillin' with some grown folk (Grown folk)
No joke, Most Dope, you just bowl smoke
How much coke you gotta sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me, "No more" (No more)
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pullin' up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say "Wassup?" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche
Who you kiddin'? Your flow's warshed
I ain't in the street, but I'll grill you from the porch (Bitch)
I been had hoes, I played sports (For real)
Her ass out the bottom of her shorts (Sheesh, woah)

Suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees
(Uh, Black James Bond and a white Shaft) (Yeah)
Turned my daughter to a queen, turned a dollar to a dream
Flashy as high-beams, smokin' on good weed
Somethin' from kush seeds, the only strand to smoke for us OGs
I'm rich, car service, no car keys (Yeah!)
First-class flight, 'bout to land to a new bitch (Yeah, yeah)
She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came with (Aww, aww)
MCM bag and, nigga, bet some weed in it
Two-hundred dollars worth of Backwoods, we all livin' (Yeah, yeah)
Brought the gangsters back the bucket hat, how real is that? (Ou)
I'm gettin' money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack (Ugh)
Quarter million in a safe in case I get a case
Faggot-ass judge hatin' on me 'cause my money straight (Yeah)
Dropped ten racks in all fifty states (Bitch)
Gon' name my next tour "Million-Man March" (Aww, yeah)
Make a nun throw it back while I pull her scarf (Yeah)
She gave me head, my nuts touched her cross, boss

Figg Side
Suck my dick before I slap you with it (Ou-ou, yeah)46Embed
