6 ContributorsHow We Rockin Lyrics
When i'm fish-tailin out of Magic City
In a car that cost a half a millie
Turn the corner too quick
Then spilled drink on my Dickie
Bad bitch, on my right side, she filthy
Damn you got some pretty titties
And I love when she call Guwop big poppa
Cause we fucking all night like Kim and Peggy
Double cup of that candy
Got a quarter pound of that cookie
Poured a quarter pint on her pussy
And now her pussy sticky
We just came back from Italy
And the feds said they want to come get me
But I'm feelin just like big Meechy
Cause i'm still gone plead not guilty
See my girl shoes keep two c's on it
Her dollar card got two b's on it
Plus all my cars got F's on em
But my lil boy's car got e's on it
Your cd ain't got nothing on it
Bought your cd, just to roll weed on it
My girl told me they ain't got nothing on me
Fuck her 20 minutes now she nuttin on me

That young nigga done stacked his cheese and bought a Benz
That's how we rockin (x3)
He draped up in Versace, shawty got some ends
That's how we rockin (x3)
He keep a chopper with him shotter will kill again
That's how we rockin (x3)
Bitch you so bad I don't care what I'ma spend
That's how we rockin (x3)
That's how we rockin, these hoes be jockin
That's how we rockin, bottles keep on poppin
That's how we rockin, I take you shoppin
That's how we rockin, had a trap house on the dead end
I know you scared then, I bust yo head in
They said that Gucci man was broke, I told em nigga when
Cause I was trapping on my house and I was only ten
You say you beefin come see me I got that damn Mac-10
And I would killer, killer, killer, killer, kill again
I told the feds that they lookin at a killer man
My momma called me told me Gu-op you's a wanted man
I told her Gu-op ain't here, pop I got a fuckin plan
