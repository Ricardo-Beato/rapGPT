7 ContributorsDats What I’m Talkin’ Bout Lyrics
Uhhhh
Ahhhh!
Have you ever been in the mind of a virgin?
It gets hot and curious (And ooaaa)
Well let me take you there
Are you ready, boy?
Come on baby, strap up, cause it might get serious (uh ooaaa!)
Now there will be some heat and some friction
Don't get alarmed cause I'll put ice just to chill the night (I'm just being polite)
And I want to see if you're into it
Intimate kisses and huggings so sentiment (ohhhhh!)
With you I might wanna spend my life

You make the freak come up out me
Dats what I'm talkin' bout
Go 'head like it's my birthday
Dat-dats what I'm talking bout
You make me say oooaa! 'til I can't speak
Dats what I'm talkin' bout
Baby dat-dats what I'm talking bout
Dat-dats what I'm talkin' bout
You don't know just what you do, yea
Dats what I'm talkin' bout
When I'm rocking, slow dance with you
Dat-dats what I'm talking bout
Cause you put chills on my arm when we kiss, yea
Dats what I'm talkin' bout
Baby that-that's what I'm talking bout
Dat-dats what I'm talking bout..
ALRIGHT!
You might also like
Now all I wanna do is, baby
Is make your dove cry and make your body scream like
(AAHHHHH!)
Bet your bottam dollar
Can make you believe that you can fly (Yea)
Well, one hit of this sex weed
Guaranteed to get you high
Like a mutha for ya (No, baby)
You won't even know what day it is
Cause after I come from downtown
Girl I'ma wanna go another round, yea
Until you tell me R Kells please stop
Put it like this
It's like fresh up out the kitchen
The way I got your oven so hot, mama
I'ma hit from the back, and the front, then the side, then bounce it up
And down like this
And baby, everyone gonna say you're a pimp
Cause I'ma have ya walking with a limp

You make the freak come up out me
Dats what I'm talkin' bout
Go 'head like it's my birthday
Dat-dats what I'm talking bout
You make me say oooaa! 'til I can't speak
Dats what I'm talkin' bout
Baby dat-dats what I'm talking bout
Dat-dats what I'm talking bout
You don't know just what you do, yea
Dats what I'm talkin' bout
When I'm rocking, slow dance with you
Dat-dats what I'm talking bout
Cause you put chills on my arm when we kiss, yea
Dats what I'm talkin' bout
Baby dat-dats what I'm talking bout
Dat-dats what I'm talking bout

Sex me, like me
Kiss me, hold me
Touch me, feel me
Do me baby, yea
Cause..
Sex me, like me
Kiss me, hold me
Touch me, feel me
Do me baby, yea
(R. Kelly: This is the greatest bridge I ever heard)
ALRIGHT!
Yea, Fo shizzle my nizzle
You sho nuff the dizzle
And that's on the rizzle, ooooo
Boy, you feel me sizzle (Boy you feel me sizzle)
So sweet helped me do almost anything
