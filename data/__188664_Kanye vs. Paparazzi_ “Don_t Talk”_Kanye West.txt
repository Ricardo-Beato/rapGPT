16 ContributorsKanye vs. Paparazzi: “Don’t Talk” LyricsDon't talk
I appreciate it
I appreciate 'at
But don't talk
You
I know
I don't want
That's fine
But don't talk
To me
I don't want to hear paparazzi talk to me
Or anybody I know
It doesn't 
No no
But don't talk
To me
At all
And don't talk to anyone I know
At all
And tell everybody never talk
To anyone
That anyone knows.
Don't talk to themselves
Don't talk ever again
