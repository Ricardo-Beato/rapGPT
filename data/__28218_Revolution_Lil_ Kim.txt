15 ContributorsRevolution Lyrics
S-W nine millimeter, check
Long-nose double barreled rifle, check
Semi-automatic infrared laser beam shot, check
Alright Puff, I'm ready to go

Threw the clips around the shoulders
Toasters in the holster
(Kim, let's go!) Slow down bab' bro
You with the rap Rambo, Tony Montana
Here's a hammer, a camera, and a "Life After Death" bandana
Here take it, in case I don't make it
'Cause if my life don't end, I'm damn sure gon' fake it
The way I see it, mmm, sexual
In the gunfight, two on three, you on me
Dawg, I got shit to make the world shake
One mistake, blaow, start a earthquake
Fuck them niggas, them niggas dust to me
And if I knock Cyrus off, that's a plus for me
And the funny thing about it, I'm a bitch
And got niggas runnin' from me like the Olympics
And I'm told my man, Gutter, I'ma get him
And every shell I spit is guaranteed to hit him (blaka!)

Pressure down below (Pressure, pressure)
Fire in the hole (Uh, c'mon)
Lose control (Oh, oh,gotta lose control)
Got nowhere to go (Ain't got nowhere to be, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
You might also like
I heard Cease and Puff callin' like the Holy Tabernacle
(Ayo, Kim, c'mon!)I'll be down in a minute, I'm drinkin' a Snapple
A Snapple? Bitch, I got bombs and shit
Grenades and razor blades and alarms and shit
You better come on, girl, throw a hat on that weave
I'm tryin' to catch this nigga Cyrus 'fore him and his boys leave
They at this restaurant that serve African food
Where you allowed to smoke weed and the waiters is type rude
You see, I used to date this bitch from Botswana
Half-African, but she looked like Madonna
Ayo, check it, she had a tiger for a pet
I'll never forget, the restaurant is where we met
And her girlfriend Lizette, that bitch is a freak
I used to fuck her in the ass while my girl was asleep
And she the one who told me where these cats is at
I can't wait to get the gat and holla back
(Kim, c'mon!)

Pressure down below (Pressure, pressure)
Fire in the hole (C'mon)
Lose control (Lose control)
Got nowhere to go (Uh, uh, Ain't got nowhere to be, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)

We came to a red light, gave right-of-way to pedestrians
Two black and white lesbians (Hey hey, baby)
The nigga Puff ready to holla at these bitches
(Hey baby, let me holla at you for a second)
I'm like, "Yo dawg, them bitches down with them niggas"
And never would the drugs make the bitch slack up
I got hit men, spreaded through the restaurant for backup
And we communicate through headsets and walkie-talkies
Them niggas just bitches like my Yorkie
Pigs like the Porky, we on point like snipers (Uh huh)
Cyrus and his Doolies is Clueless like the movies (Uh huh)
All I can think about is how he killed my man Smiles
Cut his head off, massacre style
Yeah, Cyrus did it, Cyrus the Virus they call him
When I finish with him please, his name is Swiss Cheese
My main focus is his righthand man Mouse
Sheisty and two-sided, profession dick rider
And his boys, they seem to be all on his dick
I mean the whole situation is really makin' me sick
And when Cyrus got up and dipped off to the bathroom
We started suckin' niggas up like a vacuum (Yeah, take this)
Bullets flyin' nonstop and bodies droppin' (Yeah, motherfuckers)
Puff yelled, "Away!" That's the cops then
My trigger finger started itchin'
Then Cyrus came spittin' from the kitchen
And next second you missed it
Listen, it's soundin' like the 4th of July
Like the solar eclipse is lit right in the sky
I can't believe this guy, he won't fall over
Holes is in his body the size of cup holders
One more shot, he's over, shit Puff, I'm empty
(Here, I only got one shot left!)
But I'ma hold my breath 'til he fall to his death
(Yeah, motherfucker!)
But he was Elvis 'cause little kids squeezed off in his pelvis
Pressure down below (Pressure, pressure)
Fire in the hole
Lose control (Lose control)
Got nowhere to go (Ain't got nowhere to be, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Your crew run run run, your crew run run
Pressure down below (Pressure, pressure)
Fire in the hole (Your crew run run run, your crew run run)
Lose control
Got nowhere to go (Ain't got nowhere to be, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Your crew run run run, your crew run run
Pressure down below (Pressure, pressure)
Fire in the hole
Lose control (Your crew run run run, your crew run run)
Got nowhere to go
Your crew run run run, your crew run run1Embed
