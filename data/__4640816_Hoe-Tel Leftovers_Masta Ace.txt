4 ContributorsHoe-Tel Leftovers Lyrics
Ok ladies, Big Daddy Kane is occupied for the rest of the evening
I hope you all enjoyed the show, I'm glad y'all came out
But y'all got the hell up out of here
We gotta get this lobby cleared out, let's go
Ay, ay, ay, what's up?
Y'all two right there
Saying they 'bout to clear the lobby out
Y'all wanna hang out?
Yeah, both of y'all, come on, now, come onYou might also likeEmbed
