9 ContributorsWake Up Lyrics
When I wake up up in the morning I brush my teeth
When I wake up up in the morning I'm countin G's
When I wake up in the morning Kay Kay over me
You want beef? better warm it cause my pole with me
When I wake up I'm glad to see another day
You wanna play? Let my choppa spray
Pull up on homie like andale
I ain't got no time to conversate

When I wake up up in the morning I'm on the dough
Get my check then I'm out the door
You ain't talm bout a check then its time to go
Rambo with these 9's and these foes
Chiraq where you find me at
Big house where my drugs be at
On me where my gun be at
So you better not try me jack
On me where my baby at
On me where your lady at
On me where my K be at
I'm never lonely I'mma spray your ass

When I wake up up in the morning I brush my teeth
When I wake up up in the morning I'm countin G's
When I wake up in the morning Kay Kay over me
You want beef? better warm it cause my pole with me
When I wake up I'm glad to see another day
You wanna play? Let my choppa spray
Pull up on homie like andale
I ain't got no time to conversate
You might also like
Say I got cash on my head
She say she want cash and I laughed
Say I got the cash on my act
Try to take my cash your ass grass
They say you got respect with the tec
Thats why I got the tec on my "S"
Its like I got a "S" on my chest
Cause I got a "M" on my whip
Put that bitch on "M" your ass cooked
Taking off on him hoe I look
They heard I got them "M's" I want billions
So I can have some "M's" for my children

When I wake up up in the morning I brush my teeth
When I wake up up in the morning I'm countin G's
When I wake up in the morning Kay Kay over me
You want beef? better warm it cause my pole with me
When I wake up I'm glad to see another day
You wanna play? Let my choppa spray
Pull up on homie like andale
I ain't got no time to conversate

When I wake up up in the morning I brush my teeth
When I wake up up in the morning I'm countin G's
When I wake up in the morning Kay Kay over meEmbed
