15 ContributorsPosse On Bouldercrest Lyrics
Ear Drummers
My posse on Bouldercrest
Mike WiLL Made-It, Gucci Mane slayed it

Me and my gang at home away from home
In a all-red Phantom, in the backseat on the phone
It's callin' up the posse, it's time to get rippin'
And if they get to trippin', then we shootin' like the Pistons
Everybody lookin', if you jealous, turn around
These twenty-six inches got us so high off the ground
The Forgiato rims, they're skinny as the tires
My system soundin' good, but I need the volume higher
The Mike-WiLL kick drum make the bitches get dumb
Rollin' Rolls-Royces, so the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this, these niggas wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate, the richest one in East Atlanta
Picked up the posse on 34 and Gresham
Headed up to Bouldercrest, we 'bout to start flexin'
The Phantom kind of crowded, the front was leanin' back
Scarr, he in the Birdie, got two bitches in his lap
On Martin Luther King, the set look kind of dead
We need a new street, so posse move ahead
We all drippin' in ice, the crew you can't forget
The So Icey Boys and we rippin' up the set
You might also like
My posse's on Bouldercrest
My posse's on Bouldercrest (Mike WiLL Made-It)

The cash is rollin' in, my posse's gettin' bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We stone cold criminals, we flex like big gorillas
We not the average artist, bitch, we certified killers
I spent a million dollars just for diamonds on my teeth
And every time they see 'em, make their girls get weak
People think we crazy, some think that we are funny
But it ain't hard to tell that we make a lot of money
We clockin' all the dollars, we rock a lot of gold
The other crews mad 'cause we fuckin' all they hoes
Woodland, Custer Ave, me and my crew are thugs
And they so full of drugs they may never sober up
And I'm a dope man and the pack just dropped
If you ain't tryna cop, then this Phantom won't stop
At Boulevard and Moreland the driver broke left
And Shiesty shouted "Bouldercrest, it's time to get def"
My girl blew me a kiss, she said I was the best
She's lookin' mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse on Bouldercrest, it's time to get ill
Certified, I'm that lil' nigga that make big ones pay respects
CGE, 1017, covered in choppas and baguettes
We just flipped one of they niggas, tryna see who gon' be next
Soon as I burn up this steamer, take me where I parked the 'Vette
Why he keep talkin' like he gangster? Cook him, put him to the test
My opps don't never show they background, know I'll send some' where they at
Them pigs can ask a million questions, still won't get me to say shit
It ain't no tellin' who got shot, if you don't know, you never slid
And they can't act like they don't know me, remember I flew out your bitch
I take they Rollies and their chains, nigga, I'm the reason you hide your wrist
For real menace, been causin' hell, I done did shit you can't forget
I got glizzies around the globe, it ain't shit to get to them sticks
1017, livin' a dream, come eat with us, we'll get you rich
