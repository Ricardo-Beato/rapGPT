Wicked

Remember, more than an adversary, I'm very quick
I'm ready to hit 'em with this gift I'm equipped to kick
So, grab your coat and your hat, 'cause I'm prepared to clown
Let's gather the set and throw these motherfuckers down
Oh shit, 2Pacalypse is back and strapped
Attackin' the packs, Iâ€™m kickin' the facts on stacks of raps
And those that max, relax, and let the Blacks get jack
Are gettin' taxed, by packs and packs of angry Blacks
I'm ready to go, I'm rippin' the shows
Hittin' the door, gettin' the hoes, clothes
Pumpin' the funk, thanks to the Hump, 'cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze when you see me close
Punks, you gonna roast, hopes in a cloud of smoke
Broke, choked on some potent dank smoke
Wrote rhymes that'll bring me bank notes
Nope, I ain't the type of fella that you're used to
Ki-Ki-Ki-Kickin' the funky flava, pumpin' the juice with dope producers
Run for cover when you hear the bass drum
One verse is all it takes
Something wicked this way comes (Ruthless, come, come)
Ruthless, come, come
