7 ContributorsPimpinâ€™ Pt. 2 Lyrics
Yeah, I'm back baby
You miss me? (Haha)
Come here

I be pimpin'
Ridin' in my Coupe DeVille
Pimpin', chrome on the spokes and grill
Pimpin', tell them what I taught you girl
Purse first, ass later
I be pimpin'
Ridin' in my Coupe DeVille
Pimpin', chrome on the spokes and grill
Pimpin', tell them what I taught you girl
Purse first, ass later
I be pimpin'

I am simply what you call a P.I.M.P
You could never go broke when your G tight like me
You wanna ride with the King of New York maybe
Get your money up, choose a pimp, and we can talk baby
They say the games to be sold, not told
I sprinkle a lil shit in my lines, it's hot tho
You see the bitches I fuck with, you know its real
I sweat 'em 'til I get em man, I stay on they heels
Fuck a parkin' lot
Everywhere I'm at, I'm pimpin'
Sunshine, rain, sleet or snow, mane
When I'm around, niggas handcuff they dames
I fuck 'em and send 'em home and they don't love 'em the same
See my face on MTV, the mood just changed
She suddenly doesn't want you touchin' her mane
I had the same affect on broads before the fame
Queen's track hustler point, niggas know me mane
You might also like
I be pimpin'
Ridin' in my Coupe DeVille
Pimpin', chrome on the spokes and grill
Pimpin', tell them what I taught you girl
Purse first, ass later
I be pimpin'
Ridin' in my Coupe DeVille
Pimpin', chrome on the spokes and grill
Pimpin', tell them what I taught you girl
Purse first, ass later
I be pimpin'

I can see it in her eyes, she tired of the average life
Fuckin' with me, so subject to the lavish life
Follow instructions, baby the sky's the limit
If you believe, you get to see and achieve
But first, pass the weed
I was born to be a baller
Niggas be hatin' on a kid, I can't call it
I could be everything you need, the shoulder you lean on
The one that you talk to, the one that you keen on
If you're attractive, we get to thumpin' for awhile
If you listen long enough, I'll send some humor, make you smile
Got you outta pocket, now bitch go on choose a pimp
Doc blew me, lost my momma, I've been pimpin' ever since
I'm a special kinda nigga, girl can't you see?
I talk my way out the hood on to your TV
I make changing your life appear so easy
But you gotta be 'bout your paper if you're rollin' with me
Let's go
I be pimpin'
Ridin' in my Coupe DeVille
Pimpin', chrome on the spokes and grill
Pimpin', tell them what I taught you girl
Purse first, ass later
I be pimpin'
Ridin' in my Coupe DeVille
Pimpin', chrome on the spokes and grill
Pimpin', tell them what I taught you girl
Purse first, ass later
I be pimpin'

I'm from a bottom from a bottom goin' to take it to the top
If you think we can't do it nigga watch as
We go to all the way to a drop
From a lil to a lot, put a touch up and we got it
She's far from average
She's a special lady
She'll do anything for me and that drives me crazy
We get our grind on
I let her blow on my dice
Then my luck change, I hit the h right twice
It's simple, it's mental, she down for me
When there's no one around, she's around for me
She's my sunshine after the rain, my joy after the pain
It's easy to comprehend, simple and plain
I be pimpin'
Ridin' in my Coupe DeVille
Pimpin', chrome on the spokes and grill
Pimpin', tell them what I taught you girl
Purse first, ass later
I be pimpin'
Ridin' in my Coupe DeVille
Pimpin', chrome on the spokes and grill
Pimpin', tell them what I taught you girl
Purse first, ass later
I be pimpin'Embed
