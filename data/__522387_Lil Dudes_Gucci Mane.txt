14 ContributorsLil Dudes Lyrics
Two rollies at the same time I'm too cool
Gucci is you locing? Cause that motherfucker crip blue
Soo woo Bentley and the Forgi's soo woo too
And I know two Jews eat a case like it's fast food
I bought a T-rex on these niggas cuz life's cruel
My jewels so cold that you might get the slight flu
Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
You hang from the side line this what your job do
Gang mentality I think like the mob do
Police brutality I'm strapped like a cop fool
My fo-fo's do numbers just like my shows do
My main bitch wanna fuck me just like my hoes do
These suckas say they comin' for me well cook me some soul food
I Mapquest your house and I pull up with a trunk full

Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do

Rick James stoner a party nigga cocaine on the table
Had a foursome with three foreign girls they say they from Australia
I got molly, weed, and liquor, and a bunch of paraphernalia
I'm in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania making these hoes play Punchanella
Punchanella Punchanella made two best friends kiss each other
Eat each other fuck each other fucked her mouth then switch the rubber
On spaghetti junction with a boss that just came from Los Angeles
APD be trying to crucify a G but Gucci's no evangelist
Shootout piece tree woof and Big Meech
I see his mission I dare you to reach
Big dog status don't show me your teeth
 bummy g gon' be pushed with the beef
Innocent people get shot in the street
God blessed them me but Im not with them 
I'm ridin' with the niggas that pulling the triggas
That nigga that rob you they robbin' with me

Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
Birds eye view, I'm looking down at the lil dudes
And if I had to pussy nigga I'd rob you
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do
You wanna see me locked twenty four just like cops do2Embed
