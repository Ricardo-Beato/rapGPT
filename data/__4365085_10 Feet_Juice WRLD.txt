You make me feel, yeah
Uh, I don't wanna try, but I...
So primal, and (Woah)
That's what I am (Woah)
I'm just a man, yeah, yeah, yeah
You make me feel, yeah
So primal, and (Woah)
That's what I am (Woah)
I'm just a man, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh, acidic, a bunch of bad habits with bad magic
Can't disappear and re-appear in the same sentence, I'm bad at it
The Mad Hatter, the Perc packer
The mom thrasher
The Perc mixed with the syrup turn me into a contractor
A straight tweak, so high, I can't speak
Been three weeks, I still haven't met my peak
Like I could be someone other than myself
Like I could find a little Heaven up in my Hell
Yeah, I know it never ever end well
Yeah, I know I always fall victim to a rich spell
Uh, like abracadabra
The flow so raw, forgot to grab Magnums
Been raw-doggin' bitches ever since I went platinum
I feel like Hell full of bad bitches
Wonder if it's room in Heaven for savages
My life's a canvas, I'm paintin' in blood like a cannibal
Rip off his head and I salvage it, huh
A little too graphic
At least you niggas know that I still got the passion
Of someone who don't got shit but the clothes on they back
And it's been that way since way back since
Like I'm a killer or somethin'
These niggas lip-syncin' like Milli Vanilli or somethin'
I'm like Lil' Wayne I got a milli-milli-milli or somethin', I guess
I'm rich in broke pockets, bountiful
My soul's empty, so deep, ten feet
You might also like
Times ten feet
Fuck love, it's gon' take more to convince me, that you with me
And not against me
Where I'm from we load it up
Pop out and turn niggas into mincemeat

Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Strippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too
Booties just don't shake like Priscilla's do
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Strippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too
Booties just don't shake like Priscilla's do
Strippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too
Booties just don't shake like Priscilla's do25Embed
