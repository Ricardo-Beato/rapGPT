I just bought the mall, i just threw it in the bag (uh)
Boujee bitch can't catch her looking at no price tag (uh)
Shawty look as good in the front as the back (uh)
Mami don’t stop until she got them in the bag (uh)
Shawty sing ooh na-na, She act like she Madonna
Material Girl, she got Fendi, she got Prada (prada)
Well If you a fashion killa, I'm gone rock my Margiela
I don't need no stylist, water on me like a swimmer (wet)
Shawty got a little high and now she floating on to me (yeah)
She know I’m a star 'cause see the snakes printed on my jeans (yeah)
I buy diamonds for that shawty if she is a dimepiece (what)
Baby you don't gotta front, you wanna be just like me
Don't lose your focus, live in the moment, girl this the fashion magnum opus, his style is hopeless, he do not own shit
Girl you know that we just got the whole club jumping
Tell me what you rocking if you saucy you gone gone bump this

Baby If you got juice, let your chain hang low
If you got the sauce, let your red bottoms hit the floor
This ain't for no brokebois, Fashionista Galore
I drip on my walk, Fashionista Galore

Now we hotbox the room like we just do not even care
Girl I can barely see you through all the smoke in the air
She take a glance at my chains and start undressing right here
Feeling my chest and running her fingers right through my hair
Look at all of my gucci and louis, hoes start to stare
Stunt so hard on these bitches, yeah you know it isn't fair
I got too many clothes, I got a few I could spare
Yeah, fashionista galore
