32 ContributorsThe Uppercut Lyrics
I wanted to bring back that reality
But nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin Mike Tyson
And I'm a heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga (Right)
That's why its so raw to just watch me battle lions
'Cause I'm a little skinny nigga, battlin' niggas three times my size (My size)
Watch this uppercut, here it come
Watch the jab nigga (Uh), uh
Here it come, look out, watch my armsâ€”

Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece
Comin' equipped with some shit niggas just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve, now kamikaze
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body (Body, haha)
My middle finger to you ho niggas
Run up on me, and I'll be forced to let it go, nigga (Go, nigga)
I ain't the one you wanna try, why? Stayin' high
Hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Who's runnin' these streets? I sell that cocaine
'Cause in the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke, man
Another hustler makin' major cash
'Til the punk police come raid your ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time
And its a bitch 'cause the judge gave you eight years
You doin six and we know that you can't hang
You a trick rolled over, turned snitch like a bitch
You might also like
Now you know you should have ducked, nigga
Got you fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up, nigga?
Now you know you should have ducked, nigga
Got you fallin' from this uppercut, fucked, so what's up, nigga?

They got a nigga in the dice game
I'm feelin' lucky but the nigga's just a little bigger (Bigger)
He tryin' fuck me out my cash, I'ma blast, nigga
He don't know, I gotta tell you, like the last nigga
Gotta go, no need to run for the trunk, I get 'em up
Left to right, my uppercut'll hit 'em up (Hit 'em up)
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggas, but I ain't puttin' down my Glock
The gunshots rang when I lose nigga, and, ooh, nigga
I'ma show you not to ever play a true nigga (Haha)
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rappin', motherfucker, we can do this

Now you know you should have ducked, nigga
Got you fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up, nigga?
Now you know you should have ducked, nigga
Got you fallin' from this uppercut, fucked, so what's up, nigga?
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent (Shh)
Roll on our enemies, beat 'em at they own game
Molotov cocktails, releasing up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rearview, thinkin' 'bout the payback
Wanna see my kids grow, don't know if I'ma make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto (Ghetto)
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push your middle fingers up, nigga, if you a rebel
Have your face down, goin' in ya pockets if ya let 'em
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget 'em
I done made so many mistakes, but still I don't regret 'em
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends, and the felons
We all lost souls tryna find our way to heaven (To heaven)

Now you know you should have ducked, nigga
Got you fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up, nigga?
Now you know you should have ducked, nigga
Got you fallin' from this uppercut, fucked, so what's up, nigga?

Yeah, yeah
To all the comrades no longer with us
See you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin'
Give these cowards the uppercut
'Til we get up there with y'all, you know
Thug life, we still livin' it
Outlaw for life, in the name of the Don
Let's go, woo17Embed
