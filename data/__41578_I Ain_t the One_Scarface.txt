11 ContributorsI Ainâ€™t the One Lyrics
WC, Facemob, Southside, Westside
C'mon now, ah c'mon now
Don't stop (screamin' my name) don't stop
Southside, Westside, Facemob, WC
C'mon now, c'mon now, c'mon now, c'mon now

I ain't the one, one that's getting jacked for his flicky
And he who fucks wit me, gets the itchy
That nina nicky, two times, flicky flicky
And now you got a hole in your head lookin' sickly
I ain't the one, that's getting jacked for his deuce-deuces
Or slapped toothless, ya do what you're doin'
So what you got a .40 Cal, I got a .40 Cal
Plus another .40 Cal with that
Any nigga plus the niggas that he run with
Don't make me up this motherfucker on some dumb shit
I ain't the one, I'm just as loony as the next dude
You fuck with me and I'mma send your ass to Neptune
You can only hate me, dog, but you can't play me, dog
You best respect Facemob, bitch, 'cause I ain't the one

C'mon now, ah c'mon now
It don't stop
(Screamin' my name)
It don't stop
What they want now?
What they want now?
What they want now?
(Screamin' my name)
C'mon now, c'mon now, ah c'mon now
(Way in the back I hear 'em screamin' my name)
You might also like
I am the one to say I ain't the one then tug it, take dick and suck it
Sell you under 'em thangs without putting cum on it, fuck it, bitch
I'mma ghetto nigga, six fo' pedal nigga
From Bed Stuy to the Southside, the Westside nigga
Well knowin to make the trigger jerk, push them twenty three's in the dirt
Run with niggas who got that work, from patient pills to pushin syrup
Heavens to Murgatroyd, da-da-da-da off the bionic
It's WC and Face back on them 'draulics
And we blazing no stems, and like my nigga Shaquille O'Neal
I keep Dayton logos, hangin' on the center of rims
And hot ones, and these side guns will get you touched up
And if you think I'm just a rapper, bitch, you got me fucked up
I ain't no nigga to be chasing no bitch, licking her toes
Sharing ice cream cones
So play like the group Ideal, bitch, and get on
I'm a front-line pusher, for the cheese, I stay on the defense
Stay by the lane and the gutter, bitch, I ain't no sucka
Not the one

C'mon now, ah c'mon now
It don't stop
(Screamin' my name)
It don't stop
What they want now?
What they want now?
What they want now?
(Screamin' my name)
C'mon now, c'mon now, ah c'mon now
(Way in the back I hear 'em screamin' my name)
I ain't the one, that's gettin' chased on from high school
I love to squabble, nigga, that's what I do
I'm always on detention, I ain't give a fuck
Mr. Lee can suck a dick and leave addicted to nut
I ain't the one, to let a nigga disrespect me
Or try to check me, get the wet T
Down with WC 'cause I'm a hood cat
Fuck a fine bitch but I prefer a hood rat
I love my Grey Goose, I like my blunts long
Don't get it fucked up, I come on wit' the come on
A hella cool dude, but rubbed the wrong way
I'm a dangerous nigga, say what the song say
I live it and breathe it, I shit it and eat it
I ain't never been defeated, punked out, retreated
I'mma low key, OG, from OZ's, to whole ki's
I ain't the one, duck and hide from the homeboy
Hit the neighborhood, let's get it on, boy
Let's throw a barbeque, or we can blow dank
If you don't smoke weed, then we can have dranks
'Cause y'all the homeboys, that kept the man fed
It's disrespectful not to come back and share it
So all you rappers hanging with you posses and clicks
Hit the streets and show your homies some love, they buying your shit

C'mon now, ah c'mon now
It don't stop
(Screamin' my name)
It don't stop
What they want now?
What they want now?
What they want now?
(Screamin' my name)
C'mon now, c'mon now, ah c'mon now
(Way in the back I hear 'em screamin' my name)Embed
