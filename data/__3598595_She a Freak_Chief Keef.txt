She a freak, she a freak
She a freak, she a freak
She a freak
She just wanna fuck me everyday of the week, she a freak
She a freak, she a freak

She a freak
That bitch wanna fuck me everyday of the week, she a freak
That bitch call me everyday of the week, she a freak
Goddamn, that bitch a freak, a freak, freak

She a freak
Said she wanna fuck me everyday of the week 'cause my pockets obese
Bitch, you really just wanna get some of this cheese
But I'm leanin' off a 4 right now, I'm higher than a mothafuckin' leaf
I just bought a QP of dirt right now, I feel higher than a mothafuckin' ceilin'
This bitch tricked me off, I think she off some leaf, she only wanna freak
But I only want some mothafuckin' knee-knee, say she only want me
But I know with that mouth she do a lot of things
It's a lesson in life I can teach you baby, how to do it with a nigga like me

She a freak
That bitch wanna fuck me everyday of the week, she a freak
That bitch call me everyday of the week, she a freak
Goddamn, that bitch a freak, a freak, a freak
She a freak
That bitch wanna fuck me everyday of the week, she a freak
That bitch call me everyday of the week, she a freak
Goddamn, that bitch a freak, a freak, a freakYou might also like4Embed
