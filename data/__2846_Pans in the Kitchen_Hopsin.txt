Stop and listen
I'll rock it wicked, no competition on the shit
You gotta get it, there's nothing hotter than it
A wack rapper's what Hopsin isn't, I'll kick it to ya
If you got a minute, you'll bob your head like a walking pigeon
Play my position, I'm kinda different when rhymes is kickin'
I got lots of this, I vibe to it as I rock a fitted
The amount of people that's feeling me is a high percentage
They know I'm tight, but I'll be conceited if I admit it
I'ma clown the game until I'm up at the top of it
And don't be chicken to call me out if you got a problem with it
Unsilenced shit is gon' get you stuck in some violent shit
And feelings will be hurt so you're better off if you mind your business
Don't get it started, with that nigga Marcus, that kid retarded
It's gon' evolve to some ruckus, he'll prove your shit is garbage
He'll be the illest artist, realist on this rap
All you niggas out there wanna get him on your tracks

Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
You might also likeI like playing with the pans in the kitchen, mama
You gon' let me play with the pans in the kitchen, mama
Don't care what you say about the pans in the kitchen, mama
I'ma prove that I'm the man in the kitchen, mama!

I used to push weight on the block
A fat bitch, she was barely able to walk
She was good for one thing, that was taking a cock
'Til she told me she was pregnant, shit I'm thankful to God
That she wasn't, 'cause all that shit was making me hot
I'm happy that she ain't the one to have a baby with Hop
She's so obese, I'd take her out and make her stay in the car
Her body odor always smelling like some bacon and farts
I'd tell her how I don't eat pork, she took it straight to the heart
Ready to make an assault, she need to make her fucking way to the barn
'Cause that's where she belong, better leave me alone
Calling, asking where I'm at like she need to know
Oh, what a surprise, she thinking I'm the love of her life?
Becoming my wife? Bitch, take some fucking advice
You wanna look nice? Trust me I'm right
Go to the motherfucking gym and lose the gut and you're fine

Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
I like playing with the pans in the kitchen, mama
You gon' let me play with the pans in the kitchen, mama
Don't care what you say about the pans in the kitchen, mama
I'ma prove that I'm the man in the kitchen, mama!

I'm Marcus and yes, I am stupid
Thought I was a smart kid? Guess again, stupid
I'm a special ed student
Give me a couple of bars and let the man prove it
'Cause there's evidence to it
I never knew it, but the rest of my class knew it
They must've thought I'd never remember the past to it
Fuck school, man, I never could pass through it
I never be that student that headed to class who gets an A
Up on his report card, a nice kid who's so smart
Seem like when they threw me in special ed It got more hard
Every year the cycle repeats over again
My friends graduate and I'm way older then them
Then they come to me, nice mugging me, making fun of me
What do these ugly motherfuckers be thinking when they fuck with me?
They lucky I don't suddenly go and become something other than me
Like a fucking psycho, then what's it gonna be?

Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
I like playing with the pans in the kitchen, mama
You gon' let me play with the pans in the kitchen, mama
Don't care what you say about the pans in the kitchen, mama
I'ma prove that I'm the man in the kitchen, mama!
