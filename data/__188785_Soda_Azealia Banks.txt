42 ContributorsSoda Lyrics
Tried to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh
I'm tired of trying to try not to cry and
I say soda, soda !
Tye dye O'er
I roll the dye
I coast, I dose, I...

A smile a guise
I'm trying to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh
I might survive the nighttime, I might die
I say soda soda, I'm a high roller
Yo sir I pose for the poster- Yep!
Icy Cola Coca, Sprite I love the most-a!
I ride rollercoasters! I try all the cultures!
A smile, a guise
Nighttime, is mine to lie eyes awide and I...
I'm tired of trying to try not to cry and...
I say soda !...
I'm lota, yo sir
I ride roller-
I try all the cultures!
Light my swollen smoker
I might comatosa
I once used to be your girl
You might also like
I used to be your girl
I used to be your girl, girl
I used to be your girl
I used to be your girl
I used to be your girl
I used to be your...
(What I wanna do with you)

Been too busy, but I don't wanna deal with you
Been thinkin' 'bout the way you treat me right, yeah...
It's you and me, but I don't wanna deal with you
Been thinking 'bout the way you'll leave me right, here...
Been too busy, but I don't wanna deal with you
Been thinkin' 'bout the way you treat me right, yeah...
It's you and me, but I don't wanna deal with you
Been thinking 'bout the way you'll leave me right, here...

I'm trying to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh
I'm tired of trying to try not to cry and
I say soda, soda
Tye dye O'er, I roll the dye, I coast, I dose, I
