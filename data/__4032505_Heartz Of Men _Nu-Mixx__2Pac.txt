4 ContributorsHeartz Of Men (Nu-Mixx) Lyrics
Hey, Suge, what I tell you, nigga?
When I come out of jail, what I was gonna do?
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right?
Let me see them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars!
Hahahahaha! Yeah, nigga, time to ride!
Grab your bulletproof vest, nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now, me and (Quik) finna show you niggas
What it's like on this side â€” the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now, the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now, everybody keep your eyes on the prize
'Cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends, but, in real life, they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life, they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life, those niggas will be snitches
It's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all gotta be careful about who you fuck with
And who you don't fuck with, 'cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1, it's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, every one of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary, niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothin' more I despise than a liar, cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker, why these devils left me free?
I proceed to make 'em shiver when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a worldwide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere, Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waitin' for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors, but I'm infinite, Immortal Outlaw
Switchin' up on you ordinary bitches like a southpaw: you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a G
I rip the crowd, then I start again, eternally, I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The hearts of men

The hearts of men
("Hell motherfuckin' yeah")

My lyrical verge with so much pain, to some niggas, it hurts
My guns bust, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw, and five-o
Get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G to this until the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down, thought I'd rot in jail
Paid bail, well, a nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if you let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number, then start again
Don't have no motherfuckin' friends
Nigga, look inside the hearts of men
In the hearts of men
In the hearts of men
In the hearts of men

To all my niggas engaged in makin' money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer livin' in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced that this is my year like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is havin' problems, open fire and bomb
I died and came back, I hustle with these lyrics
As if it's a game of crack, thuggin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowin'
Scarred up but still flowin', energized and still goin'
Uhh, can it be fate, that makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous-ass cowards 'cause they evil and fake?
What will it take? Give me that bass line, I'm feelin' bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent, 'cause I've been sent, the hearts of men

("Hell motherfuckin' yeah")
Yeah, nigga, that's how we do it on Death Row
Y'all niggas feel me then you can rewind this and play it back, baby
That's why we give it to you, 'cause we know you love it
That's from your nigga Pac, throwin' that real shit to you every time
Keeping it rough, rugged and raw
Fuck a Delores Tucker, baby, you know?
That ain't never stopped a motherfuckin' thang
Money gotta get made, niggas gotta be real
Ayy, the streets don't stop though, baby; it don't stopEmbed
