4 ContributorsWhen I Look in Your Eyes Lyrics
Hey
Uh-huh
Well, all right
How y'all doing?
Yes, ma'am
Looking mighty fine

I've been around the world
Seen so many pretty girls
But I still get overwhelmed
When I look in your eyes

Been from Maine to Spain
But everything seems the same
I only feel the change
When I look in your eyes

I know you're upper-class
I know you've got pizzazz
Every man wanna kiss yo'...
And I do too
You might also like
Sometimes I'm just a clown
And everybody puts me down
I guess I'll come around
When I look in your eyes

Tell me what's a man to do
To get close to you
I'm just a lonely fool
When I look in your eyes

Don't tell me no this time
If you do, it'll blow my mind
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
It's an awful thing

I guess it's time to say goodbye
But I gotta give it one more try
I'm only satisfied
When I look in your eyes

Ooh, please come home with me
Ooh, don't you wanna marry me?
I'm even gonna rub your feet
When they stink
(How can...)
How can I let you down?
I guess I'm always gonna be around
I'm simply astounded
When I look in your eyes1Embed
