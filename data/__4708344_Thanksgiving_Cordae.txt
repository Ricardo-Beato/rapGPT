It's perfect, okay

Mac and cheese up in the oven‚ grandma finished cookin'
Thanksgiving 'round the corner‚ need banana pudding
Brought you home to mama even though you said I shouldn't
Might not make it to Christmas
But I'm hoping and I'm pushing for a better day
A good day in the making‚ but you never stay
I could say that you fakin' on the real, huh, nigga
Why you fakin' on the real? (Uh‚ yeah, yeah)

You see I brought you home to mama
Introduced you to my cousins
Met my aunties and my uncles
Know they crazy, they be buggin'‚ but
Promise that I got you, didn't bring you here for nothin'
Know we fightin', plus the arguments just lead into the fucking
Though some things never rearrange, I know we needin' change
Altogether through a deeper lane, come through, release the pain
I can be your ibuprofen, keep it real what I be hoping
Know you see all of it's destined, yeah, our shit was highly chosen
By the universe, the stars align, your love is far divine
Plus I'm really glad you keep it G, that shit is hard to find
Not to mention my intentions was always evolving time
Girl, I hope I'm in your future 'cause I know you fall in mine, uh
You might also like
Mac and cheese up in the oven, grandma finished cookin'
Thanksgiving 'round the corner, need banana pudding
Brought you home to mama even though you said I shouldn't
Might not make it to Christmas
But I'm hoping and I'm pushing for a better day
A good day in the making, but you never stay
I could say that you fakin' on the real, huh, nigga
Why you fakin' on the real? (Yeah, yeah)

You see I've always been an overthinker
I've always been the type to analyze
To no surprise that you hold the team up
The way this ship was built, there's no way that the loads could sink us
A humble shawty, model type, walking Vogue demeanor
But anyway, through many days
We on the block where Jenny stays
Honey baked ham with Henny glaze
Abraham inheritance, shawty, we plenty paid
Bonnie Clyde high speed chase, a renegade, but

Mac and cheese up in the oven, grandma finished cookin'
Thanksgiving 'round the corner, need banana pudding
Brought you home to mama even though you said I shouldn't
Might not make it to Christmas
But I'm hoping and I'm pushing for a better day
A good day in the making, but you never stay
I could say that you fakin' on the real, huh, nigga
Why you fakin' on the real? (Yeah)10Embed
