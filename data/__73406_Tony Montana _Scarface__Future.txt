22 ContributorsTony Montana (Scarface) Lyrics
Fucking cockroaches
Muthafuckin’ freebands
Want me to be the bad guy?
Wanna fuckin play?
Cartel nigga!

Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up out my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

I take over the streets, Fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east
Where niggas split your canteloupe
You tell me where you want to meet
I’m coming with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud
I’m laced up to the fucking fo’
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash
Dropping all cash
Gutter to the death of me
I’m sticking to the recipe
Slug, deal with Colombians
I know Sosa
All I got is my balls
And my word, fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put
Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked
Like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie
I gotta stay focused
You might also like
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up out my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

Another shot of Quelo
She'll be coming back to pesos
When your blood in Pedro
It’s hard for hoes to let go
See AK’s ain't no pitch
Nigga I’ll split your tato
Ain’t nothing about me ordinary
I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss
It’s gonna take an army
The world is mine, nigga
You get it if you want it
You fuckin with me, you’ll
Move to Alaska by the morning
You want me to be the bad guy?
Ok, it's on then
Champagne spilling, crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin
She say I ain't playing fair
I’m about to cop a tiger
And put it in the castle
Freebandz accompany it
So nigga it don't matter, aye!
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up out my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

Helicopter in Bolivia, hundred round banana
25 cameras, I done broke the knob off
All white Porsche, you leave me no fuckin choice
Peruvian flight I'm on the way to see my jeweler
Walk inside the bank with so much cash they gone refuse us
Don't nun around dis bitch move unless you get approval
I need a driver to drive me around how I maneuver
I'm so fuckin high right now feel like I'm in Jerusalem
You hollin' A1 A1 cause ain't nun of this gone lose it
Anytime you see me smoking low or smoking super
I would keep it real, I can tell you who the shooter
All this fuckin sauce, I really think I come from Cuba

Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up out my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You wanna play?1Embed
