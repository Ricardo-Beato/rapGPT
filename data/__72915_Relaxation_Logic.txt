74 ContributorsRelaxation Lyrics
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Yeah, alright, yo—

Couple days ago, I met the illest latina
Her demeanor was unexplainable, you shoulda seen her
Thick thighs, nice ass
Body like an hourglass
Didn’t hesitate to break a brother neck
Second, she passed I was like, “What’s up?”
To which she replied, “How you doin’?”
I said, "De nada momma but your beauty I’m pursuin’
And I said "I’m about to win the lottery"
She asks “How?”
I said, “Your seven digits right now” and made her smile
Now we conversing and she feelin’ my style
I can tell by the way she talkin’
That she down to go the mile
Had a couple drinks, now we headed back to her place
The shade of red from her lipstick all over my face
I’m tryin’ to hit it, split it
Baby girl you gonna let me get it?
She said, “Hold up ok, I don’t get down like that”
I said I know beautiful girl
But I get down like that
So let me heat it up, eat it up
Go crazy and beat it up
“Damn Papi, how you even know I like it rough?”
The way you was feelin’ on me
When kissing revealed enough
I wanna scratch you, provoke you
Bite you, choke you
But just a little, bite your legs
Dig up in the middle
“Hold up, wait a secondNigga, you gotta condom?”
Come on beautiful girl, of course, I’ve got protection
I stay with Magnums and I ain’t talkin’ Smith and Wesson
I keep undressin’
Girl I’m about to teach you a lesson
After I hit it she says
“Bobby I have a confession, I think I love you!”
I said "What the fuck?”
Thinkin’ to myself, "Damn, I shoulda never cuff"
Kissed her on the cheek
Hit the lights, then she fell asleep
So I snuck out the bathroom window on the creep, like
You might also like
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
(The next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, yo
The next day, the next day, the next-)

Yeah, yeah, yo
Now I’m out the door
Downtown is where I’m about to go
Got a meeting with my boy Chris about a dope show
So I hail a cab, jump in, but so does some girl
Beautiful, pretty eyes with luxurious curls
I said, “No fair”
She smiled and said, “Why don’t we share?”
What a success, lookin’ at her chest
Thinkin’ if her breasts was a test, she would fail
Fresh tip nails
Type of ass make a brother train of thought derail
As we converse, I could tell that she feelin’ my style
Get the pussy wet, that’s the mission
As long as she listen to my words
Feelin’ on the curves
Only lips I’m thinkin’ bout kissin’ is hers
I can barely fight the urge
Only thing that matter right now
Is these two verbs
I’m talkin’ me and you
So fine, I’d think I’d start seeing you
Her body was a work of art like Hieroglyphics
Too much detail to go into specifics
Now I’m diggin’ shorty
Like an archeologist tryin’ a bone
Searchin’ for a queen to take the throne
The type of girl to love
And call her my own
I’m just a bachelor (bachelor)
Looking for a bachelorette
Baby, maybe you can persuade me
To give you love you couldn’t imagine yet
Kiss you on the neck then I sedate the pussy like a vet
Got the shorty rollin’ like a movie set
Take her to the Rio
I’m not talking about G-burg
I’m talking De Janeiro, spend dinero like its reverb
Expansion
Couple kids runnin' round the mansion
Day dreamin’, getting ahead of my self
Advancin’, but, come on, girl
Now come and give me love
I know we just met but romance is like a drug
You know we go together
Like sympathy and hugs
So I write this girl a symphony
And tell her that I love her everything
Girl, I love your everything
You know I love your everything
I said I love your everything
Yeah, love your everything
Girl, I love your everything24Embed
