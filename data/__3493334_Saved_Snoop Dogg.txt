3 ContributorsSaved Lyrics
I found a friend who is all to me
His love, is ever true, so true
I love to tell how he lifted me
And from his grace, came through for you

I'm saved by his power, divine
I'm saved by new light, sublime
Life now is sweet and my joy is complete
For I'm saved, saved, saved

Hey you, my joy
Sing it yo

Life now is sweet and my joy is complete

You know that I've been through, whole lotta things in my life
But I know that my god, my god, my god, my god
He gives me joy
My life is complete
Can't nobody do it like him
No, no, no, no, no he's my
 (x3)
My life- yeah
Cause I'm saved
Yeah
Oh my god
Yes, he saved me
Heaven saved for his grace
Oh yeah, and his mercy
I'm saved
Yeah
