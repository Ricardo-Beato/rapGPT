20 ContributorsWe Did It Lyrics
For everybody that said that I wouldn't make it
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
I want you to know
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
I need you to know
For everybody that said we couldn't do it
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
Oh, we did it
We did it
We did it
We did it, we did it

So for everyone talking down
Anybody who makes you frown
Let them know that's it's possible
Oh, it's possible
'Cause if they ever knock you down
Get up and let them know you finna run the town
Let them know that you got next
Tell them you got now
'Cause you good now
Don't waste time, do it right now
'Cause I did it, and you can do it
You might also like
For every teacher that said that I wouldn't do shit
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
I want you to know
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
I want you to know
To the youngins that be down on this
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
To the manager at McDonalds that fired me
I need you to know, we did it
Oh, I need you to know, we did it, we did it

Never take negativity from nobody
Stand tall hold your head high
Stand tall hold your head high
Reach for the sky
I never take negativity from no one
Can't nobody tell you no
Never stop, always go
Head down your own road
Never give a fuck, do it if you want to do it
That's what you gonna do pursue it, just do it
'Cause we did it, we did it, we did it

We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We did it
We did it, we did it, we did it2Embed
