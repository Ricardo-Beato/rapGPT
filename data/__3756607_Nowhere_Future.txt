18 ContributorsNowhere Lyrics
This beat here is the realest part
(Baby J)
Sometimes you get vulnerable for
(Tequila shots)
Romance and love
Is it true?
You can't be doing no lying

Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere

Homie said "go get the 'Rari"
I'ma get the yorki tomorrow
I get a yacht master, you get a yacht master
I treat you like you a model
We go to Turks, we can go to Aspen
Or we can go back to Cabo
If you been telling me personally girl look like you hit the lotto
One thing about it, don't lose your composure
Finish pilates and hop out the Rover
63 G-Wagon, I'm gettin' older
You get the full attention from my comrades and all my soldiers
Cartier down to the rocks
I got a key to your box
You got that chinchilla box
Meet me at the dealership box
All that drip drip drop
Make a nigga bands go pop
You get invited on a yacht
We making love on the spot
You throw Phillipe to the sky
Keep it elite for your guy
They can't speak to the pie
Make a nigga reach for the fire
Audemars, mi casa
Hear the hoes goin' bye bye
Can't fuck up my time
You might also like
Can't fuck up my time
You've been on my mind
Your job don't make up a dime to mines
I made you quit when the time was right
Telling me no is like hurting me
Telling me yes brings out the best in me
You can't be doing no lying

Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere

Glass walls in the room, let 'em watch me make love to you
Passion compassion while I keep in touch with you
Pretty as ever, I thank your momma for blessing me
Joking with your father cause you're part of my embassy
Put you as an opponent, make my ex girl mess with me
That Ferrari Spider, girl fuck all your enemy
Giving your pussy away girl is gon' fuck up my legacy
Maybe it's my intuition, could be jealousy

Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go...
I 'can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go nowhere
Can't let you go...
Glass walls in the room, let 'em watch me make love to you
Passion compassion while I keep in touch with you
Pretty as ever, I thank your momma for blessing me
Joking with your father cause you're part of my embassy
Put you as an opponent, make my ex girl mess with me
That Ferrari Spider girl fuck all your enemy
Giving your pussy away girl is gon' fuck up my legacy
Maybe it's my intuition, could be jealousy

Can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go...
I can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go nowhere
I can't let you go...1Embed
