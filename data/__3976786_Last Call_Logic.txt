85 ContributorsLast Call Lyrics
Ayo real talk, 6ix
As soon as you played me this joint, I already knew
I was like, "Yo, this some fucking, 'Last Call' shit"
And it got me hella excited 'cause I always wanted to do like
A "Last Call," I remember the first time I heard Kanye's
I thought that shit was so tight, dawg
And I was like, man I'm tryna tell my story, you know what I'm sayin'?
And then uh, I remember Cole did it, when did he do it?
He was on Friday Night—
Nah, nah, he did it on The Warm Up yo
And when he did the "Last Call" on The Warm Up, I was like "Damn, I'm tryna do mine"
So since—since this joint got that vibe, I'ma do my own "Last Call" right now for y'all
And my voice is messed up too, this is the last track of Young Sinatra

Yeah, yeah
Back in the day I wasn't shit, homie
Penny pinchin', I couldn't even pay the rent, homie
Thinkin' 'bout it I wonder where them years went, homie
Just a youngin' tryna survive, they was hatin' on me
I was working that nine-to-five, I was waitin', homie
I was bussin' tables fantasizin' 'bout cakin', homie
Letting 'em slip away my dreams, wasn't waitin' on me
This for anyone with ambition, calling anybody that'll listen
I'm wishing all your dreams come true, 'cause mine did
And yeah, you know I had to put that in the rhyme kit
But that shit came from sacrifice
Not on the corner selling drugs and smackin' dice (Listen)
Yeah
You might also like
Someway, somehow, I understood finally
If you want to come and get it, you know where to find me
'Cause I ain't got no time for anybody that be tryin' me
Know if they don't understand, I'ma leave 'em behind me
Obviously
I ain't got no time, no, no
I said obviously
I said I don't got no time, no, no, no, no, no

Yeah, yeah
I treat the beat like it's my only son, my DNA
And this that Southernplayalistic shit like we was in the A
Back in the day, I was Young, Broke & Infamous
A Young Sinatra that was Undeniable
Who Welcome-d you To Forever while Under Pressure
And told you The Incredible True Story of Bobby Tarantino
And Everybody in the Ultra 85
Goddamn, it feel good to be alive
And all these bitches that I passed up
Couldn't fuck witcha 'cause your hair was too gassed up
'Member creeping with the gat, masked up

God damn, it's kinda crazy to reminisce on all this shit man
What it was like growing up
Damn man, just, motherfuckers running in and out of the crib
Doing drugs, selling drugs, all types of stuff
Meanwhile, I was just tryna keep it together
I was tryna make sense—sense of all this shit around me
I didn't know how to take it, how to perceive it, you know what I mean?
And then meanwhile I'm supposed to be going to school and getting good grades and shit
But I'm seeing like, domestic violence in my house
And just, so much going on
And I'm sure everybody was probably like, "Man, yo"
"Why little Bobby didn't come to school today?"
On the real, I was doin' anything to run away
And that's the same reason kids join gangs every day
'Cause they wanna be accepted, but at home they too neglected
Meanwhile, white America quick to call him a thug
But all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love
Tell him that he love him, that he need him
Promise he won't ever leave him
Never smoke crack, never lie, and won't never beat him
It feel like for my life I been needed a break
Looking at my family, I ain't wanna make the same mistake
And I know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin' great
Oh God, please
Can I have a conversation with a member of my family without it ending asking me for five G's?
To pay they bills or they lawyer fees (Huh)
I learned something, I ain't giving y'all a dime
I'll give you something worth more—that's my time
I ain't dropping stacks, I'm dropping knowledge
Unless it's for my nieces and nephews to go to college
And hit me on the phone, hit me up
Like, "Uncle Bob, where you at?
Yeah, I know your pockets fat but I don't give a fuck 'bout that
I'm glad we family" (Uh)
We a half-breed family, yeah, yeah, uh
Man, see, I remember when I was like fifteen years old
And my dad took me to the studio
I know this is random, I'm tryna take you guys through it, right?
And, I'll never forget it, I had like eight rhyme books
He'll tell you—he'll tell you, man
I just, I went through them motherfuckers
I was rapping for like fifteen minutes straight
And that was my first time, yo
I was like tenth grade, in the studio
And I knew that this was what I wanted to do
I knew it

I knew it ever since I first saw Kill Bill
I been flowin' like that blood, Uma Thurman spilled
None other than the RZA, yeah he did the soundtrack
And then I discovered Wu-Tang soon as I found that
And then Big L, Mos Def, and Nas, it wasn't no turning back
I couldn't change it if I tried, homie, how 'bout that?
See, I'm a student of the game, so simple and plain
But I'ma take it back to before I ever sat first class on a plane
I was in College Park, right?
Well I guess, technically, if you wanna go before that
I was uh, I was living in Germantown
Uh, nah, actually it was Montgomery Village
Back in Maryland, I was living in my sister's basement
And then some shit happened, you know, she kicked me out
It was Christmas, whatever, I love you Genie
Anyway, so shit happened, and then I just kept it pushing
You know, I was homeless for a little while, whatever, you know
I went, uh, I stayed at my—my mentor's house, Solomon
Uh, and then I stayed back at my—my godparents' house
Mary Jo and Bernie, I love y'all
Uh, Mary Jo, I'm sorry, back when I used to smoke
I would steal the shit out of your cigarettes
I love you, I'm sorry about that, but
You remember—always she would let me record
I'd always be recording in the attic or wherever I could, so
I love you—thank you for supporting me there
But then, she was like, "You gotta get the fuck outta here" too
After a while, she gave me some time
But like, I was twenty years old at this point
She was like, "Nah, you gotta get the fuck outta here and do something with your life"
And this was right around the time that I opened up my first show ever for Ghostface Killah man
In Gaithersburg, right in Old Town
The shit was insane, I'll never forget it
And that's where I met my boy Lenny, Big Lenbo, wassup!?
That's right, man, we just started kicking it and hanging
He lived in College Park, and before I knew it I was living—I was living with him in his basement
And this was right around the time I met 6ix
And 6ix was going to the University of Maryland at the time, which was right down the street
So I'd always go to their dorm room
I remember—there was nights I would just crash in the dorm when we was making beats
We was doing all types of shit man
When we first got out, we did the first Young Sinatra
And now we on the fourth Young Sinatra, motherfucker! That shit is crazy man
And I remember like, I used to steal quarters from Lenny just so I could go to the 7-11 to eat
And he was like, "You idiot, why are you stealing? Just ask me, bro" And I was supposed to get a job, I was—see, I was sleeping in, uh, his basement on the couch
Which is the—the, the cover to my first album, Under Pressure
Shout out Cathy, shout out the Rosado family, all my beautiful brown people!
We made it, it's crazy
But nah, nah, listen, I'm getting ahead of myself, I'm getting ahead of myself
So like, I was staying with him and I was supposed to get a job, right?
And he was like, "Yo, you gotta get a fucking job, bro"
Things were going so good with the music that we kinda stopped talking about it
It seemed like every week something new was happening
And I just sat him down one day and I was like, "Look bro, I—please, like, can you just give me one year, like just give me one year, man, let me put everything into this, and if I don't get it, fuck it, I'll just submit, and I'll just—I'll just blend into society."
And he was like, "Bro I'ma give you one year"
And for one year him, his family, all the homies, Benny, everybody man!
They took care of me, they put—he put clothes on my back, he put food in my stomach
You know, he helped me with microphones, and recording
And yo, almost a year to the fucking day bro, I signed to Def Jam
And my man, he was a land surveyor, out there like making sure all the buildings get built
Rain, snow, sleet, all that shit for twelve years, dawg!
And when I signed my deal I said, "Fuck that! Quit your job, we're moving to LA!"
This shit was crazy, so we get to LA
We're staying off Coldwater Canyon
Alta Mesa, in Studio City, man
And I'm going to the studio with No I.D. every day
And uhh, like, shit is crazy
That's the first time I met Cole, yo shout out Cole, that's my fucking boy
Big Sean, all these homies, man, that I met, it was crazy
Don Cannon, everybody
That's when I first met Kev
Bobby, my engineer—what up Bobby?
It was just like, life was insane
I dropped, uh, Young Sinatra: Undeniable, and that was crazy
That was insane, 'cause that was the first time

Me and my boys ever hit the road
On the real, you know we went from zero to overload
Performing in front of the fans, had they hands waving
This is all I ever wanted, this is all I'm craving
Me and my boy Chris shocked the game
Two visionaries on a mission, shit ain't been the same
Some ups and downs came around, had a lot of problems
But no matter what happen, you know we'd always solve 'em
Yeah, we'd always solve 'em, like

Man, it's kinda crazy thinking about it though
Like, so much has happened yo
And I mean shit, by the time y'all are hearing this, I'm 28
I'm 27 while I'm recording it
I mean, right now, literally, I'm working on Bobby Tarantino, Ultra 85, Young Sinatra IV
And a whole bunch of other shit, man this is crazy!
Acting, writing, like
I'm just—I'm just so, I can't believe I'm here, man
We grinded for so long, we worked for so long, yo
And motherfuckers, they hate you, man
They try to make me feel bad about how I look, how I speak
How I rap, how I act, my race, my everything
They just—they, they fucking hate you man
They'll hate you when you're in this position
But you can't let 'em—you can't let 'em, you can't let that shit get to you man
Continue to persevere, continue to be the best you you can be 'Cause I'm here right now man, best friends
I got everything I could ever want man
Even though you always want more deep down
And you got goals deep down, that's great man, but fuck that shit
I'm so happy, I'm so blessed, man
So if you're listening to this right now
No matter how old you are, how young you are
Whether you on the school bus headed to get your education
Or you driving home from work pissed off at your boss
Just, man, just please do what you love in life
So many people, they always say, how, "Oh, you know, I would do this—but," or "I can't, because"
And you already fucking lost, they lost
And I feel bad for that person 'cause that person will never make it "I would, but I don't have the money," "I would, but I don't have the time"
Fuck that, you gotta do it man
You gotta do what makes you happy
You have to live selfishly in that aspect
Stop worrying about others, stop freaking out
Just focus on yourself, man, and your own happiness
That's the realest thing
And that's all I can tell you, because
You can't help anybody else until you can help yourself, you know what I'm saying?
So please, put the—put the mask on first, like they say on the airplane, cuz
Put your—put your own motherfucking mask on
And go do it man
Go do it, just live your life

I love y'all, thank you so much for tuning in
Uh, I hope you've enjoyed this Young Sinatra experience, I know I have
Uh, this is prolly gon' be the last one though
Uh, this gon' be the last one for sure
I'm coming back with some fun, but, I don't know
I love you guys! Ultra 85's gonna be crazy! I mean, crazy! Bobby Tarantino's that trap shit, woo!
We took 'em back with this boom bap
Now we, we finna head to the future
We ain't scared, we makin' music for everybody, you know what I mean?
I love y'all—look at that Murrland accent coming out
I don't know why, every time I get on the mic that Murrland accent
"Go ahead 'cuh," "jah like" all day, boy, you sound like Wale, back of your neck, haha
I love y'all so much
RattPack
