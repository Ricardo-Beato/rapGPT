Hey, baby

What's up?

What do I gotta do to get a tip-dance?

Psht... you know what you gotta do... ya know gimme some head...
Naw, I'm just fuckin' with ya, baby, I'm just fuckin' with ya...
Just go get two of your friends
And tell the DJ to play somethin' long and slow...

Alright, babyYou might also likeEmbed
