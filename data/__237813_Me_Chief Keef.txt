32 ContributorsMe Lyrics
I got a bitch, she is from Italia
Smoking on this earth, this gas and shit, it be filling me up
You think it's your time, but it could be up
That's why I got a thirty on me, nigga try me, it could be up
Tell Tadoe slow ass pour a four of the lean
I love the guap like I love Kay Kay, it's like my daughter to me
Shit, my bank account looks like Norbit to me
Say you gettin' guap, nigga, show it to me, or try me

Like Tony Montana, who I trust? Me
But it's still more Sosa and less Tony
I know niggas plottin', I know they want me, but this hammer on me
I got some niggas in the cut ready to blam you, homie
And they don't give a fuck about your family, homie
Bitch, I'm glo'd all up, put the cameras on me
Bitch, I'm Almighty Sosa, no Capone, no Meech
I glo niggas up, get them guns and they gon' be blowing for me
I was trying to disguise, how'd you know it was me?
You got a pistol, nigga, blow it at me, you know I'm flexing

I got a bitch, she is from Italia
Smoking on this earth, this gas and shit, it be filling me up
You think it's your time, but it could be up
That's why I got a thirty on me, nigga try me, it could be up
Tell Tadoe slow ass pour a four of the lean
I love the guap like I love Kay Kay, it's like my daughter to me
Shit, my bank account looks like Norbit to me
Say you gettin' guap, nigga, show it to me, or try me

I walk in the trap, I'm checking the bag, I'm shaking the D
I'm selling the half, I'm selling them fast, they sell it for me
You run in my trap looking for stash, I'm shooting for free
Aim at your chest or shoot at your head, you fall to your knees
Niggas be like, "For a verse from Tadoe, gon' cost me a Jeep"
House look like the mall, took my bitch there and I bought her some D
These niggas, they watching, these bitches, they watching, eyes all on me
Pop out the cut and light his ass up, hope he don't fall on me
Pick my lil' guys up, take their ass shopping and it's all on me
Just came back from another show, all the god damn hundreds on me
Got a club in the back, tell your friends, "Come through", bitch, party on me
I tell that bitch to ride it fast like a Ducati on me

I got a bitch, she is from Italia
Smoking on this earth, this gas and shit, it be filling me up
You think it's your time, but it could be up
That's why I got a thirty on me, nigga try me, it could be up
Tell Tadoe slow ass pour a four of the lean
I love the guap like I love Kay Kay, it's like my daughter to me
Shit, my bank account looks like Norbit to me
Say you gettin' guap, nigga, show it to me, or try me7Embed
