I'm gonna love you all through the morning
I'm gonna love you all through the morning
Yeah, see me goin' where I been, know how you feel
I'm gonna love you all through the morning
I'm gonna love you all through the morning

I see you goin' where I been
I know how you feel, was at the same place you are now in
You shoutin', announcin'
You wanna win with similar minded men, with great business acumen
We can make a acquisition 'til the topic turn from tight pockets to high profits
To life insurance, at what age do we all cop it?
Fuck who the hottest, who really stand up?
Who really messin' with they dead man girl?
That says everything about that man world
Energy transferal, immortality
You against morality, don't comе around me
Homicidal vinyl section wherе they always found me
By the motion picture soundtrack with Richard Roundtree on the album sleeve
That's my era shit
Musical excellence, hot like on a detective list
It's simple shit that's keepin' you from the shift
You a simp, a trick, or in love with your own dick
Distractions, they come in all ways
You might also like
I just keep it calm, watchin' it all play out, like it's supposed to
Old dudes playin' chess in the park
Old dudes playin' chess in prison
Stayin' on good behaviour for extra visits
If they was to switch places, could you tell the difference?
It's perspective, isn't it?
A team that's militant, a down-ass-woman by your side that get it in
The realest, I love this feeling

If you don't have a team that's militant, you better be brilliant
I love this feeling
If you don't have no team that's militant, be mentally equipped
I love this feeling
Watch everybody, that's why I love my team
I love this feeling
Keep calm, but watch everything

It's your monthly subscription to the slums edition
The new It Was Written
Get your hard copies of Blockology
Comin' from the one who lived in a bowl for goldfish
I'll never sell my soul, just evolve shock rap
That what you never been told shit
Cold part, Illmatic all the way through that episode of Ozark
I think that's harder than if I had co-starred
A ghetto symphony, I'm Chief Keef Cozart mixed with Mozart
It's ill when you get bags for your own art
Million-dollar sync for Al Jarreau of rap
But they ain't understand it when it dropped, yo
How cold is that?
They askin' if I'm ever gon' be over rap
But I left a few times, just never told you that
Amassing digital assets
No fiscal year kick-backs, yeah, we cashin'
Physical money, think different, we outlast 'em
We out-class 'em, they made it easy to pass 'em
I love this feelin'
I just keep it calm, watchin' it all play out, like it's supposed to
Old dudes playin' chess in the park
Old dudes playin' chess in prison
Stayin' on good behaviour for extra visits
If they was to switch places, could you tell the difference?
It's perspective, isn't it?
A team that's militant, a down-ass-woman by your side that get it in
The realest, I love this feeling

Everything, we do whatever we want, can't front
Yo, I love this feeling
Gettin' dressed, gettin' fly, just to go to the studio
Ayo, I love this feeling
Ayo, tomorrow I'm juicin', juicin' for the rest of the week
Just because, I love this feeling
And, big bro got his ankle bracelet took off today
Yo, we gettin' on a private jet
I love this feeling (Haha)
Yeah, I love this feeling2Embed
