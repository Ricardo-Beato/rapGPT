4 ContributorsBang Bang Lyrics
This is fucking weed is good Holmes! (Fuck!)
You know, the first time I fuckin' blazed up, eh?
I was listening to those watto's Cypress Hill!
You ever heard of them holmes?
(Yeah, I heard of 'em... They fuckin' suck!)
Are you fuckin' stupid, eh?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Those watto's are feed man, Holmes! (Naaaahhhh!)
You're fuckin' hater, eh?
Don't fuckin', just gonna shoot you, boy! (Whatever...)

This is for those haters and imitators
Take your medicine, you won't like the flavor
The taste ain't sweet, we lace that beef
Never forget how we play in the street
Never forget what you say in the street
If you talk too loud, get laid with the heat
We want that cake and Jay. - You can't stop us
Out the gate we take those dollars
You might also likeGet a crew while we do us some real shit
Me and the dogs we rock steady pushin' the Hill shit
We flip scripts like dough boys clip bricks
Get money like lottery quick picks
We stick with it and homie, I'm quick witted
Still in the game and sane we still spit it
Top level, livin' like a rebel
Settle down bitch while we skip that medal

Remember when you motherfuckers (shot down)
Tried to take what's mine (shot down)
Niggas left me for dead (shot down)
But I'll never forget (shot down)

(Bang, bang) Payback (shot down)
(Bang, bang) Payback (shot down)
(Bang, bang) Payback (shot down)
(Bang, bang) Payback (shot down)
(Bang)

I came up in the game doin' my thang for the paper
Never gon' change, bringin' bang on the haters
They used to gang bang on the corner black came out
Drop then sayin': "Not the world for this flava"
I remember when you niggas used to front on me
Everywhere I ride, kept the gun on me
I only used to listen to my one O.G
He said: "Get money, but stay low key"
So it's a payback with pain in the back
The whole world gettin' high when I say it on the track
And I say it with a gat, I never gon' slip
Fuckin' hit 'em up, if you ever wanna trick
All it takes is a hit and you never forget
When you smoke on the Hill, wanna kill level twist
Fuck a shot, we drinkin' the whole fifth
Then I ride with them killa G's, know we don't miss

Remember when you motherfuckers (shot down)
Tried to take what's mine (shot down)
Niggas left me for dead (shot down)
But I'll never forget (shot down)

(Bang, bang) Payback (shot down)
