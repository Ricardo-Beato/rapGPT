8 ContributorsOver Here Lyrics
 do you like some candle fight and shawty wanna do me
Flicking through the channels, tryna watch these movies
Might pop up on that random guy, hit him with that 
I'm on the corner like a pool stick, rack 'em up, oo shit
Who's this?
It's Quan baby
And Guwop nigga
Trays up in the cab, I used to wop nigga
They like who got figures bigger than Rich Homies
Get selfish bout that money, and leave a bitch lonely

He eves dropping, but we getting money over here
We be poppin, but we gang banging over here
The raindrop that chain swanging over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here
Over here, over here
Over here
Over here, over here
Over here

I sware, in East Atlanta it's a damn shame
These niggas'll kill you for a damn chain
I feel like Tony Montana on that damn caine
Say hello to my little friend, this damn thang
 all I say
Gucci Mane, your ass get sprayed
AK's, got HK's,  crack your vertabray
Don't play, better cooperate, with these niggas, 'cause these niggas don't cooperate with your office
These are the local police
Better bring some power  these niggas over here is thirsty
Young nigga  stop it man, I'm talking bout the worst way
These niggas'll kill your ass on your birthday
I told the scrappers 'cause I ain't finna let no nigga hurt me
It's Gucci!

He eves dropping, but we getting money over here
We be poppin, but we gang banging over here
The raindrop that chain swanging over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here
Over here, over here
Over here
Over here, over here
Over hereEmbed
