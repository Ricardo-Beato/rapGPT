19 ContributorsCBGBâ€™S Lyrics
Beach boy bonanza, sunrise, get up
Surfin' on a curb from inception of a set-up
Planet in black granite, halos above it
The autopsy can't top me, beloved
Dissect survival, passed on a whisper
Placed on the mother who shunned, now it's the
Boys who shot joy inside the violent
Heil from New York where them Rs is silent

This is for the bottom of the deck (Yo, who got squad?)
They call this nigga Little Cochise ('Cause he's a engine, baby)
I rev it like Run, the squint in the sun
I bet you bottom dollar I get louder than a bomb
A pH balance, son, I walk the phenom
Like tightrope, might throw dope in the stash

Crooked counterfeits (We keep it straight cash)
Crooked counterfeits (Keep it straight cash)
Crooked counterfeits (Keep it straight cash)
Crooked counterfeits (Straight cash)

Cash
