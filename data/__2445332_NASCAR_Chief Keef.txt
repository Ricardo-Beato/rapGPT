8 ContributorsNASCAR Lyrics
I drive my car fast, ayy (C4)
I drive my car fast, ayy, ayy

I drive my car fast like a NASCAR
My bitch bad like a Lambo'
I ain't talking 'bout no thot, talkin' 'bout my dope and my nana
911, emergency alert, Amber
Come through, shoot your video up, then pick up the camera
Swear these niggas be copying me, they pick up agendas
You a bitch or a nigga? Pussy, make up your gender
Give a brick to my nigga like, "Be careful what you ask for," ayy

Bitch, I'm Almighty John Cena Casper, ayy
Niggas ain't seeing me, Ray Charles, ayy
Heard you wanna Glo up, you need some lessons, ayy
Gun gon' Glo up, fuck around and blast you
I'm smokin' One Love, you smokin' regular
And I got one gun with dirty ass minds, ayy
And fire, you gon' catch on, ayy
And that, you can bet on, ayy
Pull up on a hot block with a bunch of hot Glocks
Niggas playing hopscotch, givin' niggas tough luck
Smokin' on dope with the top up
Don't make the top drop, givin' niggas hot shots
Bitch wanna fuck me, yeah, I know
But she wan' me to wife her, and I ain't 'bout that
Tryna set Almighty up, bitch, that's like tryna set up Batman, ayy
I was always told be careful what you ask for
Rollin' like a Flintstone, Fred and Wilma
Don't know if I'm goin' home, I'm off the damn drugs
And I ain't got no license, I be doing one-ten in a fifty-five
You might also like
I drive my car fast like a NASCAR
My bitch bad like a Lambo'
I ain't talking 'bout no thot, talkin' 'bout my dope and my nana
911, emergency alert, Amber
Come through, shoot your video up, then pick up the camera
Swear these niggas be copying me, they pick up agendas
You a bitch or a nigga? Pussy, make up your gender
Give a brick to my nigga like, "Be careful what you ask for," ayyEmbed
