What, uh, c'mon.. uh
Keep the change, my nigga, it's too late
(Uh, uh, Young, Neptunes)
It's too late for that
(Young Chris)
Don't gotta to spit that game
Keep the change, my nigga, it's too late for that
(ROC in the building)
Keep the change, my nigga, it's too late for that
(Uh, pimp stroll, pop my collar, hug the block, get dollars)
Keep the change, my nigga, it's too late for that
(Pimp stroll, pop my collar, hug my nuts, bitch holla)

My nigga, please - you ain't signin' no checks like these
My nigga, please - you pushin' no wheels like these
My nigga, please - you ain't holdin' no TECs like these
My nigga, please - you don't pop open vests like these
(My nigga please, uh-huh, uh)
(This my world, pimp stroll, let's do this)

Nigga please, you ain't start out from your trunk
Then reach the roof, just to put your roof in your trunk
Nigga please, chumps don't tour like us
You on the road a million hours, I fly over your bus
Nigga please, you ain't got your neck all froze
With the same logo that you got sketched on your clothes
Nigga please, you don't be getting no hoes
With La Perla on they cheeks, can't be messin with cheap chicks
Nigga please, you seldom seen with chicks in 7 jeans
Manolo Blahnik, I'm goin through they body like an ultrasonic
You ain't got 'em blowin no chronic
Divine intervention, y'all can't prevent me from shinin
Nigga please, I been around the world
I damn near beat Jordan in around-the-world
Nigga please, you can't even hold my shoes
I got wannabes who wanna be me that sound better than you

My nigga, please - you pushin' no wheels like these
My nigga, please - you ain't holdin' no TECs like these
My nigga, please - you don't pop open vests like these

Ahhh! Pimp strollin' on 'em
Black diamonds, rose goldin' on 'em, paper foldin on 'em
Snuck pass the dog noses with the Folger's on 'em
Keys, Saran Wrap with petroleum on 'em
Snitch got pinched but he told it on him
Lawyers got it adjourned, 'til I squeeze 'em on him
There's no witnesses, it's no holdin on him
Just George Jefferson strollin' on 'em, uhh
Nigga please, this is me, this is real as it be
My, videos is like Real TV
That chick, that's me, that 6, that's me
That boat, I had it on the Mediterranean sea
Nigga please

Yo, yo

Y'all coach class, y'all never private jet like we
My nigga please, y'all don't smoke the sour diesel like us
You don't go to Pop and get ya flour cheaper than us
Knock it off in three hours and repeat it like us

Think a nigga outrun or outlast gangrene (GangGreen)
