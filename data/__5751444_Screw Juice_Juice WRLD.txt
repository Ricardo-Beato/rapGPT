I'm apart, I'm exposed
I'm the flaw, hell if I know
I'm the cause, the cuts in the deep wounds
I've made it this far
If I can, then you can too

If I can, then you can too
If I can, then you can too, woo
Been a long fight (Ah), still no truce (Oh yeah)
Been a long night, sippin' on chop and screw juice
She said she wanna screw Juice
Her boyfriend like, "Screw Juice"
Hit her with the ooh-la-la
Then hit him with the doom-doom
Everyday my heart racin', Lamborghini, shit on vroom-vroom
Everyday my heart racin' for no reason, what have I come to?
Yeah, what have I turned to?
A lot of people turned they back on me, what if I turn too?
Man, fuck that shit, I gotta stay true
Sippin' on Actavis in my panic room

I'm apart, I'm exposed
I'm the flaw, hell if I know
I'm the cause, the cuts in the deep wounds
I've made it this far
If I can, then you can too

Drugs in my hand, what I'm gon' do? (Yeah)
I'm a high guy, kinda fly too
Cupid did a drive-by, shot me from the sunroof
Hit a nigga ten times, Gucci shirt, I bled through
Stains, stains, stains, stains, there's blood in the rain
Shame, shame, shame, shame
He used my chest as a firing range
Um, fire away
I'm feeling low, so I feel like I'm gon' get higher today, ayy
Click-clack, fire away
Night crawlin', me and Michael Myers on a double date

I'm apart, I'm exposed
I'm the flaw, hell if I know
I'm the cause, the cuts in the deep wounds
I've made it this far
If I can, then you can too45Embed
