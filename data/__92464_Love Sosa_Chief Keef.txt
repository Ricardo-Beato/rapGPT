I'm tired of motherfuckers in school tellin' me, always in the barbershop
"Chief Keef ain't 'bout this, Chief Keef ain't 'bout that"
My boy a BD, on fuckin' Lamron and them
He, he, they say that nigga don't be puttin' in no work
Shut the fuck up, y'all niggas ain't know shit
All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about
"Chief Keef ain't no hitter, Chief Keef ain't this, Chief Keef a fake"
Shut the fuck up, y'all don't live with that nigga
Y'all know that nigga got caught with a ratchet
Shootin' at the police and shit
Nigga been on probation since, fuckin', I don't know when
Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that
Them niggas savages out there
If I catch another motherfucker talkin' sweet about Chief Keef
I'm fuckin' beatin' they ass
I'm not fuckin' playin' no more
Know them niggas roll with Lil Reese and them
(Young Chop on the beat)
