What Juicy say? He be like, "Shut the fuck up!"
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, raise 'em up, raise 'em up (Swipe)
Drop it off in your fucking face, it's the sawed-off (Hey, yeah)
Gotta get my ass in, gotta get my ass in (Hey)
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, I gotta get some fuckin' in (Hey, hey)

Damn, I want some head but I chose the dough instead
I could never ever let a nigga fuck me out my bread (Ugh)
Ain't no dick alive that could make me lose my mind
Every nigga that done tried still be cryin' on my line (Hey)
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, this is not about your dick
These are simply just instructions on how you should treat my clit
Hey, gotta get my ass ate, gotta make that ass shake
Gotta swipe a nigga card so much they had to call the bank (Ahh)

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Drop it off in his fucking face, it’s the sawed-off
Gotta get my ass ate, gotta make that ass shake
Gotta swipe this nigga card so much they had to call the bank

He said he ain't trickin' (What?)
And he said he ain't lickin' (Ugh!)
Nigga, why you over here with all that little kid shit? (Ayy)
Bitch, I'm not yo' BM or no bitch that beg to see him
He say he gon' knock my head off
I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, just eat it" (Ayy)
Boy, you need me, I don't need you, lil' nigga
Bitch, is you fucking yo' niggas? Then hit 'em
You ain't been up in no pussy this tight
I want a nigga, I know how to get him
Blowin' him off then he blowin' me up
Thinkin' he something, I treat him like nothin'
These niggas know they ain't nothin' to me
Givin' me money or makin' me nut (Ahh)

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Drop it off in his fucking face, it’s the sawed-off
Gotta get my ass ate, gotta make that ass shake
Gotta swipe this nigga card so much they had to call the bank

Flew to LA, hit Rodeo
I been out here makin' queso
I bought all my shit in cash
They treat me like I'm movin' yayo
I go shopping by myself, so they know I don't need a nigga
But you know he breaking bread if you see me with the nigga
I rock shows by myself
Ain't no backup, ain't no help
Ain't no nigga put me on
Ho, I earned all my respect
When you hear my fucking name
Know they speaking on a champ
Everything that I done been through made me who I am right now, ahh

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Drop it off in his fucking face, it’s the sawed-off
Gotta get my ass ate, gotta make that ass shake
Gotta swipe this nigga card so much they had to call the bank
Thirty inches, I'm gon' swing that shit
Copy me, I peep that shit
Popping on my own
I ain't never tried to be a bitch (Ay, yeah)
Ain't no chick alive who can knock me off my grind
Every ho that came and tried
Out here strugglin', looking tired (Ahh)
Going to school, breaking the rules
Patti LaBelle, gotta a new attitude
Bought me a house, ice out my neck
Go to the hood, get my granny the rest
I see those haters, I don't complain
I must be poppin' if they know my name
Bitch I'm a pimp, where is my cane
Ho get too close and get slapped with the ring

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Drop it off in his fucking face, it’s the sawed-off
Gotta get my ass ate, gotta make that ass shake
Gotta swipe this nigga card so much they had to call the bank
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Drop it off in his fucking face, it’s the sawed-off
Gotta get my ass ate, gotta make that ass shake
Gotta swipe this nigga card so much they had to call the bank
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Drop it off in your fucking face, it's the sawed-off
Gotta get my ass ate, gotta get my ass ate
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, I gotta gets the fuck in there
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Drop it off in your fucking face, it's the sawed-off
Gotta get my ass ate, gotta get my ass ate
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, I gotta gets the fuck in there2Embed
