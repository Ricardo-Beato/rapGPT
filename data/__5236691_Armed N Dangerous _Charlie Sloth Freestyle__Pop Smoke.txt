58 ContributorsArmed N Dangerous (Charlie Sloth Freestyle) Lyrics
Look, look (Melo beat)

I'm armed and dangerous
Ain't no parking at the light, nah, ain't no stainin' us, huh
Keep a K with us (Woo, woo)
Please don't, please don't play with us, nah (Nah)
We up it, aimin', uh (Grrt)

Ain't no hidin', Flossy, baby, that's where I be (Ah, ah)
Lymie, if you lookin' for me, you can find me (Find me)
Try me (Try me), niggas know that I'm grimy (Grimy)
Niggas know I'm on timin' (Woo), big body like a lineman (Woo)
I know how to vibe (Vibe, vibe), but no, I ain't cool (No, I ain't cool)
Look at me funny (Look at me funny), bet I'll shoot up the room (Bet I'll shoot up the room)
Shoot out the coupe (Coupe), I let it boom (I let it boom)
Nah (Nah, woo), I don't play with these niggas, never (Never)
Play with it
Niggas know I keep a K with it
Ace Makaveli (Bah), wavin' it, wavin' it
All my Apes on the loose (Loose)
Ain't no tamin' em, tamin' 'em (Nah, woo, woo, woo)
Step in the game and start changin' it, changin' it (Uh)
Spin through your block, Tetris (Woo), bend it, bend it
All the opps want a shot, Beckham, Beckham, Beckham (Grrt)
If I don't got the chop, deck 'em, deck 'em, deck 'em
Got some brand new chops, test 'em (Woo), test 'em, test 'em
It's an opp in the spot, there he go, over there chillin' with his bitch (See that nigga)
Point him out, where he at? Jeremi's gon' give the assist (Yeah)
Six shots, clip him (Woo), I bet I empty the clip
Pop Smoke on apeshit, but everybody know I'm Crip (Grrt)
