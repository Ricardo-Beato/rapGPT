(Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to)
Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
Really though, it's never enough, ten million, that's a must
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive
Down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
You might also like
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
"Ribbon In The Sky" on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controlling my price?
No way, hell no, uh-uh
If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling
Anything out by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See if you fuck, then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first: Cali

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA
