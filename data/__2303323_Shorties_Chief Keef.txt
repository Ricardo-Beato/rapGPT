15 ContributorsShorties Lyrics
You dig?
You know how I'm rocking, cut off stockings (DP on the beat)
Keep kush all up in my pocket
All designer, get your grind up
Got a Breitling for the timer
Hey, hey, hey

Them my shorties (Them my shorties), them my shorties
Them my shorties, them my shorties
I give my shorties 40s
They come through blowing, blowing, blowing
They ain't missing, ayy
They come through scoring, scoring, scoring
Them my shorties, them my shorties
These niggas shorties, these niggas shorties
I give my shorties 40s
They come through blowing, blowing, blowing
When we pull up, hop out
Loud we blowing, blowing, blowing
Them my shorties

Gambino grab the strap, ayy, Flash grab my racks, hey
Ball drive the car, ayy, Tadoe grab the thots, ayy
Tray Savage grab the MAC, ayy, Cap grab the back, ayy
Throwback grab the front, ayy, this ain't what you want
Them my shorties, ayy, yeah, we love shooting guns, ayy
Call Caper from the front, ayy, he come through with the pump
Call Juice from Savage Squad, ayy,  he come through with the lumps
Call Fredo out the cut, ayy,  he come through with the mump
Very scary, Goosebumps, I come through with the skunk
Blowing on the skunk, skunk reeking out my truck
And I don't give a fuck, I got money, not no luck
I ain't never gave no fuck, was always with the buck-buck

Them my shorties, them my shorties
Them my shorties, them my shorties
I give my shorties 40s
They come through blowing, blowing, blowing
They ain't missing, ayy
They come through scoring, scoring, scoring
Them my shorties, them my shorties
These niggas shorties, these niggas shorties
I give my shorties 40s
They come through blowing, blowing, blowing
When we pull up, hop out
Loud we blowing, blowing, blowing
Them my shorties

I'm smoking cat piss, Johnny pissed on my necklace
Come through with that gat, bitch, we know drama, young and reckless
My niggas always wildin', I swear they overprotective
We don't know detective, we don't know who shoots the weapons
Don't care about a lecture, all I care about is money
Don't give no fuck 'bout court, don't give no fuck 'bout running
I'm somewhere counting money, it's a money damn tsunami, ayy
I'm somewhere eatin' pastrami with my shorties, we be munching
And mobbing
Them my shorties, them my shorties
Them my shorties, them my shorties
I give my shorties 40s
They come through blowing, blowing, blowing
They ain't missing, ayy
They come through scoring, scoring, scoring
Them my shorties, them my shorties
These niggas shorties, these niggas shorties
I give my shorties 40s
They come through blowing, blowing, blowing
When we pull up, hop out
Loud we blowing, blowing, blowing
Them my shorties1Embed
