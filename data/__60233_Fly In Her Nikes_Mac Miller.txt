10 ContributorsFly In Her Nikes Lyrics
She lookin' fly, real fly in her Nikes
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice Creams
Ooh, she's a dime, she keep 'em iced so nicely
The way she's rockin' them kicks, gotta make her my wifey, whoa

You lookin' fly, real fly in them Nike shoes
I'm lookin' for a wifey and it might be you
Ménage à trois, spend the night with two
It's alright with me if it's alright with you
Feel my hands rubbin' up and down your backside
Ma, you've got curves like a half-pipe
That's right, ma, you's a ten
And your man? You be rockin' nicer shoes than him
I'm in the spot with some juice and gin
Come to me
You a beauty with your Louis and Gucci
Baby girl, I ain't wanna be your man
But let me just write my number on your hand
At the party with a whole bunch of honeys here (Cheah)
You got your Forces laced up with some bunny ears
But now I got you all alone, and the booze gone
So slip outta your clothes, but keep them shoes on

She lookin' fly, real fly in her Nikes
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice Creams
Ooh, she's a dime, she keep 'em iced so nicely
The way she's rockin' them kicks, gotta make her my wifey, whoa
You might also like
You lookin' fresh like whoa
Goddamn, lookin' so fly that you probably got a man
You lookin' right and he ain't here tonight, so
I won't tell him if you don't (Oh!)
So let's roll, roll back to the crib
Grey Goose, lights dimmed, girl, that's how I live (You know me)
You got them kicks, fat ass, and some lips
Baby, you don't even gotta ask for a kiss
Shorty look proper, with kicks like Foot Locker
All done up, she a good shopper (Uh-huh)
New jeans, blue tee, and her shoes clean
Uh, lookin' like she 'bout to seduce me
Just touch me, tease me, cute caressin'
A hundred thousand pairs in your shoe collection
Shh, I know you like to tell
But let me just lay back while you light my L

She lookin' fly, real fly in her Nikes
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice Creams
Ooh, she's a dime, she keep 'em iced so nicely
The way she's rockin' them kicks, gotta make her my wifey, whoa1Embed
