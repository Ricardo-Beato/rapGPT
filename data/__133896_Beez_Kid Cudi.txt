Zig-Zag
Yo, check it
Ayo

Who could take a single buck, an empty cup, a stroke of luck
Fuck around and reconstruct it up to a million bucks?
In God we trust, every part of us is marvelous
You Krusty Krab squad, y'all will rust, y'all ain't hard enough
Demolition expert, I exert through your network
While the Tec squirt, jerk, there's holes inside your sweatshirt
Through your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow
Precise with this mic device, slice your pie like Sbarros
You falling nigga, and you can't get up
You been stalling motherfucker now your ass is stuck
Brooklyn, Brownsville, baby, stay with the Killer Hill crazy
Ankle strapped above the boot, it conceals my three eighty
Are you running for this money money? Hunting eggs like Easter Bunny
Geeks trying to beast upon me, freak, I will eat a zombie
Calm and double while you jumping through these hurdles
Silly rabbit, the race is always won by the turtle
Mental machinery, purple herbal mixed with that greenery
I don’t write songs, grasshopper, I write sceneries
Everything ain’t what it seems to be
What it means to you, it don’t mean to me
Bzzz, a sting from the killer bees
You might also like
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
Stings bitch, bzzzz...
BzzzzZZZzzz

I pass any test of litmus, I workout at 24 Fitness
On the weekends I sip Belvedere with that citrus
My dogs is vicious, exotic nympho whore for the mistress
Life is good, I live every day like it's Christmas
Happy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here
I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird 'til she sings out
La la la la, Bobby could convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala
Plus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas
Like Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla
Gold rings like the Green Lantern you see me in the mean phantom
Pushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton
Or maybe in the grotty, rugged projects of Staten
Tall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
