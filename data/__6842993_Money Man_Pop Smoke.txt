Do the money dance (Grr, pow)
Nah, pow (Woo, woo, woo)

Money man, money man, money man do the money dance
I pull up in a brand new Benz (To, to), Benjamin’s is my only friends
Money man, money man, money man do the money dance
I pull up in a brand new Benz, Benjamin’s is my only friends
(Money man, money man, money man do the money dance, To, to, yeah)
(Money man, money man, money man do the money dance, Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Money man, money man, money man do the money dance (Yeah)
Money man, money man, money man do the money dance (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah (Woo), yeah, yeah (Woo), yeah, yeah (Woo)
Yeah, yeah (Grrt), yeah, yeah (Skrrt), yeah, yeah (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Wooo)

I pop a Perc', go retarded, we shoot up the party, then change the artilleries
I'm a double G, I'm from the 9, that's why your homegirl be feelin' me
See this rappin' shit? It's new to me (Bow, nah), but the street shit ain't new to me (Woo)
Runnin' the streets like a true MC (Woo), when you see me, better "Woo" to me (Grrt)
Even my teacher "Woo" to me (Hahaha) and that bitch who used to tutor me
Walk in the streets with a tool on me (Woo) 'cause I ain't with the foolery (Grrt, bow)
Say she like how I walk, hop in the car, then I put it in sport (Sport)
Step on the court, twing-twing, step back, Alhamdulillah
