19 ContributorsReal Gas Lyrics

I'm in a real Dually, My life a real movie
Your girlfriend want to change her heart she is a real groupie
I'm rockin' real diamonds, you rockin' real fluey
And this is not a water gun this is a real Uzi

I got more motherfucking money than a preacher, ho
I'm like a million dollars richer than a week ago
Got so much jewelry on I look just like a jewelry store
If you a bad bitch, why you wearing sneakers for?
You say your ballin', what you sittin' in the bleachers for?
Rolls Royce a head shot but my charger is a body blow
If you don't suck it right, then I guess got to teach the ho
I'm smoking swishers not the same shit Wiz Khalifa smoke

I'm smoking real gas, spend money real fast
Lil' momma sexy but I wonder if that’s a real ass
I want her real bad, I got a real bag
I got it on me the long way I got that real cash
I roll with real niggas, I'm talking real killas'
And I suggest you stay in line we got bad tempers
I'm rockin' real Prada, I'm rocking real Louie
These other suckas' out here imposters, I'm the real Gucci
You might also like
This is a one stop shop selling weed, mollies, xans
Steal from me I'm killing all close friends
He smoking dope out of chicken bones and soda cans
Clayton county that’s gangland
My shooters they got shooters man
He wanna rob better change his plans, when they run in his house everybody backin' out and they shooting man
If you want the pounds I’m in Riverdale i'm out here send 100 bands, on 85 that's real shit, flex to much get your door kicked
Can't stand a lame and a broke bitch
It ain't hard to tell nigga' I'm the man
Can't fuck with soldiers or middle man
So I'm a boss nigga, I do boss shit
Like a GD I'm a boss bitch, hanging out the window with a chopstick
Got leather gloves with no mask, when I hit a lick
Just to let you know who took your shit
You lame as hell you a free pick, my young niggas they'll murk your ass for a half a brick
Need to rob that's my freak, bitch

I'm smoking real gas, spend money real fast
Lil' momma sexy but I wonder if that’s a real ass
I want her real bad, I got a real bag
I got it on me the long way I got that real cash
I roll with real niggas, I'm talking real killas'
And I suggest you stay in line we got bad tempers
I'm rockin' real Prada, I'm rocking real Louie
These other suckas' out here imposters, I'm the real Gucci7Embed
