20 ContributorsStoned Raiders Lyrics
"Guilty... before Almighty God
Guilty... before His Son
Guilty, before the whole human race
It's the Lord who expels you... He who is coming to
Judge you..."
It is the Lord who is coming to judge both the living, and the dead
God himself who commends you...

1 for trouble, 8 for the road
7 to get ready when I'm lettin' off all my load
Funk, Buddha monk, in the trunk
I got'cha, thumpin' so hard
Up and down the blvd.,
I'm a natrual-born cap-peela', strapped illa
I'm the west coast settin' it on, no one's reala'
Get'cha fix of the uncut funk
A small dose of the skunk weed, like it's suppose to be
Move it up, just move it on out
What'cha talkin'bout son
I got the first shot, and it's all over now
One nation under a groove
Smoke a pound for the strict of it
Everytime I make a move
Smooth and togetha
Raw like leatha
Ain't goin' out like a punk, neva
You might also like
Check it out, 1,2, Cypress groove
Check it out, 1,2, Cypress groove

It's the numba one money maker
Money takea, few steps back I'm on a plane to Jamaica,(Am I)
Puffin' a fat wada, talk shit
For the fool I'm thinkin' about, I got the ruff shit
Hard rock bone breaka
Stoned Raider, in the Temple of Boom
Assurt to assume
Never be lettin' shit slide, no way
Bitch niggas can hide
But, I'll find they ass some day

Check it out, 1,2, Cypress groove

Wherever you are, put'cha muthafuckin' spliff in the air,
Sound off, like you gotta pair,
When I kick to the metro
Lone clip, be lookin' around
Cause this shit ain't over with yet
People can't understand my situation
Now they cought up in the Soul Assasination
Fool, just take cover, it's all over
When I break ya off a chunk of this muthafucka
Check it out, 1,2, Cypress groove
Check it out, 1,2, Cypress groove
Check it out, 1,2, Cypress groove1Embed
