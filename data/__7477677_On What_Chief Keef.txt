On what I ain't go buy a lot? On what I ain't put you on?
On what I ain't get folks a Glock? On what I ain't shoot on my own?
On what I ain't shoot for Cap? Lil' nigga, this is not rap
Don't run up on me with that bap, I got that bitch in my lap
On what they won't shoot for me? Well what you gon' do to me?
What they gon' shoot for me? Shoot down like two or three
On what I won't do for them? On what they won't do for me?
On what? On what? On what?

On what she won't curl my toes for a tummy? (Uh)
On what they won't backdate for that money?
Bitch, my cup dirty, can you do my laundry?
On what I won't buy a bitch off my aunty?
On what I won't give a hundred to my mommy?
On what? On what? On what?
