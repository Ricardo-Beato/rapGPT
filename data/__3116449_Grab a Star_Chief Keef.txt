Mama say I got trust issues
I be feelin' like Jesus
She wants me to be her man
I can't baby, I would break you
Baby, I would not lie to you
I'd be careful if I were you
I'm the one, but you might be the two
I'm not that liable
Call me, pull off, skr-skr-skr-skr
Smoking that a-la-la-la
Give me that ah-ya-ya-ya
Call me, we can pull off, right now, right now-now
And when this top starts to drop, baby look in the sky and grab a star (Bang)

These bitches love Turbo and I love the purple
I ball, Tyrese Gibson, baby boy, you look so fertile
These bitches love Otto, their mouths be wide open
Been gettin' it since snot nose, I was open and then I closed
These bitches love Chief Lo, but I'm not so sweet though
And she is a freak though, I put her to sleep though
These hoes love Almighty, like Disney loved Miley
Her boyfriend is spying, she's like, "you have to hide me"
These bitches love me, that's all I can see
I'm so obsessed with me, I be all I can be
I don't see brown or white, all I see is green
To count all this cash, I might need a team
You might also like
Mama say I got trust issues
I be feelin' like Jesus
She wants me to be her man
I can't baby, I would break you
Baby, I would not lie to you
I'd be careful if I were you
I'm the one, but you might be the two
I'm not that liable
Call me, pull off, skr-skr-skr-skr
Smoking that a-la-la-la
Give me that ah-ya-ya-ya
Call me, we can pull off, right now, right now-now
And when this top starts to drop, baby look in the sky and grab a star (bang)

Ooh, my car so retarded, the bitch just farted
Pulled off like skrt, VIP access, I ain't gotta park it
All these darts on me no Walmart, will never fuck with Target
And I'm sipping, but I can't stop, I can't be hardened
These bitches love Big Gucci So, but I'm no rooty tooty though
Don't want to talk so that's all you can know
Row row ya boat, that's all you can roll
I'm stuffing these cones like an audience close
And I'm not really an American though
But I'm somewhere in the Madigan dough
But I ain't walk around like a mannequin though
Now yo bitch on the way
She want this on me
But she's listening, can a bitch hold me?
You can be lactose, still can't shit on me
Do the whole 200 on dash, with a 150 on me
Mama say I got trust issues
I be feelin' like Jesus
She wants me to be her man
I can't baby, I would break you
Baby, I would not lie to you
I'd be careful if I were you
I'm the one, but you might be the two
I'm not that liable
Call me, pull off, skr-skr-skr-skr
Smoking that a-la-la-la
Give me that ah-ya-ya-ya
Call me, we can pull off, right now, right now-now
And when this top starts to drop, baby look in the sky and grab a star1Embed
