Ayy, ayy, look

Badder than your favorite bad bitch (Ah)
Turned the whole world into a savage (Yeah)
Middle finger in all of my pictures
Just to remind y'all I ain't havin' it (Fuck y'all)
I'm the baddest bitch, who wanna fight about it?
Put 'em in the booth, I bet I'll take the title (Baow-baow-baow)
All of these hoes my sheep
Mary had a little lamb, they was talkin' 'bout me, ayy (Yeah)
Switched sides, so I switched back
Lotta I owe yous I ain't gettin' back (I ain't gettin' back)
Lotta shit I should've walked away from
But the hood bitch in me kept pullin' me back (Bitch, what?)
Wish I would let a ho in my business, ayy (Huh)
Quit askin' 'bout these niggas, look (Bitch)
You don't wan' sip this tеa
If I give you the deets, you might get in your feelings, ah

Tеll a hater, "Fuck you" (Ah)
They keep comin', tellin' me these bitches mad, what's new?
All this ice around my neck got me feelin' too cool (Yeah)
We was bangin' and he beat that pussy red, SuWoo (Yeah, yeah)
Middle finger out the roof, tell a hater, "Fuck you"
They keep comin', tellin' me these bitches mad, what's new?
All this ice around my neck got me feelin' too cool (Burr)
We was bangin' and he beat that pussy red, SuWoo (Baow, baow)
Middle finger out the roof, ah

Pull up Bentley
Drop four-fifty to make my car match with my feelings (Car match with my feelings)
Y'all be hatin', I'm ridin' with Farris to make sure none of y'all hoes come near me (None of y'all hoes come near me)
Bitch, stop cappin', that shit ain't exclusive (Ah)
Y'all in the A buyin' shit from them boosters
I heard y'all niggas ain't buyin' them chains
Just takin' them pics, send it back to the jeweler, ah
Roll one deep, rock two C's
In my purse, I keep some G's (I keep some G's)
Ho, quit talkin' 'bout me to your man
'Cause that only make him more intrigued (Make him more intrigued)
Bitch, you a bum, don't get a crumb
How you got cake and ain't fuckin' for none?
I better not ever catch you talkin' shit (Hey, hey)
If your bank account still attached to your mom's, ah

Tell a hater, "Fuck you"
They keep comin', tellin' me these bitches mad, what's new?
All this ice around my neck got me feelin' too cool (Hey)
We was bangin' and he beat that pussy red, SuWoo
Middle finger out the roof, tell a hater, "Fuck you"
They keep comin', tellin' me these bitches mad, what's new?
All this ice around my neck got me feelin' too cool (Too cool)
We was bangin' and he beat that pussy red, SuWoo (Hey)
Middle finger out the roof, ah
These niggas love me 'cause I'm like that
Freaky, nasty, bite me, I'll bite back, ayy (Bite back, ayy)
If I want a nigga gone, then he gone
I'm a real street bitch, so you know I can't type that, ayy (Hey, yeah)
These hoes be thinkin' they me
'Til them people wanna see and they really gotta show up, ayy
Hangin' 'round niggas say they made me
You gon' suck a whole lotta dick tryna blow up, ayy (Ah, ah)
I'm finna get mean in this bitch, ayy (Yeah)
They think I'm weak in this bitch, ayy (They think I'm weak in this bitch)
Instead of me teachin' these hoes
I probably should've been readin' a bitch, ayy (Readin' a bitch)
I'm a hundred, not fifty, ayy
Weak niggas never get me, ayy (Nope)
Pussy niggas on the internet
Talkin' 'bout some pussy they ain't gettin', yeah (Pussy)

Tell a hater, "Fuck you" (Fuck 'em)
They keep comin', tellin' me these bitches mad, what's new?
All this ice around my neck got me feelin' too cool (Burr, burr, burr)
We was bangin' and he beat that pussy red, SuWoo (Woo)
