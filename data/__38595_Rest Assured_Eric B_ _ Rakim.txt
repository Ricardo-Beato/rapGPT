"007 is back"
"007 is back"
"007 is back"

I don't stress my day 'cause it's best to parlay
I guess you could say I've been away
I wake up slow when I'm hot but I destruct the plant
And fourteen hands comb New York for fans
They make waves as they wiggle in my waterbed
Pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread
A mornin' massage turnin into a real rough rubdown
So I figured I'll lay around
They keep me wet with a juice called Tahiti
It make the room steamy, so soon they couldn't see me
They know more than calisthenics as they worked up a sweat
It wasn't even ten o'clock yet
Scrub down, then I get moist, they never treat me mean
They sweetly keep me squeaky clean
I chill as they filled the jacuzzi
I said, "I'm tight from a real long flight, could you soothe me
Support my thoughts, 'cause I got a lot of writing to do"
They said, "Cool" and just enjoyed the view
It ain't hard 'cause it's miles from the sidewalk
I'm overlookin' every borough in New York
The entire Empire State to concentrate
For every rhyme I make
So at exactly noon they played my favorite tune
And just before they all cleared the room
They said, "We're glad you're home from tour, now we feel secure
We wish you didn't have to leave no more"
But they wanna go to war, they even tried to shoot up the door
"007 is back"
Rest assured
You might also like
"007 is back"
Feel secure
"007 is back"

I'm fillin' up the page when I'm steppin' on stage
Got the people in a rage with they hands in the air
Fellas sayin' "Ho", everybody yellin' "Go"
Fly ladies in the house all screamin' "Oh yeah"
That's how they react when I attack the mic
In fact it's like a stack of dynamite, powerful and bright
Girls love to squeeze me real tight
007 is back
Ra has returned to romance 'em, better than Johnny Handsome
When I was young women said, "Damn son"
Ain't nothin' changed but the year and I'm still here
C'mere dear, let me whisper in your ear
Hug my words so I can taste your lips
I set up hips like domino chips
But I don't let 'em hit the floor
And if you got sore, then feel secure
Where's the pain? Is it the spot you set us in?
Almost magic, better than medicine
Take one of these and put your mind at ease
I get more work than a lot of M.D.'s
If I'm hawkin' New York or out on tour
I express the raw dialect and explore
But don't get fooled by metaphor
"007 is back"
Rest assured
Feel secure
Rest assured
Rest assured
Yo, feel secureEmbed
