48 ContributorsI Be On That Lyrics
I be on that other shit, I'm harder than a consonant
And that's because I'm flyer than the mothership, you ostrich
I'm awesome rich, call a bitch, fresher than my lozenges
The problem is you in the Danger Zone like Kenny Loggins is
I'm fly, I'm tight, they say I'm sick, they right
You think you good, I swear I put your shit to bed, goodnight
Yes, I'm sitting on the bench, I don't play no games
I just spit that Bellevue, watch them go insane
Why these motherfuckers think they waking up in pain?
'Cause they sleeping on the hardest nigga in this game
Hell yes, I'm on my zombie shit, I must get brain
They will not forget me like I was hit by planes
I ain't got to do it big, I just gotta do it different
And these hoes are on my dick, and if you got it, it ain't tricking
I be steady getting paper, call a nigga Dunder Mifflin
And these rappers cannot see me, I'm the only one with vision

I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit and you can't handle none of it
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit and you can't handle none of it

I'm on top of turd mountain; king shit, bitches
Can't nobody top that, Teen Witch, bitches
I don't make it rain, I bring the heat storm, nigga
Weezy F is in jail, I keep his seat warm, nigga
Yes, I get it like I live it, yes, this pimp is still is pimping
Y'all don't want me to be different, what the fuck is y'all thinking?
That does not suit me, call it Ben Sherman
'Cause I get more green than Kermit, heard me?
I'm in charge of new shit, don't talkâ€”do shit
Spitting at the crowd like I play heavy metal music
I can say anything, call me John Cusack
Keep my dick wetter than the bottom of a cruise ship
Keep it fresh to death, keep my swag inside a coffin
So fly, I'm in the sky like Vodka, partner
Shout out to Marc Jacobs, yeah, my feet be feeling highbrow
And Band of Outsiders, got your tie on right now
Glory versus failure, there is nothing to it
'Cause you win some and lose some, Sandra Bullock
Tell me when I'm way too much, when no one had faith in us
They thought Child was child's play
But now, they see we dangerous
Bring your girl around me, let me show her how her body work
She like me 'cause my wallet fat, it should wear a Hawaiian shirt
Comin' for your spot, like I do when I'm inside of her
Got the cold, hard green in my hand, no Heineken
Listen up, listen up, please, check my steez
Insect ligaments, I'm the bee's knees
Watch my math, like 75 minus 6
How can number two be number one? Because I'm the shit, bitch
You might also like
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit and you can't handle none of it
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit and you can't handle none of it6Embed
