20 ContributorsU Should Be Here Lyrics
Yeah, you're rockin' with the talk of New York
Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent
G-Unit, and here we go

You should be here with me, bitch
You should come and make me rich
Girl, you know you need a pimp
Girl, you know you drive me crazy (Drive me crazy)
You should be here with me, bitch (Ooh, ooh, girl)
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
Bitch (You should be here)

Bright and early in the mornin' come up short with my money
And for sure I'll kick your ass bitch (What you say?)
(You should be here) You fuckin' with them other niggas
But you know you love the niggas, switch to a pimp, bitch (Bitch)
(You should be here) You fit into my stable of hoes
You from Atlanta, I'm from New York, but I'm throwin them bows
(You should be here) Right here next to me
Girl, I know you tired of fuckin' for free (Woo, Sing along)

(You should be here)
You should be that bitch that come, every time I call
(You should be here)
You should be down on your knees, tryin' to break me off (Uh huh, uh huh)
(You should be here)
You should be that bitch, that buy me shit all the time
(Well I wish you were here)
You should be my bottom bitch, out on the grind (You should be here)
You might also like
Bust in your ass, winter, spring, or summer
I'm a winner, I'm ain't a regular nigga, ho 
(You should be here) Runnin' wit a pro, I ain't a beginner
Niggas know, what, you wanna percentage, no {Hell no}
(You should be here) Walkin' the track, rain, hail, sleet, snow
Anythin' to speed up the process of the cash flow {gotta get that money man}
(You should be here) Catchin' a date, and breakin'll keep me straight
Even if you gotta take it in the ass hole {you take it in the ass}

(You should be here) You should be that bitch that come (Uh huh)
Every time I call (I told ya'll motherfuckers)
(You should be here) You should be down on your knees
Tryin' to break me off (You should be here)
You should be that bitch, that buy me shit all the time
Yo, 50 get on that 50 shit one time, my nigga
You should be my bottom bitch, out on the grind

Uh, yeah, (You should be here)
Look, I don't really need you, I get my dough, bitch
I got some Coupe's, I got some jeeps, I got some mo' shit
(You should be here) I stay with some hoes 'cause I use those twos (Uh huh)
I keep a Benz, I keep some rims, and I stay with some jewels
(You should be here) I'm internationally known, man everybody know me
Way down in McNolly, they feelin' me wodie
(You should be here) But you can catch me in Houston with Bun and Pimp C (C)
Or in Miami, wit Luke and VIP (Yeah)
(You should be) You should be here with me, babe
You should be here with me, babe
(You should be) Girl, you know you drive me crazy (Sing along)
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
(You should be) You should be here with me babe (Ew, ew, girl)
(Girl, I wish you were here) I just wanna drive ya, babe
You should be here

I told ya'll motherfuckers G-Unit is takin' over this shit, man
(You should be here) We run the hood
And we run these motherfuckin' offices
Y'all be wildin'
(You should be here) If y'all hear the fuckin'
Chase these crackers that's cuttin' us right now
(You should be here) Man you still local
I'm out the hood, man, come on

You should be here with me babe
(You should be) Girl, you know you drive me crazy (Sing along)
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
