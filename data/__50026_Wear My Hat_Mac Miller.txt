24 ContributorsWear My Hat Lyrics
Hey, turn the beat up a little more (Ya)
Yeah, haha (Uh)
That's good
And it's the best day ever
Uh
What's good, Chuck?
Hey (Somethin' for the ladies)

I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat (Off my hat)
But now she think she got it like that (Like that)
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat (Off my hat)
Hmm, I think she think she got it like that (Ha) (Like that)

Baby, you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby, you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match

Baby, you could wear my hat, just twist it to the back
We drinkin' out the bottle while you sittin' on my lap
Then we could go outside, let me take you on a ride
With the top down, show you off to people, you my prize
Nothin' like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes
Shinin' like my high beams, cooler than some iced tea
Yeah, I got a female who like to send some pictures to my email
Professional with shoppin', you would think she worked in retail
Snapbacks make 'em look so cute
And that girl know how to blow somethin' like she play the flute, ha
That long hair, and it's fallin' down her back
I put on my hat, and she reach and tryna snatch it
Baby, you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch
Make a snapback look fantastic, but sorry, you can't have this
She smile big, kissin' on my cheek
Baby, you could wear my hat, make sure you give it back to me
You might also like
Baby, you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby, you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match (Haha)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Baby, you could wear my hat)
Just make sure you give it back (Just make sure you give it back)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Baby, you could wear my hat)
If you got somethin' to match (If you got somethin' to match that)

She like to play those stupid games with me
She never seem to have enough
She brought some friends for whoever came with me
So, my homies sayin' that's what's up
And I hear her name's pretty, from different continent
Tellin' me she single, but to tell the truth, I'm not convinced
It's all good, I'm used to boyfriends always talkin' shit
Thinkin' that they players, but I'm coachin', call me Popovich
Baby, I ain't doctor rich, but I'll probably show you a good night
When girls come out with me, they make sure that they look right
She used to be so grounded, all the sudden she took flight
And we ain't seen her since, so tell me, what does that look like?
I'm the type to bring you right back down to Earth
And for what it's worth, I'll put that Louis on your purse
She like to wear my hat, make me laugh, so I'm guessin' she a keeper
I think she stole it though, I keep tryin' to reach her
Baby, you could wear my hat (Call me back)
Just make sure you give it back (Hahaha)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Uh)
If you got somethin' to match (It's the best day ever) (Aha)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Baby, you could wear my hat)
Just make sure you give it back (Just make sure you give it back)
Baby, you could wear my hat (Baby, you could wear my hat)
If you got somethin' to match (If you got somethin' to match) (Haha)

I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat (Off my hat)
But now she think she got it like that (Like that)
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat (Off my hat)
Damn, I think she think she got it like that

Aha
Yuh, yuh
Baby, if you wanna wear my hat, you can wear my hat, it's not a big deal
Just give that shit back
