Call my Phantom the holy ghost
Church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid
'Cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came
For that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in Blu-Ray
And these black diamonds like Boondocks

I'm haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit

Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door
Roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward–oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain't much as theirs
And we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes
Why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch
I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
Dope boys, gold mine
That price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame
Then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches

It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter

There's a meaning to the kissin' of the ring
The gods don't mingle with the mortals
Peasants ain't sittin' with the kings
Goliath ain't worried 'bout your sling
And Cassius ain't bothered by your swings
You niggas keep rappin' 'bout your dreams, my reality
50 birds waitin' in the wings
Do it my way, I hit the highway with the batter
So when Kanye go on his hia', it don't matter
Since you talking 'bout me, then let's talk about this money
Let's talk about the cars and why mines shaped funny
Lets' talk about the fact you'll never take nothin' from me
Lets talk about the fact you niggas hate I'm up and runnin'
RG3 nigga, be that
Runnin' through this money and these white women

We can take this so much further than your mentions
I can get your eulogy on YouTube for instance
Have the whole world view the body
Since y'all claim I'm Illuminati, tell me why would you try me?
Kennedy, John F., or Bobby
Almost caught Reagan, but they stopped us at the lobby
And that was broad day, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?
You lil' niggas just dirty mine's is Zero Dark Thirty
Mine is night vision, witch huntin', ride for Pac worthy
I'm coke boy leanin' on you niggas
If money talk then I must be screamin' on you niggas
Top of the pile I was two thirds away
I was sidetracked busy selling two birds a day, God
Death is just a U-turn away
Two men ten paces then you turn and spray
I don't give a fuck what you say about me

Bad bitches, they skinny dippin'
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, one ocular, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since A-Rod
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
My Diors is distressed, CDG vest with Jays on
Bloggers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cemented, it's baked on
Eghck! That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'

La Musica de Harry Fraud

Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
And I know once I get there that it's sold
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
While I get this dough

One man cowboy, speed limit timid
Chevy Malibu; we graduated from them renteds
Lost 100 large on the last time we sent it
It's only four letters, I ain't worried 'bout a sentence (k-i-l-o)
Travelin' the distance, stayin' off the white line
Alphabet boys out prayin' what they might find
I hate the Carolinas, racial profiler
Say you smokin' marijuanas, fuck you talkin 'bout
My piss is clearer than my mama's, with her church wig on
996 before I get my Big on
Thousand grams, thousand hands, thousand furs, thousand bands
Hundred thousand dollar horse all-star; we stylin' in

Tugboat or car tow, we summertime snowin'

These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl, you different
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing

Reminiscing about my episodes
With them extra hoes, but you didn't cheat
Cold nights when you couldn't sleep
Celine bags were the given treat
C-Class helped you see past
All them other hoes, and that they niggas weak
Whoo! I'm good money
Got you talking in dollar signs
It's all good that she the top bitch
But she just wanna know the bottom line
I don't blame her, I don't change her
I just sit back and give her options
Phillip Lim, Derek Lam
Every baller gotta know she's sponsored
Whoo! You earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back
These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks

My bitch stunting, that's me
I break it down, then break her off
I'm breaking bread, and that's key
We everything that they talk about
Know them haters be watching
Them bitches lurking -- your page locked
And they still know when you shopping
They still know that I'm balling
You still know that I'm all in
Your ex nigga, your next nigga
Gon' hate the fact that I'm spoiling

Please don't mind
I just need some time
These requirements
Just gotta make sure you meet all mine
Standing there staring, with your bow-legged stance
Trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood, strong with the bands
Look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag
Pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
Glance at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards, really
I done grabbed a vixen
That supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacks'll really blow
Dancers get exposed
Missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town
You remain the same no matter up or down
These other women stay pretending
Money come and they help us spend it
But'll fuck my niggas in the very minute
I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play, acki
And again I say I like these hoes14Embed

YUGHHH , you ain’t ever have shit local nigga?
Woo, how the fuck I owe you local niggas?
I’m a global nigga, Champs-Élysées shopper
Looked up to Eric B and dope dealer, chain rockers
Where was you when I was bleeding
Disappointed and battling my demons
I just want to ride Italian leather, acting like you don’t know me
Euro designer palace, fuck my bitch on Missoni
And I feel…

And I feel like they want to take my life
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth
And I feel like they want to take my life

It ain’t enough that I struggle through my career
Less appreciated when I was part of a pair
Pushed an envelope full of truth like I was dared
Depiction and the depth was the proof that I was there
It’s no question in my origins
Photo album full of Polaroids they’re still pointing in
Couple million records sold, still say I’m poisoning
Seven different SIM cards, bringing all that mortar in
Brick by brick nigga, all you add is water in
We ain’t got to touch hands nigga, put your order in
I just want to float through clouds Hermes seams on my towels
No overly gaudy shit, just the diamonds on the dials
Woo, and I’m still buying mo’ guns

This track dictates everything I'm supposed to say
So have mercy on this soul that I've thrown away
Although it's cliche the devil had a hold of me
This greedy motherfucker couldn't put the blow away
Bitches blowing kisses and rappers throwing disses
Hoping to land their ass on all top 5 listes
I wish you niggas well, you niggas wish I fail
You gonna make me bear these arms like a Chippendale
Squeeze off on him, leave cross on him
By the time the bodies found there's peat moss on him
I could show all you the ways in which crime pays
My drug ring's a multi-million dollar crime wave
Two ranch homes, both dockside
Get this money back, counter-clockwise
Little bubble on the cut like peroxide
The poison in the car is not carbon monoxide

I ask forgiveness lord, in hopes of getting more
Then beg forgiveness for the same thing he forgave me for
I wasn't crazy poor, see I was lazy more
A thousand kilos cross his lines that you can't ignore
I felt entitled to it, not how the bible do it
My bright eyes exposed to how the hood idols do it
I just took a page, then I took the stage
Then put the face of that Rollie in that diamond cage
I tried to tame the beast, best I could no leash
I stood the test of time, air-tight no leaks
Not a squeak not a peep of a word
I done lived half my life in arms reach of a bird
Have mercy on me, they put curses on me
I could've been six feet or had nurses on me
It was written like these tatted Bible verses on me
I feel the weight upon my shoulders like the church is on me

I'm too much dope dealer for rap niggas
Too much closer to every trap nigga

And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah
Red, white and blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's leftovers, I still gotta eat, right?
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-poppin', her jeans tight
All day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimmin' pool

Pretty girls, my reputation
One on my arm, that's decoration
Gettin' to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me, you need a reservation
To the top escalatin', elevatin'
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'til I K.O., eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they role, even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day and all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand to hand
When you got this paper hand in her hand
Bitch, I'm feelin' like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga, na-na, na-na, na
Bitch, I'm feelin' like a grown ass lil' boy

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could just to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let them talk about it, mane, I'm already livin'
I risked my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, loungin' like it's a beach chair
Papa don't preach, a-all we do is just reach here
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doin' magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high, then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzin' by
The queen pin to the kingpin, redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins

Yuugh, this the life that we made
Gunshots in the dark like a sweet serenade

(W-W-W-What is it?)

Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder it's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by that nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got they mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cuttin' school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and an arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, "If he dies, he dies"
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwin' punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon Red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dyin', dead, yuugh

Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother cryin'
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealin' it
Hit the pipe and start feelin' it
Ooh-wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, jeez louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took an L, started sellin' soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusin' his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you'll be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smokin' is my profession, let's get it

I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain't hearing none of that street shit
'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I'm a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in His image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win

Overnight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die than go home
I'd rather die than go home
And I ain't leaving without my forty acres
Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money's universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real, niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winnin'
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinnin'
Old habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
'Cause stand-up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it off the plastic

Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only He can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended

A toothless crackhead was the mascot

What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go
Representing my niggas down 'til they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go?
My mind wanders on a PJ, my mama brought up in the PJs
In the club sippin' P&J on the same arm as my Piaget (Woo)

Say you got to hang up but that man won't let go
Oh, my nigga, say it ain't so
Now we speakin' on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearin' whispers, "it ain't adding up"
Givin' you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standin' up
I never thought I'd had have to question, 'Were you man enough?'
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Tellin' all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5

Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointin' fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like Your Honor

Every move we ever made is gettin' stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that set in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation

This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders, gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided, if you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me "daddy" from a complex
'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard, step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar

But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks

Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk

Just say the words, I'll do anything you want (Uh)
Boy, let me love you

I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging?
I ain't trying to guide you, hand on Bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirty-dollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke, so
No cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone, she's just bluffin'
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing

Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

Yuugh, I drops every blue moon
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it, the wrist is magic
The left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless it’s getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Can’t you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha
I’m aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?
And rap niggas broke like them, they’re mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like, interior gauze
It feels like, still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin’ pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceiling’s open, I Cross-Fit the coca
Yuugh! It’s a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million paralleled and ain’t nothin’ rented

White to the Blacks I’m a villain in
The Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem
Let’s talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is Netflix “Narcos”
Part on the side of my 'fro like I’m Pablo
No hablo, I sell blow
Lone wolf, no Tonto, head honcho
Yuugh, let’s take the scenic route
I could show you the strange fruit
It’s looking like Beirut
They open the wash bay, I climb it like K2
These kilos are drought killers, I flooded the Jesús, I made use
Of every Spanish name I done ran across
No matter what the weight, I done ran it off
I’m walking on water, I took the sandals off
Tell A&E to turn the cameras off, Push
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 60062Embed

America, you need a miracle
Beyond spiritual 
I need a realer view
I hold a mirror to it
These ain’t new problems, they just old ways
I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
Not guilty, still I’m filthy
In FOX eyes, we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a TV, C-N-B-C
C-N-N, Don Lemon, no Kweli when you meet me
In order to be me
You gotta see what Chief Keef see

While they testing your patience, they just testing my reach
Funeral flowers, every 28 hours
Being laid over ours
Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances 
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
Metal detectors is where ours is
They’ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes, every truth don’t get told
All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole
Every goose don’t lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
They call in the National Guard
Public Enemy, I am Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I’m Huey P
Woo! The new elite, it’s either you or me
Let the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me

Patience torn, patience gone, oh lord

Espera, ven aquí, who you wanna be? Drug Dealer? Demon? Rap nigga? You tryna save the culture? Ay Dios mío. You gotta pick one, daddy

Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em
In elevator condos, on everything I love

This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race

These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours

Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya

The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out

You killed God's baby when it wasn't his will
And blood spill, we can't talk this shit over (This shit over)
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not sheep
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
I bring my offerin', I will not preach
Awaken my demons, you can hear that man screaming
I'm no different than the priest, priest
Santería (Santería, Santería, Santería)

They say that death comes in threes, how appropriate ('Propriate)
Triple back, they rush in like Soviets (Soviets)
At the Kremlin
Searchin' for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (Woo!)
I just place orders and drop dollars
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers
The three of y'all too accessible
Seen all the wrong moves, watchin' The Untouchables
We don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined
Welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest

See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow, so that my core follows
We don’t mourn for the dead nigga, we pour bottles
Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with similac powder in a baby bottle
The formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother? Nigga, I’ll be damned
Gator at my momma’s house, welcome to zombie land
A hustler’s paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Down 40 but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye I at it, kept the poker face
Cause the batter I add had the coca base
When you get to heaven’s door they won’t hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker’s face
There’s no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right
You in Italian leather and you're four wheeling right
You know you’re up when you count a quarter mil in white
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight

My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The 012 a year early, I’m a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at 30 and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
They’ll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I’m here now, nigga, pardon my lateness

Eliminate the fool's gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime I made in this life wasn't disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is life's ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park, Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem pole, what’s my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler

Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by

For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every known rat, it's one slept on
For every loyal nigga fronted, one kept owin'
For every bitch I showed the way, it's one that kept hoin'
So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and a tour follows
Let's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow
My niggas embrace guns and ignore Bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines
The new jury can be you, ghetto law-abiding
Better know who that is looking in the mirror
The truth lies, and your soul can't see it clearer
You might also like
Better know who you is
When you lookin' in the mirror
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Ridin' with my niggas
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by

I just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone
They're handing out football numbers after tappin' your phone
Or you watchin' for the drop as they clappin' they chrome
Took a brick and I turned it to stone
5 into 10, the Return of the Clones
Then I took my experience and turned it to poems
As we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings
Panamera blood red symbolize bloodshed
Loss lot of niggas, some in Club Fed
Few still reminiscin' in they CL
Selling Pete Rock, cruisin' in they V-12
Better know who you is
When you lookin' in the mirror
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Ridin' with my niggas
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'

I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it

Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

Please, pretty please
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
Cause I return the favor like playing to the screen
I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe
You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream

I need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Could you please touch it, touch it, touch it

I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town
The Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on
I don't deny it, baby I just buy it
Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it
Alas, I'm past on my past
I ran like the flash and I saved the best for last

I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

See we can take it slow, or we can take it there
I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair
We both give a little, we just play it fair
You see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare
Put out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare
Let your hair down, I don’t have you pegged as a square
Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless
You my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck
We don't give a damn, who's watching
Me slowing down, not an option
And the buck hair's waving in the wind
You are such a champ how you take it on the chin
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it

It's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna

Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I’m Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc's silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got him feeling like he’s Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue, in the inside's potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit, I’m made of that
Cocaine parties like the 70's, I cater that
You know what fame is?
Sitting with the woman of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is?
Flushing two bricks and trying to have a nigga strain it out the drainage

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It’s like I’m throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael
And they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velour, I’m in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope where real nigga sell yay'
Everyday a nigga dies and we can’t ask why
Showing more love to bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd

Testarossa top models, G4s
Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe, push poison like a copperhead
Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rosé bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills
Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambience
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it’s Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand ki's that I’m about to do Pilates on
Wear the king's crown like the grill a Maserati’s on
Catty corner parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans is pouring in

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It’s like I’m throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico

“It's so hard for me to sit back here in this studio, looking at a guy out here, hollering my name! When last year I spent more money, on spilled liquor, in bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made! You’re talking to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, whoa! wheelin' dealin', limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun and I'm having a hard time holding these alligators down!”

To all hustlas with the same interest
Bow your heads as the Lord's mentioned
Prayer service held in the kitchen
I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen
I’m what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
Then Nancy tried to save us
By that time we had Motorola pagers
Now we push button start motors
Yacht owners, you small ballin', that’s Pop Warner
Menage a trois in the bath house
Blew money on ‘em, bitches never bad mouth
You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out
You open doors, I open jaws and pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle
I’m Scott free with a million dollar bright smile

You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I'm what dreams are made of

Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy
And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy
Bentley with the rag-top yamaka
It says kilometers all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer
I got the fever, I never took a breather
Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether
Like Mike Vick chased by PETA
More pony hairs, more zebras
More pythons, more lizards

I don’t know about y'all, but I’ma get off, cause I’m feelin myself

Oh, what a feelin, the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathed in them millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my Nino, smelling like a kilo
But I’m downy fresh soft white like my pillow
Feelin myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself

Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
Didn't listen, so prison is what they did to him
Accountant unscathed, millions is what they hid through him
Same principles you must adhere

Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas, some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back, I blew a small fortune
Wrestled with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Ric Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous (Woo!)
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid crane kick—no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tightrope walking, tryna keep a level head
But bright lights blind, look at what the devil did

Buyin' biggies, but was ridin' on some 2Pac shit

Land in thе soft-white, cook it till it's off-white

Still the X factor, that's the Rohan in me
Reluctantly a role model
That drowned in too many gold bottles

Faith never waivered as I walked along the fence
Faith moves mountains, so what are you up against?
Watch my brother 'round you bitches, I know he pretends

As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight?
It's only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

Just so you remember who you dealing with
The number don't change, I know who the chemist is
Brick by brick, we kept open dealerships
Mitch by mitch, we built up our villages
Seein' you rappers apply for the stimulus
Livin' a lie, but die for your images
It's guns involved like cowboys and Indians
You Trackhawk niggas are not my equivalent
Flew your bitch to Cuba for the thrill of it
But I ain't go, to show you what you shoulda did

And army fatigue when I talk pyramids

The purest snow, we sellin' white privilege
Designer drugs will turn niggas limitless
Designer clothes, these hoes losing innocence

You Google to death, the shit I get driven in
My boys in the hood is mixed with the menaces

'Cause I done felt too much pain
Money earned in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins

Getting money, baby girl, gold chains

Mama screaming like Mahalia

Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor

Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
But my tribe don't quest like love
Came in this bitch with a mask and a glove
