It's Guwop (Honorable)
(Ha, burr)

You never get a second chance to make a first impression (Huh?)
We both know that you're sexy, I can't wait to get you naked (Well, damn)
You got my dick hard as the department of corrections (Wow)
So stop with all that flexin', baby, bitch, don't miss your blessing (Woah)
You only get one chance to make the first impression (It's Gucci)
I'm all in her intestines to make sure she get the message (Go, go, go)
She let me hit it once and now she comin' back for seconds (Mwah)
That pussy broke the record, had you nuttin' in sixty seconds (Uh, Miami, wow)

He wanna fuck for kicks and I can't fuck if he cheap (Period, hold on)
Let a nigga hit one time, now he buyin' Patek Phillippe (Patek)
Rich nigga, good dick, I gave him ass to eat (Ass to eat)
Gucci purse and a Patek off of pussy power, now that's pushin' P (Okay, okay)
Good credit, long hair, pretty skin, pussy way better (That's pushin' P)
Cuban neck, diamonds wet, Fiji water, clit way wetter (That's wet)
Give a nigga thirty seconds, he'll swear he a go-getter
Bet I leave a nigga where he stand, City Girls pop at Coachella (Period)
Ass sittin' pretty, givin' what it's supposed to
Take a jet, buy a house, bad bitch been bicoastal (Phew)
Private sets, quick to block a nigga if he ever ask me to post him (Block)
Project bitch, if he ain't got no Wraith, then I might ghost him (On God)

She suckin' and fuckin' me, suckin' and fuckin' me
Suckin' and fuckin' me, I be the blessing
Put an arch on your back, let me teach you a lesson (Woah)
Sexy and sexy, it's wet and it's sweaty
Like Tiffany Haddish, lil' baby, she ready (Woo)
Don't want no spaghetti, but buy you baguettes
Her last nigga broke and her last nigga petty
Hit from the back, in that bitch nitty gritty (Smash, phew)
Bitch nitty gritty
On the passenger's side while I play with her kitty (Mwah)
On 85 while I ride through the city (Skrrt)
She took a G6, it's started gettin' wicked (Woah, soo)
It's started gettin' wicked
Had to fuck with the five, he grippin' (God damn)
And she fuck with some niggas we don't like (Who?)
I don't give a fuck, pussy be hittin' (Damn)
Called Rihanna and put her in Fenty (Brr)
I'm a millionare, baby, you trippin' (Go)
All this money gon' cover expenses (Okay)
First impression, you get my attention (Let's do it)
And she bad, she came out the trenches (She bad)
Lil' ghetto, lil' bitch independent (Ooh)
Fuck a rich nigga, baby start trendin'
Fuck a rich nigga, baby start trendin' (Yeah)
Ain't no postin' me, don't need to mention
Fuck me so good, just come get your 
Bottle for bottle, she keep on sippin' (What?)
Gargle for gargle, she go down in Guinness (Ugh)
Had to bag out the fire for the digits
Lil' hood bitch, so I go, "Don't be a menace" (Woo)
Got a ring on her tongue and her titties
She tattoo my name, I'll never forget her (Oh)

Smokin' like a chimney, brought a lot of money with me
This a night you gon' remember, baby, how you gon' forget me? (Wow)
I gave her dick for breakfast and now she talkin' reckless (Huh?)
Say I'm her baby daddy, I ain't even got her pregnant (Well, damn)
I fucked her with protection, but we instantly connected (Yeah)
Nothin' like them other hoes that I instantly rejected (Ho)
Don't compare me to your exes, I like money more than sex
Way before I had a check (Cha-ching), no, I always had a check (Bling)
I'ma shoot for my respect (Grrah), I'ma kill for this Patek (Bah, bah)
Niggas thought they caught me lackin', dinner date with my new blick (Grrah)
Case these niggas think they slick and think I'm thinkin' with my dick (Huh?)
I can't put my dick in just anything, I'm way too fuckin' rich (No)
Think the driver know we fuckin', had to leave old dude a tip (Yeah)
I'm hittin' her from the back, he 'bout to damn near wreck my whip (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The way I'm suckin' her tits, you'd think I'm tryin' to get some milk (Milk)
We left no evidence, she lick my kids straight off her lip, ugh
You never get a second chance to make a first impression (Huh?)
We both know that you're sexy, I can't wait to get you naked (Well, damn)
You got my dick hard as the department of corrections (Wow)
