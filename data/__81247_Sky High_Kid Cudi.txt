I'm, I-I-I'm sky high
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Flashing lights
I go for mine, I got to shine
I'm sky high
Throw your hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody
Like we always do it this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
Feels good to be home baby, feels good to be home

Nigga I'm G-double-O-D Good
Back up in the blogs like a poppin' nigga should be
Never ever was a shoulda coulda woulda type
I am controlling what the people say they like
And no not the label, this is dream on
Play my songs so you can witness what I'm on
Besides 808's, okay now wait
When you hear my album it won't be hard to get a date
Yes M-dub it, I'm kickdrum strummin', hummin'
The product of a suburb is stonecold thorough
Very well-rounded, most people don't know though
Hey is that Diddy in that photo? (Hell yeah)
Back home they don't know what I have went through
To get to you, y'all, everybody
G.O.O.D. Music up in the party
Paparazzi need not bother nobody
You might also like
Can I talk my shit again?
I'm sky high
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker
I'm sky high
The Roc is definitely in the building
I'm sky high
G.O.O.D. Music's definitely in the building
I'm sky high1Embed
