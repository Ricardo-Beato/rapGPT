70 ContributorsAlready Best Friends Lyrics
Jetson came in with a FN
Two girls with him, told me he ain't got a preference
Sat 'em both down and I asked a few questions
Met last week and they already best friends
Already best friends (Mm)
Met last week and they already best friends (Friends, mm)
Met last week and they already best friends (Already)

She's a Georgia State freshman
Told her, "I'ma pull up at your place at ten"
Girl, you look good, I would risk everything
Make mе forget what safe sex is (Ooh)
I'ma finish right now if I don't takе breaths in
I recommend you don't listen to your friends (No)
Shit ain't been the same since they stepped in
Twenty-five deep in the same section
I'm off vodka, you off Hen'
Tell me this ain't somethin' that you do often
I can't say the same, so use caution (Oh, use caution)

Jetson came in with a FN
Two girls with him, told me he ain't got a preference (Oh, yeah)
Sat 'em both down and I asked a few questions
Met last week and they already best friends (Oh, ooh)
Already best friends (Mm)
Met last week and they already best friends (Best friends, friends, friends)
Met last week and they already best friends (Oh, oh)
You might also like
Two at a time layin' in my bed
One at the top and the other give me head
Girl on girl, I love the taste
You can run around, I love the chase
If you need a break 'cause you thirsty
Don't trip 'cause I know you're burnin' up
She said she love me, but she want her to fu-fu-fuck it up 11:11, baby, make a wish and I'ma do what you want
Ain't no more intermission (No), I'm tryna see what you on

Jetson came in with a FN (Ooh)
Two girls with him, told me he ain't got a preference (Baby)
Sat 'em both down and I asked a few questions (Down, down)
Met last week and they already best friends
Already best friends (Friends)
Met last week and they already best friends (Friends, friends, friends)
Met last week and they already best friends

She brought a buddy in
"What you studyin'?"
"Education”
“That's where the money is”
"You think you funny, huh?"
"Yeah, I'm the funniest"
"So what about you?"
Her friend replied, "I don't go to school"
"Okay, what you do?"
"I'm a dancer, and quick question, are you a Cancer?"
I said, "Hell nah, where you dance at?"
She said, "Blue Flame, that shit be jam-packed"
I said, "Damn facts, so where y'all mans at?"
They said, "What's that?"
Smiled at each other and they both laughed
"I don't need a man, she my other half
We got somethin' not a lot of others have
And I feel like I knew her from the past
I mean, at this point, we're like lesbians"
Then they had another laugh
Jetson came in with a FN (Ooh)
Two girls with him, told me he ain't got a preference (Baby)
Sat 'em both down and I asked a few questions (Down, down)
Met last week and they already best friends
Already best friends (Friends)
Met last week and they already best friends (Already, friends, friends, friends)
Met last week and they already best friends (Ooh, oh-oh)15Embed
