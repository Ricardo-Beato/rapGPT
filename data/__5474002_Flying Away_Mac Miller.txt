1 ContributorFlying Away Lyrics
Sour Hour

I'm flyin' away
Here I go, here I go
Got a little bit of drink in my cup
Little something to smoke, a little something to smoke
Call me later, call me later
I ain't comin' back around
Call me later, call me later
'Cause I don't think I'm comin' down

Haha, uh
You can find me way up in the clouds, flyin' through the stratosphere
Don't need three strikes to know I'm outta here
, boy, I ain't even on your radar
Learned to play every single game like it's the playoffs
I ain't got a day job, chillin' for the moment
Blowin' potent, my schedule's pretty open
Eat, chief, grind and sleep
And if I'm in the mood go and find a freak
I am above and beyond, puffin' 'til the weed gone
Eons and eons, I'm tryna get my cheese long
Cup of tea and some china plates to eat on
Tempur-Pedic mattress that I count my sheep and sleep on
Flyer than a helicopter, homie, you a kamikaze
Feelin' good like I popped a molly
Drivin' slow, I ain't gettin' stopped by no cops
Speakers keep punchin' like a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot (Aha)
You might also like
I'm flyin' away
Here I go, here I go
Got a little bit of drink in my cup
Little something to smoke, a little something to smoke
Call me later, call me later
I ain't comin' back around
Call me later, call me later
'Cause I don't think I'm comin' down

Uh-huh, yeah, look
I smoke my weed from the Garden of Eden
Followin' a dream that ain't hard to believe in
My money European, got a market in Sweden
Hittin' on this L 'til it's harder to breath and to see
No iPhone, I got a 'droid, bitch
I'm makin' money now, you unemployed, bitch
Ha, 24, livin' at your moms crib
Get ya ass up, go and get a job, shit
I'm on the road, puttin' money in my pockets
Plus the kid got the finest ho to go to prom wit'
To be honest, I'm the illest now
For real, I'm feelin' like killin' it up in Tinseltown
Ask the bitches I'm hittin', they know I get around
You? Another face in the crowd
I'm stayin' on your girls mind
She screamin' out like it's her first time, ha
"Hey, man, we're out of papers."
"All right. Then get me a toilet paper roll, a corkscrew and some tin foil."
"We don't have a corkscrew."
"All right. Then get me an avocado, an ice pick and my snorkel. Trust me, bro. I've made bongs with less. Hurry up!"Embed
