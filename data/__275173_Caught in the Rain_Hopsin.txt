49 ContributorsCaught in the Rain Lyrics
Soon after I dropped Raw the spotlight creeped up
I received love from fans throughout the world, yeah, seems nuts
Is it God or could it be luck?
I put my toes in the sand and ended up with my feet stuck
When the storm comes, then how should we address it?
My situation with Ruthless turned out to be a blessing
During the time it left every ounce of me affected
But when it was done I saw that I was bound to be a legend
But I'm lost
The fame drivin' me crazy, cry when I'm angry, the game's trying to change me
Sinister record labels got desires to paint me
As the world puts they fucking hands high to embrace me
How would you take it in?
I honestly can't pretend
The only reason I started rapping was to make a friend
And now I got fans who love me for creating sins
You think fame ain't got a dark side? Think again, yo

Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am
You might also like
Yeah, scared I might never get a wife
Closer I move into the limelight shit is like
Girls just want to be next to me 'cause I rip the mic
Sayin' they love me, but the vibe I get isn't right
What if I flop when my album dropped
And went broke? Baby, tell me, would your love just stop?
See I'm in love with you, but you in love with Hop
The struggle's real, but through your eyes it's fun to watch
I swear to god I used to fiend for it
I see the fire but I keep going
I smell the sins from the breeze blowin'
My crew is telling me to beast mode it
I feel like I'm going to hell, I keep it up even my priest knows it
So many women and the money is great
But this life just isn't me and I don't want to be fake
I didn't think that it would come to this day
It's time I put my alter ego to the side and leave him stuck in his grave

Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am
Shit, not anymore, my soul's rotten and sore
I hear a knock at the door, for real
I got a lot to endure, there ain't no stopping the storm
Homie, the top isn't warm, so chill
I think I need my light bulb fixed
As of lately I ain't be getting hyped on shit
Life's a journey, you gotta find your niche
I'm leaving this tight space because I don't fit
Now I'm moving away, my whole life I'ma start it from scratch
As an artist I'm trapped, fuck Hop, Marcus is back
For a while it's gon' be hard to adapt
But I'm willing to go through it, I ain't starving to rap
I'm soul searching, it's like I'm living with no purpose
I tried find a spark to spit but there's no urges
Inside of me for me to pursue it, some people think that I'm stupid
But don't judge if you ain't went through it
I'm out

Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am
Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am
Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am6Embed
