"Quaranta"
"Quaranta"
"Quaranta"
"Quaranta"

This rap shit done saved my life
And fucked it up at the same time
That pain in my heart, I can't hide
A lot of trauma inside
You can see it in my eyes
Could've ended it in seconds
Just time on my side
Show must go on
Bought a ticket, take the ride
Songs are life, but a dead dream
Think he made it, everything ain't what it seems

Nigga, you 40, still doing this shit?
When you gon' stop? But God gon' make you quit
Came from hardships, but changed perceptions
A blessing
You might also like
A lot changed since triple X came out
Bought a few cars and a house
Almost had a spouse, got caught up, she was out
Now I'm sitting here, questioning what life is about
"Can you seperate the life from the music?"
I was clueless, now a nigga foolish
On my own, gotta get to it
Came too far to right now just lose it
Lost everything in pursuit of my dream
Push everyone away, now no one here for me
Now all everyone do is ask
And when you don't have, they just talk behind your back

Nigga, you 40, still doing this shit?
When you gon' stop? But God gon' make you quit
Came from hardships, but changed perceptions
A blessing2Embed
