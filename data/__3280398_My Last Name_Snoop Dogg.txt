10 ContributorsMy Last Name Lyrics
Girl what you tripping for
I don't care 'bout these hoes
I ain't still living in the fast lane
Baby, I've changed a lot
I still deserve a shot
I still want you to have my last name

I gave it to you cause you gotta have it
The Broadus family is so magic
T-Bone, You the baddest
Meet the one of us
Glad us had us ring in mind
I'm 'bout to sing a line
I'm all about you when I'm doing my time
With you on my mind
Rock around a clock, Jay and Beyonce
Michelle and Barack, all of the above
This is black love at its purest
Baby we done been through the forest
I'm talking about growing old with you
Sitting on the porch
Going through storage looking through old photos
When I used to rock the Death Row logo
And you was right there, you still here
So all that arguing, fighting
Let's toast to the night and I need you in my life
And and
You might also like
Girl what you tripping for
I don't care 'bout these hoes
I ain't still living in the fast lane
Baby, I've changed a lot
I still deserve a shot
I still want you to have my last name

I don't think I want to be with no one else but you
Cause you make my life so complete
And that's just how I feel right now for you
So you can take these words as what I say
What I mean
Don't think I'm playing, I'm saying it's truth
This is a lil' something from me to you
Flashy back
Trying to get the passion back
First girl I ever fell in love with
On some East Side long beach dove shit
You wouldn't understand it, even if I told you
Baby boo, nigga really love you
As clear as the sky is blue
Ain't nobody in this whole world ride for Snoop, but you
You're so, so
Girl what you tripping for
I don't care 'bout these hoes
I ain't still living in the fast lane
Baby, I've changed a lot
I still deserve a shot
I still want you to have my last name
(No love no love no no no no)
I still want you to have my last name
(Last name last name last name)Embed
