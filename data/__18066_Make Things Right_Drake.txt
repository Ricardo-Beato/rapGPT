17 ContributorsMake Things Right Lyrics
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

I'm from the city where
People be gettin' lazy, litterin' in the streets
And the club district is poppin' like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers, money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams and dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events, bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot, so girls'll give up the ass
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like Snoopy and Woodstock
Daffy and Bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane and she back where she was
Right back on the bus, it's a shame cause now
At his window she throwin' bricks like Shaq in the clutch
You can see that's shes colder 'cause he doesn't hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her that he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say
You might also like
If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

Now up north there's five artists deservin' a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through chances are that it ain't you
I single-handedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out and the plan's seeming ill
Whenever I'm out in Memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm Andreena mill
Japan and Brazil, the audience screaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'causeEmbed
