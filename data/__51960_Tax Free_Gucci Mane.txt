11 ContributorsTax Free LyricsHoliday Season! Ay!
Tax free, tax free
You get your income tax back, call me
I got dope nigga, you better call me
I need all mine
All tax free
I beat the dope up
Like a step-child
Yeah, the dope's stepped on
Like a step-child
Take a step back
Off the reptile
Yellow crocodile with a gold smile
I move the dope twice, like a kindergartner
Big bag of collard greens
Like I'm the gardener
That Drumma Boy on the track
Run and tell em that
Give this to DJ Drama, tell him
I say run it back
Don't try running off on me
Cause I'mma get you back
You know EA, don't know how to act
I'm taking hits, I"m talking shit
I coach the Squad, I make em blitz
You might also likeI robbed the connect and ain't been broke since
It's the return of Mr. Zone 6
I'm talking shit. Cash shit
I got them bricks
It's the return of Mr. Zone 6, I hit a lick

Tax me? Tax me? Nigga
You can't tax me, I get it dirt cheap
Tax me? Tax me? Nigga
You can't tax me, I get it dirt cheap
You know me, shipping OG
I know the middleman, but he don't know me
Trophies in my car garage
I brought ? for all my fuckin entourage
That murder charge? I beat that!
That pistol charge? I defeat that
Assult with poolstick
Say I commit that
They label me "convict" I don't accept that
Step back like a step-child
The dope's stepped on
My hood the X FilesEmbed
