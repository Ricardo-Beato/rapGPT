10 ContributorsDon’t Forget Who You Are Lyrics
Don't forget who you are, da-da-da-da-da-da
Don't forget who you are
You blessed with it
Baby so marvelous
No one like you, just look around
Yeah, you're too strong to turn around
Don't forget who you are, da-da-da-da-da-da
Don't forget who you are

Beautiful baby, I love you baby
Pray these words may hug you baby
Look into the mirror and say "I love you" daily
Remember your light when the world seem shady
You born with it, adorned with it
A gift to the world, gon' give it
Fearlessly made, no need to be afraid
Angels are with you, the path is laid
Wade in thoughts of you being a star
Truly you'll shine by seeing who you are
Reflections of you, rеflections of me
Your beauty, morе than any eyes can see

Don't forget who you are, da-da-da-da-da-da
Don't forget who you are
You blessed with it
Baby so marvelous
No one like you, just look around
Yeah, you're too strong to turn around
Don't forget who you are, da-da-da-da-da-da
Don't forget who you are
You might also like
A precious jewel you are
Don't forget who and whose you are
Made in His likeness, yeah, you're different
Uniquely specific, young and gifted
You see that in another then you gotta uplift it
Your hair, your skin, the way the sun kissed it
Mystical momma, beautiful boy
Your life is a story for you to enjoy
Wherever you stand, stand in you
Stand in love, stand in joy, stand and do
Everything that you ever dreamed you'd do
Your voice is yours, it'll sing to you

Don't forget who you are, da-da-da-da-da-da
Don't forget who you are
You blessed with it
Baby so marvelous
No one like you, just look around
Yeah, you're too strong to turn around
Don't forget who you are, da-da-da-da-da-da
Don't forget who you are (Don't forget who you are)1Embed
