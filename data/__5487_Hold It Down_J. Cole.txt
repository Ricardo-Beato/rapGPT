38 ContributorsHold It Down Lyrics

If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don’t feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally and everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself, if I was gone who will remember me?
It's hard to tell, oh well, sit back and sip this Hennessy
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
'Cause plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why? I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my momma I'll make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know it's more to life
Then mackin' hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sort of like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they ballin' like The Dream Team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm tryna get it, follow me nigga, I'm on a prowl
Headed to the top, you watching me nigga?
Then hold it down

Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down

You was my nigga from the younger days, we grew up
I went to school, you went the other way
But still my brother man, I'm sitting, reminiscing on
All of them bitches we were tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink we trying to bag some new hoes
And If I need gear, you let me hold ya new clothes, and vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man, a nigga slow caking
I'm broke tryna chase a dream, you just got probation and I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant what’s next?
Oh shit my mama doing drugs, at times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when ya mama tried to beat you with that bat shit?
Remember your chick Nina? Man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina? Yo, she still the baddest
I'm just glad that I can holla at you, it's been a while
And til the next time I hear from you, ay, hold it down

Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down
And these are tough times baby, but we’ll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top, I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling ain't balling but I have better
A woman with an ass and a strong mind, it's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit, sometimes I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart, you don’t want me to be no star though
'Cause groupies out there every show you scared I'm fucking every ho
And girl I ain't gon' lie and say I won't, 'cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength, I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids, the love is real and if we ever part, God forbid
I love you still so when I'm on the road don’t trip, you know I'm down for you
Keep it tight and don’t slip, and hold it down for me

Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down14Embed
