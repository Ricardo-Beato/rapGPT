69 ContributorsFor All My Niggaz & Bitches Lyrics
Well, it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, nigga
See these other fools, but you can't see me, nigga
Who am I? (It's Kurupt, motherfucker)
Do or die (We gives a fuck, motherfucker)
So slow your roll, I'm in control like Janet
The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet
Take it for granted if ya wanna, 'cause I'm gonna
Grab my strap then clear the corner, bitch

To all my bitches and my niggas, and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin' fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin' hands in the air

Now, on a one (One), two (Two), three (Three), who could it be?
Comin' with a grip of gangsta shit for '93
So '94's arrived, nigga, back on up
And let me and my dog Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there, wherever I bails
I put it down all around, 'cause ain't shit for sale
In the coupe with the beat, flossin' off gold Ds
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much for Tha Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for gettin' us all fucked up, now check it
It's a fallout for niggas like those
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin' like hoes
Yes, y'all, walk the dogs, yes, y'all, yiggy-y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball
You might also like
I packs a strap like that, I kicks it like this
Now, how many bitches must get dicked?
Before they say, "Oh, that is that nigga from back in the day
I never, ever thought I'd see him bustin' with Dr. Dre"
'Cause I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be comin' to my flat so I can tap that ass, to all

To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin' fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin' fingers in the air
You're headed my way, nigga, you best to hit a U-turn quick
So what's happenin'? I'm cappin' shit up like a Western flick
The kingpin of the clique, top notch
Seventeen-shot Glock cocked, so all niggas drop
The run of the mill fool get broke off for tryin' to serve the best
Kurupt's era, peep the terror, 'cause it's a murder fest
I smoke chronic every day, so what have we?
Another motherfucker gettin' served like some cavi
Now who drops (Rough rhymes)
I got the Juice like 2Pac (Plus I'm), rollin' with two Glocks
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Hell-raisin' like Pinhead, beware, I'm tearin' shit the fuck up
Slow your roll like your legs was broken
Who's jokin'? Rakim never joked, so why should I, loc?
And that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow, though
Runnin' 'em like Flo-Jo, stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die 'cause I'm servin'
And they can't fuck with or see me, I'm mass-murderous
Smokin' indo, look out my window I suppose (Yeah)
Niggas don't understand how we kicks different flows
I'm raw like news footage, I'm rugged like a BF Goodrich
Bring your whole set and get your hood lynched
Drop to your knees like a dog in heat
Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techniques
To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your motherfuckin' fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

Check it out, it's Rage, ready for the breakdown, take down
When it comes to the mic, I'm puttin' my weight down
And that's a hundred seventy-five pounds of beef
Beatin' your ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with nowhere to go
So, what's a girl to do?
Take out a crew or two, a few, what you wanna do?

Throw your guns in the motherfuckin' air
We don't care (Niggas don't give a fuck, nigga)
About nothin' at all
Just my Doggs and clockin' a grip', bitch (Niggas don't give a fuck, nigga)
That's why I can kick it so tuff
'Cause when times get ruff, my (Niggas don't give a fuck, nigga)
The clique that I'm with don't give a shit
You know why? (Real niggas don't give a fuck)
Now all the bitches and the niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin' fingers in the air9Embed
