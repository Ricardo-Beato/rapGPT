21 ContributorsSUNDAY NIGHT Lyrics
Honorable C-Note

Please don't let nothing get back to me
I've been trying to detach from you
Deep down though, I wanna know about what the fuck you been up to (You been up to)
Old him could have seen that coming
Fuck you I don't need nothing from ya
I was doing pretty good without you
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming)
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming, that a relapse coming)
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming, that a relapse coming, relapse)
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming)

How'd I get so hung up?
How'd I get so hung up?
I know that a "You up?" text would be fucked up, but I'd be lying if I told you I ain't wanna
We used to talk 'til sun up
Now it's Sunday night, something just ain't right
I done aged but I still got the same vices
Starting to wonder if I'm ever gon' shut up
You the one I wanna hear from
I don't hit back loved ones
What's that on my back? One ton
Weighing on me 'cause I had love once, but it's gone now
What you do when it's, just you
And your bedroom walls feel like they could fall down?
Let 'em fall down
You might also like
Please don't let nothing get back to me (Back to me)
I've been trying to detach from you
Deep down though, I wanna know about what the fuck you been up to (You been up to)
Old him could have seen that coming
Fuck you I don't need nothing from ya
I was doing pretty good without you
But something tells me that a relapse coming (It's coming in)
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a, that a, that a, that a)
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse, that a relapse)
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a, that a, that a, that a, ooh)

Do you got somebody new?
Do you got somebody new?
I know that I shouldn't ask for my own sake, but I can't help that I wanna know the truth
But, even if you don't
You ain't gon' tell me if you do
'Cause you don't mind, making me lose my mind
Making me lose my mind
I hope the time I spent back
I tried to brace for impact
But, I still got caught up
Gave it my best, but I'm still not all the
Way over what you did to me
What you did to me
Couldn't say why, but you get to me
But you get to me
(Please don't let me)
Please don't let nothing get back to me (Back to me)
I've been trying to detach from you
Deep down though, I wanna know about what the fuck you been up to (You been up to)
Old him could have seen that coming
Fuck you I don't need nothing from ya
I was doing pretty good without you
But something tells me that a relapse coming (It's coming in)
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a, that a, that a, that a)
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse, that a relapse)
But something tells me that a relapse coming (That a relapse coming, that a relapse coming)Embed
