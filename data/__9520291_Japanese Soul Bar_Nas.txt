Japan, I ask you
Do you love hip-hop music?
Uh

Cigars in the Japanese soul bar, drinkin' scotch 'til daybreak
KD3 had gold bars, these vibranium can't break (Uh)
That's the one
Do music for fun
Give deals to artists (Yeah)
Pull up to the office (Yeah)

Yeah, I'm from the projects, so quadruple in my youthful
So I could boost you, unlimited game I could shoot you (Woo)
I own my masters now, but the reversions is crucial (True)
I used to wonder, was they ever jerkin' the Juice Crew?
Wanted: Dead or Alive should've been platinum five times (G. Rap)
A young Russell, Rick Rubin, and Fly Ty
Ran the music biz (Uh)
Andre Harrell saw the future is
Hip-hop
L'Ermitage hotel balcony, Louis flip-flops
Meetings in the mezzanine (Woo)
With production companies, talkin' 'bout me directin' things
Said I need a CAA, 'stead I went to ICM
Said without an agency, all my chances might be slim
My humble beginnings ain't what my hunger diminished (Uh-huh)
A burnout in this game before I would run into millions (Sheesh)
See, that's a major fumble (Uh)
And I'm made for the jungles (Uh)
So I called Jungle
I said, "Put away the bundles" (Let's go)
Truly, they gon' cry when they see this movie (I know)
No dry eyes in the theater, the viewers are livin' through me (Uh)
Been thinkin' 'bout who could play me in Tokyo, Paradiso, Belize (Yeah)
Karaoke, I'm participatin', singin' Barry
White, that is (Ha)
On a good night like this (Yeah, yeah)
How do I write like this?
First of all, you gotta have a good life like this (Woo)
A real life like this
You might also like
Cigars in the Japanese soul bar, drinkin' scotch 'til daybreak (Uh)
KD3 had gold bars (Yeah), these vibranium can't break
That's the one
Do music for fun
Make deals with artists (Yeah)
Pull up to the office

Make deals to artists
Pull up to the office
Yeah
Konichiwa, yeah
Japanese soul bar, red light bulbs
A turntable, record selection
Pictures and frames from those days
Soul music
Uh

Somebody from Queens brought it live tonight
You, you see a lot of Bronx acts, a lot of Brooklyn acts, but you never see Queens acts in the Fever really
But Nasty Nas, one of the youngest artists out right now, who's doin' this thing, new artist
He's keepin' it live, keepin' it real
This is Nasty Nas
And the whole Queensbridge masters, can I say that?
Now, Nas, you have a different style
I, I, I, I know there's a lot of rappers out there who I'm sure you looked up to over the years
But right now a lot of new rappers and older rappers are lookin' up to you
How do you feel to be like, a, a, a living prodigy?
I mean, it's a pro— it's a blessing
I'm a product of hip-hop, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm a product from— of the old school and the newest of the newEmbed
