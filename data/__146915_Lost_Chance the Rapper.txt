My druggy, love me, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost
Let's get lost

Damn, I'm in so deep, girl, probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak (Igh), damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh, your mama hate me, daddy wouldn't let you
If he ever met me, if he ever met you
Put that shit behind us and put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums, minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh-oh-oh-oh, you been scratchin', you been fiendin'
I'ma fix you, I'ma fuck you, I'ma get rid of them demons
It's my

My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost

Damn, I need a minute, aight, leggo
She fell in love, it fell apart, aight, let go
She met her match, I let her match
She lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah, me mad petty, yeah, me bogus
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, me know
Yeah, she knew too (Igh), it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like, "Fuck it"
So dance for daddy like Gator
Ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room
And find yourself in my grip
I'm sayin'
You might also like
My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost

I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "Pill pop, baby girl, 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek
The masochism that you preach
Practice backflips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
