91 ContributorsWorth It Lyrics
We got London on the track
Got my bae with me, you know what I'm sayin'?

If she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (I'm so high)
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that

I know she livin' for a nigga, dyin' for a nigga
I whip that pussy with no ballers jumpin' out, lil' nigga
That pussy look just like a cut, a soakin' cut, lil' nigga (Woah)
Yeah, I'm a freak, you know I'm pullin' up to lush, lil' nigga (On Blood)
I'd never snooze to lose, I would never snooze to lose on you
Yeah, I'ma give you a couple bands, want some more boobs on you (Want some more)
Hey, I'ma sit back and pay attention like school on you
Yeah, I'ma shoot inside that pussy like a wholly on you
Goddamn, I'm sorry, B, I know you'd accepted my apology
I know that ass fat, apple bottom please
I need a deep throat baby, swallow me
I love it when you're around baby, follow me (Follow)
I only eat green, yeah, koala leaf
We shoot with big guns like a Call of D
She never say no, she ain't stallin' me
I kept my heart locked up in a safe, hey
You can't shoot with a pistol, need a K (Ha)
No, you can't see it, it is tragic by your face (Ooh)
But when it need air, let it out in a safe lil' place
I can see it on her face
You might also like
If she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth it
No these ain't no drugs, I know she worth it
Yah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp (hey)

Damn, I broke her heart, now my heart hurt
I don't know why but I done cut down on that syrup
At least I got that lil' bitch ballin', she don't gotta work
Oh-no-no, she ain't had no job, but she having purses
Yeah-yeah-yeah, she know I'm the truth, places I'm in first
No-no-no, I don't want you bitches, y'all basic and thirsty (Y'all soft)
Yeah-yeah, she taught me well, it took some time, but it was worth it
She get on top and she ride it, Kentucky derby
You should see, I count that money like a nerd bitch
I'ma ball some with my dawgs but they ain't Courage
Her whole body same color, I call it perfect

Since she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (Yeah)
Looked up baby and say goodbye (Bobby Bruh)
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth it
No, these ain't no drugs, I know she worth it
Yah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp24Embed
