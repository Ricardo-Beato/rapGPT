Ah one two, ah one two
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn (ah one two, ah one two)
Breakadawn, breakadawn (ah one two, ah one two)
Breakadawn, breakadawn (ah one two, ah one two)
Breakadawn, breakadawn (ah one two, ah one two)
Breakadawn, breakadawn (ah one two, ah one two)
Break of-

I was born in the Boogie Down cat scan
Where my building fell down on the rats and
People sold the super on a trip to the penile (penile)
While I settle off the shores of the Long Isle
My file is clean, I mean my mind is clear when I transmit
I am the man-ner of the family 'cause the pants fit
I want to let forensics prove that I can mends Groove
With the thread from needle outta hay, wanna say
Salutations to the nation of the Nubians
We 'bout to place you in that 3 Feet of stew again
I got the frequency to shatter Mrs. Jones' perm
I gotta "hey love" all the honies, cost me short term
Tallying a score for the shottie in the jacket
For the brother bes a nigga when he packs it
So get your butt out the sling, I stung Muhammad, float a note
That means I'm def, so like the autographs, I'm signed until the break

Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Break of-

Ayo, groove with the mayor, hazard on the sayer
Wave the eighteen mill', even still
Sack a bag of troubles, make a single double
Loop the coin and join the minimum wage
I had a plan if I was the man, I'd pro the jects
Lay it low and leg mad cassettes
I unconditioned my ways of the everyday sunset
Wagin' my days to the one bet
'Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin'
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
'Cause the days of the breaks be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm exploding
I be the fab, I be the fabulous but see, unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name (ah one two, ah one two)
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
Latchin' on to when I caught the fame (ah one two, ah one two)
Pass the task to ask me 'bout the Native Tongue again, my friend
I tell you, Jungle Brothers On the Run (ah one two, ah one two)
I've shaken hands with many devils in the industry
Believe the Genesis like Phil with stills mean that I'm def
Like the autographs, I'm signed until the break

Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two

We in the mornin', after, and, but in the end I be the is
'Cause in the midst, man, it's alright
Momma got the book into my day-life
My pops got the belt, so best believe we sail the wave
To the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, I stay inside of my gates
Break days mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eye-scan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew old with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz
A simple, "How ya do?" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special
Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew, we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the never-ending factor while I'm on, so tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
('Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo, he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin' up the stream
Plug Wonder Wonder Why you're lonely tonight
We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell
Let's round 'em up and get 'em back to the hotel
Motel, holiday, inn-fact
I'm gonna let you know, once again, that De La Soul
Is sure to show you we will hit the charter harder
Than the normal rappin' bull
(Ah one two, ah one two)11Embed
