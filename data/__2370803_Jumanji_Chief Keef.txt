26 ContributorsJumanji Lyrics
(Yeah)
(It's about that mothafucking time)
(Chief Otto is in the fucking building)
(He Jumanji on you mothafuckas)
(Killing you mothafuckas)

I roll up flexin', rest in peace niggas
Every day is Halloween, trick or treat niggas
I got the loud pack for the sleep niggas
Roll up, get throwed, Bun B niggas
These niggas tryna see how I don't see niggas
'Cause when I look in the mirror I see me, nigga
Like the aliens, you better come in peace, nigga
Or I'm letting animals out Jumanji, nigga

I let some lions out the motherfuckin' board game
You got monopoly money, boy your life's a board game
I got thotty money, but these hoes get nothing
Set to set, dick to dick, these hoes be fucking
Riding in the M6 bitch that's I8 cousin
High-speed chase from the cops, and now they hunting
Make his ass, fumble the ball, now they punting
Imma make it fair and catch the gang, now they running
Tadoe be my running back, he run that shit to the hundred
I got hoes up in Paris, I got bitches in London
I could have a billion dollars, still gotta get me some money
If you a opp caught in the burbs, we leave your shit in the hundreds
Car like a hot wheel, bitch it's a hot car
I'm riding fast in this bitch, going to get my thot
Like I'm in New York pull up on you, give my block
You can't serve here no more, hit the bricks, kick rocks
You might also like
I roll up flexin', rest in peace niggas
Every day is Halloween, trick or treat niggas
I got the loud pack for the sleep niggas
Roll up, get throwed, Bun B niggas
These niggas tryna see how I don't see niggas
'Cause when I look in the mirror I see me, nigga
Like the aliens, you better come in peace, nigga
Or I'm letting animals out Jumanji, nigga

I got the hood bitch I'm no fuckin' board game
I'm Yahtzee with the dice, how I up and roll them
Sosa let me hold some, boy your holdin'
Hold on sit tight, I gotta let my hoe in
Walk up in the party, see my shit swollen
I'm talking bout my pockets, this shit ain't folding
This niggas to dim, these niggas ain't GLOin'
Throwin' money in the club, bitch, rain coated
She say she like her strawberry chocolate coated
I'm ridin' past the border eating guacamole
Alfredo, nigga fuck your mostaccioli
He throwing signs up, like Chief So you gots to notice
I'm Stevie Wonder to the bullshit, with some keys
Since I'm running for the mayor, bitch I get the keys
To the city, bitch I'm pullin' up, with the Ps
Big joints size my feet, smoking Christmas trees (Bang, bang, bang, bang)
I roll up flexin', rest in peace niggas
Every day is Halloween, trick or treat niggas
I got the loud pack for the sleep niggas
Roll up, get throwed, Bun B niggas
These niggas tryna see how I don't see niggas
'Cause when I look in the mirror I see me, nigga
Like the aliens, you better come in peace, nigga
Or I'm letting animals out Jumanji, nigga10Embed
