7 ContributorsR.S.C. for Life Lyrics
'Til the day that I die
I got to be a, killer, then I (Slauson)
I got to be a, killer, then I die (Nipsey Hussle in this)
I got to be (I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die)

Look, I hustle 'til the block done
'Til the motherfuckin' cops come
And shoot 'til the shot done
I'm servin' red rum from the shotgun
I'm bartendin' red rum from the shotgun
The dope potent hit your nose make your snot run
Certified pimp, I could probably knock your top nun
I'm from where if you don't knock, you get knocked on
Thunderdome, you don't sock, you get socked on
You come a boy, you leave a man, that's how I got grown
My real life is better than these niggas rap songs
Guns, money, bitches, and a fast car
Couple hundred thousand buried in my backyard
I'm a real nigga, I don't gotta act hard
Try me if you wanna, watch how I reverse that charge
Guns, money, bitches, and a fast car
Couple hundred thousand stashed in my backyard

'Cause I'm from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I'm from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die

Look, look, black Dickies, gold Rollie, blue Cutlass
I'm hangin' out the window wit' the tool bustin'
Some off-brand shit, I heard the fool fussin'
I'm certified, they still think I'm tryna prove somethin'
The murder high, the dope blow, I'm tryna move somethin'
The spot rollin', now I'm swollen like I bruise money
Nigga, I cruise luxury, up and down the broken blocks
In the city pumpin' poison like a kidney
Focused on my vision
I'm way too young to live the life that I'm livin'
But that's the life I was given
And God'll never give me somethin' I can never handle
And my flow is so hot like wet wax off a candle
I still bag crack and clear rap like a sample
And send pounds out of town to Atlanta for the stamp up
That's my answer, life's like cancer
Nigga, and I'm serious

Nigga, 'cause I'm from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I'm from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I'm from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I'm from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I dieEmbed
