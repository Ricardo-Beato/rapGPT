6 ContributorsSpeak My Language Lyrics
I been young, rich and famous
Seems like the whole world know what my name is
Conversations need translations
You gotta talk money, just speak my language
You gotta talk money, just speak my language
(Talk about that)
You gotta talk money, just speak my language
(We can talk about that)
You gotta talk money, just speak my language
(Getting money real fast)
You gotta talk money, just speak my language

Doin' it with no punch, you feel me...
Look, lifestyles of the young, rich and famous
Money over everything, underneath the interest
I stay strapped cause they never stop hatin'
And I never stop grindin' cause they always want a payment
I pink slipped every whip I ever came in
And always wear a rubber cause these bitches is contagious
So talk money, cause money that's my language
If it ain't that, then nigga don't say shit
Holla at me, I'm prolly a boost some deuce deuces
Chrome feet, leather seats, and the coupe's roofless
A pick of broke niggas, man your crew's useless
You niggas having dollars like we born Jewish
Before rap I made a fortune off the pharmaceutics
And all it took was a Section 8 apartment unit
A mastermind, a little grind, and the heart to do it
Nigga breaking bricks like a martial arts student
Now picture me, blue pradas on a black pavement
Wife beater, blue dickies off my ass hangin'
Trunk bangin', gold chains swangin'
And all money in is the song that I'm sangin' nigga
You might also like
I been young, rich and famous
Seems like the whole world know what my name is

Yeah, everything I do is about money...
Old nine dollar signs, crimes and violent times
Face like I don't play, bet they won't smile in mine
You in the business then you out of line
Send a bullet shower by 'em
See 'em? Yea, they bury 
You don't want them hollows flyin', bet I got my alibi
Goin' on an exotic island where all the models slidin'
You either ride or hidin', quiet or 'bout it 'bout it
Cakin' or  nigga hustle 'fore you cry about it
I got a crowded closet, chinchilla should be
Gated in leather, and my vehicle's 260
What up, Nipsey? Soon as I hit the west I know you
Comin' through to get me with a groupie and a blickie
Quarter P sticky cause I smoke like a hippie
6-3-5-51-51-TIPSY, phone ringin', a 100k blingin'
Money over everything, the song that I'm singin'
I been young, rich and famous
Seems like the whole world know what my name is

Uh, militia to the gang
You heard the voice, you saw the face, you know my name
Niggas be on my dick just like they chick is on my chain
Thang grippin' my grain, paint drip as a drain
Dip in the lane, slain, slip and you crash
Fuck with Nip and the clip'll clap quick as a stripper's ass
My hoodie's a skeleton equipped with the zipper mask
And I wear to help me see through to my temper task
Got us a jabberjaw, talk or jab and his jibs slip
Resulted to give his jibs a jab
I'm all about the guap comma, the hot dollar
The mozzarella, the parmesan, the piccata
The cheddar, the whole guada
Strip shitty, skip cities for trips, kiddies
With henny fifths, plenty fiddies to skinny dip titties
Trying to get this money, dot point, simple as dot point
Make it simple, I got point, you know about it
I been young, rich and famous
Seems like the whole world know what my name is
