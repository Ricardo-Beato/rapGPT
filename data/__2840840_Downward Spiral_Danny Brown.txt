I'm sweating like I’m in a rave
Been in this room for 3 days
Think I’m hearing voices
Paranoid and think I’m seeing ghost-es, oh shit
Phone keep ringing but I cut that shit off
Only time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off
Had a threesome last night, ain’t matter what it cost
Couldn’t it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft
Had to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed
Been grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw
Nothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring
Your worst nightmare for me is a normal dream
And if I learned anything
Is don’t nod off with ya motherfucking cigarette burning
Knocking on my door but I won’t answer
Residue on mirrors, Jojo dancer

And it's a downward spiral
Gotta figure it out (out)
I gotta figure it out (out)
I gotta figure it out
Cause it's the downward spiral
I gotta figure it out (out)
Gotta figure it out (out)
I gotta figure it out
You might also like
Everybody say, you got a lot to be proud of
Been high this whole time, don’t realize what I done
Cause when I’m all alone, feel like no one care
Isolate myself and don’t go nowhere
Smoking blunt after blunt, 'til my eyes start burning
Hennessy straight got my chest like a furnace
Drowning frustrations in a ocean of sin
Thinking irrational, I have no emotions
Cold cold world, some might say
Freezing on the snow, brain feel a bit frostbit
Nauseous, don’t know the last time I ate
But I eat these fucking rappers like fucking last steak
On death row, feel like I am
You never know, one day you're here, the next you're gone
So I put it all up in these songs...

And it's a downward spiral
Gotta figure it out (out)
I gotta figure it out (out)
I gotta figure it out
Cause it's the downward spiral
I gotta figure it out (out)
Gotta figure it out (out)
I gotta figure it out15Embed
