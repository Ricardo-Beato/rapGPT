5 ContributorsNY Confidential LyricsYo, Call me M-A
Nigga jam like Jimmay
Caught a rimmay, make em strip like Timmay
Niggas know my shit hot like tamale
In the V with 3 squales, no time to polly
M dot A dot J O R, may go far
Love how I lay those bars
Play those cars
Shit chromed out, zoned out
Club bound, these clowns show me love now
Mad years still at it, these niggas had it
On the radio's most added
Plus I got the street too and the 32-5
Rap for the love but gotta eat too, what
I got it covered like glove to hand
Whose the man, mad chicks love the van
They all wanna get in it then sit in it
Even fat ones, that can't fit in it
Cause they know my teams' special
Lay you on your back and undress you and bless you, yes you
It really is no task, getting the ass
The I-class, wood dash, making it last
I'm trying to see platinum plus, kick dust
Fabulous, trust, in god we must
Stay hot like hundred degrees, LP's & CD's
Hard to believe these, cops & DT's
Got lead like a pencil
How it feel when the world against you
You know we bench you
Keepin' yall high is essential, yo N-Y confidential
You might also likeYo, knocking BIG in the big Benzs'
Georgio frames with no lenses, and dont know who my friends is
The rap game ain't nothing but snakes, nothing but fakes
That dont stop like no brakes
Thats life ain't it, niggas know the world tainted
Try to paint it, picture that, then frame it
I stay true in it, keep doing it, yo
Raps out my face til im blue in it
Put glue in it if youre trying to stick
These I N C niggas wrong ones to pick, must be sick
Must dont love your life, gun or knife
Must dont love your wife
On the radio drop gems, 200 a spin, locked in
Top of the chart, popping your heart
Lot of shit with me, dont I, blow the spot won't I
Fuckin with me's like poking out your own eye
I take it back, like a u-turn, I do burn
To whom it concern, niggas dont learn
All my people on the Hill like Lauryn, keep scoring
Getting G's like Warren
I'm trying to see platinum plus, kick dust
Fabulous, trust, in god we must
Stay hot like hundred degrees, LP's & CD's
Hard to believe these, cops & DT's
Got lead like a pencil
How it feel when the world against you
You know we bench you
Keepin' yall high is essential, yo N-Y confidential
Yo, Tarantino, roll like El Camino
New three chrome drop, maraschino
Red with the beige guts, front for what?
Looking crisp in a black mans wish, dont diss
Lotta hoes with new clothes & Parasuco's
Looking for those Lexo's & Expo's
Lotta rappers smelling theyself & telling theyself
They the hottest the shit on market to ever spark it
Soon they ain't hot no more, not no more
Songs ain't blowing up the spot no more
Got no tour, got no fans and no plans
No more Lex land's and shows for 10 grand
I drop shit thats toxic and make a cop get bru-tal, its futile
Second chance like a new trial, trying to win
Trying to blend, trying to get in, trying to fit in
The rap game ain't nothing but cliques, up in the mix
Up in these chicks, up in the blue six
Knocking Busta-buss, trust us
Flows is lus-cious, you can't crush us!
I'm trying to see platinum plus, kick dust
Fabulous, trust, in god we must
Stay hot like hundred degrees, LP's & CD's
Hard to believe these, cops & DT's
Got lead like a pencil
How it feel when the world against you
You know we bench you
Keepin' yall high is essential, yo N-Y confidential1Embed
