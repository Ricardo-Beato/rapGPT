30 ContributorsGeto Heaven Part Two LyricsGod bless...

Know I love my baby; my baby loves me
Day gets so hectic, need a little company
It's quarter to eleven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto...

Searching for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third eye on the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and to rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we're not together
Baby, it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Henrock and the Holy Spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall
Of a nation, even when the buildings tumble, I still stand tall
I walk through the valley with a life preserver
Feeling at times, that I might just murder
Yo, but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock or any broad
He found Geto Heaven in himself and God
You might also like
Geto Heaven
It's time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven
It's time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto...

Love, your happiness don't begin with a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man?
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You'll never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
'Cause one man fucked up, men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At that destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, anybody seems warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop at a store
For you to grow, he had to go, so what you stopping him for?
Not even I could ignore being alone is hard
Find heaven in yourself and God
You know I love my baby; my baby loves me
My day, it gets so hectic, need a little company, yeah
It's 3-1-7, it's time to get some Geto Heaven
(Time to get some Geto Heaven)
Geto Heaven (Geto Heaven) it's time to get some Geto Heaven
Time to get some Geto Heaven, oh...

This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, joe, it's like a trigger to me
Dealing with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doing something you like to support daughters
Keeping your guys from collecting court orders
Conveying messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the in thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I opened it and used it hoping you could grow to it
Whether servant or a surgeon, you gon' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps towards hotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, yeah, yeah
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby...2Embed
