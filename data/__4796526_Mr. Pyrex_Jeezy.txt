7 ContributorsMr. Pyrex Lyrics
I'm here for thug motherfucking motivation, nigga
Give a fuck what you niggas think
I'm here to motivate the thugs and get this bread, nigga
Other than that, nigga, it's nothin'
Huh, yeah
What they call that nigga?

Mr. Pyrex, Mr. Pyrex (Working, working, yeah)
Mr. Pyrex, Mr. Pyrex (Working, ha-haa)
Just closed a million dollar deal behind curtains (Hey)
Mr. Pyrex, Mr. Pyrex (Working, working)
Mr. Pyrex, Mr. Pyrex (Working, working)
Mr. Pyrex, Mr. Pyrex (Working)
One-point-seven in the bag, that's for certain (For certain)
Mr. Pyrex, Mr. Pyrex (Working)

You niggas know I've done it, you niggas saw how I did it (Yeah)
Got the eye of the tiger, guess I was over competitive (Hey)
Adrenaline, discipline, I'm gon' need me some Ritalin (Damn)
And I ain't serving these niggas, guess I'm gon' need me some middlemen (Ha-haa)
That boy moving militant, like he fresh out the military (Yeah)
They want me to fall off (Fall off), that closer to Nevervuary (Yeah)
My vision in legendary (Huh), my hustle is necessary (Woo)
It's grind over pride, nigga (Yeah), you slip or you slide, nigga
Can't have it no other way (Yeah), you broke or you're tired, nigga (What's up?)
You can't be both (Nah), that's when your bitch get ghost (You already know what it is)
Possession, intent, you do the job or get fired, nigga
Don't pull her underwear, she pull them shits to the side, nigga (You already know what it is)

I beat the feds, bitch (Yeah), I'm as smart as they come (Ayy)
Take them bricks out there wrapped, they look like teeth with no gums (Ha-haa)
That chopper came with a drum (Boom), Travis Barker a nigga (Barker a nigga)
Couple mill' on that stove, Betty Crocker for figgas
The way I'm scraping this pot, you'd think this shit was delicious
Now the whole kitchen dirty, I gotta do all the dishes (Damn)
G, G, G for the gutter, you niggas know where I'm from (Know where I'm from)
Blew all the money fast, you niggas know what I'd done (Ayy)
Got scorpions on it, you niggas know how they coming (Know how they comin')
Balled in Europe all summer, you niggas know I ain't fronting
Party to San Tropez, then took the chopper to Monaco
Same young nigga that had them rocks at the Amoco

Just closed a million dollar deal behind curtains (Curtains)

Whether we in them boardrooms or we in the block, nigga
We still gettin' itEmbed
