47 ContributorsUltra Violent Lyrics
You have interfered with our affairs for the last time
Yeah, yeah
Ch-ch-check, mic check, one, two
Straight from the underground type shit
When I write shit, yeah, type shit, ayo (Ayo)

Behind the mic or on the MPC is where you’ll find him
Fucking waste of life, you should’ve died in the condom
17 days, your whole shit beyond too weak
I grip the mic and blow the spot like plastique
The bomb atomically, the lyrical anomaly, bitch, I'm on one
Yeah, you fucking with the wrong one
I wrote this shit backstage in an arena
Pep and Jordan sippin' Pellegrino, never Aquafina
Been through a lot of pain, yeah, that’s word to Gina
I grip the mic like a machete, fuck
Grip the mic like a machete, get ready, don’t do me petty
Or I’ll do you like Bruce Willis did that boy Zeddy
Feeling arrogant, all up in your system like heroin, it’s easy
Know my beats bumpin' like Deezy
"Wu Tang Forever," get the C.R.E.A.M., shit's breezy
Whip out my dick, how it taste?
I’m cummin' on your face, I’m a savage, your shit is average
Yeah, ha, on this day, we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of, bitch, I creamed up and rolled out
Illest motherfucker on the scene, don’t bring yo' hoe out
Louis on my feet, best believe I'ma show out
My shit bananas, no doubt, huh
Yeah, you bet' not bring your ho out
You motherfuckers ain’t got no clout
Kick in the door, waving the .44
Bobby-Boy ain’t never rapped on some shit like this before
Contradictin' himself on every other song
I got different calls for different occasions
This shit is amazing, now let me run that shit back, I fucked up
Listen, listen, ayo, contradictin' himself on every other song
I got different moods for different occasions, my shit is amazing
Barely scratching the surface, I’m barely fucking grazing
On the beat machine, dropping gems like black raisin
I gotta leave the booth 'cause my homeboy's blazing
Tryna get so high that not a fuckin' thing faze him
