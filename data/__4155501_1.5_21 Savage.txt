My earrings cost a half a ticket, I don't hear the same shit y'all niggas hear
On God

Pockets on Cheez-Its, heavy on the cheddar (Cheddar)
Run off with your money, Savage a.k.a. Jerry Heller (Heller)
Too much drip, I'm rainin', bought a Gucci umbrella (Umbrella)
Why you always trippin' bitch? You must look up to Ella (Ella)
It's only the first night and she keep tryna snuggle (Snuggle)
I slept on my back just so I ain't have to cuddle (Cuddle)
Nothing 'bout me average, hit her with a Fendi rubber (Straight up)
Feel like a magician, all these bitches that I juggle (Straight up)
'Rari red, Bentley black, got a Demon and a Cat
Check the stats, all facts, rap made me a lot of racks
Down bad, caught a flat, change his tire, he got jacked
Ass fat, waist snatched, can I get some of that pussycat?

1.5 (1.5) on the ride (On the ride)
Niggas die (Niggas die) when we slide (When we slide)
Draw the line (Draw the line) pick a side (Pick a side)
Ain't no switchin' (Ain't no switchin') on my guys (On the gang)
1.5 (1.5) on the ride (On the ride)
Niggas die (Niggas die) when we slide (When we slide)
Draw the line (Draw the line) pick a side (Pick a side)
Ain't no switchin' (Ain't no switchin') on my guys (On the gang)

Offset!
Catch a vibe (Vibes)
The doors go up, suicides ('Cides)
The diamonds poke your eyes (Eyes)
Don't tread my gang, they shiest (Gang)
I don't take advice (Nah)
I don't care 'bout price (Woo)
Sticks, the boss don't fight (Brr)
Flippin' bricks in the loft at night (Bricks)
Told her "Get what you want, I swipe" (Hey)
Hop in the Lambo, brains open (Skrr)
My chain soakin' (Soakin')
Codeine in my vein, I'm strokin' (Codeine)
I put her head in motion (Bow)
This Patek right here a trophy (Patek)
Passed out on the Hermès sofa (Hey)
Straight face, this a game of poker (Game)
The green Lambo a ogre (Skrr)
We pass the bitch (Bitch)
Got to flippin' the bitch in the wrist (Flippin' the bitch)
Just ask your bitch (Ask her)
I fuck, no kiss (Smash)
Walked right in this bitch, don't touch me, don't get frisked(Nah)
Let's get lit (Lit)
