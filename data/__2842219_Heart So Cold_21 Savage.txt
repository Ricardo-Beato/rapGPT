15 ContributorsHeart So Cold Lyrics
So cold
My heart so cold

My heart so cold, I can never fold
I'm on the paper chase, man, fuck these hoes
I'm poppin' pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle 'cause I hate being broke
And, man, this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
And, man, this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit

My heart so cold, I'm sticking to the code
Fake niggas bend, real niggas don't fold
I'm tricking J's daily, selling sheetrock for blow
In my younger days, nigga, I was robbing stores
Still got it for the low
Judge give you the book, hang your ass without a rope
When you at the bottom, seem like you ain't got hope
And when you got kids, nigga, anything will go
Green dots at funerals, they got my head fucked up
Can't digest these Percocets, they got my chest fucked up
Pussy-niggas shot me six times, my luck fucked up
Hundred band lick, pussy-nigga, now I'm fucked up
You might also like
My heart so cold, I can never fold
I'm on the paper chase, man, fuck these hoes
I'm poppin' pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle 'cause I hate being broke
And, man, this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
And, man, this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit

Fast paper had me dropping out of school
Violating laws, breaking all the rules
Smoking marijuana, riding with them tools
Hanging 'round hustlers, robbers, and fools
Hand to hand with strangers, watching from an angle
Praying for an angel, protection from danger
'Cause I done seen plenty niggas died that had a banger
And I done seen them niggas' partner ride out of anger
And never came back, about them greenbacks
Now have you seen that? These are obscene facts
And just because we paid, the stress don't decay
Still thinking 'bout them losses, winning never made 'em fade
With Gs being dead and  on my mental
It hurt so bad that I can't do the shit I didn't do
To keep my niggas here with me, I swear that shit be killing me
I hope you niggas feelin' me, 'cause I know that you hearing me
And just because we smile and play
That don't mean that everything is going okay, no
Man, just because we smile and play
That don't mean that everything is going okay
My heart so cold, I can never fold
I'm on the paper chase, man, fuck these hoes
I'm poppin' pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle 'cause I hate being broke
And, man, this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
And, man, this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit3Embed
