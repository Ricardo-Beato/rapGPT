We may not know which way to go on this dark road
(Mr. Duckworth)
All of these hoes make it difficult
Session 10, breakthrough

One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's when I unite
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?
(And I'm tripping and falling)
It's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
Sleep, I ain't nevеr had affairs with that
What's fair when the hearts and thе words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
(And I'm tripping and falling)
I care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much
I shut down too, I ain't there too much
I'm a complex soul, they layered me up
Then broke me down, and morality's dust, I lack in trust
(And I'm tripping and falling)
This time around, I trust myself
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Look myself in the mirror
Amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
I fought like a pitbull terrier
Blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, "Carry 'em"
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived
Even my strong points couldn't survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg
You might also like
I love when you count me out (Huh)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
I love when you count me out
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up
How you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (Wah, woo, wah)
How you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep? (Sheesh)
Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (Vroom, vroom)

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (Huh, huh)

When you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?
Three-thirty in the mornin', scroll through the call log (Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Ain't nobody but the mirror lookin' for the fall off (Brrrt)

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo
It's gon' take more than pride to stop me
Call 9-1-1, I caught a body
Sun up now, and yesterday is fadin'
Healing's only 'bout a mile away
Let me tell you 'bout the woman I know (That's my baby)
I know karma like to follow us strong (Sheesh)
I know millionaires that feel alone (Sheesh)
Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
Many find they life in a phone
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up

You said I'd feel better if I just worked hard without liftin' my head up
That left me fed up
You made me worry
I wanted my best version, but you ignored me
Then changed the story, then changed the story
Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please
(Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated)
Tryna keep my good conscience in rotation
Thoughts in my head, they livin' there with no— (Tryna keep my good)
I made a decision, never give you my feelings
Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
Some put it on the Devil when they fall short
I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
Sometimes I fall for her, dawg

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (True, true)

Miss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)
(Miss Regret) Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Some things I can't forget
Lord knows, I tried my best
You said it's not my best
I came up out my flesh
Something's up, must confess (Ah, ya)
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Spoke my truth, paid my debt (Ah, ya)
Can't you see I'm a wreck? (Ah, ya)
Let me loose, I digress (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)
Anybody fightin' through the stress? (Ah, ya)
Anybody fightin' through the—?57Embed
