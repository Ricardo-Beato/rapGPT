14 ContributorsGet The F... Outta Dodge Lyrics
Yo, this is a different neighborhood (Yeah)
You know what I'm sayin'? Word up man
Yeah, rockin' on boomin' ****
They, they got no cussin' version for nobody, man
Rockin' on boomin' ****
Ya goddamn right

I was wheelin' with the boom in the back
The treble was level, I like it like that (Yeah!)
I was rolly-roll-a-roll rollin'
A Five-O looked and said, "Hold it!"
And I stopped still, I never got ill
Cus my license was clean and I showed it
A peace pow-wow Instead of pow-pow
I'm straight up and I'm straight, how you like me now?
A brother know how you do, you're straight from Babylon (Yeah!)
A brother know how you do, you're straight from Babylon
They said turn it down, this is a new law
You never seen us before, but we're raw like a war
They warned me once, they warned me twice
So I knew I was warned, they had it goin' on
I got the **** outta dodge with my Bronco
Sixty miles an hour, one mile to go
And I be pumpin' the sound, drownin' out the cars
Which tape should I rock, LL's or ours?
I'm in the streets of New York (Go away!)
I pop in my Kool G Rap and Polo tape
They was at it again, sirens in the air
(Aw, ****) So I'm outta here (Yeah!)
But the blue in the front called the blue in the back
They cut me off, stopped me dead in the tracks
But this is minimal, I'm not a criminal
Always did what I did because I'm not a kid (Yeah!)
And I looked around, they stared me down, told me what I did
I ain't with it
Cause word around town was a stickup, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah!)
B-boy ***** in a pickup
But I was jeepin' and creepin', just a kissin' it down, sound
Here we go, the run around
Blamin' me for my hardcore roar
But they the one with the forty-four
I'm just coolin', I know the beat is rulin'
Too loud for the crowd, the bass is large, yeah
So I'll get the **** outta dodge
That's right y'all, El Commando
El Commando, you're in demand-o
You might also like
Sgt. Hawkes and I'm down with the cop scene
I'm a rookie and I'm rollin' with a SWAT team
Packin' a nine, can't wait to use it
Crooked cops, yeah that's my music
Up against the wall don't gimme no lip son
A bank is robbed and you fit the description
Now I ain't your mama and I ain't your pops
Keep your music down or you might get shot
This is a warnin', so watch your tail
Or I'm a have to put your *** in jail
I'm the police and I'm in charge
You don't like it, get the **** outta dodgeEmbed
