21 ContributorsBack to the Bando Lyrics
Back to the bando, we go
Back to the backseat they loving the flow
QC they call us Deathrow
We ain't straight outta Compton, we straight out the Nawf
DJ Durel, give 'em hell!
Bando part two

Trappin' out the houses, boards on the windows
Trappin' out the houses, where we came from
Trappin' out the houses, where we at
Trappin' out the houses, trap trap trap
Trappin' out the houses, boards on the windows
Trappin' out the houses, where we came from
Trappin' out the houses, that's where we at
Trappin' out the houses, trap trap trap

Trapping out the houses, with boards on the windows
A lot of y'all claim bandos but I know y'all pretenders
You know we the beginners, originate inventors
If you knocking at my bando more than twice you cannot enter
Fishscale rocking
Cooking in Versace
Niggas baller blocking
Feds still watching
Molly sent in, percocet, xans
Break a whole pound down, cap off extra grams
Trap season â€˜come tax season, Uncle Sam
Bricks all white like the hair off of Sisqo
Pots real greasy like I wiped it down Crisco
Pulled up on a young nigga ask him what he lick for
50 packs in the hood because I made it rappin'
Gave a cutie to my niggas down the road I made it happen
Gave straps to my niggas that I knew was bout that action
Birds sangin', Toni Braxton, in my trunk, I'm swerving traffic
You might also like
Trappin' out the houses, boards on the windows
Trappin' out the houses, where we came from
Trappin' out the houses, where we at
Trappin' out the houses, trap trap trap
Trappin' out the houses, boards on the windows
Trappin' out the houses, where we came from
Trappin' out the houses, that's where we at
Trappin' out the houses, trap trap trap

Trapping out the houses, got more cheese than mouses
Kicking in your door, I'm looking for the fucking ounces
Wave around that chopper I'm intimidate spouses
Flipping over sofas, found a 100 in the couches
20 bales of soft, I let that alarm go off
Jerz know he slurred trippin to let one off
What the fuck nigga, you trippin', you want the police to run up in the house?
He said he won't give the key up to the safe, I'm bout to put this strap in his mouth
Back to the bando, we go
Back to the backseat they loving the flow
QC they call us Deathrow
We ain't straight outta Compton, we straight out the Nawf
I'm in da city like Dro
Roll a backwood, no drough, lotta cookie dough (girl scout)
Broke niggas tickle me, Elmo
Bando part 2 on the radio
You niggas are Captain-Save-A-Hoe
I'm a bit better than a playa hoe
You niggas go to them local shows
My bank account is on overload
Y'all niggas ain't put your wrist in the pot
Get you a knot, they go come to yo a spot
Trap out the bando, cause niggas they watch
Hit you artillery, niggas gon' plot
Trappin' out the houses, boards on the windows
Trappin' out the houses, where we came from
Trappin' out the houses, where we at
Trappin' out the houses, trap trap trap
Trappin' out the houses, boards on the windows
Trappin' out the houses, where we came from
Trappin' out the houses, that's where we at
Trappin' out the houses, trap trap trap4Embed
