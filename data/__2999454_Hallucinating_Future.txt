Astronaut
Yeah yeah

I seduce you with this Aston Martin
I bought today
Oh, you done did more drugs than me?
You must be hallucinating
Oh, you did more percs than me?
Then you must be hallucinating
Don't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan
I seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way
Chanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today
That bitch get on my nerves, man
I had to send her out to Saint Tropez
Oh you done blow more cheques than me, boy?
Then you got to be hallucinating

I'm a young nigga with this cheque and I fuck it up
The freshest thing that I ever bought was that Bentley truck

I could turn a stripper to a diva
Chinchilla on her, that's a PETA
Shawty light the gun like Bonita
Rockstars goin' like the Beatles
I took styrofoams to the meeting
Three cellphones when you greet me
Got a bitch waiting in the lounge
I done had to move a few pounds
You might also like
Looking at my chain, don't drown
Andy put the diamonds in his mouth
All bad bitches pop out
When a nigga steppin' out the house
Every day we walk the red carpet
Every day one of my hoes fallin' in love

I seduce you with this Aston Martin
I bought today
Oh, you done did more drugs than me?
You must be hallucinating
Oh, you did more percs than me?
Then you must be hallucinating
Don't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan
I seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way
Chanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today
That bitch get on my nerves, man
I had to send her out to Saint Tropez
Oh you done blow more checks than me, boy?
Then you got to be hallucinating

I'm a young nigga with this cheque and I fuck it up
The freshest thing that I ever bought was that Bentley truck
All I do is pop more bottles and give 'em to you
All they ever do is bring more problems than listen to
My chains, my ring gon' bling, they do all the seducin'
I was kickin' shit with yo' bitch, she did all of the choosin'

Looking at my chain, don't drown
Andy put the diamonds in his mouth
All bad bitches pop out
When a nigga steppin' out the house
Every day we walk the red carpet
Every day one of my hoes fallin' in love

I seduce you with this Aston Martin
I bought today
Oh, you done did more drugs than me?
You must be hallucinating
Oh, you did more percs than me?
Then you must be hallucinating
Don't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan
I seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way
Chanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today
That bitch get on my nerves, man
I had to send her out to Saint Tropez
Oh you done blow more cheques than me, boy?
Then you got to be hallucinating
I'm a young nigga with this cheque and I fuck it up
The freshest thing that I ever bought was that Bentley truck

It's a lot weighin' on my shoulders
I ain't ever gon' fold up
I had turbo'd off my motor
I was pushin' boulders
I gave you some closure when I bought the Rover20Embed
