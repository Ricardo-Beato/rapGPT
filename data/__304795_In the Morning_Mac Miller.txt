42 ContributorsIn the Morning Lyrics
Um, she say she love me for these cold-ass raps
Wanna be involved but no strings attached
Listen, honey, I'm feelin' kinda hungry
Go to dinner with ya girls, can you bring somethin' back?
It's unusual that I would feel so strong
The party upstairs, you waitin' in the lobby
Fuck cares, valet the Ferrari
Bright Vegas lights get alarming, I'm sorry
Too drunk for sex, I might pass out early
Just keep it wet and I'll hit it in the morning
Glory, free-fallin' forty-three stories, cordially sippin' forties
Hooked up to morphine, for sure clean like bald heads
I kinda wish that we would fuck more and talk less
Except me and you a little far-fetched
Reach for the stars, got my arms stretched, God bless

I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the light
Hope you'll be there in the morning
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
Just hop off for the night
Know I'll be there in the morning

And I, I need a cool bitch, conversation skills
Roll blunts and in love with Darth Vader films
Love to sit there and chill when I play the keys
When it turn to fall, she love to go and rake the leaves
Make-believe, used to dream of bein' Ann Marie
Or a model for Maybelline
But fantasies tend to die off when you grow up quickly
Her walls the exact same color as a Tiffany box
Make her waffles, solvin' riddles on her Popsicle stick
If she could, she would leave in a rocket ship
The way she feel got her nervous like a doctor's trip
Mom said she should see a psychologist
Say she love me for my cold-ass raps
Never tell me where the cocaine stashed
She up late worried, tell me, "Hurry up home"
Eleven missed calls on my phone, woah
You might also like
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the light
Hope you'll be there in the morning
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
Just hop off for the night
Know I'll be there in the morning
