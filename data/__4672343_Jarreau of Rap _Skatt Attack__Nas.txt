42 ContributorsJarreau of Rap (Skatt Attack) Lyrics
Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily
Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily

Everybody's not gon’ get you but keep going
I be cruising 40,000 feet like I'm a Boeing
Doubting me, they said I would have no longevity
Instead I'm steadily repping these fundamentals
I assemble these sentences
’Cause someone said that I've been unadventurous
I've been uninterested, learning life is what matters
Chill, I'm the humble bragger
I could son a rapper, every one of you rappers
Vámonos, I be running you rappers
Adios, I don't see none of you rappers
All of y'all under me rappers
I need to golf, need a day to relax
Get a massage, Al Jarreau on the track
Al Jarreau of rap, made the Mets hat
More famous than Strawberry, y'all know this already

Here's our symphony
A measure by measure, a pleasure of harmony, melody
Here’s the memories
I used to play 40th and Vernon every yesterday
You might also like
Had a lot of losses
It hurt a lot losing cats but it was worth it
I gave a lot, giving back still
I catch heat ’cause I'm black and I’m ill
And I'm real and made millions and they in they feelings
They can't hide it
I don't internalize it, I ignore it
I was taught to observe it
Not absorb it, so I don’t absorb it

Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, stumbling, tumbling, fumbling

Evolution of a man and his music
The ill fill of harmonic symphonic acoustic
My Wikipedia just said it, I'm multimedia
When you rock O2 arena
You made it then it's crazy and now you gotta rock stadiums
I played it some where you tuck away and play the cut
Then they front
Then the shade come, they try to say that your day is done
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody
Married to harmony
