Woo!
Music up, please
One, two, three, four...

Born and raised in the USA
By way of New Orleans where the killers stay
Okay... uh, uh
Alright, yeah
Born and raised in the USA
Where the government's watching what you do and say
Hey, haha
Alright, yeah
Well, I'ma tell you this story 'bout a nigga with glory
Yeah, I come from piss-poor, and now I live in six-story
Houses, haha
Now how's this? Yeah, ha
Listenin' to my own voice in my black Rolls Royce
Get the girls of my choice to take off their shorts
And blouses
I take off my trousers, yeah!
You don't know nothing about this, yeah
I'm a dope boy wit' a guitar

Hey, daddy, can you let me
Ride with the band in the back seat?
Ridin' with the dope boy
(I'm, I'm a dope boy wit' a guitar)
Tell them if they're lookin' for me
I'm on the road to the next city
Ridin' with the dope boy
Dope boy with a guitar
You might also like
Born and raised in the USA
By way of New Orleans, where the killers stay
But that's okay, yeah
That's alright, yeah
I'm loved and praised in the USA
My ancestors were slaves in the USA
But not today
It's alright, yeah, come on!
Oh, oh
I'm a dope boy wit' a guitar

Hey, daddy, can you let me
Ride with the band in the back seat?
Ridin' with the dope boy
(I'm, I'm a dope boy wit' a guitar)
Tell them if they're lookin' for me (Tell 'em)
I'm on the road to the next city (Woo!)
Ridin' with the dope boy
Bridge!

Born and raised in the USA (US)
Where my president is B-L-A-C-K (Oh)
Where my president is B-L-A-C-K
Where my president is B-L-A-C-K
I was born and raised in the USA
And all I wanna do is play
So turn me up (Yeah!), turn me up (Yeah!)
So turn me up (Yeow!), turn me up3Embed
