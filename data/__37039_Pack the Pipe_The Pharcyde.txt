I dedicate this to buddah
This is our song dedicated to smokin' weed
'Cause we smoke lots of mad weed all the time (Mad, mad, mad)
So Tre, Tre (We got what you want, Copenhagen)
Since we smoke a lot of mad weed (Give the people buddah)
Indo, gentlemen (Yeah, um, hahaha)
You must love the buddah (Listen, man, your mama's weed theme is hip-hop)
You gotta smoke some bomb, man

Trapped in the cockpit at forty thousand feet
The sky is the limit, but we supersede
The greed for the speed is, like, way beyond limits
I grab my parachute with, like, forks and spoons in it
And I'm falling, I'm falling, my heart rapid rushes
Death before my eyes, oh, why did I trust this?
My reactions are repeated over and over and over
Oh, it seems like I will never be sober

Pack it up, pack it in (I get high, I love gettin' high)
Pack it up, pack it in (I'ma get high 'til I die)
Pack it up, pack it in (Can I have a light? Where is my bud?)

The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe

I look in every hip-hop magazine, it seems
That the blunts are being passed around the scenes in teams
And the ganja man with contraband in lesser amounts
I guess 'cause understands he has his chance, he passes like Fouts
But his pass is incomplete, 'cause I can tell in the smell
To let the dutchy pass me by, let the left catch hell
If I wanted to smoke tobacco, I'd get a skinny white bitch
I know that Fatlip carries a pack to cure the nicotine itch
Because the only itch I have is for the indo or sess
So don't pass me that mess or try to even protest
That it's adding to the flavor 'cause the old one was fine
Won't you pack the pipe and keep it moving down the line?

The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe

I got a big ol' blunt, I'm lampin' on my front porch
About to put a torch to it, then Coco said, "Don't do it
Please don't hit that shit in front of my little four year old son"
She sent him inside the house, meanwhile, my Sheri steadily rolled one
After the other, then another 'cause I'm rollin' in the dough
So we rolling the indo as if the kid didn't know
He's lookin' through the window, yo, why we tryna hide it?
To make a boy grow to be ignorant and misguided
About the bud? Now I have to play the part of the adviser
Because the bud is just a tasty tantalizer
The bud, not the beer, 'cause the bud makes me wiser (Figaro)
So I said, "Come here, little man" (What you want, little man?)
And with his little hand, he grabbed the pipe
A lesson in buddah blessin', not too young, just right
So he started blazin', it was amazin'
My lungs are black and shriveled up like a raisin
But who am I to deny the kid a try
At nature's little way of sayin' hi? (Thank you, old man)
So pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe

Twisting, turning, burning, rings of fire when I come into your lair
Say you'll pay a fare for the fee
I see the pipe, the pipe is what I like
I'm Imani and I'm hype, give me the pipe tonight
I really wanna smoke it, I really want to smoke it
I choke it
The endo no jokin', I'm doin' it like this
I hope I do not get this by anybody (Yo, where's Quinton?)

By anybody (Quinton, Quinton, where are you?)
By anybody (Yo)
By anybody (Quinton, Quinton, come here)
What? Uh-huh, uh-huh (Who got a lighter? Imani's got a lighter)
Ah, kick somethin' on the mic
Why does your mother smoke pipe with crack on the inside?
She likes to take a bus ride with a sherm stick in her mouth, preachin' about
What in the world's goin' on, I don't know what's up
The bitch smokes a lot of heron
Every day, a hard basehead, I don't know what to say
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe (I saw yaâ€”)
Say when
The pipe, damnit!
That was dope in the nostrils and nose and it's completing the run3Embed
