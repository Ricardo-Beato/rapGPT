7 ContributorsSwagga Like Us Lyrics
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Right
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Haaaah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Aight
No one on the corner has swagger like us
I'm 'bout to do my thing
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
You ready?
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Here I go

No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
It's October's Very Own
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Drizzy
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Tez, you ain't even got nothin' to worry about, man
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Yeah
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Check
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
You might also like
Uh
Are you listening? Is anybody listening?
Walk into the room and you can smell the Clive Christian scent
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrilling bars, you'd think I'm writin' with John Grisham pen
I need ros√©, never mind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom, no license
Fuck if you feelin' me as long as your wife is
No one in my city got a pocket like Drizzy
I could rock fitted jeans 'cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentals
And, Ms. Wrong, sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck y'all rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now, happy St. Paddy's
Yeah, I know you waitin' on the last quote
Check the SoundScan, you can see that I'm the last hope

No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Oh, I'm not done
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Ye, what up?
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Don C, what up, homeboy?
No one on the corner has swagger like us
G-hop
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
I got 'em
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Uh
Look
By the way, I'm Jewish
And turnin' 22 gets depressin' when you see your favorite rappers goin' through it
Tryna reinvent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light-skinned youngin on some new shit
40, just record it and we'll drop this here
'Cause I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
You in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Yeah, fuck you really know about a Eames couch?
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake but a nigga livin' ya dreams out
Lookin' like a photoshoot every time the team's out
Yeah, and is the realest nigga still I?
A woman could love me to death but I still die
So I'm about us now
Smith and Wesson flow, you should tell them boys duck down

No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
You know what it is
No one on the corner has swagger like us
October's Own, ATF
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Reps Up, holla at me
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
We do this day in and day out, man
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Dead serious
Azooka, I see you boy
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Yeah!
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like usEmbed
