56 Contributors2Pac Lyrics
Nard & B
Ayy, this for my city, you know what I'm saying?
You heard me?

Got bandana 'round my head like I'm 2Pac (Yeah, what?)
My lil' brother, he ain't scared, he got two Glocks (Frrat)
Put some blonde in my dreads, I went too pop (Fut')
My young nigga, he gon' shoot you for a teardrop (Blatt, blatt, blatt, Chiraq)
Got bandana 'round my head like I'm 2Pac (Thug life)
My lil' cousin duckin' feds, ridin' with two choppers (Skrrt)
And when you're matchin' head to toe, they say you're too fly (You're too fly)
Got a bandana 'round my head like I'm 2Pac (Like 2Pac)

Got a bandana 'round my head, screaming, "Thug life" (Thug)
I get faded off the Xans and the muddy drank (Yeah)
Got a bandana 'round my head like I'm Soulja (Like I'm Soulja Slim)
Keep that chopper on a nigga like Magnolia (Like Mag', brrt)
Put some blonde in my dreads, I went too pop (I went too pop)
For my brother's sixteenth birthday, bought him a new Glock (2Pac)
These niggas taking off your head for a new watch (A new watch)
My young nigga, he ain't scared, he want a new body (Yeah)
I done fucked around and cashed out on some new exotics (On some new exotics)
Bitch ain't never speak no englo, I went too tropic (I went too tropic)
Got a bandana 'round my head like I'm Birdie (Like I'm Birdie)
I left my dope with my grandma, had her servin' (Had her servin')

Got bandana 'round my head like I'm 2Pac (Yeah, what?)
My lil' brother, he ain't scared, he got two Glocks (Frrat)
Put some blonde in my dreads, I went too pop (Fut')
My young nigga, he gon' shoot you for a teardrop (Blatt, blatt, blatt, Chiraq)
Got bandana 'round my head like I'm 2Pac (Thug life)
My lil' cousin duckin' feds, ridin' with two choppers (Skrrt)
And when you're matchin' head to toe, they say you're too fly (You're too fly)
Got a bandana 'round my head like I'm 2Pac (Like 2Pac)

These hood bitches love a nigga like I'm Alpo (Like I'm Al')
My lil' cousin got that yoppa on him and he broke (And he, brrt)
Got designer on my collar like I'm Bon Jovi (Like I'm rockin')
I got all these problems, I just roll a bunch of doddi (Roll some kush)
These niggas killing 'bout these bitches, fuck that dirty pussy (Fuck that dirty pussy)
These niggas ain't used to no pimping, they gon' pay for pussy (Damn)
Got bandana 'round my head like I'm a rebel, boy (What up?)
All this molly in my system, I can see the devil (Fut')
And I'm playin' 'round with these presidents (Freebandz)
Still tote a one-hundred round with a felony (Grrat, grrat)
Keep a few kilos on me, nephew (Nephew)
Big links on me, they Cuban (Nephew)
Got banana clips on banana clips on banana clips

Got bandana 'round my head like I'm 2Pac (Yeah, what?)
My lil' brother, he ain't scared, he got two Glocks (Frrat)
Put some blonde in my dreads, I went too pop (Fut')
My young nigga, he gon' shoot you for a teardrop (Blatt, blatt, blatt, Chiraq)
Got bandana 'round my head like I'm 2Pac (Thug life)
My lil' cousin duckin' feds, ridin' with two choppers (Skrrt)
And when you're matchin' head to toe, they say you're too fly (You're too fly)
Got a bandana 'round my head like I'm 2Pac
