All of my feelings are gone
I left them all on the floor
Man, who's to blame if you don't love me no more?
No, I don't mind, just take whatever you want

Why don't you just take what you want from me?
I think you should take what you want and leave
Why don't you just take what you want from me?
I think you should take what you want and leave

What you want from me? Yeah
What you want from me? Yeah

Get yourself an Adderall
And throw me up against the wall
And kick me when I have to crawl
Ooh, I love it when you show no love at all
You know I can be your part-time lover
Our scars, they'll dance with еach other
I can be your part-time lovеr
Our scars, they'll dance with each other

Why don't you just take what you want from me?
I think you should take what you want and leave
Why don't you just take what you want from me?
I think you should take what you want and leave

What you want from me? Yeah
What you want from me? Yeah

You're changin' (You're changin' every day)
You played me (I let you win again)
You're changin' (You're changin' every day)
And you're takin' (You're takin' everything)20Embed
