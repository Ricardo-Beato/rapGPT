22 ContributorsExotic Lyrics
I blow three blunts before lunch and turn a rapper into dinner
Serve the East side taught me Bel-Air Shopping Center
The West side, these niggas call me Green Field Plaza
You ain't got no connect nigga, you copping from El Blaga
Continue on the saga, your mouth is Fierce as Sasha
Making millions off the girls, I'm Beyonce's father
I'm sitting in the Charger, you niggas Lady Gaga
Left my car charger, CD changer no Carter
Dwayne or Shawn, Sean Price mixed with Lil' Jon
Off the fifth of rum, piff in my lungs
Fucking two Asian bitches 'til they couldn't cum
And when them hoes squirt it tastes like Hong Kong Wonton
They said, "Oh my, biggest dick I've ever seen"
Showed her on the webcam, she start licking the screen
Next week we party putting coke all up in her nose
Just me, my nigga Luke and a house full of hoes

And it's coke on the corner, guns in the closet
Pills on the table, blowing on exotics
Money on the mantle, fuck direct deposit
Old school Chevy next year we roll exotics
And it's coke on the corner, guns in the closet
Pills on the table, blowing on exotics
Money on the mantle, fuck direct deposit
Old school Chevy next year we roll exotics

That Cutty steering wheel all wood like a beaver bed
Your bitch neck move faster than cheetah legs
Nike 6.0's look like Zebra heads
Wack MC's, I eat 'em like pita bread... rappers
I voicemail your best bitch
In the hood, hoes give me more throat than neck strength
All I want is money, cash no checks
I swear the sight of kushy makes her pussy so wet
I say my flow cold as the walls in the precinct
I'm a monster, eat pussy like Wheat Thins
I'm a rock star without a guitar
My chocolate melts in your girl mouth, Mr. Goodbar
And it's weed on the corner, guns on the target
Shorty going crazy, sniffing coke in the closet
While I'm sitting on the toilet puffing on exotics
Bitch busts in the bathroom and fucking vomits

And it's coke on the corner, guns in the closet
Pills on the table, blowing on exotics
Money on the mantle, fuck direct deposit
Old school Chevy next year we roll exotics
And it's coke on the corner, guns in the closet
Pills on the table, blowing on exotics
Money on the mantle, fuck direct deposit
Old school Chevy next year we roll exotics2Embed
