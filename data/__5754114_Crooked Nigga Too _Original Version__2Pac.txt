4 ContributorsCrooked Nigga Too (Original Version) Lyrics
Yo Pac I heard you got beat up by the police
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything (Word up)
Niggas just wanna know if your still gonna be on some crooked ass nigga shit

Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I do to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK-47 layin' on my hips so I don't trip
One mothafucker from the Underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
Yo why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch, the mothafuckers got a beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin' the finger at police
Instead of them mothafuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when the punk mothafuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then, I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too

Here's an example just another sample
For ya crooked ass niggas
Here's an example just another sample
I'm a crooked nigga too
Here's an example just another sample
For ya crooked ass niggas
Here's an example just another sample
I'm a crooked nigga too
You might also like
You know you really can't say that ya blame niggas
Fuck being tame, set a flame, time to aim triggers
2Pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at each other (fuck no!)
That's my mothafuckin' brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover
And all the bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (Fuck that!)
Genuine draft, guns and ganja and my fucking TEC-9
They know their scared to see us sober (awwwww)
Stop drinking King Cobra, and niggas will take the world over
It's all up to you (Up to you)
Blame the Korean blame the Jew
Or be a crooked nigga too

Here's an example just another sample
For ya crooked ass niggas
Here's an example just another sample
I'm a crooked nigga too
Here's an example just another sample
For ya crooked ass niggas
Here's an example just another sample
I'm a crooked nigga too
Me and Tupac bout to rip shit
Damn I got these dazed and amazed and
Crooked with the crown on a flip tip
Swinging part two, the leaders of the mothafucking crooked ass crew
So pass the brew and let me sip and plot another hit for loot
And I'm aiming for ya head if a nigga gotta shoot true
Word is bond and niggas confess for stress
So when I'm in your presence play a game named death
And start guessing when and where the niggas snitches gonna
Move or groove or wax and tax
Flexing our show and prove I get wicked, hoes want to lick it
Tweed on a Mack and that ass'll catch a ticket
Ticking like a time bomb, boom too late
I'm wrecking when I'm stepping and a nigga full of hate
For the beef police and the K.K.K
So I'm scheming on a way to make 'em try this new spray

Here's an example just another sample
For ya crooked ass niggas
Here's an example just another sample
I'm a crooked nigga too

All you niggas out there, take your guns that you use to shoot each other
And start shooting these bitch ass mothafucking police
Die to impress a mothafucking nigga like me
The crooked mothafuckas
'Cause these Police getting way too mothafucking out of line
Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nuttin but love for each other
So mothafucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and OOOH
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga to
