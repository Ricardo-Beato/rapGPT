12 ContributorsCamera Ready Lyrics
OH IT'S HOLIDAY SEASON, NIGGA!
It's the Crazy Mane, with the crazy chains
Got these bitches at the telly doing crazy thangs
What you bitches know about the Gucci Mane?
HOLIDAY SEASON!

It's Cinderfella Dana Dane, call me Gucci Mane
I got these bitches taking pictures of my camera chain
I'm just a rich, wealthy nigga, kind of weird and strange
But I stay dead fly like a private plane
If you don't know about the ki, then I must explain
Everything that I got, owe it to cocaine
I'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussein
I'm fire: propane, I'm a boiling flame
I came, I conquered, I did my thang
Dropped my slang, then I changed the game
Two dames on the train, got that English brain
'Cause my money real long like a modern train (Huh huh huh huh huh)

Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

It's Gucci GuWop in the drop, I'm playing 2Pac
Taking 2 shots of Ciroc, then drop some straight drop
Take me some blocks off the top, I gotta re-rock
42 grand in my pants, now that's a T-TOP
The hustle don't stop on my block, they sell sheet rock
Kick your square dead in your ass until you kick rocks
Gram after gram, yes I am, I got a weed spot
Last couple days it been hotter than a teapot
A way to make bills off a deal, I got to fig' out
Niggas got mills on the deal, I pulled the cig out
A half of a bill off this shit, then I'm a nig-out (Huh huh huh)
Count all my money with my team, then we gon' pig out

Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

It's the Crazy Mane with the crazy chains
Got these bitches at the telly doing crazy thangs
I done camouflaged the flow so it's pure and pain
I got a deal for the labor, so it's more to gain
I am so untame, y'all niggas are lame
Treat your bitches like a whore, treat 'em all the same
You gon take her to the store, buy the bitch a ring
She gon beg me for some more, want a catchy drank
60 grands in my pocket, that's a drop-top Stang
What you bitches know about the Gucci Mane?
I'ma shave it off the top, get some extra 'caine (Huh huh huh huh huh)
If you ain't getting money, you should be ashamed!
Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready1Embed
