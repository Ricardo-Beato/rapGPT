Yo yo
Badmon representin'
Yo yo

They say you never know what you got
'Til it's all up and away
And it's so lonely at the top
Sometimes you wanna throw it away
But lately I've been talking to God
He told me Heaven is a way better place
So I'm taking everything that I've got
And I'm running away, I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)
I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)

Gone like the wind, I can't seem to win
I know the end is near, but I just don't know when
Turn on to CNN, look at what I see again
It's another black man, died at the white hand of justice
To tell the truth, man, I'm fuckin' disgusted
I fear for the lives, for my sisters, my brothers
Less fortunate than I, let's formulate a plan
I'm sick of holdin' grudges, I'm loadin' in all my slugs and
Aimin' it at the judges, fuck the cops
Fuck the system and the government, you fuckers not
Protectin' and servin'
You more like damagin' and hurtin'
And letting off shots 'til you motherfuckers certain
He ain't breathin', you made it clear
"Fuck your breath, nigga," don't even deserve air
Don't even deserve shit, don't even deserve nothin'
If black lives really mattered, you niggas would do somethin'
Instead we mean nothin', in fact, we being hunted
They don't want us in abundance
They know it's strength in them numbers
That's why they gave you one
The time is comin', no discussion
If you ain't got a gun, then you better start runnin'
You might also like
Run to the rock of my salvation (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Run to the stone that the builder rejected (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I run to aboriginal, Christ, Haile Selassie
Hear them call some other name
Them other guy nuh qualified
A long long time mi see ah idiot a try
Tell me America is the land of the free, that's a lie
'Cause nobody, nuh free 'bout yah
Bet how we leave Babylon, and go ah Ethiopia
And if you don't believe we can achieve that
Then you is just another idiot or another

Motherfucker, it's the J-O-Z-I-F B-A-D-M-O-N
Come on, bring them M's on in
I'm on the upside now, you can turn 'em M's upside down
We 'bout to win, there's an L for the other side of him
Most greats that you lost, I invite 'em in
To my soul, don't you feel the vibes when I'm channelin'?
The innermost of my spirit been engulfed with plenty gold
'Cause most of them labels throw pennies so
Who you think investin' in penitentiaries though?
Same owners as them labels, same owners of your cable
Spoon feedin' you fables, tryna keep your mind stable
Your eyes blind, and your skin's hazel
The truth is under your nasal but even the air's all fucked up
How we supposed to see stars? Chemical trails above us
Plus bunch of other shit that's undiscovered
Detached from the roots since we set sail, my brothers
That's word to motherland, sold us on stolen land
Visions from brother man, he seen us all holdin' hands
Fifty years later, still see my brothers choked to death
R.I.P. to Eric Garner, only right I show respect
Nowaday they hangin' us by a different tree
Branches of the government, I can name all three
Judicial, legislative and executive
Lock your pops away, your moms, then next the kids
It's all consecutive, I'm just tryna break the cycle
I wonder if I'll do it all before they take my life, yo
Crucify my image, the Lord is my witness
If them Heaven's gates closed
I'ma break all them hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all
They say you never know what you got
'Til it's all up and away
And it's so lonely at the top
Sometimes you wanna throw it away
But lately I've been talking to God
He told me Heaven is a way better place
So I'm taking everything that I've got
And I'm running away, I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)
I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)

As fast as I can to Mount Zion
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
Running away (I'm running away)
Away, running away
You better start running, running
Babylon boy them ah coming, coming yeah
You better start running, running
Babylon is coming
Babylon get jealous of we, of we
Just because I walk this way
Babylon get jealous of we, of we20Embed
