5 ContributorsTurn The Lights On Lyrics
Say man, we don't need much to come to the freak show (SMS Audio)
Come to the freak show

Fuck that, leave the lights on
Girl, 68-69 leave the lights on
(Can't see shit) leave the lights on
Girl, I can't see shit, leave the lights on
Girl, leave the lights on
68-69, leave the lights on
Damn, leave the lights on
Zip down my zipper and play with the python

Girl, I make the bed rock like I'm on a yacht
Shit, citation, think quick, lick my cock, baby
Time's money, check my Tourbillon Movement.
I'm rich bitch, I say 'move', you get to moving
I'm a Bently Mulsanne type nigga, I'm crusing
Looking ain't hard to tell who's winning, who's losing
Got a penthouse around my wrist, I'm flashing out
Condo' around my neck, I'm cashing out
I'm nigga rich, got everything a rich nigga get
I got whips for days, I got kick for days
Louis, Hermes,  Jimmy Choo's
Ferragamo, Dolce Gabanna, red-bottom Loub's
Plus I got the Prada collection
I might leave my socks on sex, and old habits and old habits
Baby, show me what you know
Let the freak in you come out on the low
You might also like
68-69 all the time, shorty
You can be a freak for me
Come and be a freak for me
Baby, I can lick yours, lick mine
Shorty, you can be a freak for me
Come and be a freak tonight
This kid right, leave the lights on
I can't see shit, leave the lights on
Damn, leave the lights on
Zip down my zipper and play with the python

Girl, IÂ´m not into all that S&M shit
The leather spikes not for me but you can get your ass whiped
Limited time, skip the foreplay
I be a chocolate whopper you could have this shit your way
Hope the head games's good, she looking exotic
Seven hour flight, she already 'rotic
London, Paris, France, Japan
Talk to me while we fuck, girl, I can't understand
Let's get to stroking, boning, moaning, groaning
Start in the afternoon, end up the next morning
Start the next round, lick from my neck down
So she did do, felatio correct. Wow!
I'll play "monkey see, monkey do"
So everything you do to me I'll do to you
It tickles but I can't quite hear
What the fuck she trynna say with her tongue stuck in my ear?
68-69 all the time, shorty
You can be a freak for me
Come and be a freak for me
Baby, I can lick yours, lick mine
Shorty, you can be a freak for me
Come and be a freak tonight
This kid right, leave the lights on
I can't see shit, leave the lights on
Damn, leave the lights on
Zip down my zipper and play with the python

Hey, girl, I know you want me, (No?)
Well why the hell wouldn't you want me? (Damn)
Shorty now push up on me
Zip down my zipper, play with the python
You gon' be just be like that?
You so insensitive, hurt my feelings
I mean from the bottom of my heart
I love youEmbed
