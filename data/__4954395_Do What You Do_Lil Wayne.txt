4 ContributorsDo What You Do Lyrics
Capo
Hold me up, daddy
Yeah

Yeah, and you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -
I’ma get by and I’m a get mine
So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine
And you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -
I’ma get by and I’m a get mine
So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine

Yeah, they tryna get me when I’m not lookin’
But word to my momma’s hot cookin’, I’m joogin’
Like O.J. Simpson, I’m innocent
Grind, even if I’m blind, I’ma benefit, yeah
And I’m smellin’ like a new box of Benjamins
Black card in the gucci wallet, holla
And I charge so much, it’s a penalty
And I travel so much, it’s a penalty
Ladies and gentlemen, what you gon’ do?
The gun fit in the Timberland, the Timberland boot
I’m so invisible, invisible to you
‘Cause you can’t see me and you’re see through
Young Money baby, what’s up with y’all?
If the boy don’t do nothin’, he gon’ bring it back home
If the money don’t move, I’ma move ‘till I get it
And let the sideline see me with it, now timeout

Yeah, and you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -
I’ma get by and I’m a get mine
So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine
And you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -
I’ma get by and I’m a get mine
So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine

We know the cops don’t like us
Because they wanna rock just like us
But even if we knew you since diapers, if you’re a cop now, you are not just like us
I’ma ridah baby, I wouldn’t lie to ya
I probably live for ya, but I wouldn’t die for ya
And I’m high to the point of too high, if a nigga come down, it’ll be a suicide
And the difference between you and I
I’ma get ahead, you gon’ get behind -
Me, and watch me do my thing
And everyday give all thanks to my king
As true as I seem is how real I am
And if ya feel is fake then here I am
That boy ain’t in my plan
But Baby that boy ya man
Yeah, and you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -
I’ma get by and I’m a get mine
So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine
And you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -
I’ma get by and I’m a get mine
So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine

And you know I’ma stunt, I gotta stunt
But if I pop the trunk, you may think I hunt
That’s why, the federales all over my Cavalli’s
Bad enough I got a bunch of women tryna find me
What am I to do, but hop in a Ferrari?
Pop up at the party like, “Drinks for everybody!”
Yeah, Thank you everybody
Those of you who respect what Wayne do
Shit, better believe this star is spangled
That mean I got stripes like fuck what fame do
Yeah, baby girl, fuck what ya man do
I can take care of you, the kids and ya man too
I ran through my city like a chicken with his head off, but everything paid off
Every link iced up, everybody’s ready
Take a picture and hold the camera steady
Look at me
Yeah, and you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -
I’ma get by and I’m a get mine
So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine
And you can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I do me
And I do it real well, and yes I -
I’ma get by and I’m a get mine
So tell the haters I say that I’m doing just fine

Uh, Furious
Uh, uh, uh
Weezy F, uh
Cash Money, yup
Young Money
You can do what you wanna do, ‘cause I fo me
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-oh
Ch-chea
C2, babyEmbed
