Uh, yeah

I'm unfazed (Woah), I'm unfazed (Woah)
I'm unfazed (Woah), I'm unfazed (Woah)
I'm unfazed, I'm unfazed
I'm unfazed, I'm unfazed

Turn that girl into a bad bitch
Turn that girl into a savage
And you might think she's outstandin'
Make that girl go through practice
Take three Xannies like a hat trick
Take another pill for that magic
These models 'bout to get ratchet (Ooh yeah)
These models 'bout to get ratchet
Give a fuck about what a source say
Don't attach me to your name
A-All they wanted was more fame
All they wanted was more fame
And you were always a distraction
It was never gonna last, and they will always be the past
And they just tryna get reactions from me (Woah)

I'm unfazed (Oh, oh), I'm unfazed, I'm unfazed

I make it rain, you can have it (Woah)
I make it disappear like magic (Woah)
I, I met that girl right at Magic
Left with her and a big back-end
She slippery, losin' traction
You keep listenin' to your mad friends
Your last old enough be my dad's friend
So that guy to me he a has-been
I took his girl, yeah that's Bogart (Woah)
I fuck that girl like a pornstar (Woah)
Yeah, it's Starboy and a born star
Pull up every which way in foreign cars (Woah, skrrt, vroom)
Man, these broads so fake (So fake)
Mistakes, time to part ways
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you can keep it (You can keep it)
You say you're real, what's the meanin'? (What's the meanin'?)
Countin' Washingtons, this Gilbert Arenas (That's Arenas)
Hit it twice to let her know I really mean it (I really mean it, woah, woah)
I'm unfazed, ooh yeah (Woah, yeah), I'm unfazed, ooh yeah (Woah, yeah)
I'm unfazed, ooh yeah (Woah), I'm unfazed (Oh, oh)
I'm unfazed (Oh, oh), I'm unfazed
I'm unfazed, I'm unfazed, ooh, yeah (Woah)
I'm unfazed, ooh, yeah (Woah), I'm unfazed, ooh, yeah (Woah)
I'm unfazed (Woah), I'm unfazed (Oh, oh)
