3 ContributorsIron On Me Lyrics
I got that iron on me, I got that iron on me
I got that iron on me, I got that iron on me
That nigga say he try me, that nigga lyin' on me

I got that iron on me, I got that iron on me
A nigga say he trap me, that nigga lyin on me
I got that iron on me, I got that iron on me
A nigga say he trap me, that nigga lyin on me

I heard a legal paid legal just to riot on me
I feel like '99, I had that Tech Nine on me
Going 99, I had them 95's on me
I had em 49, I think I had a 9 on me
And this pussy ass nigga try to shine on me
3-4 a nigga must ain't never heard a word bout me
I got the urge to smoke this nigga on the side of the street
You that life cheap nigga, I switch cheese to Jeep
And fine what is a weaker make a nigga scared to speak
Have a nigga so scared that he skin get leash
Walk in your house, lovely spouse, knock out your front teeth
Aye you reap what you sow so you sowin' heat

I got that iron on me, I got that iron on me
A nigga say he trap me, that nigga lyin' on me
I got that iron on me, I got that iron on me
A nigga say he trap me, that nigga lyin' on me

I keep that iron on me and I can't wait to crease a nigga
Instead of fienin I'll whack yo ass to pieces nigga
I got this iron on me and with that iron I'm going hard
Choppas knock the wrinkles out yo ass, bitch I don't need no starch
Fuck yo body good, you dream enough to die nigga
I got bliptide so all my niggas ride
Niggas niggas talkin loud but when it's only high
Nigga you got teardrops but you ain't killed a nigga
Think you a bam nigga but round here you boutme
Boy you sweet nigga, I'll whoop yo ass bout feet
Use yo feet nigga, marathon track me
We in the streets nigga, 10-17 DTE

I got that iron on me, I got that iron on me
A nigga say he trap me, that nigga lyin' on me
I got that iron on me, I got that iron on me
A nigga say he trap me, that nigga lyin' on meEmbed
