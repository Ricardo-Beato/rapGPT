5 ContributorsEverbody Lyrics
Its time to go foreign that other shit is boring
Throwing up the club yeah we always had the star
You that its the kid, its free band for ever
You better get your bands to-mothefuckin’-gether
Cause once I get in the game, its lamborghinis for everybody
Me and my nigga gone shine, we shittin on everybody
I’m pouring up a four, I’m putting up for everybody
We don’t fuck with you niggas, we shit on you niggas
All this fucking blow, boat big as ?
All this fucking money, got condos just for hoes
What the fuck you said I’m through with selling birds
I watch the birds fly, I’m a real black Amigo

All these fucking hoes, I’m a share some with everybody
All this dro I smoke, I’mma smoke me some with everybody
All these bars we pop we gone drink some with everybody
All this style I got I had to give some to everybody

Bottle pop with everybody

Stay real low with the wide body
Turn it up on everybody
Like I had a gangster party I invited everybody
Milo plugging everybody living room stay real crowded
Bricks and bales man future got it

Think I need a head doctor, think I need a helicopter I looked out for everybody not I’mma shit on everybody

Everybody riding, everybody hiding, everybody flying
Everybody on a nigga everybody going everybody gliding
Everybody flossing, everybody crossing

Everybody bringing back good with the fork and
Everybody shooting everybody plug talking
Everybody strapped trapped with the 40
Everybody have a fully loaded four forty
Everybody balling ,everybody calling
Everybody smoking, everybody coughing

All these fucking hoes, I’m a share some with everybody
All this dro I smoke, I’mma smoke me some with everybody
All these bars we pop we gone drink some with everybody
All this style I got I had to give some to everybodyEmbed
