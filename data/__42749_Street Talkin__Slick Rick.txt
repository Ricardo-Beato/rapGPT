49 ContributorsStreet Talkin’ Lyrics
Not tryna claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What, kid? Diamond on the tooth — 2 grand
Tryna help raise our youth to men
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand

OutKast and Slick — the answer is in it
Hun, you need to get your ass on the dance floor this minute
We bruise stuff, knock you out shoes, socks
Show your ass, move you forgot we're mad smoove snots
La-Di-Da-Di (Mmm), we like to party
Don't make me get money and platinumize my body
With bright stuff, known to earn a dyke's love
Blind folks be like, "Somebody turn the lights off"
Immense strength poppin' out a muffin
Make famous artists that's dead hop out a coffin
At the real estate, behavin' type choosy
Want a palace with the shit beige and light blue, please
Got the kid like "Watch your manners"
Since I came out of jail, it's like the planet gone bananas
Lack the strength a badder fella had
Lady lookin at me all stink, I had to tell her that
You might also like
Not tryna claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What, kid? Diamond on the tooth — 2 grand
Tryna help raise our youth to men
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand

Uhh, I went from "Player's Ball" to bulldoggin'
From bulldoggin' to bowhoggin'
Now bowhoggin' and pimpwalkin'
Then strictly fresh and street talkin
And we all last like that there
Ruin them all up like cat hair
We never fall off like hat wear
We some of the dopest MC's out there
Now, eat that
OutKast and Ricky D — bitch, can you beat that?
Remember the time I laid them down to Teenage Love?
Now, see that
Just to sport a rhyme and break in new patterns like hymens
Shuckin' and jivin' was never the style
I'm gon' keep on being this lion
Spittin' that king shit, you cling shit
A tailor and a seamstress
Blue gators for you haters and the penis for all you beatches
Like an addiction 'cause I need it, hip-hop is that I fiend it
Like a junkie, show me your monkey, 'cause I sho' nuff like to beat it
Might just eat it just to skeet it
Fold you up like you was pleated
Like some slacks and, relaxin', be strollin' like Sir-Captain
See, I got a baby daughter, and I feed her with this rappin'
Not trappin', b-boy, but rappin', huh
Ye-yeah, yeah!
Not tryna claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What, kid? Diamond on the tooth — 2 grand
Tryna help raise our youth to men
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
Help clean up this land

Seems everybody's open off the grammar
The white fox pink velvet suit, white cabana
Listen, baby girl, genius Rick ta..
Dreamboat, bitch, you shoulda been clicked picture
(Check her out) I don't know what you're tryin to figure out
Down South, barbecue ribs fly out a nigga mouth
And touchin' me The Chosen, for such a will opposin'
Me and Big Boi tryin' to give our children clothin'
Smokin' love, do we provide dope enough?
Even people unborn kid wide open off
The enginin' I'm sendin' in
Even make construction workers start actin kind of feminine (Hi!)
10%'ll blast this hit
From me and Big Boi who represent the OutKast clique
A jealous cat, lack the strength a badder fella had
Lady lookin' at me all stink, had to tell her that
Not tryna claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What, kid? Diamond on the tooth — 2 grand
Tryna help raise our youth to men
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
