Skinny nigga from the Northside (That's true)
Fuck a Swisher, burn a four-five (That's true)
Keep it hidden in tight jeans (That's true)
Shoot a nigga 'fore he fight me (That's true)
Skipped school in sixth grade (That's true)
Rite Aid, stealing ice cream (That's true)
Spray paint for the cap guns (That's true)
Held up for his Nikes (That's true)
Pro Club on the white tee (That's true)
NY's on the NE's (That's true)
Six-fives for my enemies (That's true)
Pop-lock when you find me (That's true)
Eight shots in the Hi-Point (That's true)
But it jam at about three (That's true)
Walk up, never drive-by (That's true)
Back through when the cops leave (That's true)
