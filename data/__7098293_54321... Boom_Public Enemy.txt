2 Contributors54321... Boom LyricsCan it be easy as 5 4 3 2 1
Damn sun
Heard it was easy as
1 2 3
We don't control the 3 e's
Still we be on the plantation
And you be in trouble b
Dizzy whirls and niggerlodeons
In the nigga time
24 duckin the war
No shirt on like
Wakin up at 3pm, no job
Ridin around on a bike
Hair half braided
Half combed out
Smoked out
Still braggin about
How cats gonna come up
Get that hustle on
While them babies born
Headed to the club to get more chicks, cmon
These rhymes ain't got
The glow of your normal
Fairytales
As another color passes
Another brother fails
No singin or blingin
Freestylе wingin
Beer can sittin around
Waitin for highlghts on espn
4 3 2 1 over it
Some Vincе Carter dunkin on Mike, an shit
Get yourself together
Before these feds start
Scrapin
Heads off the street
Sendin cats to the middle of heat
Far in the so called middle east
Somebody gotta
Communicate
Beyond the beats
You might also like5 retail chains
Got your brains trained
To consume anything
With a bang and a boom
Gimme room
I'm sayin
It's a scam to pay for airplay today
But 4 major corps
Bought your support
Check the fine print
That cd you bought
Sony Time Warner Universal
Notorius BMG
No lie they just got EMI
3 radio corporations
Own all them so called
Black stations
While two tv stations
Gotcha kids waitin
WB we be
Hatin the fact
Every 5 seconds
Canned laughter
Rolls off the faces of blacks
U p n you pick a nigga
To make the problem
Nigga
As I await the one video arm
Viacom
To get bombed
No doubtEmbed
