8 ContributorsGhetto Life Lyrics{Intro}
Yeah yeah!
Darkman X up in here wit my nigga Ron G
Ruff Ryders in the muthafuckin house, you know how we do baby
96 until...
Darkman X, DMX, Ron G, Ruff Ryders
Its all good, my niggas
Im bout to show yall niggas something for real
Catch it if you can baby

Niggas say I'm bugging
And ask me what's that shit I'm on
Cause I did them wrong, carry them greasy, and get 'em gone
What I'm on is some real "fuck the world" shit
And hoes like a cruddy nugga
So I'll fuck your girl, quick, that nigga Earl sick
That's what they used to say in school
Throwing chairs, and jigging niggas with pencils everyday in school
A wise man can play the fool for reasons of his own
I knew that I would understand them reasons when I'm grown
And now it's on
They started something they wasn't ready for
At the age of 10 I'm busting down a steady four
Comin out for visit but what's a visit when there's no home?
Other kids' parents like 'this little boy is so grown!'
I am what happens when you're raised in the streets
All I really want is to get praised in the streets
And he who lays in the streets with your last breath
Ask the Lord for forgiveness and you may have a fast death
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
I wanna see it when it's coming, so I can open faces
Open cases got me paying to stay out of jail
While these streets, got me to praying to stay out of hell
Slipped, and I fell, got back up - slipped again
But no matter what it's been, niggas never got a win
It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good with it
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood did it
Knew what I was doin, everyday that I've been doin it
Seein niggas havin a good time, so i'ma ruin it
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggas is puss!
Frontin like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu
Now peep what I just said and see how long it takes to hit you
Everybody knows you can talk all day
But when it's on what you gonna do - walk away?
You might also likeOne love Boomer, rest in peace, baby!
Dark Man X, DMX
Now you know, for real
Ron G, Ruff Ryders
