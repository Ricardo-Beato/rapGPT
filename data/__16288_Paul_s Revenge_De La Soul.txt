7 ContributorsPaulâ€™s Revenge Lyrics
Yo, yo, yo, do it

Yo, what up? It's Paul, got your message
I'm here to get this piece to redo it, or there's one we left for you
Whatever, whatever you said, I agree
That's why I was like to get tore up on "I Am I Be"
That rhymed
Uh
Uh
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
Uh
Yo, man, they dissed me in The Source, they gave me no credit for my songs, for the Slick Rick stuff in the new Source
Gave **** credit for songs I did
That's a diss, I'm mad, man
I hate **** and I hate ****
And you can quote me
And you can record this and put this on a record
I hate them, I hate them
And I'ma get em if it's the last thing I do
Anyway, hope you have a pleasant day, peaceYou might also likeEmbed
