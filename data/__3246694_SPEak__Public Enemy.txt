1 ContributorSPEak! Lyrics
Old enough, bold enough
Man up, woman up
Think you had enough?
What you know about
Whatever you know about
Question is, uh, can you get it out?
Spoke!
Stay woke
Gun culture silenced
Stop the violence made all the brilliant silent
World ain’t gonna fix itself
World ain’t gonna change itself
Run your mouth
Don’t be dumb
But bump them gums
I know that the insecure be sure that their adversaries
End up shootin’ them guns
Dumb shit rises to the top
Ain’t got shit to say
Shut the words
Makin’ action stop
Diction avoids friction
Speak and aim
Ain’t playin’
Make it plain
Express yourself
Stand up to the game
Cause it’s stupid being afraid
Of the same egg you laid
Talk it over!
You might also like
Speak! Your mind
Speak! It’s time
Speak! Your peace (Believe me when I speak it)
Speak! Be free
Speak! Your mind
Speak! It’s time
Speak! Your peace (Believe me when I speak it)
Speak! Be free
Speak! Your mind
Speak! It’s time
Speak! Your peace (Believe me when I speak it)
Speak! Be free
Speak! Your mind
Speak! It’s time
Speak! Speak! Speak! (Believe me when I speak it)
Woaaaah!

Dumb shit
Who can’t talk
Need a gun
Cause the brain
Can’t change the terrain
Trained by a government chain
Makin’ it rain in the club
That goes without sayin’ the devil don’t want change
You old enough to shave you old enough to save
Speak easy talkin’ somethin’
Say it loud
Malcolm, Garvey, Sonia Sanchez proud
Sister Souljah, Jesse, Al, Huey
Orator heard
Hip hop got the culture
Rap is the words
Having the blind
Loving some dumb aimed and directed death
And end up callin’ it def
Feds to protect black crime from the threat of community
Keeping truth from the youth, have them shootin’ me
And at each other, sister and brother
Lockin’ the rest up in them federal ovens
What y’all know about whatever you know about
Question is can you get it out?
Talk it over
Speak! Your mind
Speak! It’s time
Speak! Your peace (Believe me when I speak it)
Speak! Be free
Speak! Your mind
Speak! It’s time
Speak! Your peace (Believe me when I speak it)
Speak! Be free
Speak! Your mind
Speak! It’s time
Speak! Your peace (Believe me when I speak it)
Speak! Be free
Speak! Your mind
Speak! It’s time
Speak! Speak! Speak! (Believe me when I speak it)
Speak!
Believe me when I speak it
Believe me when I speak it
Believe me when I speak it
Believe me when I speak it
Believe me when I speak it
Believe me when I speak itEmbed
