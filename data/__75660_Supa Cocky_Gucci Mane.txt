35 ContributorsSupa Cocky Lyrics
Super duper stupid cocky
My wrist super duper rocky
Rocky like the rocky mountains
Make it rain, water fountains
Damn she got a stupid body
I just popped a super Molly
Twin ferraris got em thinking
I'm down with illuminati
Say your sorry, beg your pardon
Gucci Til I pack The Garden
Riding foreign, rocking Ralph Lauren
Call me Liberaci
Louie keychain belt and wallet
Shoes and jeans and hat Versace
Gucci back so who can stop me
I can't lie I'm super cocky

I got money in every pocket in my cargos
Pull up in a largo
Call me Gucci Fargo
Sold so many deuces I should have a bar code
Pj to Las Vegas won a half a mil in Cosmo
Fucked so many bitches, dipped my dick in rolls gold
Suicide doors on the Rolls and you know that I had to go get the brain glow
They say Gucci Mane so hard but shawty loco
Never rapped the same flow
And never hit the same ho
Heard your nigga getting some money but he lame tho
Your boyfriends a rainbow
An egg beaters my logo
I'm the ruthless
I'm the crucialist
I put diamonds all in my crucifix
Y'all know how I do this shit
Treat an RnB bitch like a groupie bitch
You might also like
Super duper stupid cocky
My wrist super duper rocky
Rocky like the rocky mountains
Make it rain, water fountains
Damn she got a stupid body
I just popped a super Molly
Twin ferraris got em thinking
I'm down with illuminati
Say your sorry, beg your pardon
Gucci til I pack The Garden
Riding foreign, rocking Ralph Lauren
Call me Liberaci
Louie keychain, belt, & wallet
Shoes and jeans and hat Versace
Gucci mane so who can stop me
I can't lie I'm super cocky

Gucci mane make super profit
Your girlfriend is jocky jocky
I know what you read about me
I heard what you said about me
Bitches think I'm feedin' pigeons
Cuz I keep that bread around me
Ten bitches and only me
This girl is getting some head beside me
First I let her drive the car
Then I let her ride the star
On a bra don't own a bra
I swear that girl a porno star
Yo boyfriend got a loan-a-car
Ménage à trois, I'm up to par
Stay stupid fresh I'm extra sharp
I swear he cross dress grandmama
On your break lets go to lunch
She ate my balls like crunchy munch
Pull out clean I love to stunt
The backs the front, the fronts the trunk
Buy a pint, spike the punch
Smoked out the pound, we crown the blunt
Scram if you ain't serving grams
I still got what them junkies want
Super duper stupid cocky
My wrist super duper rocky
Rocky like the rocky mountains
Make it rain, water fountains
Damn she got a stupid body
I just popped a super Molly
Twin Ferraris got em thinking
I'm down with illuminati
Say your sorry, beg your pardon
Gucci til I pack The Garden
Riding foreign, rocking Ralph Lauren
Call me Liberaci
Louie keychain, belt, & wallet
Shoes and jeans and hat Versace
Gucci mane so who can stop me
I can't lie I'm super cocky2Embed
