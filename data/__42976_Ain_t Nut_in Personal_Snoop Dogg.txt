4 ContributorsAin’t Nut’in Personal Lyrics
Kill kill kill
How many killas you got on your mother fuckin pay roll nigga?
Snoop Dogg, C-Murder, and Silkk the Shocker
No limit  (biatch)

Nigga nigga I'ma rida
Ride with G's
And ship keys overseas by the three's
Keep an eye on my enemies
Snoop and Silkk
In da back of the Lac
With that AK
In da blue tint, with a infared
Mother fucker gonna die tonight
That's why I smoke weed, get high tonight
'Cause I'm a No Limit soldier
With TRU tatted in blood
I went to jail for years, for movin, burnin da drugs
Murda murda, kill kill
If you put me in danger
I ain't trippin noo
No limit niggas no strangers
I'ma tank representer 'til I'm history
Making playa hatas into a mother fucking memory
So throw 'em up if you a soldier
And Snoop Dogg pass tha mother fucking dolja
I know you mother fucking feel me
C-murder ain't gonna die, 'til a bitch nigga kill me

Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
Ain't nut'in personal junior
See it's all about respect
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
I'm never caught slippin'
Keep my heat on deck
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
Ain't nut'in personal junior
See it's all about respect
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
I'm never caught slippin'
Keep my heat on deck

Now, how many niggas you know that can fuck around and die and come back
They get hooked up with the number one rap label in rap, like that
Shit I can't be duplicated
But I'm highly playa hated
And I been reinstated
And I thank god that I finally made it
Fated many niggas, just to get one back
Remember im that young nigga
That put gangsta rap on the map
Never craps, only five duices
Mix that Moet, white star, with them orange juices
I hang out with real niggas
Like Silkk and C-Murder
TRU niggas, do niggas
Like you niggas
Ghetto ass, lower class
Never hesitate to blast
And im so serious about my hustlin
Gots to have my cash
Can you imagine if I was broke
Shit I wouldn't be bustin no raps
Id have my strap, running up in your door
Takin all your dough and your gold and your cars
'Cause big Snoop Dogg, Ain't no mother fucking rap star
See ima gangsta(gangsta) and you a notch(you a notch)
And you a sucka(bitch ass nigga), and I rock
I'm draped in my army fatigue
Blowing on green trees
In the navigator, and keep the heat for them playa hatas
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
Ain't nut'in personal junior
See it's all about respect
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
I'm never caught slippin'
Keep my heat on deck
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
Ain't nut'in personal junior
See it's all about respect
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
I'm never caught slippin'
Keep my heat on deck

Now look at murda, murda, murda
And this kill, kill, kill
This shits real
Stay strapped and capped, to get pealed
And mama always told me
If you ain't down to ride with god
Down to die with god
You ain't no mother fucking soldier
No limit tatted on my back and my stomach
'Cause ima mother fucking fool
Uhhh, show me love
'Cause when I make music with thugs, I make moves
Well I'm coming out hard
I was coming out large
Seen this guy named van
I bring the pain
Look everybody coming out stars
See now me, C, and Snoop in da coupe
Conversatin bout loot
I told niggas
Rap shit isn't bad, I blast'em, So I ask'em, I shoot
Just a young nigga bout raising hell and makin mail
If you a trip
I told you I was making this shit on bail (that's cool)
Back up nigga, can't flame that shit like drugs
And see ima nigga, I'm gonna hang like a nigga
Bang that shit like it was crips and bloods
Now deal weed nigga
Strapped up in my fatigue
Can't hold me down
Don't even trip my nigga Snoop
Nigga you a soldier now
Do what ya think bitch
For this tank bitch
I stay puttin in work
And I got No Limit scattered on my fucking forehead
That's why I do so much dirtEmbed
