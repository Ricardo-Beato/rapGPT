17 ContributorsStains Lyrics
Trill, yeah
That's how it is
Pluto

How many stains you hit? I'on't know. How many stains?
Private plane, converted over to private plane
Cookin' it up with baking soda, how many chains?
You ain't thinkin' how I'm thinkin', I'm goin' to the bank
I come in a tank, I come with the drank
I come with the drapes, I crush up the face
Patek Phillipe, I'm too unique
Gotta stop all the leaks, get caught with the freaks

I pour up codeine, I can't go to sleep
Criminal mind, thanks to the gang, gang
Louboutins, sittin' in a row
Louis Vuitton's, mink on the flows
My migo the coldest, it got me the frozest
I ordered the LOTUS, soon as it touched down, I sold it
The money is stacked up off the ground, you could never fold it
I done got racked up, I done stacked up me a fortune
Colossal, enormous, have you seen my performance
You makin' it drizzle, I got it thunder and stormin'
Cash on deliver, hope you not recording
(Cash on deliver, hope you not recording)

How many stains you hit? I'on't know. How many stains?
Private plane, converted over to private plane
Cookin' it up with baking soda, how many chains?
You ain't thinkin' how I'm thinkin', I'm goin' to the bank
I come in a tank, I come with the drank
I come with the drapes, I crush up the face
Patek Phillipe, I'm too unique
Gotta stop all the leaks, get caught with the freaks

I got you comfortable, but she say she love me
I got some commas, they can't be discussed
I weigh a ton in these streets, ain't no discussion
I started off with a couple watches, I got 'em busted
I got a flooded Richard Mille, it ain't no cuffin'
She came in blushing, she came from Russia
Digital scale, my kind is rare
I had to prevail, I made it through Hell
See the wheel on the right, when you live overseas
Think it came overnight, how I make it look easy
Ain't a regular nigga, I accept that
Got ahead of you niggas and I never took a step back

How many stains you hit? I'ont know. How many stains?
Private plane, converted over to private plane
Cookin' it up with baking soda, how many chains?
You ain't thinkin' how I'm thinkin', I'm goin' to the bank
I come in a tank, I come with the drank
I come with the drapes, I crush up the face
Patek Phillipe, I'm too unique
Gotta stop all the leaks, get caught with the freaks1Embed
