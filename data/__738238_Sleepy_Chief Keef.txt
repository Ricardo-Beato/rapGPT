16 ContributorsSleepy Lyrics
Ayy
Bang bang, nigga
Gang gang
Sos', baby
Gang, nigga
Bang, nigga
Gang, nigga
Bang, nigga, ayy
Gang, nigga
(I told 'em sleep is for the rich)

I am sleepy, I am sleepy
I am sleepy, drankin' sleepy
But, I ain't gon' go to sleep, 'cause I am greedy, ayy
Where that money? Gotta get them fft, beepies
Don't watch me, nigga, watch TV
Are you sleepy? I am sleepy
I be up day and night 'cause I am greedy
Pick the check up in my car and I'm fleein'

Dope got me tweakin', Xans got you sleepin'
Nigga, no sleepin', dope got me reekin'
This thot Puerto Rican, that's what she speakin'
Me, I talk money, that's what I be speakin'
Niggas diss sneakin', ridin' 'round with heaters
I don't like speakin', I don't want a feature
Bye, bye, Felicia, I can fuck my teacher
Niggas talkin' tweakin', ayy, I'm a fuckin' tweaker
I'm the Grim Reaper, I'm so fuckin' evil
My reefer is a keeper, I smoke it, get tree-treed up
You's a fuckin' Tweeter, me and my pistol keep up
I'm ridin' with my heater, I'm a Glo Gang front-streeter
You might also like
I am sleepy, I am sleepy
I am sleepy, drankin' sleepy
But, I ain't gon' go to sleep, 'cause I am greedy, ayy
Where that money? Gotta get them fft, beepies
Don't watch me, nigga, watch TV
Are you sleepy? I am sleepy
I be up day and night 'cause I am greedy
Pick the check up in my car and I'm fleein'3Embed
