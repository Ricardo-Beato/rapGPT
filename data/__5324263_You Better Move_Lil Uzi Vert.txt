What's happening?
Remember I used to play that pinball game?
Let's go
Lil Uzi Vert
Ooh, you better move (That was before I had Internet)

Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
You better move, you better move
You better move, you better move
Louis my shoes
Pull out my whip on twenty-twos
I saw your girl, I had to scoop
Just like a bird, she gonna swoop
Neck is achoo, might catch the flu
Banana clip straight from the zoo

I'm like Mother Goose, if I say shoot, they gonna shoot
No, I'm not sweet, I just got flavor
Don't need no to water to mix up this juice
They say "Why your chain it look like a choker?"
That's for the slaves that had to wear the noose
Uh, no, you can't cuff me, baby, let me loose
The way that I live, baby, that's a roof
Matchin' closet, it came with a pool
Bro moving 8 balls, not no pool
If you ask me his name then I don't have a clue (Woah)
Make 'em hit the folks every time that I shoot
Too much money, I'm evil from the root
Yeah, my shows they bust right through the roof
Saw your crowd at your concert on snooze
I'm a dog, bitch, I howl at the moon
I remember when I didn't have cable
That was back when I used to watch Zoom

Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
You better move, you better move
You better move, you better move
Louis my shoes
Pull out my whip on twenty-twos
I saw your girl, I had to scoop
Just like a bird, she gonna swoop
Neck is achoo, might catch the flu
Banana clip straight from the zoo

I live my life like a cartoon
Reality is not my move
I don't know why that girl so rude
Oh, that's 'cause her jeans, they from Rhude
You better have you a real good excuse
He want the smoke, but I don't got a Juul
I'm like Mother Goose, if I say shoot, they gonna shoot
Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu-Gi-Oh, you wanna duel?
Blue-Eyes White Dragon, no, I will not lose
When I hit my dance, got unlimited moves
Countin' twelve thousand and that was by noon
Yeah, step on competition, changin' my shoes
Green shirt, bitch, I'm Steve, where is Blue?
Every chain on I pity a fool
I'm an iPod, man, you more like a Zune
Made her eat on my dick with a spoon, ew
Versace drawers, bitch, you Fruit of the Loom
Yeah, yeah, Fruit of the Loom
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
Ooh, you better move
You better move, you better move
You better move, you better move
Louis my shoes
Pull out my whip on twenty-twos
I saw your girl, I had to scoop
Just like a bird, she gonna swoop
Neck is achoo, might catch the flu
Banana clip straight from the zoo

Woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah20Embed
