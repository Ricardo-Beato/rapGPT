4 ContributorsDotted Lines Lyrics
And I just wanna let you know and I just, you know what

Baby, lately I don't even know what to say to ya
Grab something stable and sturdy, it's getting crazier
But why so blue? It's getting brazier too
Try to spread love and keep your head up, buckaroo
I hope you catch a W and your crew does too
Don't die multiply two plus two
And on the 7th looked up and saw the name in the stars
Next to Hüsker Dü and that's super cool
And every stick in the mud became a dick in the dirt
I don't know their music but I got the Misfits shirt
Ayo, my horoscope says that I should skip dessert
And put my fitness first
Dear God, I believe I'vе received your calling
And you'rе probably wondering why I seem to be stalling
Wanna live long enough to buy some weed at Walgreens
Is that too much to ask?

I just wanna let you know
Just wanna let you know
You might also like
I never stepped in line to be the next in line
Don't let the operator come and disconnect your line
Keep it rolling even if you forget your lines
I love it when we color outside of the lines
Opened up the hands to reach across the dotted lines
Jumped over the ropes like there ain't no lines
Is that really too much to ask?

I just wanna let you know
I gotta let you know

This ain't my story, I'm just the homie's sidekick
My psychic told me they were gonna be my psychic
I remember back before life was actually priceless
We still pretended like we liked it
Used to keep a vice grips attached to the back of the seat post
Big daddy sweatpants clapping mosquitoes
Trying to squeeze the cheddar out of a bag of Cheetos
So I can pull some records out the racks at Cheapos
Wake me up in 2072
Are you ready to die or are you ready to do?
Fuck the cops, fuck the judge, fuck the referees too
Especially you - but not you, right?
The music sells the movie and the movie sells the toys
The toys sell a lifestyle of girls versus boys
Trying to sing a lullaby in a world full of noise
Now let me hear your beautiful voice

Come on and let me know
Be the next in line
Keep, just in case you forget your lines
I love it when we, the lines, dotted lines
There ain't no lines
I'm just trying to let you knowEmbed
