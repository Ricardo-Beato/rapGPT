DY definitely Krazy

Abandon all ships, it's about to go down
No Titanic (Titanic)
There's a lot going on in my head right now
But I manage (Yeah, I manage)
Good heart, good soul, both been in bad hands
I could deal damage (Yeah, real damage)
Both hands in the air as I scream out prayers
My demons show their face in the midnight air

Just got a new house, gotta hide the skeletons in the closet
And keep 'em there, really tryna forget about 'em
They tell me God watchin' over me, I don't doubt it
But I can see Him gettin' tired of me sinnin' and wildin'
Don't know what to do with myself these days
Young rich nigga, I done fell in love with the bank
But all this money don't rid me of my pain
But everywhere I go, I could make it precipitate, rain

Fucked up (Fucked up), I did (I did)
Fucked up (Fucked up), I am (I am)
Calm down, I can't
Shit, here we go again

Abandon all ships, it's about to go down
No Titanic (Titanic)
There's a lot going on in my head right now
But I manage (Yeah, I manage)
Good heart, good soul, both been in bad hands
I could deal damage (Yeah, real damage)
Both hands in the air as I scream out prayers
My demons show their face in the midnight air

Set sail in the codeine bottle, I'ma drown in it, drown in it
Shit fills me up, but whatever goes up goes down in it, down in it
At the end of the day, I'm blessed, oh yes, crack a smile with it, smile with it
Now I'm frownin' again, life goes so fast, watch it blow in the wind
Can't get time back, I been beggin' for it

Fucked up (Fucked up), I did
Oh, fucked up, I am
Here we go again (Here we go again)

Abandon all ships, it's about to go down
No Titanic (Titanic)
There's a lot going on in my head right now
But I manage (Yeah, I manage)
Good heart, good soul, both been in bad hands
I could deal damage (Yeah, real damage)
Both hands in the air as I scream out prayers
My demons show their face in the midnight air
Midnight air, midnight air
Midnight air (Midnight air), I'ma drown in here
Midnight air (Midnight air), surrounded in the midnight air
I'ma drown in here, no Titanic, Titanic54Embed
