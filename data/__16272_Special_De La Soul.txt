It's gotta be you, it's gotta be right
No time for games, it's gotta be tight
I just want this to be special, special
If it's gonna be you, it's gotta be right
No time for games in my life
I just want this to be special, special

This is like the third time ya said you was through
I'm beggin' ya back, we loud in the parking lot causin' a scene
Campaignin' like the love ain't have no resident here
Still I stay all in the cabin
Although I know we've seen enough of good days and dirt
I bet you'd cut me just to nurse me back but damn I'd understand it
You gave ya all and I just gave it up
Put the truck in ya name
Damn ya should've known I was liability
Ignorin' the ways you would dress for a nigga
Express to a nigga I heard jibber and jabber
My apologies I left the wrong man to conduct
Take these jewels for the inconvience and neglect
You expect the worst of it
But I realize that I owe you more than explaination
I got my life in a box, what I'm proposin' is a joint account
It's cash on it - let's take our lil' business and incorporate it
It's me and you girl
You might also like
It's gotta be you, it's gotta be right
No time for games, it's gotta be tight
I just want this to be special, special
If it's gonna be you, it's gotta be right
No time for games in my life
I just want this to be special, special

First of all love, your sole caller
Before me helped create and shape your distorted image
See every man don't play games or even scrimmage
That's a lie but I'm try to be that only one
You look to, to make you smile
First you need to check my files
Understand I play the part of a sterotypical man
An regret the pain I may have left to flame
My people say "Yo that's a fine girl ya mess with"
But I told em' we have ain't a mess
Ya charm must have calluses from the grip
That it has on my heart that I ain't tryin' to rip
But by now we both should know
That it's no longer where ya at but where we tryin' to go
So do ya background checks so I can pass through these borders
And stamp my name on a lil' man or a daughter
Come on girl
It's gotta be you, it's gotta be right
No time for games, it's gotta be tight
I just want this to be special, special
If it's gonna be you, it's gotta be right
No time for games in my life
I just want this to be special, specialEmbed
