2 ContributorsWanna Hump You Lyrics
Haha, Welcome to tha Chuuch, Vol. 3 (Preach)
Big Snoop Dogg doin' it again for y'all
I told you niggas, I run the streets, 'cuz
It's my game, that's right, it's my game, nigga
I wanna spit at the hoes for a minute
Excuse me, for real
Let me holler at you bitches real quick

I ain't comin' like a goddamn fool
I'm only here, 'cause I wanna be with you
Because I love you, ooh-ooh
Now you can act like you ain't cool
But all of this shit that I'm spittin' at you
'Cause I know it (Yeah, you know I know this shit, trip)

Can we? Eastside, and blaze up some of this gushy
That's gonna get your ass high (It's gonna get your ass high)
Can we rock on? So let me sleep this dick up in you
And get you a ride (And get you a ride)
Nevеr mind if I'm carryin', oh, wanna hit that ass all night long
I just wanna hump you, you know we fuckin', babe
We gon' fuck 'til thе break of dome, so lay back and take off that thong
We gon' be fuckin', you know we humpin', babe

Back on the road, I got a show to do
With my nigga 50 and the G-Unit, I'm lovin' (G-Unit)
Yeah, I love seein' where the posters back
Ask Soopafly or my nephew Daz
Man, we does it (You know we does it)
The hoes get up wild
Especially when they let me feel this Doggystyle (Doggystyle)
I break these hoes, a store is what she wanna be
So I'ma make this ho'
I was just smokin' on, tryna get my socks blown
Won't you come join me, won't you come suck me, baby?
Fuck, it's so alone and strong, bring your homegirls, come on
All y'all, come suck me, we gon' be humpin', baby

Playboy bunny, playboy pimpin', playboy mansion, playboi mission
Playboy bunny, playboy pimpin', playboy mansion, playboi mission
Playboy bunny, playboy pimpin', playboy mansion, playboi mission
Playboy bunny, playboy pimpin', playboy mansion, playboi mission
Playboy bunny, playboy pimpin', playboy on a mission, yeah

Three, two, one, I need six new ones
And hand me them chucks, them dark-blue ones
To Crip on, creep on, and act right
And get baby girl a little act right
She wanna lay up and play with a player (What?)
Don't pay up, you can't stay, a parlay with a player
Say you, nigga, ain't playin' with your bitch
You gotta get right, get up, and get dick
'Cause that's the laws of the Dogg
Not to be broken by anyone
Rules were meant to be broke, but if you break mine
I'ma slap you and make you take five
Let's take a walk outside
Before you slip on ice, I'm twice as nice (Hahaha)
I care to kid you
Have you cryin' 'til you're mama talkin' 'bout "How did you?"
And I ain't frontin', I'm keepin' it real
I'm doin' what the fuck I want, for real (Pharrell)
Welcome to tha Chuuch, Vol. 3
Yeah, so you know
You come backstage, you get on the tourbus
When we get to the hotel room, we straight fuckin'
We can't handle them lawsuits, none of that bullshit
You see how they tryna do my nigga?
We refuse to be done, so, no
When you get in, you gon' eat some dick
It's just the rules
'Cause if you ain't lyin', you can't ride it
Chuuch, haha, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna shoot this out to all my favorite hoes, hoes, yeah
For all my favorite hoes, hoes, haha
I'm goneEmbed
