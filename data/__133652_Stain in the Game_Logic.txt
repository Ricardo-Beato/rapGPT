38 ContributorsStain in the Game Lyrics
Flyer, than the rest of 'em
I'm higher, than the rest of 'em
My first name is Sir, so I'm sire, to the rest of 'em
Nothing but the freshest writtens in my compositions
Psychological protégé, what more to say, nothing

See I'm a stain in the game, tryna scrub me out, I'm still in
I started at the bottom and now I'm spreading to the ceiling
Is you feeling this lyricism, I'm dealing like rummy, you know?
My flow smoother than gin, on its way to your tummy

Nah, see? I think we should come in like this
You know what I mean?
With that ill beat, sort of give it a different type of vibe
Uh, yeah, we finna get it like this, uh

See I'm a stain in the game, tryna scrub me out, I'm still in
I started at the bottom and now I'm spreading to the ceiling
Is you feeling this lyrcism, I'm dealing, like rummy, you know?
My flow smoother than gin on its way to your tummy
Yeah, I'll stop your heart like a pulmonary edema
I'm so hungry I need FEMA,  and I used to be a dreamer
'Til I came into fruition, now, all of y'all better listen
And understand it's my mission, that no matter where I walk
It's my purpose to glisten 'cause you rappers can't see me
Like you bought the wrong prescription, but I spit that Lasik
So close, that I can taste it, while you go back to the basis
'Cause you don't know where you headed, as soon as I shred it
You dread it like Wayne's skull
I'm one of the best, to ever do it, that ain't done it yet
And yes, that might sound cocky
But I'm just gunning for your respect, that's how you do itYou might also like11Embed
