40 ContributorsMad Solar Lyrics
I guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I'm just a star of my movie
They say I'm the chosen, and so it goes
I'm supposed to live and grow old and die alone
Talking to myself in the mirror
Take one to know one
Can we talk, just loony to loony?
How strange the notion
You don't really know no one
And what if I told you
You no longer know me
You better keep going and keep it rolling now
Ain't no thing, you don't really need me
The pressure is growing
Hard times they mold you
Into someone way colder
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em

And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
M.A.D. S.O.L.A.R
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
Oh, and people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
M.A.D. S.O.L.A.R

I guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I got to finish my movie
See my heart has been swollen, it's healing slow
Hope I don't live to grow old, no one at home
Staring at myself in the mirror, take one to know one
Want to find out 'bout the real me?
Certain moments reveal you
Especially friends who were never good friends
But want to act like they know me
You better keep going and keep on strolling
It's so crazy how you think you can play me
Show them pussies you're growing
Hard times, they mold you
To the haters, I told you
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em

And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
M.A.D. S.O.L.A.R
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
