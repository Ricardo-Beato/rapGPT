44 ContributorsBirds Lyrics
Wassup, Pablo? What's poppin'?
You got them birds? D-low?
I need 'em, I want it

Had a dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrt, skrt, skrt)
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry (No way, go)
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird (Woo!)
(I got 'em, who need 'em)
B-birds
(Come on, come on right now)
B-b-birds
(Come on, come on, come get 'em right now)
Birds
(Quavo, gone)

Just hit my phone if you want a bird
My niggas out right now on the curb (Serve)
You can get a re-rock, you can get a whole serve (Serve)
We locked and now I can front you, young nigga that's my word (Word)
Walk in the bando, look at all them birds (Birds)
Bando get low, re-up on the birds (Birds)
Got shooters on pronto, don't got no undo
At the age of 17, I hit my first kick door (Kick door)
Just me and Willie Mac, Offset, shoutout Domingo (Domingo)
Then 12 tried to get me for gang activity (Migo)
The judge dropped the charge and I thank lord (Thank you)
That's why I take this mic and I go hard
You might also like
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (Skrt, skrt, skrt)
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry (No way, go)
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird (Woo!)
(I got 'em, who need 'em)
B-birds
(Come on, come on right now)
B-b-birds
(Come on, come on, come get 'em right now)

(Gone)

Just got the word (Hello?)
Just got the birds
Shabba Ranks gold, only kick it with Ferg
You thought 'bout finessing me? Run off with a bird (Haha)
You gotta be kidding me
Charles Barkley, I got that broccoli
Fuckin' these bitches, committing adultery
Trap full of babies like a Elementary
Bando with burglar bars (Bando)
Plugged in with Italian mobs (Plugged)
Don't never put trust in a broad (No)
I'm puttin' my trust up in God
I got birds, I got chickens, I got seagulls, so many birds
My gun is an eagle
When I talk birds (Huh?)
I'm talkin' a kilo (Kilo)
Had a dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (Skrt, skrt, skrt)
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry (No way, go)
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird (Woo!)
(I got 'em, who need 'em)
B-birds
(Come on, come on right now)
B-b-birds
(Come on, come on, come get 'em right now)
Birds
(Takeoff)

The plug just hit my phone for some Funyuns, want a onion (Gas)
Exotic crocodile skin Martens, call me Dundee (Ooh)
Tito want a brick, Chico gotta cross the country (White)
Carlito for a hundred, gave bout fifty to my mama
I'm an OG in my hood, no Aretha, well respected
Toucan Sam pigeons, call me Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
I see falcons on a daily basis, Takeoff Arthur Blank
Whippin' chickens in the kitchen, trap smell like a septic tank
Black and gold everything, talkin' 'bout jewelry, not the Saints
I don't need no translator, I comprehend in a way
My plug Carlito, he can't speak no Englo, all he know is "andale" (Huh?)
I got bandos for the L-O, state-to-state, no real estate (Damn)
Had a dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (Skrt, skrt, skrt)
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry (No way, go)
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird (Woo!)
(I got 'em, who need 'em)
B-birds
(Come on, come on right now)
B-b-birds
(Come on, come on, come get 'em right now)
