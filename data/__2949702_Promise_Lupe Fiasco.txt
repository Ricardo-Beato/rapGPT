Promise, yeah
I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise, yeah
I promise these niggas ain't honest
Promise, but I keep it real
I keep it a hundred, I promise
I keep it a hundred, I promise
I keep it a thousand, I promise
I keep it ten thousand, I promise
I'm keepin' it honest, I promise
I'm keepin' it honest, I'm keepin' it honest, I promise
Repeat it, repeat it, repeat it
'Cause niggas, they know that they need it
I think that they fallin' off, they cannot keep it

Honest, I'm crossin' my heart and I'm hopin' to die
I promise, I promise, and they don't know why
I promise, I promise, I don't be gettin' high
I'm sober, I'm sober, I'm sober, I'm sober
No champagne, no vodka, no, none of that, man
Tell you I keep me a heater, I keep me a heater, believe it
I won't lead 'em wrong, said I won't lead 'em wrong
They know what I'm on, and they know what I'm on

I promise, yeah
I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise, yeah
I promise these niggas ain't honest
Promise, but I keep it real
I keep it a hundred, I promise
I keep it a hundred, I promise
I keep it a thousand, I promise
I keep it ten thousand, I promise
I'm keepin' it honest, I promise
I'm keepin' it honest, I'm keepin' it honest, I promise
Repeat it, repeat it, repeat it
'Cause niggas, they know that they need it
I think that they fallin' off, they cannot keep it
