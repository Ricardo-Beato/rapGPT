It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
You know what I'm sayin?
And it goes like this

Hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin', the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin', when suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me drivin'
By, hangin' out the window
With my Magnum takin' out some putos
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street gettin' paid from my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something ya can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something ya can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something ya can't understand
You might also like
I'm ignorin' all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around
My gat straight hummin'
Hummin'... comin' at cha...
And you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Sen got the gat, and I know that'll gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said "Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed-out
How you like my chrome?" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway...
Hahaha... that young punk had to pay
(So I just killed a man!)

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down: bullshit!
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next ya hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
So how do ya know where I'm at, when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
When you're up on the hill in your bigger home
I'm out here riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, ay yo I gotta say "fuck it"

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
(What does it all mean?)
All I wanted was a Pepsi
