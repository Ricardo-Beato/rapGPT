'Cause them bros gotta go (They gotta go)
Talkin' that shit you a ho
Talkin' that shit take your ho, take your ho (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
And then go take your ho to the ho patch
A ho to my bro, then my bro finna scope
Like woah, he's scorin'
I'm ballin', I'm ballin' like Jordan
I'm so high that I'm soarin'
I might fuck your bitch in the mornin'
This lean I got, I keep pourin'

Woah, I say that a lot
I mean it a lot, I told you I'm in it
I don't give a fuck about bitches and niggas
Just bitches and niggas, you know that that's true
And you know that I'm true
If you listen to me, I'ma listen to you (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
That I told you I'm preachin' to you
I swear that I'm teachin' to you
I'm seein' it through
I see the visions, I swear that I mean it
My nigga, you know that it's true though (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
All of my niggas they high
I'm on another planet coolin' on Pluto
And somebody got a problem
I'm kickin' shit like I'm a major in judo (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
All my niggas getting money
Yes me, myself, and I
That numero uno
Woah, woah
You know how it go, I pull up
Woah, woah
I don't gotta reload, I shoot up
Woah, woah
You know I'm the man, hold up
Woah, woah
Let me pop the Xan, hold up1Embed
