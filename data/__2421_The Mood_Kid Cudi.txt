33 ContributorsThe Mood Lyrics

Yup
Yup

Shades over my eyes
Make the creepers look back at themselves
Sittin' stuck, in emotional bliss
The skinny model girls rub coke on their gums
Tap my knee, I'm keepin' the rhythm
The young and wild take chances together
They all jump up, twist and groove
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood

No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

There's a hunger in the night
The moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame
I kissed her inner thigh
Closed my eyes, she began to make me fish
She like to go the mile
All the while I could see her tear a bit
I forgot her name, somethin that sound like Penelope
Maybe a French twang to it
Her tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
A lovely foreigner, foreign to racism
She like that young nigga vibe
My brown skin, my shagged out 'fro
I'm king to her, and she will please her friend for me
So funny how the starvin' are guardless
Naked is always honest
Her hands all over my privates, lost in the mood
You might also like
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood

No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood16Embed
