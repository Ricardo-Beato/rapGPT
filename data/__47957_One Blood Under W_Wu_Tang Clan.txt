31 ContributorsOne Blood Under W Lyrics
Modern vampires of the city, hunting blood
Blood, blood, blood
You coulda from Rema, or ya come from Jungle
You coulda come from Fire House or
You come from Tower Hill
One blood, one blood, one blood

I was rollin, showin my age, unshaven
Rugged with my Timberland boots that paid
I walk with a slight lean from the weight of my heat
Givin a green to shine infra-red beam
At the street traffic light recorders
Takin pictures of our corners
Cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em
The Chameleon throws cream to children, out the window
We movin in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan
With plastic faces and rubber hands
Fuck fame, I shoot a hole in a 50 cent piece to test my aim
How dare you call the Gods in vain
Not knowin the seriousness of this and why I came
To Earth, feet first
I dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum
No questionin to the session, I walk with gun
The magnum'll bust his head from many directions unknown
Another statistic, change the ballistics
On the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow
Scrape the craters of the brain for data
Old scriptures on withered paper
Beginnin take shape and form
When the Gods get on it and crash your college dorm
You might also like
You coulda come from uptown, or you come from downtown
You coulda come from outta town, or you come from 'round town
One blood, one blood, one blood
The fussing and fighting
The tribal war, racial war
Cause blood, blood

Now verse 2, even more deadly than the first
Unrehearsed raw footage part 2 for you
I give this dedication, project elimination
Here's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve
I'm just vanishin with the vanishin cream
Here's jewels to live by
Identify before you enter and can't leave with weed
Fuck that, we waste no time in search of those who can't breathe
A bomb only has one time to explode
When I break I'm takin everything
Turn the city streets to Dusty Rhodes
Behold this return of the Invincible Tone
Rude like Governor Tuse and King Toustume
Who gave the order to bust 'em?
Don't ask this is Genuine Draft
Blueprint ultimate legit sting international, stone love classical
Comin back, to attack in black fatigue
Wu-Tang and Junior Reid
You coulda come from Lebanon, or ya come from Iran
You coulda come from China, or ya come from Japan
One blooood, one blooood, one blooood

You coulda come from uptown, or ya come from down sout'
You coulda come from outta town, or ya come from â€˜round town
One bloood, one blooood, one blooood
The fussing and fighting
Tribal war, racial war
Cause bloood, blooood, bloood

Mothers fighting daughters every day
Fathers fighting sons
Sisters hating sisters
Rappers getting murdered, every day
You coulda come from Lima, or come from Georgia
You coulda come fire outside or come from Hawaii
One bloood, one blooood, one bloooood
You coulda come from Brook-a-lyn, or you come from Bronx
You coulda come from Queens, or ya come from Jersey
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood
You coulda come from Long Island, or ya come from Philly
You coulda from Canada, or ya from from over south
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood1Embed
