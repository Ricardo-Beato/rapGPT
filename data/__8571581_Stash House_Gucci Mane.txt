Sun Vally boys
Huh huh

I'm a stash house with shoes on
I'm a stash house with Trues on
I'm a stash house with jewls on
Walking talking stash house, I'm a million
I'm a stash house with shoes on
I'm a stash house with Trues on
I'm a stash house with jewls on
I'm a walking talking motherfucking trap a thon
I'm a walking, talking, motherfucking stash house
I'm a walking, talking, motherfucking stash house
I got shooters round me all the time, like a stash house
I'm a dope cooking, kush smoking ubber band boss

Rubber band boss, but I can sell the sauce
50,000 for a brick, AKA the stash house
 you pull up 
 business, let the drum go off
 the gass, kush man cloud
4500 for a bag right now
Say you want a 50, 
Then it's back to the crack,  all the pees down
, few racks in my stash house
In the kitchen cooking, and my shoes a stash house
My watch a stash house, my chain a stash house
So everything I buy, just know young Juiceman cashed out
You might also like
I'm a stash house with shoes on
I'm a stash house with Trues on
I'm a stash house with jewls on
Walking talking stash house, I'm a million
I'm a stash house with shoes on
I'm a stash house with Trues on
I'm a stash house with jewls on
I'm a walking talking motherfucking trap a thon
I'm a walking, talking, motherfucking stash house
I'm a walking, talking, motherfucking stash house
I got shooters round me all the time, like a stash house
I'm a dope cooking, kush smoking ubber band boss

Say you got a stash house, but you got some pennys in it
Your wardrobe, yeah you shopped at J.C. Penny's, didn't it?
Cook on the grill like Dennis, chicken like Wendy's
In a blue and black Lamb, with some blue and black 
Got a white girl that throw that pussy, I call her Ms. 
And she love that clean, but the bitch so nasty
Stash house  stash house 
I'm the trap Speelberg, you a stash house actress
 half of a mill, then that shit ain't worth stashing
She'll beg you for a deal, still got me laughing
Still talk  ten toes trapping
Sell a quarter for a hundred,  full metal jacket
Was a nigga from the 6, stayed down  bricks
He  a nigga , he won't give a nigga shit
Sun Vally boy for life, watch when the light hit
And your bitch switched, cause she  on a dope man dick
I'm a stash house with shoes on
I'm a stash house with Trues on
I'm a stash house with jewls on
Walking talking stash house, I'm a million
I'm a stash house with shoes on
I'm a stash house with Trues on
I'm a stash house with jewls on
I'm a walking talking motherfucking trap a thon
I'm a walking, talking, motherfucking stash house
I'm a walking, talking, motherfucking stash house
I got shooters round me all the time, like a stash house
I'm a dope cooking, kush smoking ubber band bossEmbed
