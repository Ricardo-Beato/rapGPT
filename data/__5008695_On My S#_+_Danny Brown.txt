3 ContributorsOn My S#!+ LyricsYeah, you know I'm on that
You know what it is nigga
It’s Danny Brown
Denmark Vessey what's good nigga, yeah
You know I'm on my shit right know, you know what I’m sayin'?
It's the hybrid, you know what I'm sayin'?
We in the middle right now, feelin' myself, yeah
I fly like paper, I'm high like Louis luggage
Drunker than a motherfucker, overcoat Brook Brothers
Dog I'm on my shit, fresher than a motherfucker
Man I got a lot of kicks, way more than your older brother
Don’t she suck a lot of dick? We call her the applepucker
When she bomb you up, look like she sippin’ applepucker (applepucker?)
Applepucker, mixed with some vinegar
If that ain't fact, mister, that don’t say sinister (sinister?)
Sinister, nigga we live by that
Nigga why you hatin' I could make your brain pop out that
Tiger fitted cap like a fuckin' toaster strudel
Man I peel yo' top like a cup of ramen noodles
I speak soft so the clothes look loud
And you might got swagger but you ain’t got style
Don't rock bling bling, the bitches like, "wow"
Versace lookin new, I ain't worn this in a while
And I'm on that
You know I'm on that
On my shit, I'm on my shit
You might also likeYeah, it's true, it's true
Ain't that right
Nah
Long as the sun shine, the hybrid got rhymes
Used to have them trays like the school lunch lines
Gourmet rhymes, yours like school lunch
Drunk the bottle on my own just like can of punch (?)
At the school dance nigga Ima start a fight
You wanna pop yo ass and I'm fucking up yo night
Best dressed, class clown, nigga you a fool
This rap shit to me sorta light high school
Fuck the crack game if you ain't got muscle
Whoever said that, man they could not hustle
Around my hood, nigga what's good
