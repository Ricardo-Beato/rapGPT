24 ContributorsSub Zero Lyrics
My neck and wrist on froze, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist is cold, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero

Easter pink my Sprite, I think I'm icy
I put a eight inside my one, I call it priceless
Five hundred for my Js, shouts out to Fly Kix
These nigga thinks I work in there, only wear fly kicks
Get it and push it down, get down and lay down
They call me "alphabets", I keep that K around
Wanna know something 'bout Young Thug?
Ask your girl, she stay around
That pussy commit crime, when they say I lay it down
Got weed stacked up like mounds, we smoke that shit by ounces
Got bezels around my watch, can't see or even count it
Got Tommy Hilfiger on the ice, I break a nigga kush on dice
She let me fuck all kind of ways, every day and every night

My neck and wrist on froze, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
My neck wrist is cold, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
Okay, my neck and my wrist, Sub-Zero
Okay, this dope that I whip, Sub-Zero
Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero

I went to the jeweler, I copped the Franck Muller
Versace my neck and my ring is Medusa
Your ho my might be bad but my bitch is way cuter
I'm taking the trips and I fly to Bermuda
Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, I get peso, I'm a Migo
I pull out the 'Rari, the bricks in the engine
Got Louis, got Bally, got Prada, got Fendi
I don't fuck with you, heard your partner is snitching
My partner got bags and they say you the witness
I'm sipping on lean and they killing my kidneys
My diamonds is green and my bitch came from Philly
I call the plug, he had to cash out
I copped me some ice and I hopped in my Bentley

It's sunny outside, I'ma hop in the Bentley
The windows is tinted, y'all nigga pretending
Y'all niggas know you can catch me at the finish
Before you take it back 'cause you know the shit is rented
Lambo doors, whole lotta hoes, six price scotch

Okay, my neck and my wrist, Sub-Zero
Okay, this dope that I whip, Sub-Zero
Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero
My ice on Antarctica
If you reach chopper knock off your Portugal
Now it's two door coupes, I came a long way from Marta
Got a traphouse been just like the Carter
And I get it like my father
You can't name another nigga that go harda'
Name 'em and I disclaim, frame 'em with out the picture
I got jewelry on, cost more than your life, nigga
Put your head up for a bargain, nigga
Hell nah, I ain't gon' argue, nigga
Wash my face off, then the job done
Jewelry heat just like the sun

My neck and my wrist on froze, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
My neck wrist is cold, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
Okay, my neck and my wrist, Sub-Zero
Okay, this dope that I whip, Sub-Zero
Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero26Embed
