10 ContributorsGangbang Rookie Lyrics
I'm not down with the republican party or the democratic party
I represent the gangsta party
(The gangsta party?)
Yes sir

I ain't no gangbang rookie, let that thang bang fully
I'm a boss out here on the west
Killer coast is my home rich rollin' on my throne with my blue bandana on my neck
Girl, come fuck with Snoop, sign up on my team there's a little room left
Girl, you heard all my songs, steady long, steady wrong, don't get your ass left
Church on the move nigga, now go and hit the turf with the news nigga (Snoop)
I got some advice for you new niggas, you wanna be in the league well tell 'em who sent ya (Snoop)

DO double G, hoes with double D's, in line to juggle these (Snoop)
Twisting up the OG, about the whole P, untill I OD, (Snoop)
The one they all wanna come to see, hoes loving me, you niggas wanna be (Snoop, Snoop)
Even Bloods fuck with Cuz, I hit the club, they're all showing me love
They like (Snoop Dogg)

You might also likeCan I get you a autograph, what's up with that DPG, Doggystyle and Aftermath
I just laugh while I'm twistin' up another zag, bad bitches kissing in the tub takin' bubblebath
I ain't no gangbang rookie police tryna book me
I'mma modern day Tookie on the set
I got the whole party poppin see you hater niggas jokin all these ice cold diamonds on my chest
They see my whole team thugging, nah they mean mugging
But that no meant nuthin'
Cause if there's problem I pull the problem solver
I call the .308 revolver put an end to all this drama, (Snoop)
*?Chop fleet dollar with that gold fleet collour?*, (Snoop)
Get them euros, get them dollars, get them zeros, get them commas, (yeaaah)
Time to get this change guess I'm like Obama
But I'mma stay the same on my motherfucking mama

(Snoop, Snoop,)
DO double G, hoes with double D's, in line to double D's (Snoop)
Twistin up the old G, about the whole P, untill I OD
The one they all wanna come to see, hoes lovin' me, you niggas wanna be (Snoop, Snoop)
Even Bloods fuck with Cuz, I hit the club, they're all showing me love
They like (Snoop Dogg)

So what up Locust
Long Beach inside
(Some names impossible to understand)
And you allready know what it is
I ain't no gangbang rookie (whaaat?), police tryna overlook me
Long Beach Eastide is where im at
Skinny side and roll on
With my tub on the bottom, I'll be shopping on the set
Let me hop on a Enzo
Let a bitch hit me up for some brain bro (hit me up)
Let them niggas now im 'bout my cake bro
WPG young Pilot fuck with (Snoop)
OG wath a young man, 15 got haters like a grown man
W-Money Sa-D who I fuck with (that my niggas)
When I was young my mum said I looked like (Snoop)
And we ride in a cool, topback, Doggystyle bangin' out mawfackin'
I'mma take her to my bed homie
And I'm thinking crystal clear
Diamonds on my neck shining like a shinereer
Even Bloods fuck because, I'm in the club with big (Snoop)
Young Pilot

(Are you, Snoop are you still basically a gangster at heart?)

Say it dawg (Gangsta hehe)
Say it like you mean it
Haha
