You ain't up wit him these niggas just ain't touchin' him
You want him out the game distract to straight bustle him
I know it's necessary because I'm ahead of every

Probably the same way, I'd run up on me and take fade
Then lie to the cops wit a straight face
Then right when you thinkin' that shit is just perfect
Hop would take it outta some rappers who didn't deserve it Just to make me feel better, send threatens and kill letters
To every rapper who I think is droppin' a ill record (Pow!)

Ehh, MCs tryna roll on opponents
Just to boost up they career when they old and Corroded

And if you really feel you've had it, You want the mic so bad Well motha fucka I suggest you come and snatch it! (Aaah)
Even if you did it wouldn't make a difference
'Cause the people you tryna attract ain't listenin'

It troubles me but the honeys be lovin' me
Some will be fiesty, but in the end I'ma feel on her double Ds

I remember the first time you overdosed
A fuckin' overload on meth
Paramedics saved your ass, you was close to ghost
You never did know which road to go
It’s like you rode the boat
And sailed away and hoped to hit the golden coast
But you sank like the Titanic
The incident, it left your life damaged
And that’s when I panicked
You thought you had it locked
Well, you ain’t on the right planet
If you're tryin' to live your life right, plan it
It’s like your mind vanished, you don’t even know that
I wish that we could go back
'Cause it’s so sad when I tell jokes and you don’t laugh
Like you used to, I really hate to stress it
But you strange to mess with, so I keep my distance
'Cause you always got this blank expression
Like you’re confused and unaware of yo' surroundings
Emotions have gone and no one’s found it
It’s overwhelmin', your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass
Now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world
'Cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home!)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block
Like we used to (Where’d you go?)
I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future
But I was wrong
You might also like
I should've stopped you when I had the chance to do so
But back then I had felt like that was too bold
You started hangin' with new folks
And made the drug environment yo' new home
This world is too cold
Could I have prevented this? Who knows?
They convinced you that this shit was cool and hip to do
Sayin' it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible
So you started skippin' school
Hangin' with these wicked dudes
Unaware that when you got older you played a bigger fool
And it’s pitiful, where the fuck they at now?
In they mid-20s passed out inside of a crack house
Back when you met 'em I had doubts
They put you on the bad route, and when you needed they help to pick you up, they fuckin' backed out
They fuckin' got you, I can’t lie, but now your brain's fried
You don’t even act like you’re the same guy
Your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain’t listen 'til the fire burned your ass
Now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world
'Cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home!)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block
Like we used to (Where’d you go?)
I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future
But I was wrong
I ain’t never felt this shit before, it gets me sore
I reminisce on us playin' Nintendo 64
And that Christmas in '97 we got new crispy boards
And we was doin' ollies in my kitchen on the slippery floor
Shit changed and it happened quick, but I can’t forget
That you was the first homie I started rappin' with
You could’ve had half of this back when I had established it
But now I have to sit and feel bad
Look at what your actions did!
Man, you were so outgoin' and so hysterical
Seein' you now is just unbearable, it’s terrible
You should've made your choices wisely
Fuckin' with poison ivy; without your brain, please tell me, what would your point in life be?
It’s a struggle to get your ass to listen
Really hurt me and the rest of your family
With all your bad decisions
We always told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass
Now you understand
Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world
'Cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home!)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block
Like we used to (Where’d you go?)
I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future
But I was wrong
Excuse me, do you need a ride?
Looks like you’re goin' downtown
Yes, hop in my ride!
Well, hi, I’m Chris Dolmeth
I’m your best friend (Chris Dolmeth)
I’m all you need (Chris Dolmeth)
If you wanna succeed, hop in my ride
Well, hi, I’m Chris Dolmeth30Embed
Hey yo, pass me a Kleenex before I lay this shit down
I can’t believe this shit man
I tried to be a lover boy, little bitch broke my heart
Words of wisdom

Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

What happened to “be honest with me and I’ll be honest with you”
Your whole past Mrs. Innocent I thought was the truth
Bitch had me felling ill on my knees barfing my food
I’m no longer the same nigga now; I’m heartless and rude
My homies said never trust a ho, but I casually ignored it
'Til I got caught up in it, now I see the reason for it
But I had to be retarded, go and release my heart
I always thought that I’d bring the drama, never knew she would spark it
That’s just the way to learn, I go the tables turned
To get to my cold state of mind I had to make it burn
For pussy, one night stands is my only source
Fuck that love shit little bitch, I’m feelin’ no remorse
Why should I? You had me acting like a fool
Trapped inside your loop because you’re scared to sacrifice the truth?
Come on, how many niggas you really fuck with?
How many time you really suck dick?
Quit lyin’ to me you dumb prick
You might also like
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

I’ll never find love, screw it, fuck it
Been through enough shit
There’s nothin’ you bitches can do to go renew your justice
I’m too disgusted and I’m tired of being played with
You should have thought about all this prior to the occasion
You fucked around, thought for a while you was amazing
'Til I got the pieces and piled up the equation
Had a nigga goin’ in and out your crotch
Not knowin’ this little skank done been around the block
A year later out the blue we having trust issues
After I already fell in love with you
Come to think of it the image does fit you
You fucked every nigga on the thug menu
And I’m the dumb kid who
Thinks he found his soul mate, he’s blinded by the light
'Til it goes dim, now his hand is right beside a knife
A violent type of life is what society offers
Man, why even bother?
Just remember
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

They’ll hide their colors from ones they wanna love
Even if you ask her, more than likely she ain’t gonna tell
Been through this too many times, so take it from me, ooh take it from me!

Yo if you about to fall in love you need to think twice on it
‘Cause girls are triflin’, they’ll start lyin’ when they invite you in
Have you feeling like the man; you think you found a keeper
Girls have said they love you; but when she say it, the sound is sweeter
Your love drowning deeper, now she’s acting like she smoking pounds of reefer
Confessing that whole fuckin’ town done beefed her
Then you like “I left this bitch with my heart, she ripped it apart
I should have seen this from the start”
The shit you and her go and do it sounds nice
But the fact remains, you don’t turn a ho into a housewife
That’s what the fuck I did, and I regretted it, that’s why I’m negative
No medicine could get rid of this
The next bitch who lies to me, watch me damage her
I’m pickin’ her up and body slamin’ her
And that’s real, so if you think your girls a ho but you didn’t witness it
Assume she’s a ho, 'til proven innocent
And just remember
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

Fuck love, Don’t hate me
Hate these lying ass bitches for making me make you hate me1Embed
Yo, let me take you to the tribe real quick

I'm from that small city called Panorama
Where the vatos roam and they blast they hammers
Never had no sense, so I'm bad with manners
Who'd've thought I'd be livin' life in the flashin' cameras?
Got bitches on my nuts like pubics (Ooh!)
Niggas could never figure me out like Rubik's (Cubes)
I be bullyin' everybody like I'm Brutus! (Who?)
So don't underestimate me, I do this, truest
I'm calm and ill but still drop bombs, I kill
You know the deal, with my godly skills
You wanna jog the field in my shoes? There's a lot to fill
It won't happen, you cannot be real
Man, there's so many rappers that wanna catch my fade
So many bitches that wanna snatch my brain
I'll probably end up on the news, dead, bullet in the head
Mama in the street yellin': "That's my baby!"
You want me to keep it to a minimal with the syllables?
I think you should get up off my genitals
Every nigga identical when they spit a flow, this shit is critical
I'ma have to get rough and get all my sentinels
Nigga, what you be sippin' on? I'm guessin' your pen is broke
Is it difficult for you to get better? You're so despicable
'Cause your shit is boo-boo, your bars are predictable
I do not bump it, it's hard to get into you
Please admit it, man, the voyage is radical
Mind is set to just destroy, I'm an animal
Killin' shit, man, I'm a poisonous antidote
I be on it, man, your boy's international
Yeah, I'm mad with rhymes
Been doin' this since '99, I'm a mastermind
Homie, it's 2015, and all my niggas gon' kill it
When they finish the job, the other half is mine
You might also like
Fool, you ain't on that real shit
I live here, you on a field trip
I'm made of shit you ain't built with
You a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick
It's no doubt niggas gon' feel this
You don't scare niggas, not even a little bit
I serve you, you get the bill quick
Crown me, I'm a real prince

Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said "Give me that shit!"
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)
I said "Give me that shit!"
Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said "Give me that shit!"
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)
Give me that shit!

The rap game's mine, I revolve it round me
I think I have lost it, and my mind's exhausted
I'm nauseous from the process
Of hoppin' on stage and tryin' to dive in moshpits
Nigga, why you focused on diamonds?
These Cubic Zirconia's all up in my ear
Over jewelry, I don't get excited
My perception in life is "Why the fuck am I here, nigga?"
I've been this way since your ass has been suckin' on titties
Since niggas cocked back and start bustin' on 50
Since J-Lo was mobbin' in public with Diddy
Since Biggie and Pac got shot up, it's a pity
That bullshit you're talkin', I'm not in the mood, bro
Continue yappin', you'll see Hopsin is brutal
Keep pushin' me, you gon' get dropped with some Judo
You fannin' out like you want cock in yo' culo
Niggas only in it for money and bitches
I don't even think they wanna rap no more
But they wanna be all over the television
Rockin' feminine shit, tryin' to act homo
Old bi-ass niggas can't bypass niggas
"I can't change even if I tried"-ass niggas
Tight jeans on so they show yo' ass-ass niggas
In the pool with the homie, tryin' to splash-ass niggas
Fruity as Mike and Ike, you'll get diced to rice
When I arrive I pull up like "Hi! Surprise!"
It might be wise to hide when the nightly skies are high
Fuckin' with an ape; no Life of Pi
Tell me, what position would the game be in
Without me havin' the ability to rape the pen?
Pound Syndrome, this is it, I'm weighin' in
I still hate y'all niggas and I can't pretend
Fool, you ain't on that real shit
I live here, you on a field trip
I'm made of shit you ain't built with
You a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick
It's no doubt niggas gon' feel this
You don't scare niggas, not even a little bit
I serve you, you get the bill quick
Crown me, I'm a real prince

Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said "Give me that shit!"
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)
I said "Give me that shit!"
Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said "Give me that shit!"
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)

You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)
Yeah! The Dark Knight's in this bitch
Without the mask and cape, I'm actin' ape shit
Faggot, embrace it, I just got validation
On my ass-whoopin' ticket; I'm that amazin'
It's my mad invasion of smashin' brains in
My fuckin' pen and pad was anxious
All these haters who mad and be naggin' at me
I flip they ass off like an acrobat on a trapeze
And I'll be lashin' back like a Shaq attack on these rap beats
You thought that I was done with completely bein' an ass? (Please)
Don't think you raw just 'cause you got success
I'll uppercut your ass so many times
You look like you was noddin' yes

It’s sick and spiteful, 2Pac’s twisted grim disciple
I been this nice, yo, way before Michael had vitiligo
My ex girl's heart is so bruised and burned
Beggin' me to quit rap
But I'm just not ready to let it loose for her
Am I Hopsin or am I Lucifer?
I didn't blow 'til I started talkin' a gang of shit
Tell me who you prefer
Nigga, you ain't ill in the booth
I'd die and do my next show as a hologram
And still be realer than you
See, I'm the shit, like I slithered in poo
I'm sicker than stickin' my freakin' dick

Man, Kanye on that bullshit
That’s why the paparazzi made that nigga hit his fuckin' head, that’s what that fool get
You think you God now
You half-assin' rap little faggot bitch?
Perhaps you suffered brain damage
Back when you had that accident
But most importantly, hip-hop isn’t dead no more, you see
'Cause Kendrick took the bar
And then raised it up higher for MC's
Unfortunately the little nigga's like 4 feet 3
The guy's a fuckin' midget, his high is still really short to me
Fuck givin' my pencil breaks
My mental state tells me to renovate
If you hand me your shit, I'll toss your demo tape
“Hop, if you're not spreading love
Then why do you even write music?"
'Cause this is how I feel
When I ain’t rappin' on the mic, you bitch!
Am I supposed to coat it up? Am I not allowed to open up?
I spill the blood of rappers
And use Weezy dreads to soak it up
Bustin' like South Central driveby's
Support the guy with white eyes
But nigga, don’t ride my dick when I’m on that high rise
Your bullshit, come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!
I got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin’ on it

I was taught that education is the only way to make it
Then how'd I get so much money inside my savings?
My teachers never saw the heights that I was fuckin' aimin'
Did the man who invented college go to college? Hm, okay then
Am I the only one that noticed humans on the same shit?
Y'all thoughts are sailin' on the same ship
And if that's the case, then that's the reason that you ain't shit
Let me enlighten you, my niggas, just let your brain drift

First of all, the best type of marketin'
Is marketin' that doesn't feel like marketin'
It makes the people feel like they a part of it
And when it's done right, corporations think it's marvelous
They feed us these ideas and they would place 'em in our hearts to sit
It's why players are good at gettin' chicks
It's why Nike is good at sellin' kicks
It's why Disney is loved by all the kids
Why McDonald's owners are super rich
We're too blinded to ever see 'em pitch
See, when this happens we take our health
Wealth, lives, and just hand 'em off
Thinkin' that we did this from organic thoughts
I know you seen parents trick kids
With candy, toys, and Santa Claus
The same method is used to trap adults
But instead of candy, it's with money, religion, drugs, and alcohol
Mention that shit and it's gon' arouse us all
I done seen niggas get into fights over cigarettes like a pack of dogs
They get you hooked and then they laugh at y'all
You might also like
I really hate to break it to you
But your life's bein' played with
You have not witnessed the world
'Cause you stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly

Man, can't you see we're robots
Who know not what we do and we got no shot
In the real world until we climb out of this ice-cold box
Your whole life has been part of a whole plot
To keep you at the bottom while they on top
Stay quiet, then they won't stop
They always tryna show us what we don't got
They do it to all of us 'til we finally break and go cop a gold watch
Knowin' we need the cash for rent, my ass is sick
Just thinkin' about how rich and powerful all these bastards get
They package ideas like it's oxygen
They make us feel like if we ain't got it we fucked and we cannot fit in
This fuckin' system is not your friend
And understand they controllin' your thoughts 'cause they got a lot to win
Niggas get turned away when I mention this
Ignorance is bliss, but I don't give a fuck, I won't censor shit
The Matrix is real and you done entered it
It's way too intricate for you to ever realize it you fuckin' simpleton
I really hate to break it to you
But your life's bein' played with
You have not witnessed the world
'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly

Yo, fuck Hollywood! Fuck all these reality shows!
Makin' us feel lame unless we blowin' stacks on new clothes
Makin' us feel like we ain't cool unless we have a few hoes
Makin' us feel like we ugly unless we have a new nose
I see naturally beautiful women get Botox, fake tits
Fake lips, they so brainwashed and it doesn't make sense
Focus on your life and the path you pursuin'
'Cause y'all too busy worried 'bout what Kim Kardashian's doin'
Check it, most of this shit that you sheep are watchin' on television
Is fake as fuck and it's not real, I rebel against it
It's the Devil's business, they just reel y'all in
If they say it we do it, yo I'm tryna tell y'all, man
The system created the stereotype for the Black image
That's why my people are scared to be different
Why don't you get it? I'm done practicin' these ridiculous rituals
It's time I become a real individual and just do me
I really hate to break it to you
But your life's bein' played with
You have not witnessed the world
'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly

Use your mind, be yourself
Don't be nobody else but you
You and the meaning of life
There's no rules, no rules, no rules
Fly away! Fly away!
Away, away, away!
Life's too short not to live it
The world is all yours, come get it
Just go and get it, it's beautiful84Embed
Niggas wishin' I fell o-o-off
But I'm forever ill, that's by law
These commercial niggas keep jockin', killing's my only option
Ask about me boy, I get shit popping
(Yeah, yeah, Pound Syndrome)
My mind's telling me kill all these niggas
(Pound Syndrome)
There is no limit to my madness
I'mma smash it, smash it, smash it

Bitch, FV is the Voltron crew
Talkin' that shit, we gon' roll on you
The game ain't nuttin' but a mothafuckin'
Battlefield and we killers so don't run through
Man there isn't much hope ya can hold onto
I'm up in the mix like pulp orange juice
Nigga you cannot walk in my sewn-on shoes
You thought I was quittin', the joke's on you
(Nigga laugh out loud)
Got the crown, I can't pass mine down
Demons in me, can't cast mine out
Nope
You can't forget me with the slashed eyebrows
Please excuse me when I'm at my prows
You might get trampled
The day'll never come up when I get handled
When the fire's lit then don't bite the candle
Your future's dim, I've got psychic channeling
And you know this man, this territory is vulture land
Y'all say he ain't shit until he became rich and bitch niggas, I wrote this plan
Sure that it's obvious now
Any struggle, I'mma body ya *blaow* (c'mon)
Don't you ever try to copy my style
Little nigga, ain't no jockin' allowed
Uh-uh
I pop out the blue like a Crip with a rag
I got the juice, watch you listen to Chance
I'm in the booth on a mission to smash
Pocket the loot, I be gettin' this cash
Hop is the truth that's why niggas is mad
I came to bruise with a pen and a pad
As of lately, I've been itching to smash
So here is my ass, you can kiss in advance

I spit shit like I got chest congestions
You shoulda known to never neglect the reckless
Time to myself was the best suggestion
Sex before bed and sex for breakfast
The sound that you're hearin' is the stress digested
You ever tell me, a little less aggression
You'd better get ghost 'fore your head get pressed in (back up)
You rap niggas just a facade
You only do ten-percent of your job
Your producer is the only reason that they bumpin' your shit while they sit up and nod
Who the fuck you think you kiddin' bro?
You think you're fly because you gettin' dough?
If your label would stop paying radio stations to play you
You think we would feel it? No
That's just how it goes
Please do not get close, this is not a joke
Better be jottin' notes of my hottest quotes
Till your pockets swole, puto vámonos (ay wey!)
Shit I'm just talkin', don't mind me
I guess it's my comical mind state
The moment I came into the game
I've been gettin' fame, I've been the hottest since MySpace
I ain't even gotta try to amaze ya

Yup, I done made a career
Most niggas think my situation is weird
But don't get it twisted, I know what I'm doing
I've been had it locked, I'm just making it clear
Niggas wishin' I fell o-o-off
But I'm forever ill, that's by law
These commercial niggas keep jockin', killing's my only option
Ask about me boy, I get shit popping
(Yeah, yeah, Pound Syndrome)
My mind's telling me kill all these niggas

First time I met her was at a meet and greet
She ran up in a hurry and was like "woah"
"Hi Hop, I'm Ramona (hi)
Please forgive me, I might go nuts
I don't know but I'm like so lucky
And I just wish I could just...oh fuck
I'm nervous and I feel worthless
Please don't think I'm doing this on purpose
I just cannot control all my urges
You're just...oh my God you're so perfect"
Man if you fuck with this bitch then you're doomed (yup)
She followed me and my tour crew
To my hotel, I'm like "who you?
Where you going?" she said "your room" (silly)
Like "woah look, ho you gotta go, just because I ripped the mic
Don't mean you get the right to follow me back to my hotel room, you ain't 'bout to spent the night, aight?"
She said "okay, Marcus, what if I give you my pussy (what?)
Oh my God, getting fucked by Hopsin, do you know how awesome that would be? Ah"

How bitch, damn, I had my cock locked up
With a latex condom, and we just fucked two days ago
Now how the fuck a baby pop up?
Ah, she like "Jarren you're right, must be SwizZz or maybe Dizzy Wright

And now I regret it, and Jarren, you're a fucking liar
I only know you because of fucking Hopsin, okay?
And I genuinely thought you were a nice fucking guy
So I sucked your dick, and you made fun of me
You made fun of me for sucking your fucking cock
I so can't live with myself right now
....Okay I'm over it12Embed
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me

I'm fucking tired of playing God when you in need
The choices you made are on you completely, what's it got to do with me?
You mobbing through the streets, clueless but it's not like you could see
You know I'm cool, so you take it like it's an opportunity
To get some free money, damn you ain't got no shame
You been living off of my dough, bitch I'm not your bank
You be asking to borrow knowing that you not gon' pay
Abusing the privilege my nigga, that is not okay
Why don't you get it? I shouldn't have to explain it
Our foundation should be on some real shit, not you asking for payments
So create a dream, then get off your ass and then chase it
I'm mad and frustrated dealing with this shit, I'm lacking the patience
You the homie, I don't mind you coming around dog
But I should not have to pay for your downfall
Choose your faith, but still even if your day seem great
Just know I got your fucking back either way, you already know

I've been there when you needed me the most

Where would you be without me?
Without me

Now my own family tripping, I ain't think I would get this shit from siblings
The money I'm making is yours right? It's a given
Let me tell y'all why I get a different feeling
Y'all was living good watching me and my momma struggle once we get the bills in
I don't recall any help or sympathies
Since 15 I been paying rent, you know what that did to me?
Could have been here, had this rap shit popping off, if y'all had lent the hand
But y'all wasn't worried 'bout helping us, you had a different plan
Focused on yourself, and now you holding on for help
You were self centered, and that was just an open door to hell
Oh, you need some money now, yeah of course I know the deal
You want the benefits without playing the courses on the field
You ain't even doing your best or trying
Don't ask me for shit unless you dying, this is me testifying
Just know that when your bright days going straight
I couldn't have your back without feeling strange but you already know
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me

Money can leave you isolated 'cause people are shady
So why debate it? They love cash and fantasize to make it
To get it, we'll fight and break shit, develop unrighteous ways
Even taking the side with Satan, thankfully I've awaken
Foes who abused the privilege by having those who were gifted
Around them close and they vision, stop corroding your friendships
Don't be having your hands out, smiling, hoping to get shit
Mooching off of a man's treasure is bogus and it's just
Not the way you should function with brothers when you're amongst 'em
That is what we call punk shit and it can leave you stuck in
A boat that's already sunken, this can happen to anyone
Sisters, brothers and cousins, they disrespecting, then fuck 'em
That's the way that the fountain leaks, keep on pushing your boundaries
In due time I am bound to see all the snakes that surrounded me
I know that if my brightest days turn gray
You wouldn't have my back unless there was pay, it ain't no secret
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me11Embed
Yeah, early 2014 I was on the Knock Madness tour
I was mad about it, I half-assed my album
'Cause I really didn't know what I was rapping for
I was going through a break up and that was hard
I wasn't in my right mind, nigga that's for sure
Every night I was praying and I would ask the Lord
To please give me strength, so I don't slam the door on my fans
But no luck I was stuck
Even though a nigga had a plus size buzz
I didn't even know who the fuck I was
I tried so hard to see a plus side, but
I couldn't find the spark inside the dark
Even with my crew saying nice remarks
It felt like some darts were stuck inside my heart
I was thinking that a brand new life's the start
But I couldn't leave, I made a commitment
On my off time the fans invaded my business
So I started feeling a gang of resentment
Flipping on everybody when they ain't even did shit
I needed to go home and gather my thoughts
I didn't wanna suicide as the result
So the night at my Fort Collins show before I hit the stage
I left through the back for a walk and no one saw
I thought I was going up to the store to get a drink or somethin'
Then a voice had told me to keep walking
And do not step foot on that stage for nothing
So I kept on walking
Then I camped out up in an abandoned house
I hated this rap shit and I hated my life
The spotlight does that when you can't get out

'Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please 'cause I don't know

Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry

I got a girl back home, yeah
God know she the sweetest thing on earth
I can't sleep on her
But there's too many women on tour and I try not to cheat on her
Man, my options for pussy are unrealistic
There's bitches who'd give up a lung for this dick
My music be leaving 'em sprung and twisted
The average nigga would have fun with this shit, that's real
Here is a secret, you don't have to keep it between you and I
Upcoming rappers who 'bout to be touring, I promise the road will eat you alive
But you know that shit when you rise
And by no surprise, I'm not gon' feed into the lies
No, I'm not gon' say that you wrong
But I'm not gon' say that you right, it's hard to keep quiet
When all I do is hold you down
If I ain't know you then, well I feel like I know you now
I know you had a little doubt, but to hop off stage and find out
You done walked out, and you not taking nobody calls
You don't wanna deal with it
But I'm looking at these fans like 'damn, there's a lot of y'all'
You got me tripping with the bodyguard
Like "Nigga, how the fuck you lose the headliner?"
Now I don't care that you left the show
I just wish you woulda let me know
'Cause I don't know if you've been kidnapped
Or know somebody from the city where they live at
But, the way you went about it make it hard for me to feel bad
Honestly it made a nigga real mad
'Cause I'm texting you like, "Hop the devil just testing you
And Fort Collins got respect for you"
And that's why the next day, you was like

'Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please 'cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat
And I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry

(Money and the fame)
It just doesn't feel so right lately

The Pound, the-the-the-the-the

If you're looking for trouble then you found it, the new album
Of two-thousand-and-fifteen, I'm too violent
This shit seems like I'm cooped out with lucid dreams
I'm a new route for these emcee's
This is a drought that's coming
I'm about to sprout to start a new style's full of envy
I need to cool down what is in me
Everything I had bottled up pukes out when the pen bleeds
You drown from a 16, who's doubtin' the sick steeze?
I could spit a wild verse without taking a breath
Then crowd surf, who's helping this kid breathe?
The worlds against me so I gotta come harder than the average
Think smarter than the masses
Everybody's on the move, ain't no time to get caught up in the traffic
When shit goes down I got the heart of an assassin
This here's harder than my last shit
Gotta do it now, no luck in tomorrow if it crashes
If I do die before I awake, I don't think too many will feel sorrow for my ashes
With this song I've frozen time, don't skip this, don't rewind
The throne is mine, close your eyes as I provoke the mind
This was bound to happen before I wrote the lines
And it's so divine the way my influence multiplied
It's like I created a cult inside this rap industry
Please don't look so surprised
I'm at the top, I ain't throwing down a rope to climb, come on

Yo, you ever had a homie you did everything for?
But when it comes down to helping you, they barely support?
When you around them you feel like you stuck with various chores
They dead weight, but you love 'em too much to bury their corpse
So you keep 'em around, hoping that the sun gon' shine
Ain't no harm and I'mma give this nigga one more try
And then they screw you again and you like, fuck no, why?

And fuck me, too, for like eighty dollars?
I need my dick scrubbed and bathed in water
I hold the bitch down to play some doctor
If I ask her for it, it's gon' make it awkward
If I tip her well, she'll give brains and swallow (oh, yeah)
I'm a nutcase with ADD
Who rapes these beats, don't try cause you can't be me
Ya'll can't be pleased, stop hatin' on my angry steez
It makes me cheese, I barely know my ABC's
But still I'm on and I made like (two million bucks)
Oh, look at y'all niggas now (you give a fuck)
Shit, askin' to be on my team
Tryna take my goddamn cream, 'cause you niggas stuck
Same niggas always name droppin'
Like, "Aye, Hopsin, I rap too, I'm tryna get paid off it
Dre heard my shit and said it was great
I'll probably get signed to Eminem any day
And next week, Snoop Dogg, he gon' get me blazed
One time, I opened up a concert for MGK
My big partner, lil cousin, man, he friends with Drake
And Big Boy up at Power said he'll get me play
I had a video on Worldstar, dawg, believe it
I don't know what happened but it got deleted"
Man, if you don't get your ass out of my God damn face talkin' that bullshit, nigga!
Stop it with the lies, dude, I'ma just remind you
I hate phony niggas, I will not pretend to like you
Thirsty ass niggas love talkin' when I slide through
Fuck you, nigga, you ain't hoppin' into my crew
Damn, shit
Fuck, nigga
I just can't deal with these niggas no more, man
Yeah, yeah, nigga
I just can't deal with these niggas no more, man
Yeah, yeah
I just can't deal with these niggas no more
Fuck, shit
Man, I just can't deal with these niggas no more, man
Fuck, shit, damn

Baby, I know we goin' through shit and you feel like there ain't no solution
You say I'm a nuisance and think I be playin' these games with your heart and not purposely bruise it
That's when I lose it and flip, put the blame all on you like it's all your fault
Now I'm goin' through your phone, you goin' through mine, and we wrestlin', I'm hopin' you don't call no cops
Baby, I love you, don't be jealous of females I know that I've met down the way
You mention they name on a regular basis and you just be givin' the space in my brain
You'll look me straight in the face, swear that I'm stickin' my penis up in every girl that I'm friends with
And that's the moment I say, "I don't even know why I'm in a relationship, I want to end it"
Let's just chill the fuck out, girl, we livin' in the same damn house
Everywhere I go, you go, and you go, I go, so what we naggin' about?
Shit, not a goddamn thing, maybe we just like to hear ourselves talkin'
We do it way too often, I think we both lost it
Our love just might be in the coffin, oh shit

I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love

I feel like your parents don't like me, I hate that you tell 'em our problems
See, when I first met 'em I knew that they fell in love with me, but then I fell straight to the bottom
Now your daddy textin' me sayin' to fly you home and he bein' so passive aggressive
Then I'm like "Sure you gon' pay for her ticket?" That is the question, dammit I'm stressin'
I've been sufferin' from manic depression, baby it takes a real man to confess it
I don't care if you confront me with issues you got, just be careful with how you address it
'Cause sometimes you attackin' me the wrong way, and then my mind think the wrong way
Then all of a sudden I be actin' like I got no brain, and I'm doin' foul shit like it's okay
But don't say I ain't ever tryna make things better, you been the only focus since the day we met up
Every time we get into it, you got me wishin' that I never broke up with my girlfriend back in Maryada
You say I don't love you then I don't know what else to do
'Cause I don't want nobody else but you
I know that I've been hurtin' you and you've been hurtin' me
So baby let's get it right because fightin' doesn't help the bruise, we both lose

Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love

Why do we fight so often?
These games are oh so ridiculous though we cannot let this shit get to us
We just need to focus on the brighter side so we can make it
And if you ain't doin' somethin' I like, then I promise you that I'ma be a little more patient

'Cause these bad vibes are contagious and our relationship is now breakin'
And I know, I know, I know your heart is constantly achin'
It's like I snatched it out of your chest and tore it up, just tore it up
And I, I played the bad guy towards you more than once, yes, more than once
Man, this shit be frustratin' me
If you ain't the one then who may it be?
We tried to make love, but we made a beast
Now we just stuck 'cause we can't agree
This is my heart, please take a piece
And put it in a safe place to remind you
There's a million other guys in the world to choose
But none of 'em will ever love you like I do, baby
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me

Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love

Ya'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming
That's how I roll, dawg
The second niggas take they eyes off me
I leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg
I'm the realest, believe me
Niggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me
Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga

Yeah, you behind if you don't know the power (nigga)
Plotted this shit the moment Ruthless started goin' sour (what?)
Niggas is sayin' fuck you to us, but we have spoke it louder
Now they come to us for advice in the game, they know it's ours (true)
Cause It's so hard just to survive in this era
We learn from trial and error, it's hard for cowards to bare us
They know the style is terror, nigga we everywhere
Yeezy and Hov ain't the only niggas that's wildin' in Paris
Back in the day, me and my nigga SwizZz was always in grind mode
Reppin' that 818 was just like walkin' that tightrope
We've seen rappers come and go and get lost in this cycle
So we had to fuckin' make sure we left all of your minds blown
SwizZz? He told me 'bout his brother Damien sayin' that he could create a structure for us
We're guaranteed to make a win
I said I'm in, let the games begin
So he introduced us, then after that
We plotted on some ways to make us trend, yeah

Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga

You see, I took a shot out of the glass of mischief
Made an album so raw the way you just had to get it, every track explicit
I figured those of you who was in love with rap would listen
And tell your parents that it's the one gift they should grab for Christmas
Then I blew up way faster than what I had predicted
It's like magic, isn't it, they love my language and graphic image
Some people thought Ruthless put me into a bad position
But I over came it and outshined 'em, I'm back up in it
2011, went on a nation wide tour
Came back and dropped that Ill Mind 4
That put me in a cool place, swiped up a million views in a few days
I celebrated inside of swimming pools sippin' Kool Aid
I shot a video with my nigga Tech and B.o.B
I went from feeling lonely to how does everyone know me?
2012, I made the XXL Freshman list
I knew that this fuckin' game was gon' be mine when I stepped in it
Come on, man
Ya'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming
That's how I roll, dawg
The second niggas take they eyes off me
I leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg

Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga

I was online chillin', bloggin' and whatnot (okay)
I stumbled across this one nigga, reminded me of a young Pac (right)
I asked Dame if he heard of Dizzy he said, "Come on Hop
I been bumpin' his shit before you, bruh, his songs hot."
If he had that push, then so many doors'll become unlocked
He said we should sign him, I said that's a long shot
We flew him to Denver to see our show and said you fuck with this shit?
He said, "Shit nigga, yiggity yamp, I'm up in this bitch."
A few months later, one of the homies had stopped me
Asked if I had seen this raunchy, zombie filled, godly video, that's beyond beast
I said, "probably, I don't know, who the fuck you speakin 'bout?"
He showed me Skitzo by Jarren Benton, I started freakin' out!
I'm like, oh shit! I had to show SwizZz
And Dame and they both flipped, it's a trip, this nigga's so sick!
We had to put him on quick and blow this nigga up
Now we got a serious squad, the truth, it is nuts
Yo, I took the college route to figure out my path in life
Romp the UCI and that lead me right back behind the mic
I tried to make my dad proud, brother got his MBA
While I was wildin', takin' random classes tryna find my way
Junior year, I had to bounce not to blindly chasin' dream
Calculated riffs, I knew that I devised a perfect scheme
Hop was gazin' at the moonlight, I just hit the valley scene
Dame got rocked by the recession, then we formed the fuckin' team
F-U-N-K-V-O-L-U-M-E, nigga
Seven years into this shit, somehow we're only gettin' bigger
And we're just now gonna start the shit, I've been up out the picture
Dizzy, Hop, Jarren, and Hoppa stay confident I deliver
So I'm grateful for the chance and the position that I'm placed
Meet the aftermath, the aftermath, the Funk is in your face
Independent livin', we control every decision made
What up Dame? Prepare the reign, we killin' this thing, it won't stop, bitch!

Haha, Zzzeed up
Don't act like you don't know what time it is fool
SwizZz
Dizzy motherfuckin' Wright
Jarren Benton
DJ Hoppa
Let's make it

Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga8Embed
Man, fuck these niggas, punk G niggas
Things get rowdy, I'ma crush these niggas
Fuck these niggas, punk G niggas
Worse comes to worse, I'll bust these niggas
I'll keep my crew with you if you keep your crew with me
Nigga you know, I'll keep my cool with you if you keep your cool with me, hey

Fuck bein' a nice dude, niggas rather see me fail, in this world to make it to make it like my teachers in High School
Never had no problems in life 'til I came with that real shit when a nigga hopped on the mic
Won't stop 'till my pockets is right
I'm tryna stack that d-o-e to the top of the sky
Niggas wanna give Hopsin the eye, put down the Glock and the knife, I'll show you how I get it poppin' tonight
I'm ready to hit nerves, I reckon you'll get served, then death is where you'll be headed like Nick Burp
My sick words'll make a nigga shit turds
Been a hard-headed brother since birth
I'm steamed up, I pinch my knuckles so hard my fist bursts
Ain't nothin' to say, I'm just cursed
Make sure you wanna lurk if you rap whatever the kid verses
Push buttons too hard, you'll get hurt, it gets worse


I'm bein' real, what you want, dog?
I'm an ill nigga, you could say I'm from the junkyard
I come from the blocks where the pumps are
Easy access, you could get dumped on

The good die young so I'm livin' as a bad kid, it's the black kid, I make you sick of this madness

Soon as niggas caught my diss, they interest to go and stick in my blacks quick
You think you tight 'cause the shit you bust?
I don't give a fuck, I'ma leave you wish you was
I made you, you fake dudes, the fuck, like it ain't true
You niggas wanna play me, I fade you
I pay dues and I ain't have to follow the rules to learn music, straight go to college like you
I'm sick with it, homie, the tracks gotta stay crazy, I did the shit on my own like potty trained babies
Done looked niggas up too, and only thing I got back was a finger that said fuck you
Now who wants some of the action?
Niggas don't wanna get at me, fuck around and run up on 'em with matches

Nigga, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)
Homie, I made you rich, paid your rent (Damn right!)
Bitin' the hand that was feedin' you
This shit don't make any sense
Nigga, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)
You know this is that real shit
How you gon' forget who built this? (Huh?)
I'm the one who made the company all the millions
Now you got problems to deal with
Man, this is tough luck, see a couple weeks ago we was buds
And the crew that was killin' shit was us
'Til you turned on me, homie, that's fucked up
I ain't keepin' this shit on the hush, hush
On my chest I just carry too much stuff
I done had it, enough is enough, bruh
Plus I needed somethin' to get my buzz up
You done fucked with the wrong dude
Ain't no tellin' what Hopsin is gon' do, creepin' up on you
Quit your sleepin', I told you
This a mothafuckin' journey we finna go through
If I ain't have so much to lose
I swear to God I'd probably beat up and choke you (Damn!)
Nigga, this is that raw shit (Right?)
That organic flow you probably see up in Whole Foods
Shiver me timbers, somethin's fishy 'bout you, Mr. D Ritter
When I told you that I wanted new management
Why the fuck you throw a fit and seem bitter?
Why you catch an attitude whenever I question you
About all my fuckin' percentages?
I know why (Why?), you've been bendin' it
In your benefit—your honor, I'm innocent!
This nigga crazy, I'm tellin' all of my people (You tell 'em!)
He takin' all of my C-Notes (It's true)
See, he has a gamblin' issue
He takes the cash and blows it all at casinos (Damn!)
Uh-oh, when I bring up my royalties
You start avoidin' me, that's some disloyalty
You woke up the evil boy in me, your ass is poisonin
Tell me why you would destroy FV?
This was a fuckin' vision that I had created with your brother
But you too infatuated with the money
You killed it and ran it straight into the gutter
Now I think, "Why'd I make D—A—M—E the boss?"
You keep pissin' a whole lot of people off
Our whole label came out with a weak result
You on that same bullshit Tomica brought

Hold up! Hold up!
I got some more shit to say, yo

It's supposed to be Funk Volume, isn't it?
Thought it was music above all the business
But you just said: "Fuck all you niggas!"
You tarnished the brand
And you started a Funk Volume Fitness?
Come on now, really think
Got us portrayin' somethin' we really ain't
How we supposed to be ill
When you on our website with a Shake weight
Tryna be Billy Blanks—nigga, thanks!
Fool, ain't nobody tryna lift weights
We just wanna hit up the studio and just rap and do shows
But you don't understand the culture of hip-hop
You a lame-ass nigga, Dame, half the crew knows
New-Age Jerry Heller, a scary fella
I hate your fuckin' name, every letter
I'm very fed up, you actin' like an ordinary heffa
I'ma take you to the mortuary dress-up
We gave you our trust, then you had us cornered
You got us a shitty label deal with Warner
And if I confront you about it
You tell me I need counsellin' and I got a disorder
You sent me on tour and it's horror
Shitty hotels, no sleep, with no food to order
Meet and greets every single day, it's torture
How you expectin' an A1 performer?
Every time somethin's wrong it's the same thing (What?)
Blah-blah-blah-blah, you just blame me (Damn!)
Then you tell Brooklyn and Jammie (Damn!)
Now they both thinkin' I'm crazy (Damn!)
I deal with this on the daily (Damn!)
My career mentally rapes me (Damn!)
I won't let this nigga break me
He prayin' Dizzy Wright is gon' replace me, shady
What are your fuckin' motives, Dame? Let's talk about it!
Umm, you're our manager, our label-owner, our accountant
Hmm, that's kinda tricky
Somethin is fishy, that's risky
We just don't even know
We go with the flow while you rowin' the boat
You keepin' it simple-minded
'Cause you knowin' our only concern is just hopin' we blow
So, when all the money come in from our album and tours
You sit there and soak in the dough
When did we ever ask about the gross?
When did we ever ask about the net?
You would just hand us money from our shows
'Cause you knew we wasn't questionin' the checks
Nigga, I trusted you with my life
You upped your percentage, so I'm makin' less?!
Fuck you, bitch, you get no respect!
This is why Hop is comin' for your neck (Bless!)
All you care about is makin' money
You don't care about a fuckin' soul though
You just fluctuate our dollars up and down
At your convenience like a fuckin' pogo
You been screwin' everybody on the label on the low
And they don't even know though
So, good luck, Jarren, Dizzy, Hoppa, SwizZz, I'm goin' solo
Nigga, I don't know what you thought
You think I can't see the blood on the walls?
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
I don't know what you thought
I can clearly see the blood on the wall
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it

Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit

Now you wanna go and turn me into shrimp on the barbie!"
(Fatality) Bitches, I am rap, every verse is fire
I lay my shit down like fertilizer
A murderous words supplier, merkin' you is my first desire
If you got a problem with me
You can suck on my dick 'til it squirts saliva
The whole planet been waitin' to get a serial killer symphony
Comin' from the Volume and Strange
Get in the way of a killer, try to deliver
You gonna end up in a trap, and I'm sewin' your brains
MC's wanna take the bar down
I fucked the game and even picked your card out
Bitch, I'm far out
Hopsin and Tecca N9na takin' over, we gon' rip your heart out
We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it
We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it

You damn right
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out

Yeah, I promised you niggas a album
You been patiently waiting, now the day is finally present
I took my time with this shit
I put my mind into every line, 'cause when it's out I ain't tryna regret it
Niggas get overhyped and all they hits go stale
Because they shit don't sell, now that's a big ol' fail
But the punch is a lot harder when you clip your nails
Niggas, how you expect to drive when you ain't get your L's?
You was the next big thing while I was last
You was poppin' tags while I was mad chillin' in my pad with my rhyming pad
Tryna record with no door so I hear my mom and dad
Arguing upstairs so I gotta wait 'til the drama pass
'Cause my mic be picking that shit up
But I ain't wanna give up, I'd exhale fast even if I did suck
You want the madness? Then come and get some
I'm takin' the cake, and all that's left for y'all is the pieces I bit from
See I ain't buddy-buddy with rappers because that shit is fake
Most of y'all morals is fucked up, you on a different page
You get no props just 'cause you getting paid
If you garbage we ain't doing business, point blank, I discriminate
And I don't do no bullshit collabs to get my name poppin'
That ain't even considered a safe option
And that just ain't Hopsin, I paid homage, now I'm straight wilin'
Now turn this shit up while the bass knockin', now c'mon

And I be gettin' comments like
"Hop, what's the hold up with your new shit, man? You be taking forever son
Yo I'ma stop waiting, I'm getting my hopes up
With your work ethic it ain't gon' never come
You had the XXL cover in 2012
And I thought you would soon prevail, but homie, you ain't doing well
You hit us with that Ill Mind shit and that was cool as hell
But when it comes to your album, you never got no news to tell
Your whole career is just a train wreck
You toured around the world for 3 years, but you always performed the same set
I been asked you to come to my city, but you ain't came yet
I guess you ain't in it for love, you just want that pay check
If I was you, then I wouldn't be too proud
You signed Dizzy not too long ago when he's bigger than you now
You said you saving hip-hop, well, save this shit
And all I hear is wack niggas and I hate this shit
Homie I stopped being a scrub because of you
I stopped playin' these bitches in the club and fell in love because of you
My dad heard your song and he stopped doin' drugs because of you
I learned to rap and even built a little buzz because of you
But you take it for granted, thinking you have it made
Sittin' back in the shade, Hopsin, there's people that you have to save
This is beyond music
You speak life into these motherfuckers, Hop, you have a gift, so when you gon' use it?"
Damn, I have that much of an impact?
My rhymes did that? Sometimes, I really feel my shit's wack
That's why I kick back, but fuck this shit, yo, where my pen at?
I'm 'bout to kill this shit and make niggas just wanna quit rap
I'm causing havoc, layin' the rappers like a hammock
If I want the fucking planet, I can have it, now try to snatch it
Only God can stop my violent habits
You niggas average, I ain't even in my prime and still I'm twice the savage
C'mon

Bitches squirtin' St. Ides liquor out of they two tits
Fuck a metaphor, basically, nigga, you ain't doin' it
Hand you a mirror before I murk you, check out a view in it
I'm losin' it, serial killer lurked in the music biz
Without a mask, I want you bitches to know who the fuck it is
Sufferin' succotash, rims on a hovercraft
Romantic psychopath, I drown whores in a bubble bath

Fuck your new Versace, you can get a cut throat

Swallow the nut whole, this shit is X-rated
Y'all kept playin’ on devilish ground 'til you met Satan
I stomp on you 'til your chest cave in and neck breakin'

There really isn't any way I could be less blatant

Me and my girl keep arguin', somehow my life just got hard again
She's scared of groupies that steady bargin' in
I can't explain the pain my heart is in
Yeah, I got money but reality isn't sunny, it's dark and grim
See, when I'm tourin' I don't take her
So she get filled with anger, thinkin' another woman is gon' replace her
She's standing in tears of emotion, knee-deep
I keep tryna tell her I ain't fuckin' no groupie, she don't believe me
My career is so deceiving
She's datin' a rapper, nobody said it was gon' be easy
She's threatenin' to leave me 'cause of these text messages girls sent
Now I'm just caught in this whirlwind
Tryna explain that they just friends who can't control they-self
They see the fame, think I'm cute, and they get overwhelmed
She should fuckin' know the deal
I'm done dealin' with this bullshit, bitch, I'm outta here, you can go to hell

There's no room to drive at the end of the road
When you're living in the cold, not wearing a coat
The breeze turns tears to snow
Will they ever learn to love me? (Will they ever learn to love me?)
Don’t fucking call me, stop tryna reach me

You better zip it shut, I’m respectful
But if I spot you, that’s the only time that I won’t ever give a fuck
Your words can make a difference, do not forget
If you run your mouth and talk shit, you payin' for what comes out of it
Bitch niggas acting all macho, jealous 'cause they ain’t got dough
While they still openin' up for me at my show
Smilin' comin' over to me, like I’m the coldest MC
And then you badmouth the moment I leave?
Aight, I got it, since I’m in the limelight
You niggas try to look cool by not being hyped about my hype
Simple and plain, better watch where your missiles are aimed
Insult my name, you’ll rekindle a flame, nigga

Will they ever learn to love me? (Will they ever learn to love me?)
Don’t fucking call me, stop tryna reach me
I ain’t tryna hear all of your bullshit, just leave me
I’m about to lock myself in my basement and dig my grave inside
All jokes aside, man, I see no reason to stay alive
If I do it, I won’t even say goodbye
“Yo-o, but you’re Hopsin and you have so many fa-ans!“, yeah, great advice
I’m not lucky; outside of Hopsin, there's no one who loves me
I come home to absolutely nothing
Nobody pays any mind to Marcus, they treat me like I’m retarded
And just want me to slave away as an artist
It don’t make any sense to me, no one wants to get to know the real me
They just want some pictures for they friends to see
I deal with this kind of stress endlessly, fuck this damn industry
Look at all the shit that it just did to me
I don’t care about no big collab or tryna swim in cash
I just want a family I can watch the TV with and laugh
Until then, I’m on the dark side
I’m the fuckin’ Dark Knight, startin’ bar fights, it's a hard life

There's no room to drive at the end of the road
When you're living in the cold, not wearing a coat
The breeze turns tears to snow
Will they ever learn to love me? (Will they ever learn to love me?)

Ankle wrapped up a while back, a nigga bruised it
Who's this fresh ass nigga with the steelo?
A vicious ego, he hardly ever land in primo
He always got a brand new deck wherever he go
Flexin' on niggas at the park like Debo
He keep the hot spots on the d-low
If he snap a board, DGK'll hook him up with the reload
Never get it mixed up, I'm the one with big nuts
Hitting everything regular, because my switch sucks
Play SK8, you'll get fucked, see I likes to kick butt
Hole in my shoe 'cause that's the spot where all my grip rubs
I'm in the valley with a bunch of street vandals
We maneuver boards with a clean handle like Kareem Campbell
Soon, I'll be rolling through your neighborhood probably
So, don't be scared to holler if your ass fucking spot me

Hat back, with no belt in my pants, just a shoe lace
Skating legends mean mugging yo, when will these niggas learn?

Back when I was a young nigga playing in the sand
I had some big dreams so I made a little plan
You was out partying while I was thinking in advance
Tryna get right hoping that one day I'd be the man
The years went by, I was M.I.A
I got rid of all of the niggas that was in my way
I saved nickels and quarters till I could afford a studio
To record and then get money off the shit I say
Then my dream came true and the fraud niggas came out
See me ballin' out, they think we all gettin' paid now
Talking like "Hopsin, oh you're a great pal"
Fuck you, stick my balls in your dang mouth
Now every other week you hit me up for money
Frontin' like you always been down (pal!)
But back then when a nigga was living bummy
Your ass was nowhere to be found (wow!)
Look my nigga (Marcus) I ain't tryin to be one of ya fake ass goldigger
Homies that's not it (That's not what I'm doin')
But can I borrow 500 dollars, I'mma pay ya ass back next week
I promise (Please)

I can't even make friends
'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money
They like, "Let me have this, let me have that
Let me have this" and they keep on coming, man
"Let me get a dollar, give me that money!
Let me get a dollar, give me that money!
Let me get a dollar, give me that money!
Let me get a dollar, give me that money!"

There was a chick I asked out back in ’06
Made her a love song, and she was like “No bitch”
Gave me the song back, and I was like “Oh shit
I’m so stupid, I should’ve never wrote this”
She was a dime piece, top of the list
A Latin girl, and her skin had a tropical twist
She never used to call me, I always had to call her
And deep down inside it was making my heart hurt
So, her life went on, she didn’t even involve me
Then last year I ran into her in a Walgreens
She was like, “Marcus, how are you? (Oh my God)
You finally made it, I’m so proud of you”
So, the next day she called me and asked to kick it
For the sake of the old me that was sad, I did it
Come to find out she was never that terrific
Especially a week later when she asked me this shit
“Hey um, Marcus, I really, really hate to be a bother
But my rent is due, and I’m like broke as fuck
So, can you please lend me ten hundred dollars, please”

I can't even make friends
'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money

See, my ex girl think she slick
Man, let me tell ya how she tried to do me
She said she didn’t have a vehicle to drive to work in
So, she came and asked me for 2 Gs
And although I wasn’t that concerned
She said her mom would pay me back, soon as she got her tax return
So, I committed and did it, thinkin’ she wouldn’t forget it
But she forgot it, now my stomach got a nasty burn
I called her! And said, “Bitch! Where my money?! You got that?!”
She said, “Not yet, see my mom’s mad
She said she isn’t gonna pay, you can drop dead
'Cause I got into a fight with her, she’s a hot head”
I’m like, “That’s between you two, not me!
What the hell does that have to do with my cheese!”
She said, “Ok, ok, stop please
I swear I’ll pay it all back Marcus, in five weeks”
Huh, five weeks huh?
It’s been three months and I ain’t even heard from her
Changed her damn number, shit
Bitch played me like a dumb motherfucker

I can't even make friends
'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money
They like, "Let me have this, let me have that

"Let me get a dollar, give me that money!
Let me get a dollar, give me that money!
Let me get a dollar, give me that money!

It's bad for business, I'm lackin' senses, feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension
Stepped in this bitch to wreck so don't disrespect
I promise that it'd be a big regret
I'll twist ya neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch
I chop niggas up, yeah, I learned it from Tech
I got hoes all over that wanna give me dome
They all yellin', "Hopsin, you turn me on"
But I feel like it's the Devil tryna get me, woah
And I don't wanna do it, nigga, send me home
Nigga, I'm so cool (Cool), but I feel so low (Low)

How did I manage to get robbed from the truth? Maybe I should've never went and dropped outta school
"It's not that bad, you're okay, kid, cheer up!"
But I got a life that I ain't too sure of (Yup)
Swagger lookin' just like Ace Ventura
Can't look at myself, I might break this mirror (Shit! Fuck! Fuck!)
I'm paranoid, I panic over every little scary noise
See, when I go to pick up the phone and tell friends about it
They won't answer 'cause they're annoyed
I'm like "Ugh..."
I put a porno on 'cause my life ain't awesome, man (Yeah, yeah)
Jack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again (Yeah, yeah)
Then repeat the cycle
Can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on
You don't know how many fuckin' demons I know
Maybe I should go and try to read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)
I don't even like rap, only thing I wanted was just to be cool (Be cool)
And hang out with a group of friends and solve mysteries like I'm Scooby-Doo (-By Doo)
But I got way more than I bargained for
You can't kill when your heart is sore
I'm so mad I could start a war
So fuck Hopsin, man, I don't even know who I are no more

That there changed my whole entire life, you make more tings like that, I'll buy!"
Well, I got news for you, my screws are loose, I'll tell ya
This rap thing here's what I used to do, now I'm movin' to Australia
When I go ghost, I'mma get a house on the Gold Coast, yellin' "YOLO" on a couch, feelin' so dope
Livin' low pro so these foul niggas don't know, I'll be struttin' around like "Hell yeah"
Man, I'm losin' my mind! But y'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme
See, I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin but I get depressed when the two intertwine
Truthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be
Nobody cares so I use the beats
To talk to so I lose the heat
I'm cut bad and the bruise is deep, is there anything you can do for me?

Niggas thought the old me dissolved and I went soft
After my album Raw but nah bitch I evolved
I'm takin' over shit easily
I rarely do collaborations 'cause y'all ain't qualified to be in a league with me
Hop just let the beast unleashed
Someone get this freak a leash
I'm snapping on all you, leavin' every MC deceased

Motherfucker we makin' history
A million independently
So kiss my fucking ass
Left or right you get to pick the cheek
You don't ball you just pretend you do to make the chicks believe
But your label is fucking you like Ruthless Records did to me
Stop with the compliments, I've been locked in my momma's den
Plottin' when I will be droppin' this Hopsin apocalypse
Bombin' the competent
Rap goblins mobbin' the continent
Gotta be dominant
I'm surprised that God isn't vomiting
I'm wearin' a badge, tearin' your ass
Another vag, cuttin' through necks, 'til they barely attached
Me and this game are one of the same, like Jarren and crack
The darkness is arrived, so make a flare with a match
You got skill? Where is it at?
I haven't seen it, who dares to attack a genius?
You'll get managed I'll have you gag your penis
Until you throw up your own liver (nuts)
I don't give a (fuck), the flow ripper (what)
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder

Now if I stop being who I am, that would upset me
I'll never change for none of your wack-ass deadbeats
I struggled to change for J. Christ to accept me
I don't even change clothes, shit not even my bed sheets
When I step inside the booth and rhyme
Rappers commit suicide
And jump in front of a moving semi-truck
Like it was cool to die
Niggas is watered down
Fuck it it's time to scuba dive
Better get on your knees and pray to God and hope that you survive
Killin' rappers like I condone violence
I murder you and when your soul is floatin' to hell I ghostride it
You won't last living in this cold climate, so don't try it
I know I'm ill, well I don't need no pussies to co-sign it
Commercial niggas thinking they carry the torch
It's going to be very hilarious when I bury your corpse
So next time you spit a fucking rhyme that's too simple
I'll jump kick your ass through the glass of the booth window
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up

I know I don't usually make love songs, but there's a few
Special girls who kind of changed my perspective on everything
And I feel like every guy comes to that point in his life
Where he changes from a boy into a man
So yo, this one is strictly for the ladies, only

See when I met your stupid ass up at the mall on accident
I thought you was the baddest chick I ever seen but that was so inaccurate
You stole my heart like you had done some magic trick
Your essence was so fabulous you also had a sexy look and rack of tits
I only had intentions to respect your ass and that was it
I took you for a walk under the moon, we joked and laughed a bit
The chemistry was there, right where we met I had to act on it
At that moment I knew you was the girlfriend that I had to get
What happened bitch? I swear you had me mad sprung
Our first time hanging I could've did more than I had done
But I didn't because I was nervous, in my heart, you had reserved a place
So sexing you just wasn't on my mind cause you were worth the wait
Shit got to a point where you started cancelling dates we made
Gave me crazy rage, you had me thinking you hate me, great
You vanished with no signs and I didn't even know why
'Til I found out you had a fucking boyfriend this whole time

Why couldn't you just tell me?
You had me buying plane tickets to go see your stupid ass
Then you cancelled on me at the last minute talking about you busy
Bitch, I'm busier than you and I still make time for your bitch ass
Fuck you!

I should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)
Now I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now
Baby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you
Cause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys
And good guys get left behind

I swear I'm sick of this, bein' stuck in predicaments
Gettin' the shitty end of the stick and it's never different
Hours spent on the phone as I'm listenin' to your gibberish
Blah-blah-blah your mind was scrambled I tried to configure it
I'm not one you should move past, these player guys, you choose that
To me, you're worth a lot more than what they had valued you as
Only reason they hollered was because you got a cute ass
They just want you for sex and then they move on to a new task
Your actions show your true class, I think you're moving too fast
Datin' these strangers can be dangerous, they rarely do last
But you just too blinded to see, just like a disease
The guy that you been lookin' for is more than likely me
But now I'm on some "fuck you" type shit
Your mind is so indecisive, bitch, cry
I'll no longer be ya tissue you can wipe with
You just triflin', you get screwed so much
I'm thinkin' that you like it, my prediction on
Your future is always right, I must be psychic, damn
See, I ain't even tryna affiliate myself with stupid
People like you anymore, it's the same damn story with
You every single time, don't be callin' me talkin 'bout
You fucked up, bitch, fuck you!

I should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)
Now I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now
Baby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you
Cause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys
And good guys get left behind

That's just the way that the story goes
Deep down bitches ain't nothing but clueless, horny hoes
They'll fill ya life up with drama like it's the Maury show
She'll turn her back on you even though she had sworn she won't
I never felt this sore before, here's what you do to be fair
You get a girl, fuck her while the opportunity is there, cause if you don't
Some other nigga will, best believe this shit is real and
When you find out what she's been doin' you'll fall and get the chills
Love is just a battlefield, some bitches be gettin' killed
Niggas too, it's the truth, better run and get your shield
Hoes will make ya think they at home waitin' for ya, sittin' still
But really, she's out with that guy you don't like and she's gettin' drilled
My heart is forever swollen, why'd I let you ever hold it?
Girl, you was my Bella and I thought I was your Edward Cullen
There's no rules to hop onto your boat, you'll take whatever floats it
Bitch, you turned my heart into a cave no one should ever go in
I can't stand these stupid bitches
Man, I just wanna take my hand
And put it around their fucking neck
And choke the fuck outta them! Ooh!
Fuck 'em all!

I should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)

Uh, Hopsin, yo, check it

I've come to conclusion that life sucks
The only good that comes out of it is sticking my dick in nice butts
So if it's wetter than normal inside your wife's cunt
It's my nut, I busted inside her that hasn't dried up (Yuck!)
I'm such a contradiction, I hang with Dizzy Wright
And all he does is smoke so when I'm breathing all the ganja gets in
Not to mention I'm condescending, my mind is missing
Plus I'm kinda sending the wrong signal, oh god, I'm sickening
I'm not the one you wanna start shit with
I'm part animal, part dimwit with bad manners like Bart Simpson
You Hollywood niggas who write songs
I'll give you a black eye, that's a good reason to put some ice on
I'm like a Jedi with the Obi-Wan bars
Lyrics are shocking just like a phoney gun charge
My niggas we only fuck with the dopey blonde broads
We play 'em, and trade 'em like they were Pokemon cards
I excel in rap, it's 'cause I been through fucking hell and back
You ain't close to dope, it's just that everybody else is wack
Niggas getting jealous tryna diss me, scary!
I'm an animal, fuck a Mink coat, bitch wear me!
Yo, all you rappers quit your bitching and sit and listen
I'm the new sick edition of Pac, this is the demolition
I'm so tired of all the reminiscing
So I'ma leave these niggas shook like my dick when I finish pissing
(Yo, you fucking nasty dog) Get off me
I love Christ, but guarantee you wouldn't wanna cross me
I'm as frustrating as lost keys
My sick mind's a good example of what the crooked law breeds
I'm trying to die as the greatest rapper
Shit, I'm so hungry I could stick my fist in a blender and drink it after
You climbing up then I'ma break the ladder
And you'll fall off so damn hard that every bone in your face will shatter
Fuck these niggas, I'm a racist bastard
You hear the devil speaking in tongues on this song if you replay it backwards
Tell your sister I can't wait to smash her
But I heard that her pussy stinks so make sure that she fucking takes a bath first
I come second to none
My verbal weapon is perpetuous, and it's just as effective as guns
You destined to plunge, homie, I find it pleasant and fun
Like having sex with a nun (What the heck have ya done!?)
Whoa, I'm known to hate, I use foul language to motivate
I know I'm dope, okay, but Hop ain't real was just a role I play
Earth, I don't know this place, but I just wanna stroll away
Into my home in space wearing a pair of flying rollerblades

You left me and you went home to Indianapolis
If I wanted, I'd be getting plenty of ass and tits
But I want you, can you send me an answer quick?
Lost in your love, baby, give me a map to this
Never knew what love felt like till I met you
My heart wasn't for any other woman except you
But you stabbed it till it bled through
And now my head screwed 'cause I shoulda been the one who had left you
Accepted our break up really wasn't that pleasant
But I learned to deal with it and didn't ask questions
No point in making the past present
But after a month and a half, you was a month and a half pregnant
Damn, my heart taken badly
Now I'm a situation dealing with another baby daddy
Sad part about it yo, it's not even my kid
Evidence proves you really out of your mind, bitch

I swear I thought you was my lady (lady)
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you

I'm in shock, life feeling like a crazy movie
I really don't appreciate the way you do me
Since I got your news I been dating groupies
But they never last, all they want is fame and jewelry
These gold-diggers can't recruit me
I keep running back to you as if the pain is soothing
'Cause the bond we had is something I got used to
My mind is telling me to say bye-bye, screw you
You ain't even in love with the guy you having a kid with
When I think about it I get sick, you did this
Clubbing with your friends and drinking till you get senseless
Shoulda thought about this shit before you sipped it
You put faith into his dick
And now you pregnant by a dipshit, life is all twisted
Our world could've been terrific
But the Hopsin bus passed baby, and you missed it

I swear I thought you was my lady (lady)
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Now ain't no reason to be smiling for
I'm always the type looking down on whores
And even though the goddamn child is yours
You know I still got your back on child support
'Cause we both know you don't make enough for day care
That shoulda been my baby, what the fuck, this ain't fair
Call if you need me that's fine by me
But the jealousy killing me 'cause that's not my seed
I don't know why I take this crap from you
Break my back for you, I can't adapt to you
We ain't compatible, face the facts, it's true
But when you lost why do I make a path for you?
I spent a long time working at making our love tighter
But you sipping Jägermeister, and having these one nighters
I'll never be able to trust you
My nigga Tecca Nina said it best, "I love you, but fuck you"

Oh no no no, you played your games
And now we'll never be the same
See I love you, but I hate you
And I hate the fact I still love you
Yeah yeah, oh why, oh why

I swear I thought you was my lady (lady)
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl

Oh shit

Uh, yeah
Yo, you gain some you lose some, I blaze like some hookah
I rock the crowd, leave the fuckin' place lookin' gruesome
How you think you killin' shit with basic ass maneuvers? (What?)
The games fake, filled with more snakes than Medusa
I'm goin' Hollywood (hah!) you was lied to
I only buy it if it benefits survival
I had a busted whip but real shit it didn't drive smooth
I had to open up the door to order in the drive thru
I'm so rugged and low budget, so fuck it
I'm cold blooded
To top it off, all the hoes love it
Go dumb, leave the microphone bloody see?
I'm so cold yall might leave with your nose running
See I got a fat flow, putting bars to rest
I roll up like I'm rick Ross's Neck
Ripping it up and keeping it funky like I'm DAS EFX
I'm flawless? Yes. My flow will dissolve your flesh, c'mon

Me and my boy, we've been on it for years
You might get snatched up if you try to come around here

Turn the volume to the max so we can knock it like madness
We been on this shit for years and we still doin’ damage
You’re at a disadvantage, take cover, the bomb has been planted
We bout to blow up like a doll, little nigga don’t get involved
The way she shakin’ her booty, her parents would be appalled
The temperatures heating up and I’m stripping down to my drawers
Exceeding my limits, forget it, we bouncin’ off the walls (watch out)

Yo man
Let's take this shit back to fuckin' high school lunch time cyphers
When mother fuckers was beat boxin'
And kickin' ill ass flows in the fuckin' cafeteria
Fuck all that Hollywood shit!
Let's fucking rap, man

Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
I hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?

I spent a long time tryna build a buzz
Hop is in the building, cuz
Step to me up on this battlefield, you know I will erupt
Didn't change, I'm still a nut
The girlies see my skills are up
So I be gettin' head every single night like a pillow does
When a nigga be flow bashin'
You know I be keepin it old fashioned
My compassion is so tragic on instrumentals when I toe tag it
Throw dirt on me? Then guard your face and stomach
Cause I'm swinging on you like ya ass cheeks had a rope hangin' from it
I'm out my mind, I can't configure it
I'm way too niggerish
I tried to read the Bible but I'm straight illiterate
With anger temperaments
I put myself in strange predicaments
They labeled this as sick
The doctor says to take some Ritalin
Man, I'm a lunatic,rockin' a crucifix
I'll mack on any chick I feel who got the cutest tits
I'm wanted, fugitive,robbin' yo whip to cruise in it
See, I'm the only kid on Elm Street that Freddy Krueger skipped
Pants saggin' cause they too loose to fit,I'm torturous
Grab a hammer and nail for your front door and board it shut
I stare deep in ya eyes, rip out your soul and absorb it up
And have Biggie Smalls yellin' out "call the coroner!"
My groupies stay horny
They always call to say "Hopsin can you fly me out to Cali?
Please pay for me"
I make that pussy pop for you like you skateboarding
Then you can come inside like a hurricane warning
I got a lot of sluts, I like to call it Hopsin luck
But now I feel like having sex with these bitches is not enough
I needed something new for moments when I gotta bust
So lately I've been beating my dick with a pair of boxing gloves
I got the maddest rhymes, how dare yo ass deny
I'll stab you in the brain with a knife
You can keep that in mind
You talkin' shit inside yo house, cool, fine, fuck it
I'll break in and stomp you out inside of it
Ain't tryna be ya friend
I'll knock you out and when you wake up
I'll just be standing there with a mischievous grin
Like"Ha, we meet again"
I'll puncture yo skin with a crack fiend's syringe
And drill your nut sack to the seat you're in
You want props? You don't deserve it, you're not ill
I won't stop 'til every rapper lurkin' has got chills
Why these niggas actin' like they certainly pop steel
When only time they carry heat is serving a hot meal
Since I was young, been on a mission to make dough
And put all my niggas on like this shit was a slave boat
So tell me why your songs sound like skittles and rainbows?
That's a dead giveaway you love to listen to Wayne bro
I'm sick and deranged when I'm spitting this strange flow
Stuck my dick in the game, that's the business I came for
Witness my pain grow, I don't kick it with lame folks
Simple and plain though, you gon remember my name ho, ha!

Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?
I'll snatch it from anyone when I dance with Satan
And detach more wigs than every female cancer patient that ever cared for a transformation
With a (diss joint | disjoint) sweeter than a diabetic amputation
When I split niggas, clipped quicker than big pictures
Heads get bodied with a single line like a stick figure
Cause my words are wild, and when I write
They can't wait for the sentence like family victims of a murder trial
Openly flow potently
Tighter than the choke-hold needed to put the Incredible Hulk to sleep
Tighter than the boatload of soldiers that stormed Normandy
Tighter than the hairy twat with the Virgin Mary's ovaries
They choke up like their throats cut when I show up
To keep the competition (win-free | Winfrey) like Oprah
Cause when I work with Hopsin, everybody who's hip
Is getting (killed | kilt) like a skirt from Scotland
Then I'll cock-back quicker than mouse traps
And stare as they pull (outta here | out a hare) like magicians tricking with Top hats
I got foreign objects
That'll get you (capped in America | Captain America) like Marvel Comics
With a strap like star guitarists
When this lead of mine see ahead in time like Nostradamus
Or swift jabs that swing left like crip flags
Will be the reason you break (next | necks) like whiplash!
So who the fuck wants war with this?
Distorted thoughts morphed this author to Spartacus
When he balls his fists around the swords he lifts with the force of a horses kick
Multiplied by the reason why god exists, and makes Thor his bitch!
Horror flick like imagery, organs everywhere..
You would swear I was orchestrating a Symphony!
It's passion, the force within him will cause the critics to look-n' drop dead like gorgeous women, hah!
Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
Fuck the principal, he can give me a fuckin' write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?
Don't get this shit confused
You're not a person, you're delicious food
No matter your race, birthplace, or religious views
All you niggas getting chewed
I eat a rapper, fitted cap first and then I spit out his tennis shoes
Missing screws in my top, I don’t have the patience
I grab the chop and leave you niggas eradicated
I never let the doctor give me shots, I'm unvaccinated
And I got small pox, you can have a blanket
Get assassinated and left with broken bones
If you gotta travel through the woods don’t go alone
I'm fucking bitches in a mobile home
Like a mutated nigga from the hills have eyes with no Trojan on
This is paranormal activity with a dagger
I got paranormal tendencies y'all just a pair of normal rappers
So why you talking like you not defenseless?
I punch you ten times in the mouth
And have your pussy asses hoppin fences
I got suspended for a few weeks in the 8th grade
When the principal caught me on the street tryna spray paint
I bought a dozen eggs from Safeway
And threw them at the muthafuckas house on the same day
You can get it the same way
I'm making bitch niggas walk the plank
In crocodile infested water mixed with toxic waste
Bury you alive with a camera strapped across your face
Then come back 2 weeks later and watch the tape
You cried like a bitch trying to make the coffin break
You died like a bitch instead of trying to concentrate
I'm here to depopulate on the red carpet with a sniper rifle
Taking out any nigga you nominate
So if you see me as soon as you turn the news on
Chances are I laid a nigga down like a futon
While you at work dealing with groceries and coupons
I got your bitch tossing my salad pass the croutons
Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
I hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?
Yeah hah! Took it back to fucking lunchtime on these muthafuckas son!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Funk Volume21Embed
You're the only girl who never disrespected me
You always know how to bring out the best in me
Cupid shot us separately
Then we came together, it was destiny
I love you ‘till there ain’t no loving left in me, definitely
Our souls will ride together, even when the stars die
And when parted, my heart cries
It's angels like you, who make it hard why?
It's cause you beautiful, outgoing and smart
And shit you really set the bar high
All you bring to me is happy moments
You make me feel like I'm cute even though my face got all this acne on it
The way I feel for you, you can't revoke it
Cause it changed me, and my family knows it
Damn, we both just kind of fell into this
You gave me proof that heaven exist
But tell me, what is love without a headache or twist?
You come taunting, every night after twelve when I'm unconscious
You never come out when the sun's watching
Baby, I need you

Where are you? Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you
You might also like
I wake up in the morning with this sensational pain
It goes straight to the brain then my day is invaded with rain
Engraved in my veins is your name, this ain't gonna change
It is staying remain unless my heart is deflated and drained
Your love is magic
Daydreaming about you is such a habit
Thought I saw you when I was driving
But I was stuck in traffic
If other girls flirt they're sadly mistaken
I tell em' scram cause they need to know I'm happily taken
You see my love life, it wasn't going well till I found you
Fellas get jealous and doubtful when I tell em' about you
I know we had our fair share in the past, with selfish lust
But once we came together we sealed it and nailed it shut
Your touch is that of a goddess
When we kiss, I'm at a lack of words
Especially when we pull away
And then you smile afterwards
In our hearts, we're no different in color
We live for each other, I'm glad you're my significant other
I love you

Where are you? Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you
Baby it saddens me to know that you only exist in dreams
I sit and fiend for you when I'm awake
And it seems like I’ll never be happy unless I sleep
I failed to see the point in living without you
It got me thinking death is sweet
I’ll never know unless I leap, I guess I reach for the stars
Cause girl I'm in love with you oh so desperately
What I'm about to do I kept discrete
I rest the cheek on the pillow as I'm counting sheep
Take me to ecstasy
I tried to get you out my head, the pain's a lot worse
I love you more than anything, I won’t even put God first
You’re the only reason that I sleep so often
I'm hurting nights I don’t see you
I just keep on tossing and turning
I feel so lost and deserted, you made my life good
I told you if I had to take a bullet for you, I would
So baby here I go with the proof, this is it
The moment of truth, only for you *gunshot*

Where are you? Are you only in my dreams?
I don’t wanna wake up
I’ll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I’m really hoping to find you
I don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up I’ll stay asleep

Planet Earth
The place that I live... we live
Who owns it?
You?
Nah, nobody owns this shit
Just a big ass piece of rock with humans on it
Do what the fuck I wanna do

A lost human born into a dark society
With one mind state, there's no variety
Movin' vibrantly, tryin' to be the best that I can be
I've tried to see the light in livin' life but it just blinded me... irony
Now I'm thinkin' violently, because I feel my country went and lied to me
It's bringin' out a whole new fuckin' side to me
Ride with me, if you feel my pain then you can cry with me
This fuckin' shady system is the rivalry
They the ones who raised us, turned us into cage nuts
They're what we're afraid of, they are why we ain't us
They the reason we constantly livin' for money and we just can't budge
It's takin' a toll on your dreams, so you gave up
And now the pain stuck, they ain't showin' nothin' but fake love
We just numbers put on a pay stub
Our purpose shouldn't be to make bucks
We all slaves and if we never make a change then we straight fucked

One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)
The problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign
Maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'

Who set the standard for everybody to live by?
How far along in life would you be if you did try?
Who tryna help these ghetto neighborhoods where kids die?
This world has turned into a mother fuckin' pigsty
I look outside and it disgusts me, it bugs me
It's ugly, I trust no other fuckin' human but me
So what needs, to be done? Every day is a rerun
Technology's advanced, as people how far have we come?
Yeah, I can see that time's grown, but still I'm mind blown
'Cause everybody's mind is stuck inside they iPhone
They always textin' and postin' statuses hourly
But in reality, there's no sign of a personality
It's cowardly, we shielded like we scared to get some allergies
The human being is what we don't know how to be
And honestly these issues really suck to know
But I refuse to sit and let the trouble grow, so God, show me where the fuck to go
I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human
(I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)
The problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign
Maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'

How can a man with power feel there's no responsibility?
These rappers blowin' up, but through my eyes they not as real to me
They constantly conceal the beast, but never try to heal the streets
Teachin' girls to be a slut, but never make 'em feel unique
How can we feel fine this way? Open up your minds today
The matrix got you young, owin' a debt you'll spend your life to pay
Stressed out, assumin' that you'll be more happy inside your grave
Don't tell me about no fuckin' struggle then, nigga, 'cause I know pain
To the point where I felt like life was shit
Growin' up as a kid with both parents who got no funds to ever provide you with
Shit is just stuck repeatin', the world is tough to be in
Munchin' on fast food, don't even know what the fuck I'm eatin'
America, I gave it my all
Still you guys arrested me for bein' black and standin' on a sidewalk
It doesn't matter if I'm breakin' laws or bein' harmless
I'm automatically hated by cops 'cause my dark skin
God was my smartest option
My soul is mine, y'all ain't gon' bargain off it
'Cause if you do that means the darkness profits
The sky is where I got my heart adopted
Man, if we all just took the time to think I swear it won't be hard to stop this
But y'all assume that I'm just startin' nonsense
But I promise y'all the fuckin' world is gon' remember Marcus Hopson
There's consequences for enlightenment
But if I have to hide the truth to live then I'mma die just like my idols did
I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human
(I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid

Soon after I dropped Raw the spotlight creeped up
I received love from fans throughout the world, yeah, seems nuts
Is it God or could it be luck?
I put my toes in the sand and ended up with my feet stuck
When the storm comes, then how should we address it?
My situation with Ruthless turned out to be a blessing
During the time it left every ounce of me affected
But when it was done I saw that I was bound to be a legend
But I'm lost
The fame drivin' me crazy, cry when I'm angry, the game's trying to change me
Sinister record labels got desires to paint me
As the world puts they fucking hands high to embrace me
How would you take it in?
I honestly can't pretend
The only reason I started rapping was to make a friend
And now I got fans who love me for creating sins
You think fame ain't got a dark side? Think again, yo

Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am
You might also like
Yeah, scared I might never get a wife
Closer I move into the limelight shit is like
Girls just want to be next to me 'cause I rip the mic
Sayin' they love me, but the vibe I get isn't right
What if I flop when my album dropped
And went broke? Baby, tell me, would your love just stop?
See I'm in love with you, but you in love with Hop
The struggle's real, but through your eyes it's fun to watch
I swear to god I used to fiend for it
I see the fire but I keep going
I smell the sins from the breeze blowin'
My crew is telling me to beast mode it
I feel like I'm going to hell, I keep it up even my priest knows it
So many women and the money is great
But this life just isn't me and I don't want to be fake
I didn't think that it would come to this day
It's time I put my alter ego to the side and leave him stuck in his grave

Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am
Shit, not anymore, my soul's rotten and sore
I hear a knock at the door, for real
I got a lot to endure, there ain't no stopping the storm
Homie, the top isn't warm, so chill
I think I need my light bulb fixed
As of lately I ain't be getting hyped on shit
Life's a journey, you gotta find your niche
I'm leaving this tight space because I don't fit
Now I'm moving away, my whole life I'ma start it from scratch
As an artist I'm trapped, fuck Hop, Marcus is back
For a while it's gon' be hard to adapt
But I'm willing to go through it, I ain't starving to rap
I'm soul searching, it's like I'm living with no purpose
I tried find a spark to spit but there's no urges
Inside of me for me to pursue it, some people think that I'm stupid
But don't judge if you ain't went through it
I'm out

Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am

Stop and listen
I'll rock it wicked, no competition on the shit
You gotta get it, there's nothing hotter than it
A wack rapper's what Hopsin isn't, I'll kick it to ya
If you got a minute, you'll bob your head like a walking pigeon
Play my position, I'm kinda different when rhymes is kickin'
I got lots of this, I vibe to it as I rock a fitted
The amount of people that's feeling me is a high percentage
They know I'm tight, but I'll be conceited if I admit it
I'ma clown the game until I'm up at the top of it
And don't be chicken to call me out if you got a problem with it
Unsilenced shit is gon' get you stuck in some violent shit
And feelings will be hurt so you're better off if you mind your business
Don't get it started, with that nigga Marcus, that kid retarded
It's gon' evolve to some ruckus, he'll prove your shit is garbage
He'll be the illest artist, realist on this rap
All you niggas out there wanna get him on your tracks

I used to push weight on the block
A fat bitch, she was barely able to walk
She was good for one thing, that was taking a cock
'Til she told me she was pregnant, shit I'm thankful to God
That she wasn't, 'cause all that shit was making me hot
I'm happy that she ain't the one to have a baby with Hop
She's so obese, I'd take her out and make her stay in the car
Her body odor always smelling like some bacon and farts
I'd tell her how I don't eat pork, she took it straight to the heart
Ready to make an assault, she need to make her fucking way to the barn
'Cause that's where she belong, better leave me alone
Calling, asking where I'm at like she need to know
Oh, what a surprise, she thinking I'm the love of her life?
Becoming my wife? Bitch, take some fucking advice
You wanna look nice? Trust me I'm right
Go to the motherfucking gym and lose the gut and you're fine

Thought I was a smart kid? Guess again, stupid
I'm a special ed student
Give me a couple of bars and let the man prove it
'Cause there's evidence to it
I never knew it, but the rest of my class knew it
They must've thought I'd never remember the past to it
Fuck school, man, I never could pass through it
I never be that student that headed to class who gets an A
Up on his report card, a nice kid who's so smart
Seem like when they threw me in special ed It got more hard
Every year the cycle repeats over again
My friends graduate and I'm way older then them
Then they come to me, nice mugging me, making fun of me
What do these ugly motherfuckers be thinking when they fuck with me?
They lucky I don't suddenly go and become something other than me
Like a fucking psycho, then what's it gonna be?

Hollywood-ass rappers, bitch-ass females!
Huh, that's enough to make a nigga flip

Yeah, I erupt like a bomb, so give up the baton
I'll slap you after bustin' a fuckin' nut in my palm
Why you muggin' me like somethin' was wrong?
Just take a puff of the bong
And let me leave your mind corrupt from the song
See, you can't stop me, 'cause I'ma brainwash teens
And create false dreams, 'cause it pays﻿ off clean
I'm just an idiotic, ironic, symbolic, Illuminatic product
That's gonna be killed if I talk about it (Shhh!)
This industry bidness is all screwed up
I have no favorite rapper, because all you suck
I sever the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree
'Cause on a tombstone is as hard as their name will ever be
I'm judged by my wild image a lot
And everybody seems to think I have a sinister plot
I do! Be offended by every sentence I jot
I got some militant thoughts
And you ain't killin' 'em off, so listen!

That's wacker than the 500 dollars you signed me for
Eazy's dead now, yeah, the label's finally yours
Too bad he never knew that you were just a grimy whore
You can't maintain what Eric built (Nah!)
I know he's in his grave, turnin' like a ferris wheel (Ha!)
Don't think you cool just 'cause you inherit mills (Shit)
Bitch, bare the skills! I'm Hopsin, I spit shit so unfair and real

You motherfuckers are quick to judge. It's all good though. You don't know shit about shit. If you only knew what I knew, if you only knew what I could do. If you could only see what I could see you would probably stop bothering me

Yeah
I independently started this shit, marketing hits
Starving for chips, no gasoline to start off the whip
Felt like the only nigga labels wasn't bargaining with
My heart has been ripped, I stuck with it as hard as it gets
These producers would always blow me off
Now that I'm blowing up, they don't recall
Talking about "Yo, you my homie, dawg" (My nigga)
Oh, now you wanna hop on the Hop train
Knowing damn well since '04 I had hot flames (The fuck outta here)
My real buddies was mainly the worst
Hating to shoot my videos without me paying them first
So I slide 'em 100 bucks to watch 'em bitch on how it ain't enough (Man)
That money got my cell, internet and cable cut!
A real homie would've gave a fuck and not expect to pay upfront
Then get the money later when I'm making some
Nobody saw the bigger picture except me
They neglect me, only thing that protects me is FV (Come on)

You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Bitch I am raw

I was a high school grad preparing to go to college
An enthusiastic freshman, major in Economics
I didn't have a clue what to expect to be honest
Banging beats in my dorm, streaming Pornhub constant
I figured I could make it out in four years tops
Study religiously and graduate, apply for a job
The rap thing was secondary, I was putting it off
Calling it quits, assuming I had better chances playing ball (Yep)
My third year came and suddenly that changed
I couldn't bear watching my mom at home suffering pain
Tryna fight off the strain of only having half a stomach
Plus a handicap back from a surgery that helped nothing!
So I returned to the valley and called the homie
Hop was on Ruthless getting shelved like a trophy
I told him how I left my life in the OC
And we concluded that we could both use FV

You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone

This was written for niggas who wouldn't give me dap
Niggas who told me that I had sissy rap
This was written for all the bitches I used to called who never hit me back
Until they heard the word I was buzzing, c'mon don't give me that (Shit)
You backed out, now you tryna roll with my clique?
Where the fuck were you when my signing bonus was spent?
Where the fuck were you when I got the notice for rent
Saying I was getting evicted and I was hopeless as shit?
See I keep some names handy and you got thrown on the list
That's how you know that I'm pissed, I got you, don't even trip
'Cause I'm rude over the nicest beats, you had to go ignite the heat
You might agree to beef, but yo I'm not the type you'd like to meet
Life's indeed a journey that I have yet to finish
Hopefully my career's something that will be epidemic
You'll always know that it's Hopsin the way I wreck a sentence
Realness, I represent it, raw, I'm the definition

You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die

You think you're original? You ain't original
You were programmed to be you
You're a slave, and you don't even know it
The shit you think of, ain't even your thoughts
Let's step out the box for a minute!

How do we know if God exists? How do we know it's positive?
Are you the definition of an angel or the opposite?
If you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit to stealin' it
But if the tables turned, then you would pocket it
See, I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is
How come I'm the one my teachers used to have a problem with?
I show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it
But in the underground I seem to get so many compliments
Say my name and it's like people get afraid and shook
But if you take a look, you'll see I'm nothin' like an angry crook
I'm learnin' hands-on, you busy with your face in books
I'm here to benefit the world, so Heaven's where we're safely put
I'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues
I just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs
I'm from where a child's future's on the streets with the bums
Because it's hard to become somethin' so unique where I'm from

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power, then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

Just because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent
You're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with
His charmin' smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit
Frontin' like he's truly Jesus, and all you fools believe it
The change he's makin' isn't good, that's just how you conceived it
It's like we're all broker than ever, it's due to reasons
Dealin' with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with
Illuminati, or whatever the fuck they go by
They're the reason weird shit happens and we don't know why
Why did Michael Jackson start his tour, then have to go die?
How did rap music go from really good to so dry?
Real artists get shelved and wack ones get famous
To leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous
In their eyes; there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist
You're just a product of what the government has created

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see

If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows
Yo, we're all smart, and we know what's bad and good for us
But yet, when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff
Your brain's a fuckin' powerhouse, but what, that wasn't good enough?
It's people like you who talk that "shoulda, coulda, woulda" stuff
You probably threw your life away ‘cause you would rather get high
With no license or car, so you bum rides to get by
Sayin', "I should've did this" or "I shouldn't have hung with this guy."
"I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized."
I ain't bein' cruel with these situations that I address
I more than likely could be someone you admire, yes
But it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest
We play the same game, difference is you never try your best
You don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess
I work around the clock, you slack off for lots of time to rest
Keep bullshittin' till your life is gone
‘Cause livin's naturally hell, you have to work to put a smile on

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high

All together, come on!

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma (hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma

Oh, hello son, I really wish I knew you
I'm your father you'll probably never be introduced to
You'll only see me on TV or maybe YouTube
But now I know your momma is probably dating some new dude
So how you liking Earth? Are you loving your existence?
I wasn't at your birth, 'cause your mother made me miss it
I tried to get a visa, I applied, and they denied it
'Cause your momma told the police that I beat her, she was lyin'
And now I'm banned for something bad that I ain't even do
There's a lot of land and water separating me and you
You're far away in Australia, and I am in America
So I cannot be there to do all of the things a parent does
This is my attempt at me raisin' you from a distance
You have Hopson in your blood, you are special, and you are gifted
The punishment your mother has given me doesn't seem fair
Just know I love you, son, and I'm wishin' that I could be there

And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
(That's why what?) (Hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma

I know you and your momma stayin' with her parents Bill & Kirsten
You're partially black, I'm confident they're feelin' nervous
They don't like colored people, in their eyes you're still a burden
They assume you gonna grow up shootin' guns and stealin' purses
But that's not true, son, don't be sad
I know you're not like that, you know I got your back
Listen, here's a funny joke that you could tell your grandmother
She looks like the Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters
Oh, I forgot, you're too young to know what that is
But that's the kinda thing I like to say to plumpy fat chicks
The humps on Mom's chest, they're not real, they're elastic
And if you look closely, you can see she's made of plastic
Like a toy, you my boy, my son, my friend
I promise we gon' be together somehow in the end
I am very ashamed that you don't have my last name
Every night I go to bed, and I'm feelin' this wicked pain, because—
Our lives coulda been so good

And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)

Currently my life has hit the floor
I can't lie to you, shit is hard
I should be buildin' with the Lord
It could be what I'm missin' or
Maybe I should continue to hurt your momma and diss her more
Just to relieve the tension that sits in my heart, 'cause it is sore
When I'm spittin' bars about all my cash and exquisite cars
This was on my vision, and you were the one I did it for
My relationship with your momma is sittin' in the morgue
After all this hell, I can't lie, I do wish she did abort
Our lives are so unhappy
'Cause this world is cold and nasty
Just know your daddy don't condone havin' a broken family
I'm so sad we couldn't work out our issues 'fore you arrived
And now you have to suffer
'Cause Mom and Daddy have stupid lives
You're way too young to notice it
You don't deserve to go through this
If I do see your mom again, this time I will assault the bitch
At least then I'll feel like my banning was justified
Look at your momma, thank her for fuckin' up all our lives, and sing
Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)

I ain't gon' say that I'm runnin' shit
That's the shit every rapper say and think about
Nigga, just go in and look at the bank account

You can cry me a river 'cause I'm a dog and you know that shit

Yup, just a normal day, on my favorite website, backpage.com
I was scrollin' through hoes, lookin' for a bitch to fuck
I'm like, "That babe, uh huh."
I was just about to call her
Then I saw an ad pop up, I'm like, "Wait, oh my God!"
You see, I had a really long day
And I just could not turn down an Asian massage
So, I called 'em up and I said
"Hello, when is your next slot available?"
She said, "You can come right now."
Fuck yeah! "Hurry up, because I'll wait for you!"
I pulled up and I sat in the waiting room
Is this shit all a setup, it's debatable
If I get confronted by the police
I just want a massage, I am not here to break the rules
Then an Asian lady had a pen and told me
"Come over here to the counter!"
Then she ask me if I wanted to get a session
For 30 minutes or an hour
I said, "Hmm uh, I'll take 30
Nah, matter of fact I'll do an hour, fuck it."
'Cause I know whatever's 'bout to go on
Behind those doors I'm 'bout to love it
She say, "Usually 50 dollar but for you I do 45."
I say thank you and gave her the money
Then she say, "Okay, let's go inside!"
I'm like, "Fuck yeah!" – it's about to go down right now
So good what I found right now
I'm about to let it all out right now, yeah

Look, so I walked back to the massage room
She said, "Take your clothes off, and then put this robe on!"
I'm like, "Okay, no prob'."
Oh God, this about to be so fun
And no one even knows; she left, I got undressed
And all the sudden a new Asian girl walked through the door
She said, "Hello, how are you?
I am Muli, that's what you can call me
And I give you lovely Asian massage."
I've been waitin' for this all day
I position myself on the table
And put my face down in the circular cushion
And she started massagin' my back
I knew somethin' was up with the way she was lookin'
Then she slid her tiny little finger tips
Down my spine right over my buttcrack
She was massagin' my booty
Then go to my thighs and start touchin' my nutsack
Fuck yeah!
Then I put a little bitty sway in my hips to let her know I like it
Somethin' was 'bout to go down
You can see it a mile away, you don't have to be psychic
She said, "You want somet'ing?"
I said, "Yes I do."
She said, "You big strong man, I really like you!"
I said, "I like you too."
Then she said, "You want the hand, sucky, fucky?
Tell me right now 'cause I need to know!"
I said, "I'll have all three of those"
Then I thought ooh she a little freaky ho
She said, "I give it to you for cheap, you give me 125 dollar"
I said, "Okay, here you go!"
Lowkey I was feelin' kinda awkward
She jacked me off and gave me my top first
I stayed quiet as I watched her
My dick had a strong posture
She said, "You very big like a monster!"
She got naked then I humped her
I'm lovin' this little tiny Asian booty, I swear that this girl is the best
I'm buildin' a sweat, I'm killin' it yes
I pulled out and spilled on her breast
Everything was just right
I hit the hour on the deadline
I guess I'm gonna leave now
She said, "That's fine, thank you, come again next time!"

I ain't that industry nigga who always ass-kissin'
I got mad disses for anybody who askin' and
Y'all can sit and pout as you watch how high the cash gettin'
And bitch, I made hits, day to day in the basement
Slavin' away, playin' the game, makin' my name fizz
And lowkey I been checkin' to see how Dame is

Do somethin', got you goose bumpin'
Who fuckin' with me? I'm rude, rugged and love to intrude ruckus
Too stubborn, I got the motherfuckin' juice chuggin'
You think you runnin' shit but you really my cute puppet
Just danglin' from a string, I was made to disrupt the peace
Don't care if you poppin', bitch, you basic as fuck to me
I've been labeled a fuckin' beast, it's a fatal corrupt disease
Don't be callin' tryna sit for a bagel and cup of tea, my nigga

Ooh, you don't want the backlash

And I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck
And I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up
Maybe I'm thinkin' too much, am I caught in my feelings?
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
It's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with
Oh, I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)

Oh, I'm the black sheep

Fuck, a nigga just don't fit in
No one close to kin
I write about it so much I done broke my pen
And I'm so sick of pretendin' my life is so dandy and flawless
I'm stuck on a road to Hell
Fightin' demons but I let 'em drag me across it
While everybody happily applauds it
Tell me what caused it
Was it Monroe High? That's where I went to school at
All the black kids said I was white-washed
And the white kids said I was too black
When I skateboarded I got booed at
At lunchtime I was who they threw food at
I was tryin' so hard to cope with it
I really wanted to run up on campus with two gats
And just (ahh) let loose
Put some niggas in the E.R. for tryna treat me like a retard
Where the fuck does my future lie? I can't see far
Momma's little sweetheart, he developed an attitude
Picked up a mic, that's a Hell of an avenue
He gon' take yo' ass to Hell and then back with you
Life is a class you can tell I've been absent to
My massive doubt has got me wrapped around
And then it drags me down a bit
I don't know how to cast it out
I try to rap profound so you could laugh about the shit
Truth is, yo, I never laugh
I'm lookin' for wherever Heaven's at
The black sheep, they won't let him past
They would rather get together
Tie him up and then behead his ass, got me hella sad
Listen!

That nigga whose brain is off, I am that
My train of thought left on Amtrak
I take the loss and I stand back
I can't pray to God for no hand clap
I can't recall when this damn crap
Became so overwhelmin' I started rebellin'
"I hate" is all as I stand as
Never got no love from my niggas
And no love from the hoes, pinned up in a hole
Tryna climb out the Devil's dark lab, but the oven is closed
I don't ever leave the house much
I never really thought this would be the outcome
Wish I had a window I was leapin' out from
My family is yellin', "Please, Jesus, help him!"
When I'm out in the real world, I feel like nobody knows me
What if this whole time I've had an issue and nobody told me?
See, this cold heart isn't cozy
Am I below par and I don't see?
I'm so disconnected from Earth
My hands are out so far but they won't reach
Should I get in a coffin?
Not many niggas would wanna kick it with me
Unless they were gonna benefit of it
Motherfuckers never interested in knowin' me
They just be just itchin' for Hopsin
I'd be frontin' if I act like it isn't a problem
I done shed tears contemplatin' my suicide in my room
Isn't it awesome? (Fuck no!)
Do you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?
Like the world is never gon' need you?
I always do, every day is déjà vu for me

I got a story and I hope it unfolds (yeah)
Undercover Prodigy, I won't become broke (yeah)
Nobody fuckin' with me and both of us know
Y'all two week hyped like Pokémon GO
You don't see it, homie, then you smokin' on dope
Got MC's hemmed up, chokin' on rope (so?)
Haters keep talkin' but doin' nothin' about it
As I let my nuts hang while I'm holdin' on both
I been on one, charged up like protons
I'm so gone, it's goin' down like nose runs, nigga
Collectin' mo' funds like bank robbers who tote guns
It's so fun, look at the hoes come, nigga
Step aside, allow me to prepare for my finale
It's grind time around me (yup)
Damn, Hopsin, you tight, no doubt B
Back at it again with the white Janoski
Look, I ain't innocent, I stay killin' shit
Rape sentences and shake witnesses, I'm an insane menace
Vacate the day premises, my brain's missin'
I date women for eight minutes then play 'em like Seg' Genesis
Straight nigga, but shit, it's too late to take Ritalin
And doctors, they've been itchin' for days to make sense of it
If I'm around, no such thing as a safe citizen
When I'm on the mic I deliver like St. Nicholas
Niggas get in shivers the moment the bass tricklin'
You can see I'm not in the mood to play, gentlemen
Forever ill is somethin' you can't fiddle with
You ain't got the balls to hang, okay little dick?
Niggas, I'm God, I'm a numskull
If you don't like me, what the fuck did you come for?
If anybody sayin' I'm not raw
Just tell 'em one thing: I got bars, nigga
Yeah, I'm in my zone
Get on my level, I'm wildin' out, move back
Bitch, get off of me, I am the prodigy
I feel like I am a new man
I really don't see any areas in this shit I should improve at
So who tryna wake up the dragon? You?
Nah, I wouldn't do that

Nope, nu uh, sorry
I wouldn't do that
Come on, what? Are you serious?
I wouldn't do that
This guy, really? Fuck are you doing?
I wouldn't do that
Look buddy, I get it, I know! It's not gonna work
I wouldn't do that5Embed
I must be on somethin'
Lately I been actin' kinda cuckoo
Momma said I got a screw or two loose
I must be on somethin'
The doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood
I ain't just been feelin' like I used to
I must be on somethin'
I been lost and ain't nobody found me
To be honest it ain't safe to be around me
I must be on somethin'
This shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones
Fuck it, man, Lord knows
I must be on somethin'

Shit, lately my logic's been so irrational
Violence is laughable
What's the antidote? I don't have control
I need a chaperone when I'm back at home in a padded zone
'Cause I've been known to speak in a savage tone and slap a ho
Do I even have a soul?
My thoughts are so unimaginable
My brain just hasn't grown
Since I climbed through my momma's vaginal
And I been asked to go to a shrink, it ain't gon' happen, bro
Suck a dick and swallow a massive load!
Bitch, I can explode at any moment
Don't get me goin', 'cause a lot can happen
You talkin' crap and wake up in a fuckin' Saw contraption
A raw assassin, you see me you better be haulin' ass then
Your gashes cannot be treated with Tylenol or Aspirin
No cotton swab or napkin can clean the mess up
It's me and my alter ego against the world, it's just us
Ain't no one who textin' my cellular phone except sluts
It's clear there's a problem with me, so guess what?

Guess it's my deceivin' smile
Guess it's because I been treatin' people foul
Makin' songs about 'em, talkin' shit and then freakin' out
This is how I handle all solutions
There's no false illusion
Fuck an evil witch, bitch, I'm the demon that's off the broom stick
Where's the fire? I'm walkin' through it
Y'all ain't got the balls to do it
I'm talkin' stupid, it's all inclusive
With my psychotic state, filled with a lot of hate
I'ma operate on my enemies
Chop 'em up and then drop 'em on pots and plates
I'm not to fuck with, so stop it, let's not debate
Usually never talkin' much 'cause I'm stuck in a awkward state
The pain I have's everlastin'
Won't be surprised when I'm left in ashes from my hellish habits
The hell is happenin'?
The condition I'm in is probably worse than you can imagine
Make sure you say this shit to whoever's askin'
He must be on somethin'

Hey, Marcus, how you doin'?
This is your father's callin'
Uh just touching basis with you
I want to know if everything okay with you
Because I been getting from family members callin' me
And wonderin' what's goin' on with you and stuff
And I ain't heard nothin'
And I know this can't be over this baby
You know, and I don't know why you mad and angry when it about somethin' you did yourself
You gotta stop foolin' with these old gals and shit
You know they out for money and stuff
And all these women are

Girl, you trippin' and you know it
You think these issues that you got goin' unnoticed
I smell some bullshit tonight, you the culprit
Bitch, I can read your motherfuckin' mind like I wrote it
You swear you the baddest bitch alive (yeah, yeah)
I can see the madness in your eyes (yeah, yeah)
All your pain is packaged in disguise (yeah, yeah)
To your friends you yappin' with the lies, I don't mind
Feels like I don't even know you
Girl, you ain't got no clue what I'd go through for you
There ain't much in this crazy world that I won't do for you
But I don't get the same love in return
It's just a lesson learned, I'll just let it burn, 'cause—

You had convinced me that you had your shit together
Back then all my homies said that you was just a set-up
My mind musta been gone
Damn, my momma taught me better
I just wanted you, baby
I don't know what to do lately
It's like I hate you and you hate me
And all this shit is too crazy for me
You got enough pride for the both of us
You can't apologize, you don't open up
I thought you would bride, would be close enough
I guess inside your mind you weren't old enough

I built this empire off rebellion
Niggas seem to have a problem with what I be sellin'
All I got is dope and I just make the world inhale it
Bitch, I am the GOAT, you're blind as fuck if you can't tell it
I dropped out of school so I could focus on my mission
Principal is callin', Mama sayin' that I'm missin'
I check in to homeroom and then after that I'm ditchin'
Start off bumpin' Dirty Dozen in my fuckin' system
Mom and Dad would look at me and knew my mind was missin'
I look in the mirror, my reflection was my bestie
That's just how it was since crystal took my nigga Jesse
It's me against the planet, motherfuckers gon' respect me
Shit, but I ain't trippin', got a mighty reflex
Stronger like I'm a feisty T-Rex
Mobbin' the streets with a white T 3X
The mic is 'bout to be how I relieve stress
Niggas blowin' up left and right and it might be me next

Motherfucker, look me in the eyes
And you can see it's no surprise
That I've been livin' like there isn't a tomorrow
All I got is grindin' on my mind
Middle finger to the sky
Fuck the planet or you'll end up with your heart broke

Before the paper
Way before these groupies ran the world and caused the vapors
I was rockin' fat Osiris’s out with the skaters
Vandalizin' spots until security would chase us
Young and fuckin' clueless as the homies that surround me
Doin' hoodlum shit they got me locked up in the county
Fights are poppin' left and right, these motherfuckers rowdy
They gon' whoop my ass if they find out I'm from the Valley
My whole crew is cocky, homie, nobody could stop us
Chillin' on Tobias Avenue sippin' horchata
Shootin' pellet guns at cars until we saw the coppers
Once we got confronted we would lie and say it's not us, gotcha
A decade later I only grew worse
Niggas say they hate me, that's cool, I hated you first
The truth hurts, I guess it's just a few perks
From all my crazy mood spurts
The power of my mind can fuckin' move earth
Motherfucker, look me in the eyes
And you can see it's no surprise
That I've been livin' like there isn't a tomorrow
All I got is grindin' on my mind
Middle finger to the sky
Fuck the planet or you'll end up with your heart broke

I done lost myself again
I done lost myself in sin
I've been burned by selfish men
I've been died but held it in
I do not want Hell to win
Life's cold, I done felt the wind
Could it be any clearer?
When I look in the mirror
I just see a jackass with a tail to pin
Me and my family ain't close
So I got some fame and went ghost
I am not paintin' a hoax
You can hear the pain in my flows
They say that life has its ups and downs
But why do I stay in the lows?
I don't like Marcus, I don't like Hopsin
I am ashamed of them both
You see, all that I have is my money
I had no idea that this was coming
I fell into the stereotype of a rapper
I'm how they package a dummy
This is my reality I embrace
I look back and I can see my mistakes
I just wish that I could rewind the days
I honestly don't want to be out of place
I guess we gotta face
All these issues like this as a human sometimes
Yes, I am losin' my mind
If you have come to that conclusion, it's fine
Don't ignore all of the proof and the signs
I made my bed, I'ma lay in it
The thought is as soothin' as wine
Now all I need is a suit and a tie, I tried

In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting

God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again
(This lonely road again)

Take it away, I want the peace, I want the happiness
I took a blindfolded shot, it was accurate
But in my heart I know I never asked for this
See, this life I'm in, it seem miraculous
Who knew I'd break a few bones when I tackled it?
It's been years and I still can't adapt to it
I cannot predict what my next chapter is
There's a hearse speedin' fast in the ashes and
I feel like I lay flat in the back of it
There's no love in my eyes, so look up in the sky
Bring me back like you did Lazarus
I can hear the Devil whispering, "Come play!"
Injecting me softly with numb pain
My fingers are covered in blood stains
It's torturing not seeing my son Zade
But one day, that will all change
When the fog strays, it's a lost page
That had blown away into the hallways
In Atlantic where the wild dogs play
When you're confined into a small space
You will know that that's enough to cause rage
I'ma kick until the fuckin' walls break
I don't know what made me walk straight
Into this fire, my soul is burnin' quick
I've been told this isn't permanent
Growin' up, my father made a lot of mistakes
I do not know why I didn't learn from his
Can you direct me to where the furnace is?
I need to do away with pain that's lurkin' and
Maybe figure out what my new purpose is
All these bad vibes are so discouragin'
In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting
I'm in need of some company
God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again

— Are you guys letting me go now?
— Yeah yeah, I'm afraid not, ya fuckin' dog of a cunt! Let's go, dickhead!
— Officer, you said I was only gonna be here for 30 minutes. It's been five hours, man, what's goi—
— Yeaaah, shut your fuckin' mouth, ya fuckwit, before I fuckin' bash ya!
— Man, what the fuck are you talkin'—
— Go inside, ya fuckin' wombat!
— Man, this is stupid.
— Go on, sit down!
— *sighs* Oh, god.
— Now, your missus claims you assaulted her.
— Psssssst.
— Bloody oath, man, why'd ya fuckin' beat her?
— Man, I didn't fucking beat her! Listen, I'm telling you…

I got her the engagement ring that she liked, booked a new flight
To come to Sydney just to see her, start a new life
Man, she's twenty weeks pregnant and I was tryna do right
For us, a family, the kid, but maybe I was too nice
My homie text me a picture and I just burst into anger
It was my girl in a bed with her personal trainer
I text my homie like, "Yo, where you find this?"
He says, "Snapchat, bro, it's all on my timeline, shit."
Swear it struck a fuckin' nerve in my chest
I looked at my girl and said, "Get a paternity test!"
She said, "No! Don't you get all worked and upset
I only slept in his bed right after work just to rest."
I said, "What? You expect me to believe that?
Ha, alright, yeah I'll 'relax,' guess it doesn't seem bad
My girlfriend's with a buff nigga gettin' t-bagged."
Officer, correct me if I'm wrong but she needed her head detached
I said, "Bitch, I can't believe this shit!
Does he know you're pregnant? Is that his kid?
Look how big my headache is! This whole time y'all havin' sex and shit
What type of nigga would fuck a pregnant chick?!"
I said, "Let's get this paternity test, I'm not kiddin', bitch!"
She said, "No, I'm not gettin' it!"
Officer, I ain't seen her in months, I couldn't trust the lyin' whore
Plus she told me she slept with this guy before
And then I said, "You know what? Forget it, it's all good, never mind"
Shit was makin' my blood pressure high
I love her unconditionally, you know, I can't pretend I ain't never lied
For the moment, I guess I'll let her slide
She said, "If you don't want to take care of this kid, Marcus, then say so."
I said, "Wait, no, it's mine too, I can't go
How you gonna support this kid without me? You don't make dough."
She said, "Hahaha. I make loads."
She had six grand cash
I said, "But you was broke two weeks ago! How you makin' chips that fast?"
She said, "I bartend, I made it all in tips, haha."
I said, "Girl, you must take me as a big jackass."
I'm like, "Please, we both know money is hard to come by."
Her bullshit might fly over the heads of some guys
Officer, she's always tellin' dumb lies
I've known her for six years, and she hasn't lifted a finger one time!
I said, "Where'd you get the cash from?"
She said, "I bartend, duh, from tips, I'm a waitress."
I said, "Where'd you get the cash from?"
She started stutterin' like, "Uhm, Marcus, I've... wait, just—"
I said, "Where'd you get the cash from?"
She said, "Ok, ok, I'll tell you, just promise me you won't get mad."
I'm like, "Baby, where'd you get the cash from?"
She said, "I work at a strip club… it's how I made the six grand."
I said, "Woah
No… no!"
I fell down in tears
My heart broke, I turned cold
I don't want the girl that I'm in love with doin' ho shit
If she needed cash I woulda loaned it, and she knows it
They won't let me get a refund on this twenty-thousand-dollar ring
Fuck, my head, it hurts, I need some ibuprofen

— Yeah, Mr. Hopson, you need a minute?
— Um, may I have some water please?
— Ah, no worries at all.
— I don't mean to cry and get emotional, but all this just bothers me.
— Yeah, it's alright, you're good… yeah here ya go, mate!
— Thanks… *sips water*

I wasn't me no more
I looked her in the eyes and straight told her
(What'd you say to her?)
I need you to tell me where this strip club is at
Or this family we're about to have is over
I said, "Tell me where it's at!" — she said, "No."
I said, "You about to make me mad!" — she said, "So?"
I said, "Bitch, you better panic and run, the damage is done
You're doin' this four months away from havin' my son! UGHN!"
I told her I would always have her back
I forgave her after all the careless acts
I had one question, and she couldn't share the facts
The strip club — how come she couldn't tell me where it's at?
Who the fuck she fuckin' in there? Whose dick she suckin' in there?
Shakin' her fuckin' butt in the air
It's like we've argued for a thousand fuckin' hours, I'm annoyed
And I was at the point where somethin' was about to get destroyed
I grabbed her purse, threw that shit across the room
I fuckin' launched it too
It was filled with makeup kits and all of her jewels
I blacked out; she said, "What the fuck is wrong with you?"
She got up out the bed to get it, I pushed her ass back in it
I said, "We still talkin', bitch, you and I ain't finished
Now, this strip club, where is it?
Bitch, where the fuck is it?!"
I said, "You know what? Fuck it. Awesome. Fine."
In the process of all this drama, I'd lost my mind
I felt lost and blind: the gym trainer, the strip club
The ring, the baby, she really crossed the line
And then I finally came down and all the madness was finished
Then she invited me to dinner with her family in Penrith
I said, "I ain't goin' witchu, you can leave now
I need to stay in this hotel room and figure some things out."
Officer, I know you ain't gon' sympathize
I don't approve of any man puttin' hands on his girlfriend or wife
Especially when she's pregnant with his kid inside
Honestly feel like I wasn't in the wrong, but still I wasn't in the right
Ask her, she ain't got no bruises on her
I'm human, there's only so much that a dude can conquer
She knew that her actions reflected true dishonor
And tried to cover it, sayin' I'm an abusive monster
That's bullshit, huh, and that fast, poof
All of her wrongs are in the past, cool
She's just the innocent white girl
And I'm the Black guy who always gets mad, true!
I know y'all 'bout to make it hard for me to get back in Australia
Man, this shit is fuckin' sad, dude
I still don't know if this baby is mine or not
So when he's born, who's gon' be the fuckin' dad? You?16Embed
A critic has never been able to stop me
Somebody that doesn't like me
They may try to discredit me or even say things that are not true
They've never been able to keep me from rising higher
They can't stop your destiny!
See, an eagle can fly at heights that a crow cannot reach
The crows cannot go where you go

If you're lookin' for me I'll be right here, nigga
818 livin' right here, nigga
I'm the fuckin' man around here, nigga
Passin' down the pussy like, "Here, nigga!"
Fuck the lavish shit, man, you can have it
I came up from the gutter like some magic
Aw yeah, niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back
It's right here nigga, here nigga
Yeah, listen up, yeah

Back in 1999 when I picked up a pen
I swear I used to wish for this (Yeah)
And I was so frightened doubting all of my music
I never thought you'd be into it (Yeah)
Now I feel unstoppable like I'm Bradley Cooper
Up in that one movie Limitless (Yeah)
And I done been around the planet a hundred times
Nigga, I'm truly infamous (Yeah)
All the grindin' I put into this
All my fans are feelin' intimate
This shit isn't a coincidence
Treated this game like a glory hole
All I did was stick my dick in it (Yeah)
I do not believe in discipline
Niggas think I be magicianin'
I never needed nobody's opinion and
Cosignin' on whatever my decision is
Rap is all I had during the rough conditions
I bought The Chronic, the deluxe edition
I heard Eminem on "What's The Difference"
I was like, "Oh snap, what the fuck is this shit?!"
My homie Justin played Crooked I
When he had made a remix to the song "Ignition"
I kid you not, it blew my mind, I do not lie
Since then I've been on a mission
To be down with rap until my mind corrodes
I'm dedicated with my life and soul
When I be givin' my all 'til I die and I lie below
Please bury me with the microphone
I ride alone through the night as I flow my pain
Now the whole world know my name
A whole lot changed, I'm givin' everybody mo' octane
And you can see it from the dough I gain, so listen

The game is a painful journey
Thank God I never came in early
Had I blown up in 19 or 20?
But damn Hollywood would've raped and jerked me
Fame woulda went to my brain and hurt me
I had no idea that it may submerge me
One minute you're on top, the next minute you might flop
Man, every single day I'm learning
I use my ill mind to boost me, still ridin' smoothly
Feels like a movie, real lies, I'm truly
Blessed the ways you ain't yesterday, it's too late yesterday
You straight kill time profusely
Go hard, there ain't no excuse
I get a shot then I won't get loose
But I won't let you
Tryin' to take advantage of my hard earned skills, nigga, no can do
Bitches, I am a boss now
The pushovers been tossed out
I deliver the Raw style
I moved outta my mom's house
Anybody who never believed has been crossed out
I got this shit on lock-down
You rappers been knowin' you never get Hop's crown
Even though I come off as a goofy nigga
I assure you I'm what you should not clown
I'm too hard to digest
You might get your eyes wet, 818's what I rep
'Til the day I die yes, H-O-P is timeless
Why the fuck should I stress?
I have accomplished the mission that most'd be proud of
I'm lookin' down on my doubters

For real, no doubt, no doubt
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it—

I see myself as Bruce Banner
Some people say I'm a loose cannon
I only came here to do damage
Not 21, I'm just too savage
Go ahead and get you some new glasses
But I am unseeable, dude can it
I will applaud you if you manage
I now reside on a new planet
Nigga my ego is on Eiffel
Piss a nigga off, I ain't really gonna see no high road
"Damn, Hop, why you seem so spiteful?"
Steppin' on niggas like fee-fo-fi-fum
Get used to my trifle ways
When enemies got a price to pay
I don't really fit in with none of you niggas
When I'm near you I feel like a metal in a microwave
I'd much rather be at home all alone by myself
Fuck your support, I can buy it myself
Foes be the real reason why I melt
Y'all get around me and eyein' my wealth
I don't need anyone sideline help
Pain in my eyes every time I yelp
If I don't relax then my mind might swell
But I guess that's life, oh well
So here's my hypothesis: the old me does not exist
Y'all like, "What Hop is this?"
I'm not here for peace, I'm not here for love
Bitch, I want the opposite
So fuck all the compliments! Fuck being positive!
I'm in my prime, but I ain't no Optimus
Shit's about to go down, I can promise it, biatch!

How you tryna drive from the backseat?
I been runnin' things like an athlete
Pedal to the metal goin' max speed
Sippin' Red Bull 'cause I barely had sleep
Laboratory smellin' like a gas leak
Goin' up in flames when the track beat
I made a 100 motherfuckin' K last week
Niggas feelin' me like Mr. King's last speech
When you mix in a lot of hardcore revenge
A pitchfork and sins, then misfortune wins
You can cop you a house up in Porter Ranch
And pull up on these hoes in Porsche or Benz
So many fake friends, I'm bored of friends
Life feel just like I'm bordered in
Have I talked to the Lord? I sorta been
I been battlin' with life in a tournament
Let me spit the facts
Bitch, relax, I lift the match and build the shit from scratch
First empire I built, shit collapsed
Had bad splits 'til my lips were chapped
Back in high school where not many kids could rap
But I engineered they ass just for cash
Niggas couldn't see where my head was at
In my living room where I rest the plaques
So here's my conclusion
As I sit in this booth I condition to bruise
I'm vicious and gruesome, you're listenin' to
Some premeditated murder, yes, I meant to intrude
It's Panorama city, madness up against me
UC Prodigy, the rap attack committee
I been rappin' 'fore the world tell me not to go sittin', like—
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga

Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up

You better not get it—

Welcome to my euphoria
This is a place where I'm too victorious
This ain't a place where the grass is greener
This is a place full of mad demeanor
Look sideways, catch a bag of fever
Niggas stay shooked like they havin' seizures
My life's a movie, this track’s a teaser
So recognize the real nigga

You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it twisted, nigga

Ok before you start something that's so daring like this and hard you wanna um make sure you have something good to eat
Ok so it's just a large pepperoni
Yeah
Your total's gonna be 15.35
So I got my delicious dominos pizza mmm
I'm gonna um shove this right there
I'm gonna have to heat the bottom up and just shove it through
So it can burn through and then it's gonna sit on this thing right here
Ok this is gonna get too crazy
Alright this went all wrong
This is what I'm doing now you know I'm just letting it burn at the bottom you know
Lettin' it sit there for a while I'm not gonna touch it
Ok now you're gonna get some water because it gets really dangerous
Fireballs are still dropping
There now we got a nice tripod not too low not too high
This is what it looks like so far ok
I'm about to break this little tripod and attach it to this rod
I'm gonna place this middle section right on there, fits on perfectly
This is what the full thing looks like
Busted up the shopping cart taking this red part off
Lets come down here real quick
Get that out, ahh now we gotta dolly somewhere
I still gotta lot of work to do I'm probably gonna add a seat to it or something
Tune in Ill mind of Hopsin
Lil bitch
Jesus man
Pull this thing out, push it back, and sit down
I bought a pole, so I can put the tripod in it
And I can still put the tripod in the back
There's two ways: in the front or the back
Depending on what your preference is or what type of shot it is
Sit down right there
You look through the lens
And yeah, this is the 360 view of it
Dolly is officially finished
I spray painted it and everything
But it's sick though
Started from a dream and I made it into reality
Goes to show that you can do whatever you put your mind to
This world is mine and I'm gonna show you guys that it is
No I shouldn't have said that never mind, forgive me
So when we need hard shots using our videos we resort to the volume mobile
Welcome to the pain in my life

Live life, mind power
It's us, find power
Live life, mind power

Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Life is a tour, I sit and ride along
Takin' some notes and then I write the songs
I’m starin' down the road my life has gone
Is this where I belong?
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?
My mental state is fuckin' me up, and I cried a pond
While asking you for some answers, but we don’t have that type of bond
That my desires gone with the way that I’ve been livin' lately
If I died right now, you’d turn the fire on
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sell-out
'Cause I hopped to Christianity so strongly, then I fell out
Now I’m avoidin' questions like a scared dog with his tail down
Feelin' so damn humiliated, 'cause they lookin' at me like I’m hellbound
What story should I tell now? I’ll just expose the truth
I'm so close to the fuckin' edge, I should be close to you
But who the fuck are you? You never showed the proof
And I’m only fuckin' human, yo, what am I s'posed to do?!
There’s way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Beggin' all fuckin' men and women to listen
I can’t even beat my dick without gettin' convicted
These ain’t wicked decisions, I got different intentions
I've been itchin' to get it, I’ve been given assistance
But the whole fuckin' system is twisted
Now I’m dealin' with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
And I’ve been told that my sinful life is an addiction
But I can’t buy it, it’s just too hard to stand beside it
I need an answer, humans can’t provide it
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
It’s truly mind-blowin', I can’t deny it
Is Heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?
Where’s the Holy Ghost at? How long’s it take a man to find it?
My mind’s a nonstop tape playin' and I can’t rewind it
You gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it?!
I’m frustrated and you provoked it
I’m not readin' that motherfuckin' book, because a human wrote it
I have a fuckin' brain, you should know it
You gave it to me to think, to avoid every useless moment
It was a mission that I had to abort
'Cause humans be lyin', we're such an inaccurate source
It’s gon’ be hard to put me back on the course
Next Jehovah’s Witness to come on my porch I swear I’m slammin’ the door
A lot of folks believe it though, but I’m not surprised
Humans are fuckin' dumb, still thinkin' that Pac’s alive
I ain’t tryna take your legacy and torch it down
I’m just sayin', I ain’t heard shit from the horse’s mouth
Just sheep always tellin' stories of older guys
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Now I’m supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise? Sounds like a fuckin' Poltergeist!
Show yourself, and then boom, it's done
Every rumor’s gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you’re the One
I’ll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge
I’ll donate to a charity that could use the funds
Fuck the club; instead of bitches, I’d hang with a group of nuns
And everyone I ran into would know what I came to do
I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of you
I hate the fact that I have to believe
You haven’t been chattin' with me like you did Adam and Eve
And I ain’t seen no fuckin' talkin' snake unravel from trees
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I don’t know if you do or don’t exist, it's drivin' me crazy
Send your condolences, this is me reachin' to you, so don’t forget
If Hell is truly a pit of fire and I get thrown in it
I’ma prolly regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
My gut feelin' says it’s all fake
I hate to say it, but fuck it, shit, I done lost faith
This isn’t a small phase, my perspective’s all changed
My thoughts just keep pickin' shit apart all day
And in my mind I make perfect sense
If you aren’t real, then all my prayers aren’t worth a cent
That would mean that I can just make up what my purpose is
And I could sit in church and just say “fuck” in the services
Man, what if Jesus was a facade?
Then that would mean the government’s God
I feel like they’ve been brainwashin' us with a lot
So much that we don’t even notice that we’re stuck in a box
Man, everything is “what if?” — why is it always “what if?”
Planet Earth “what if?”, the Universe “what if?”
My sacrifice “what if?!”, my afterlife “what if?!”
Every fuckin' thing that deals with you is fuckin' suspect
I’m fuckin' done!
I’m fuckin' done!
This is my fuckin' life
And I’m livin' it, I’m havin' fun
If you really care for me
Prove that I need to live carefully!
But I’ll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside
For an afterlife that isn’t even guaranteed
We are you, and you’re us
Stop playin' games!
My life’s all I got
And Heaven is all in my brain
And when I feel I'm in Hell
My ideas are what get me through pain
Do as you please, and I’ll just do me
I’m a human, I’ll stay in my lane; Ill mind

In a world of mischief, we fiend for glory
The true satisfaction held within mankind lies in blood!

You don't wanna get ya head cracked?
When you see me coming through you, better step back
I be crumpling all you niggas leaving you stuck up in the gutter with ya neck and your body ready to shed that (blood)
I'm a beast in the night
Creepin' up on you to feast on your life
The demons inside
Are telling me to give you a reason to cry
And leave you to lie in (blood)

Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Give me your blood

You don't really wanna roam in the darkness (no)
You ain't ready for the pain and the harshness (no)
I'm zoning up to hop outside of my ride, at full speed, then swerve till the car flips (blood)
You dealin' with a maniac
See I know a couple of ways to scrap
I'mma raise the axe
Throw it at you while you're running away and when it hits, your brains will splat
So just face the facts
I'm a result of all the gangsta rap
I say shit, never take it back
I don't hate to brag
A true menace with a love of blood
You'll never get rid of my ways
What you think of that, huh? (blood)

Beat niggas till they have concussions (woah)
Rape wives and then laugh at husbands (woah)
And if you down with the mass destruction (what)
Toast to it with a glass of blood then (blood)
Pray to God for a night to start
I'm a psycho nigga finna top the charts
Being shot with darts till it stops your heart
And chopped apart and thrown up in a shopping cart
And pushed off a cliff, there's no alternate
Ending that involved with this, it's your fault I'm pissed
You're gonna suffer the consequences
You can not prevent this shit, I promise it, come on (blood)
Pretty clear that my brain's not there
I be looking for it when I shave my hair
Black is the color that I paint my lair
And the way I break niggas everyday is not fair
It's all because of the rage I bare
See I'm down for whatever, just say "I dare"
My nut sack is the biggest so you niggas gonna have to murder me if you wanna take my pair (blood)
Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Give me your blood

You don't like me? Tune it out
I'm livin' life on the foolish route
When I hit the kitchen, I butcher niggas until they drain slowly, but only when the moon is out
I get this way when my mood is down
Some even think that I'm rude and foul
Out of all the lovely children my mother gave birth to, I was the stupid child (blood)
Back in the day, when I was in elementary, I would chisel a pencil until it sharp as fuck
Leavin' the bullies laid out, on the playground
When they came round, yell "fuck" if you're raw as nuts, come on (fuck)
The sight of blood is so marvellous, stab a nigga in his stomach till you scar the gut
Hit 'em in the spine until you paralyze him and fill him with lighter fluid and go ahead and spark him up
And then abracadabra, am I missing brain cells? That doesn't matter
Makin' you scream makes me a happier rapper
You don't want trouble then your ass better back up
Fast little bastard (blood)
I was born as a natural hazard, I turn lives into massive disasters
Look over your shoulder when I'm in the area
You might get hit in the cranium with the back of a hammer (blood)
Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood

His name is Jesse, we kicked it since we was little kids
Throughout his life there's a bunch of stuff that he shouldn't have did
He was cool but there's a lot of stuff he could have fixed
But addicted to drugs is what I had thought he couldn't get
Until he had started hanging around them other kids
Who showed him how to drink a Corona and puff a cig
And introduced him to weed with added supplements
So whenever he was feeling down he'd take a couple hits
It ain't really bother me cause it was nothing big yo
It only bothered me when he started to fuck with crystal
I'm sure he knew that doing it wasn't a smart move
He'd walk around with humongous pupils like cartoons
I tried to tell him his life goals'll be ruined
But he just told me to "chill out", he knows what he's doing
And now I'm thinking hard if I should get hostile
And said fuck it
And watched him take it right up his nostril

Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me

Eleventh grade where he's supposed to be
But he's in the ninth
He'd wake up for school feeling like it's the end of life
He'd hop off his bunk bed to go and sniff a line
A couple minutes later, now he's energized
He'd go to school and wide open's how he'd get his eyelids
Then he'd get excited
Cause he finished his assignments
Now it's big surprises from the teachers when they find it
Jessy's doing all his work
Well shit aight then
I guess it wasn't that bad after all that he did meth
It made him actually do his work, and not cheat on tests
It boosted up his confidence, he felt like he's the best
He'd stay up all fucking night like he don't need to rest
Until he had none left
Now he's acting strange
He couldn't buy anymore, cause he didn't have the change
So he sold his Xbox and his whole rack of games
I never thought that the crystal could make him act this way

Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me
Jesse's sister walked inside of his room to get something out
Then she noticed Jessy on the bed foaming from his mouth
Now she's tearing up, scared as fuck
Oh he's done it now
So she picks up the phone gives 911 a dial
She tried to give him CPR, before the kid was lost
Then he had woke up and saw her on him and it pissed him off
All of sudden he went crazy just to fucking get her off
He threw her up against the wall so hard it made a picture fall
He can't really get a grip
She can't believe he did this shit
She kinda knew what made him flip
She yelled, it's drugs isn't it
And now the paramedics at the door
So she runs down to open it and they run up with all these antidotes
They tried to tackle him but he's too hard to handle though
They called for back-up
So the station sent another van to go
When they arrived he was spitting in their face and eyes
So they injected him until he had a stable mind
They told his sister that it's time for them to take a ride
You lucky that your brother made it
Cause he almost died
She went up to say bye but he must have dozed off
And I had barely pulled up when the truck drove off
From our apartment buildings, so I didn't see crap
And I ain't get to see him till he got out of rehab
Even when he got out he was still depressed
Until he heard a little tiny voice in his head that said
Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me12Embed
Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers

It's really hard to focus living in this world of sin
All balled up in a corner is what I wanna curl up in
Some pearls an' Benz, money to spend, girls who's a ten
Fuck it baby, I promise I'll never hurt you again
People fiend to be the best, not the best they can be
I use to be the same way, I guess it's what Satan made of me
It's somethin' like slavery the way Lucifer has us
All this glamorous shit we like, he'll use it to trap us
Then he smiles as we run loose on his campus
And dances circles around us and you think it's fabulous
The glamorous, pay a price it's all hype, it's Satan
But in the mean time shit is all right
Most people think the message I send you is stupid
And y'all are gon' ignore it and just continue to do it
But as long as I made an attempt to convince you this shit's cool
The rest of your destiny is within you

Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers

I'd rather go broke than go and give my soul away
My coldest day couldn't add up to Satan's prodigy
He's tellin' me to jump, but I'm sayin' I don't obey
They say your soul is not owned until your blood's on the page
And he don't have to own your soul for you to do his dirt
He's the master of ceremonies and that's why music works
All it takes is one rapper to make it big then through him
Satan will have the nation creatin' sin and he wins
Then repeats the cycle over again
For many generations 'til time is close to the end
And all those times you were saying fuck it
You'll be hit with the day of judgement and burn as the Devil's naked puppet
Take it as odd flows or take it as gospel, shit
I'm just speakin' the truth whether I make it or not, yo
You don't have to love just don't ever hate
And just know with Satan here, this world it'll never be a better place

Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers

So many times I have fell in this trap
I'm tellin' the facts, he makes it seem like hell isn't bad
'Til this day I still get influenced
And even though I know it's sinnin'
I'm willin' to do it, my ass ain't even improvin'
'Cause it's so hard to stop what's been taught for so many years
If I think about it too much I'll just be rollin' in tears
Sometimes I think "Why am I here? Why do I feel
Like I'd be runnin' in fear if ever the end was near?"
It's like, sin is in so much of everyone's daily habits
That we don't even know we do it whenever it happens
Then it settles in like I should've never did that shit
I wanna enter the gate perfect rather than have this
If you had to turn your test in today
You think you would pass it or would you rest in the flame?
Who knows, there's only one way to find out
And if you die now, no turnin' back, it's your life pal
Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers6Embed
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
Yeah, how you like now?
I'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!
WOW!

Yo! So I'ma flop? Nah, that's where you guys are wrong
I shit on niggas, that's why I rap with a diaper on
Don't be approaching me with none of your mess talking 'bout where I belong
Just tell your friends all about me and sit, and watch as they minds get blown
Niggas on that basic shit, now I'ma go ape a bit
I know y'all prayed for this, so don't trip
Here's a handkerchief for your razored wrist
My flow got a few ways to switch
Niggas act hard, I'ma change the script
Everybody begging to be a buddy of mine
'Cause they know I got skills y'all can't prevent
When I lace a hit you impressive, none
You can take it as a lesson, son
If you was smart, you'd drop the mic and
Try to stick up a bank with a weapon drawn
Pillow Man was slept upon
That's the reason the West was gone
But I set the bomb, when it blows up
You niggas will know where the heck I'm from
I'm keeping it raw fo' sho', flow so diabolical
You all should know that it took like 10 whole years just for my balls to grow
No overnight success, I'm struggling just to write this mess
The road to righteousness was more than words and skill that I possess

My swagger makes your girl want to cut, like upper
I'm mad hot, dog, my 16's should come with mustard
If you think I have a big head, then you haven't seen my brother!
Stacked bad niggas swore I wouldn't make it rappin'
Promised it couldn't happen and hated with a passion
A mixtape later I silenced their laughing (shut up!)
Now the same ones would probably suck my dick if I asked 'em
It's obvious I have it locked like CAPS
Rocking to a bitch fight beat that slaps
I do it major, Poly Sci & Bio
I don't have haters only fans in denial (let's go)
Now gimme a minute to hop in my zone, I'm making 'em pop like Mary
I'm rocking the party to act all retarded, I'm making 'em pop like cherries
I know this nigga is wild, but I will knock him down
Just answer this question for me:
How you like me, how you like me now?
I was the nigga all you niggas used to clown

Oh, so you wanna be cool? You wanna be pals? You wanna be closest friends?
See a nigga so hot, that's why I'm popping up like I'm toaster bread
I say shit that don't get said
That's why I can't roll with feds
Illuminati got they eye on me
And they gon' see to it that a nigga don't get fed
My purpose ain't hard to see
I pull up on rappers like "pardon me
Your bars are weak, you put too much time
Tryna get your sparkling charm to bling"
I be kickin' 'em multiple syllables
Ripping up shows and holding my genitals
Get a dose of the wicked flow before your niggas run up
Saying "Homie, you should've known"
It's crazy how life can switch
I ain't gonna lie to you mine was shit
Not anymore, shit changed up
From woman selection to size of tits
I know bitches who can ride the dick
Niggas who think that my eyes are sick
Showing 'em many agents who be loving
The melodies that I supply them with
Yo! I gotta a note for all y'all
In the rap game who got an album stacking dough
Y'all got big, chains'll start falling off like Michael Jackson's nose
Who the illest? Y'all know
Hopsin, yeah, bravo

I can't decide

Now see, Tyrone does whatever his homies do
Just a dopey dude
An' deep in his mind, he knows he's cool
He's ditchin' class 'cause he feels like he don't belong in school
Momma always yellin' out "Damn Tyrone, what's wrong with you!?"
He wanna show the world he grew in some balls
Abusing the law, 8 weeks in juvenile hall
This dude is the cause of a lot of shit
Don't know where is father went
Never had no confidence, resortin' to poppin' clips
His homies thought that they were violent assassins
They said "Come on, Tyrone it's time to get active
We gon' roll up on this nigga
Real silent and passive
Then you pull out the 9 and then blast him
We gon' roll to his crib
Be careful shootin' so you don't hit the kids
You down fo' it?"
Tyrone said "You know what it is"

In the land of the killerz
You better say your prayers tonight
Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide

Tyrones big ballin’, gettin' the dough
Fuck bitches and hoes, still rippin' the 4’s
Walk with his fist clinched he was itching to blow
Shit, and all the local neighborhood niggas would know
It's like he was born to fit the streets
Never had no chicken feet
Walked up to the local liquor store to get a swisher sweet
Before he walked in some dudes was like
“Aye Nigga...POP POP POP, we don't play nigga”
They just shot him when his lives undone
The man inside the liquor store dialed 911
And at the same time he's strugglin' tryin' to find someone
Screamin' “HELP HELP, STAY ALIVE YOUNG SON!”
The boys gonna die and he knows that
A bullet went through his skull cap
He’s barely breathing
And both of his eyes balls have rolled back
Oh crap the people who witnessed it can't believe it yo
Maybe it’s linked to the drive by he did a week ago
In the land of the killerz
You better say your prayers tonight
Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide

Tyrone’s dead, all over some dumb shit
His homies don't know who did it
They just got assumptions
Ready to wild out
With a sinister function
And drive by on some bitch niggas and dump clips
And OG was like “fuck it he’s dead now
So open up the 40 and take a sip and pour the rest out
Y'all got me stressed now
Shit y'all need to chill out
'Cause every time some shit be poppin' off y'all pull the steel out”
One of the younger homies was like
“Fuck that, we gon’ tug gats and bust back, trust that”
The OG was like
“Man Y'all don’t need to be out here bustin' slugs
Y'all don't even know who the fuck it was
Y'all fucking bugs
Y'all gonna be dead taking this violent route
You little niggas always wildin' out
You need to getcha shit straight and understand whatcha life about
'Cause if a bullet hit your ass believe your lights is out”
The younger homie like “Nigga, you don't run these streets
You ain't never been no fucking G
If I wanna bust my heat it’s up to me
And I know them niggas that killed T
Are the same niggas that we hit up the other week”
Another homie like “Naaah they ain't get back for that
'Cause that’s them niggas pulling up in the Cadilla-
POP POP POP POP....POP
In the land of the killerz
You better say your prayers tonight
Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?

Baby, Hopsin is in the building (I'm raw)

Who am I? A snobby and deadly poet
So nigga, put down the pen 'cause I prolly already wrote it
I'm the nigga that Hollywood barely noticed
For pullin' cards, it's easy as sockin' on Gary Coleman
How did you get a deal without havin' no type of talent?
The shit you write is invalid, you gettin' your mic impounded
I'm livin' in a dump, you livin' life in a palace
Dinin' with Caesar salads, man, how do you guys allow it?
Yo, you weak niggas in the limelight trippin' (Yah)
But I won't let you slide like friction (Nah)
Not tryna be your buddy in this rap shit, I like dissin' (Ha)
So you can kiss my ass and watch them white eyes glisten (C'mon)
Ya'll nigga's be regulatin' the area
Hesitatin' to, scared of some defamation of character (You know)
I got it locked, no separatin' the barriers
Medicate your hysteria, heaven's waitin' to carry ya

My hot 16's be on that ill shi (Uh-huh)
Your hot 16's still with the children (Uh-huh)

I don't know but my flow is so cold (Mr. Oh No!)
At your door, I'm ready fo' war
When you was flossin' on me, tryna swerve in your Hummer
I was plottin' way bigger, nigga, word to your mother
My verses are butter, I emerged from the gutter
To step up inside the booth and then work, motherfuckers
I'm hungry as all of the roaches that lurk in my cupboards
You should be duckin', runnin' to send the word to the others
I'm a fuckin' nightmare and your worst hell
And I'm leavin' niggas stuck behind the bars, they don't deserve bail
You see wackness doesn't sit on my nerves well
You couldn't bust with a dick full of sperm cells

My hot 16's be on that ill shi (Uh-huh)
Your hot 16's still with the children (Uh-huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building (You know)
We gon' have one hell of a time (Right now)

You see, I'm lyrically bashin' up on your feelings
I'm bad and I don't conceal it, this dragon is known for killin'
That's the reason I'm baggin' these hoes and grillin'
My madness is so appealin' and swagger is on a billion
Aside from all of the provocative hellishness
I'm somewhat underground but got the commercial elements
According to Ruthless Records, it wasn't evident
So I'mma 9/11 the label, bitches, to hell with it
I'm that crazy nigga, you can't be iller
I'll pick your fuckin' mom up in an 18-wheeler
Yeah, I'll hit it, but if she don't wanna pay me scrilla
I'll let a Rottweiler fuck her till the rabies kill her
My hobbies are rappin' vicious, slappin' bitches
Grabbin' digits, and I occasionally laugh at midgets
I'm hardly sane and half-horrific with a dab of mischief
Never rap no shit if I haven't lived it, it's that specific
My hot 16's be on that ill shi (Uh-huh)
Your hot 16's still with the children (Uh-huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building (You know)

Now

I'm the rap maniac with the hooligan eyes
Who's cooler than I? Wack niggas, move it aside
When you heard I was a big deal, you were surprised
West Coast, bitch, put your W's in the sky
I spent my days as a refugee till the rap game came to rescue me
And left my wrist paved in accessories
A dangerous necessity, I came here to wreck emcees
You're wrong if you thinkin' Wayne was the recipe (Nah)
He ain't worthy of that, the controversy is back
Get out the Kool Aid, stir me a batch
See, I prefer to relax, but I can't and God knows it
Gotta stay raw with the flow that I'm diagnosed with
Oh shit, niggas keep fuckin' with my emotions
Maybe that's the reason I suffer from psychosis
Shockin' as high voltage, fuck it, my life's hopeless
So I had to make sure I killed it when I wrote this

Wish I had the cover on a Rolling Stones magazine
I'm sick of the radio playin' all these faggot teens
Keep it real, show me somethin' ill that I haven't seen
For ten years, I've been workin' on ill flows
And finally got a fuckin' record deal and I'm still broke
Man, that's not common, bombs that I'm droppin'
Are dope, but all that I can afford is some Top Ramen
I notice that ya'll niggas like to dumb the stats
I should stomp your ass out until your lungs collapse
No more corny cowabunga rap, we done with that
It's a wrap, keep it up and get your tongue detached

I'm the last of a dyin' breed, hip-hop lacks a variety
That's the reason I thrash on society
I get laughed at when I clash with a rivalry
Until they feel the wrath when I smash on their dynasty (Word?)
But I ain't Hollywood, I'm still the same, kid
Up on the same shit, rappin' in the basement
Catch me at your local school, skating, bustin' tre flips
Left shoe lace ripped, you know how them days get
Listen while the bass hit, only thing that changed is
The way that girls act 'cause now they think I'm amazin'
I used to be the nigga chicks didn't wanna hang with
Sittin' alone with a Capri Sun and raisins ("Ew")
My senior year in high school, I was always truant (So?)
Had a lot of homework but I would never do it (Fuck that)
Screw it, I'm the king now, homie, take a bow (C'mon)

Buckle up...9Embed
At night in my window I see your silhouette
Crying heavy tears, look how wet my pillow gets
Throughout my days I don't smile I just get upset
And since you left look at all the shit that it affects
I take a picture of your face and I just hold it up
Kiss it, then reminisce on when it was both of us
It's hard for me to open up, I'm always talking to myself
But to nobody else
Some say that church or maybe counseling could probably help
But they don't know about all of my idiotic lies
All the fucking times I left you traumatized
Swore up and down to you saying I'ma try
And never did, I try not to cry but I feel bad I didn't apologize
It's time I cough it up and tell more, my soul is taken, never sell yours
I did some shit I probably coulda been in jail for
Bury me deep inside Hell's core
And don't let me out until you hear bells roar

She said, "You never loved me, you just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police"
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh, how I wish that could tell you

You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you
You might also like
It's hard to forget, my heart is a brick
I tell myself "Marcus, I thought that you were smarter than this"
The mess I put you through was worse than Pearl Harbor and shit
I'd always harm you and flip, mentally scar you and trip
Sometimes I'd argue and get the nerve to call you a bitch
Then bruise your back against the dresser that I tossed you against
My Juliet? At the time I never thought you was it
I do now but shit you're gone, so I just offer you this
A song to you, through it I open the crack in my chest
And show the whole world I've always had a lack of respect
For women who enter my life, I look to vengeance as knife
Intentions to fight, if you thinking I was senseless you right
Now every sentence I write, I think twice on it so I don't regret
'Cause only stress lies in a sinful mind of loneliness
I'm an unholy mess, put me in a hole to rest
Welcome to my life this is how painful my stories get

She said, "You never loved me, you just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police"
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh, how I wish that could tell you

You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you
Now use this track as a lesson
All you guys out there who have some aggression
Towards your woman it don't have to get hectic
That crap is pathetic, now look at me I have to regret it
I can't go near her or nothing, she'll probably have me arrested
The only thing I could do is just make a track with a message
And hope she hears it so she could know I was badly affected
I never meant to be that type of guy
But I realized that I was, and because of it I'm throwing my sinister life aside
I can cry at any moment just thinking about it
Sometimes I hide it from the folks that I'm hanging around with
I should apply for a new soul 'cause I think it's invalid
Somebody told me when I die I'll be safe but I doubt it
The grudge she holds against me, it hurts me so severely
She won't come near me, I thought that time was supposed to cure me
I'm so alone and weary, writing songs to heal me
I swear that I'm sorry Heather, I mean it so sincerely

She said, "You never loved me, you just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police"
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh, how I wish that could tell you

You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head

Hello Hopsin
Word on the streets is that you're crazy
And I honestly believe you are

Listen, if I was really crazy I'd run up inside an orphanage
And torment kids, and beat babies faces with bags of oranges
Fake my origin and tell people that I was born to sin
I'd go back to filming molested porn again (Yeahhh)
I would murder a nigga then steal his body from whatever morgue it's in
And take it back to an alley to torture it
Study all of the Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, and Chuckie horror flicks
(Baby is that a knife that you have in your hand?) Of course it is!
I'd run around crazy like the Afghans do in some black camp boots wearin' a fuckin' Batman suit
And scream at bitches like I'm Fatman Scoop (C'MERE!)
And tell them to take a deep breath cause this will be their last chance to
I'd hate on everyone who's sane and gifted (Yup)
Then claim that my brain is missing while sniffing cocaine
And then cut my dick for the Pain Olympics
If I was crazy I would go pick up the mic and use it
And tell Dwayne Carter that I really like his music (Shit)

But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy
You might also like
If I was manic I probably woulda neglected
My responsibilities and made society respect it
I'd walk around in a dress with a can of gas
And blow up a mothafucka for laughing with half a match
Dig up all the baby cadavers and grab a basket
And shoot them through every window of every crib that I'm passing
I'd probably be back a couple hours later to fuck 'em with every bottle
I cut up within my labor
Take a breather, make a haste of it and bounce
Toward the house it's adjacent of and chase everyone out
And take em down
Tell them I'm the devil and I'm claiming everybody for a battle that's crazier than my brain is
Grab a chainsaw, blow the fuckin' dust back
Leave it all and still ready me a new blood bath
Run back to the psyche ward
Check my perimeter and get in before they knew that I left

But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy
Yo, I won't lie, I'm not as crazy as glue
But if I was let me describe all the bullshit I would do
I'd jack off with sandpaper while I'm watching the View
Picturing Whoopi bald headed stroking cock with her boobs!
I'll throw babies in dryers
Strangle tweakers that fidgit
Contract HIV willfully, just to purposely give it
I'd mug mothers on wellfare
Swim in gallons of gas
Meander to the batting cage and use my dick for a bat! (SHIT!)
If I was derranged, I'd cop me a chain
Make it rain like Washington and throw a stripper some change
Make her work it on the floor, pussy pop on a handstand
Lick her dirty snatch and film it all on my webcam (Oh yeah!)
Honestly I'd be itching for gunplay
I'll cock the .45 and shoot up church on a Sunday
I'll hi-jack a plane while it's still on the runway
Grope the stewardess and take the passengers' chump change!

But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy10Embed

Check it, I used to be the goofy man you hounded
The Special Ed kid at lunchtime
The bitches wouldn't stand around with
I would jack off so much back at my parents' house
And now my dick has a permanent imprint
Of my hand around it
Life was lame, I had to pay money to fuck a whore
I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug o' war
But then I made enough money for me to fund a tour
Now the ladies show me the goodies under their wonderbra
I'm goin' door to door, with foreign swords
Causin' more than war
Slayin' rappers, commercial or horrorcore
So, hold your head, 'cause I'ma torture yours
Leavin' morbid sores
I promise you it will be hard to ignore the gore
Hip-hop's dead, and I'm the lucky savior
I'm kinda mad and I don't wanna pile up the anger
All these no-flow, gimmicky-ass, fired-up behaviors
With wack beats and gap teeth like Tyler, The Creator
Motherfucker, you not dope
So you tryna get some attention by cussin'
And eatin' a fuckin' cockroach?
In "Goblin"? You get no props on it
It sucks so much I get blowjobs from it
I been told you niggas, "I'm real!"
If you wack and no one's confronted you
On your bullshit, then I will
Hate on me, but you can't deny skill
I crush all the momentum that you guys build
With my eyes sealed
You faggots got me cussin'
And only reason you probably buzzin'
Is 'cause you slave as an Illuminati puppet
Y'all really on one, beat it, you're gone, done
You think real niggas feelin' your shit? C'mon, son!
I'm the illest and that's fo' shizzle
My flow sizzles, your boy Hop go hard like some cold nipples
You niggas are makin' it so simple
My swag makes the ladies wave
Like fat stomachs with bold ripples
I know you niggas wish you could prevent it, 'cause I get buck like my Kool Aid's got way too much sugar in it
You better run like I'm booger-flickin'
Homie, I've been good at rappin'
Now I'm tryin' to get gooder with it
So I'ma just go beast, and bring that West Coast heat
'Cause I'll be damned if you flex on me
The radio is filled with garbage over techno beats
And all these songs about cash are what we just don't need
Yo, nobody care about how much money you stack
I murder everything I touch, buddy, move back!
Got enough guts to sew trash and bust up your fluke act
And leave your fans sayin', "How the fuck does he do that?"
My rankin' is vicious, you thinkin' it isn't?
Come pay me a visit if you feel that you may be offended
Baby, I'm wicked, crazy and sick
And with the face of a nimwit
I be callin' out names, but I ain't takin' attendance
Some bitch was like…
You might also like
"Hop, you got me cryin'
'Cause you said I could call you
While you out on tour, shit, and I be tryin'
I even text you, but you not replyin'
So when your new shit finally drop
That's one album I will not be buyin'
What, you're too Hollywood?
And you don't even have two minutes?
Ever since you got your buzz
You don't know how bad you trippin'
You went to that ho's house last night
And you said that you didn't
I seen your pic on Facebook
The skank bitch done tagged you in it!"

I got put on with the beastie flow
Now the sluts, they wanna bone when they see me, whoa!
So I must, I take 'em home, let the wee wee grow
Then I bust from different strokes, like the TV show
See, when I be comin' through
Kickin' it raw, niggas like, "Gee, he's dope!"
If there's anyone throwing dirt at my name
Then you know he be toast
For all of you rappers who bringin' me drama
Homie, please be ghost
The only reason I'm bein' aggressive is 'cause we need hope
"Hey yo, Hopsin, I fuckin' love you
'Cause you supply the best rhymes
Since your flow is kinda strange
You should sign with Tech N9ne
You design erect lines, who am I to just lie?
Every single night I play your music right at bedtime
And usually I'm not into dark dick
I wanna do somethin' freaky enough to win your heart with"
I say, "What you wanna do?", she say, "It's simple, Marcus
I wanna blow it before you put it in like a Nintendo cartridge"

Bitch, I'm hotter than a UV ray
Hotter than the thought of Nicki Minaj naked
Makin' her booty shake
Hot enough to pull up to yo' show and steal yo' groupie date
Hot enough to melt the ice cream that's on Gucci's face
And now you havin' hot flashes
All the shit that you ever wanted in one MC, Hop has it
Don't rap if you do not practice
I cockblock wack shit, now get ready for Knock Madness!67Embed
I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me

The world I live in was never a pleasant paradise
Bullies used to hassle me, then laugh cause I was scared to fight
I let the sun beam in on my skin, but I can't bare the light
So I reside on the side of life with nocturnal parasites
Treated unfair as an infant, abnormal characteristics
Waiting for terror to visit, as I stand there in the distance
Fucking arrogant bitches, you were never there with assistance
Wish I could fly into the air with the pigeons
Let it begin, the story how I never fit in
While the popular kids would run around with seventy friends
I'm just a heavenly sent, waiting for the day that I rise
So I could take my aggression and maybe place it aside
I gaze at the sky with contacts placed in my eyes
Asking why do they only love me when my face is disguised
I'm still waiting for signs but I doubt I'm a ever get them
If I never see any proof, how can I represent them man

You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me

I do this because I know it's what I'm destined to be
I do this for the kids who were always messed with and teased
I do this for the ones who were told they'll never succeed
I do this for those who grew up as young and restless as me
Ya'll would always drink and go party with your crew in the nighttime
Doing shit nobody would ever do in their right mind
Then when you got a little older you hit a fine line
With an accidental kid struggling with a nine to five
You always thought that I was so stupid to write rhymes
Thinking I would never make it and lose with the white eyes
But the formula I created proved I was Einstein
Now I've done more shit then you'd ever do in a lifetime
Since elementary, you'd belittle me, show no sympathy
Hurt me mentally, but you never had the sense to see
That your desire to be cruel, was fire to my fuel
Would inspire me to rule, the world until I was cool
I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me

I ain't gonna take your shit, I've already lost my mind (lost my mind)
You driving me crazy, so that it makes me cry (makes me cry)
God if you exist then please send me a sign
Because all the rage that's stored in me is eating me alive
Help me out

I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me

Sometimes I wonder what the hell your problem is
Why must you love to see me this low
Won't you just let me live

I've spent about ten years tryna work on my craft
Tryna save this hip-hop shit and disperse of the trash
But all my nerves have just crashed 'cause all the verses I've thrashed
Were meant to benefit my future, I'm uncertain it has
I rarely ever put something out to insert in your dash
'Cause as soon as I became a brand, my whole purpose was smashed
I'm feelin' nervous, in fact, I got no urges to rap
Now I don't think my fucking life can get more worthless than that
I see these niggas blowing up who never do got the proper game
Niggas who fucking suck, Gucci and Waka Flocka Flame
Niggas who makin' bucks, someone tell me I'm not insane
'Cause I feel the urge to run up on a bitch ass nigga and rob his chain
Dang! I thought I had it figured out
See, I panic and I pout, yo, I've had it, man, I'm out
God damn it, this shit's a clout
I'm the baddest, ain't no doubt
But my madness is about to turn me manic 'til I shout

How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me?
Won't somebody tell me?
You can go ahead and fall asleep
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man

Unhappy here with no wife, don't ask me, I don't know why
I'm livin' life without no type of strategy to go by
I knew a bitch who I would go pick up when the day starts
A bitch who'd even like to watch me skate at the skate park
A bitch who I was making out with up in the graveyard
The same bitch who went and left my ass with a slayed heart
She cut it like an avocado
Secretly hittin' clubs and poppin' bottles
Hanging with thugs or sucking a lots of cock, yo
The biggest slut from Loveland, Colorado
Fuck a ho, that's Hopsin's motto
My heart is vacant, you knock it's hollow
She met another guy who left the baby stuck inside
Her vagina, then he just split and messed up her fuckin' life
Now she hits me up and I say, "Go suck a nut, goodbye"
All you sluts can die for wasting all my sacred love supply

How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me?
Won't somebody tell me?

To live a decent life, what all does it take?
I've tried and tried to be the best, but nothing falls in the place
And I'm a man, but my struggle is gonna cause me to break
And just evolve me to hate, I'm in a nauseous state
And, shit, it probably is fate, but who's in control of it, me or God?
Is he the cause? Then why am I here? The reason's odd
I'm broke and need a job for spending cheese on broads
But y'all don't see the flaws, I coat it up to keep it raw
And MC's who's got the most talent in this whole planet
Don't never get recognized when they dope at it
So they go back to the block hustlin' the dope addicts
Some niggas got the "it" factor, some niggas don't have it
Yo, I'm at my last ends
'Cause every time I think I'm out the matrix, I get sucked right back in
But, man, I'm hopin' things'll change and the soul in me remains
'Cause the talent that I got is way too cold to be contained

No, no
What did I do to deserve this?
No, no
I don't even have a purpose
(Pillow Man) No, no
(Pillow Man) What did I do to deserve this?
(Pillow Man) No, no
(Pillow Man) I don't even have a purpose
How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me?
Won't somebody tell me?
You can go ahead and fall asleep
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dreams4Embed
Who am I? Why am I even here, man?
Okay, let's take a trip through my mind and see what we find. Yeah. Okay. Yo.

In high school, Marcus wasn't a helpful student
He dropped out 'cause teachers would never help him through it
And if I don't save this rap game who else would do it?
This is my motherfucking world, welcome to it
If you thinking that Hop's wack, then you is hating
And what the fuck do my contacts have to do with Satan?
I want a bitch with a bomb ass and some lubrication
A loverboy, you see I'm that but I'm rude and blatant
Now you listen here: I started a movement this year
I will fuck you up if you interfere
You been a queer your whole fucking life and I'll kick you into gear
You trying to prove you a lunatic? Ooh, I'm oozing in fear!
You on some sloppy-clown bitch shit: I'll rip your head off
Poke a stick through it, then beat the rest of your body down with it
I start violence, cops come with the loud sirens
Now I have to hop a barbed wire fence
They find me in the broke down car I had been hiding in
Homicide is now the charge I'm against
Walk up to the jail cell with the guard I am with
He pushes me in and then the bar slide and sit
This new age of rappers, all they wanna do is floss, why?
Swearing they're the boss guy, thinking that they're all fly
You, Lil' Wayne, Soulja Boy, this Asher Roth guy
Normally I would mind, but this time I've lost mine
Who the hell is he? The biggest hater that you'll ever meet
White contacts, so you motherfuckers remember me
Lyrics put together so cleverly, you will never be
On my level, I chop all of you rappers to celery
Fake thugs rap like: "I'll let the Glock spit at you
Just got out the pen' 'cause I move how real niggas move"
No, don't lie, 'cause it hurts when you get the truth
You got out the pen' and wrote a verse with it, didn't you?
Fuck life, you can't tell me nothing
I'll shove a knife in your back and leave it poking out through your belly-button
Sir, your daughter wasn't that reluctant
You see this 8-inch dick bulging out of my pants? Well, she sucked it
I went to Wal-Mart with a Visa card, bought your wife a leotard
And made her try it on to get my penis hard
I'm pissed enough, I can never find a bitch to fuck
I beat my dick a lot, that's why only my right wrist is buff
I go dumb off of two packs of Now and Laters
Then fight niggas like I was the black Power Ranger
Head to the lake then wrestle a couple alligators
Then run through the woods butt-naked; so what, pal? It's nature
Why the fuck would I collab witchu?
Yeah, you're good friends with Marcus but Hopsin don't wanna rap witchu!
You're full of shit like some ass-tissue
And you're a bitch when you go to studios you bring your dad with you
No! Unacceptable, now watch me wreck a flow
Niggas be hating 'cause I'm balling just like my testicles
Word is bond, the way I'm on this mic and serving bombs
I might as well have an Osama bin Laden turban on

"Hi Marcus" "Oh, wassup?"
"Um, there's something I wanted to ask you"
"Uh, what is it?" "Um, could you do me a favor?
Oh no, no, no!

Marcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please? No! Please? No!

Hold up, throw me the mic, I got a flow to recite
You got a baby by a nigga that you don't even like
A broke nigga who thuggish, always be talkin' rubbish
Steady be causing ruckus, all because you were sluttish
Jesus, I can't believe this, freak shit!
That's the same motherfucker that you had cheated on me with! (What?!)
I knew this would happen without a question
But you said, "I never have sex without protection"
Bitch please, you left me flowing down shits creek
You sex driven like a big freak
Plus our relationship has been breached, you took a big leap
And rumor has it you sucked his dick then kissed me
And now I'm s'pose to be the father and the mental guide
Like, "Sure, I'll take care of the little guy"
Shit, you ain't puttin' me through the stress
I put your baby in a pillow case and beat it to death, bitch

Would you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please? No! Please? No!

I'm far from a fuckin' life saver
Not you're friendly neighbor, but yet you called me during your labor
It's not my issue, take me off the menu
I'm not the one who put the motherfucker in you
I'm not a mean guy, hate to sound that foul
But I don't give a fuck about that child (You damn right)
See you chose him, then he fucked you, tag, you’re it
Too bad his dick didn't have any insurance
You knew that he was just a lame nigga prior to it
Now your ass hittin' me up thinking I would do it
Hoping we gonna spark it off like some lighter fluid
That's kinda stupid, face the facts, bitch, your life is ruined
And don't be callin' me like, "My life's a crazy blur
Rashad don't take care of the baby and makes me hurt
I wish that me and you could go back to the way we were"
Shit we can, just get rid of the baby first
Marcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please? No! Please? No!

Now I won't be your baby's daddy, I'm not the one
But you can still give me some head and maybe swallow some cum
And if you want it, then I can deliver quite clean
But don't ever send the baby to find me

Yo
Do you remember when I told you I would love you forever
And broke up with my girlfriend Heather
Kicked her to the curb, and then I got with you thinkin' that you are better
And found out you were a heart shredder
Yeah, I felt really stupid after that
Became the nigga that my crew was laughin' at, I was foolish, that's a fact
(Yup) So this is karma, you been on my shit list
So ha ha ha ha, that's what you get, bitch
Marcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please? No! Please? No!

Hey, that's life
You fuck me over
He fucked you, you got pregnant
Now you're fucked
You had me
You had me, that's the funny thing about it
And you blew it
Ha ha ha7Embed
A lot of you females got me twisted
You assume just because I'm a rapper, you can approach me in a ho-ish way and get something out of it
Shit, you'd be lucky if you walk away with an autograph, bitch
You better come correct

I'm a beam just like the shining sun
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one
And I'd be the water that's raining down on the land
But I won't be your man
You see I got other plans
You know what you know what

I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama

Man it's so hard to find a girl who's close to having a mindstate like me
A lot of you drink and smoke, suck a lot of dick on the low and probably got HIV
Don't get mad when you get played by me I'ma keep it real til the day I D-I-E
And for you girls who be up in the club that's underage with a fake ID
Listen, I don't give a fuck what you believe most guys don't want you to see
That they just wanna get your ass under the sheets fuck you then leave I don't know what prompts you to be
So stupid now you're crying your eyes out he's long gone and you're trying to find out
But I'm telling you why so don't cry baby girl now it's time for you to be back on the right route
Back to me, actually, I got a lot of girls throwing they ass to me
I throw it right back at 'em so happily, can't believe that they have the audacity
To even do that shit, like I'm that guy

Every girl I meet, always talking bout "I don't even wanna know Hopsin, ew
Yeah, he got some skills but every time he put them eyes in it look like he popped some pills
I just wanna know Marcus, he's a sweet little innocent boy
Oh god I'd date him with no prob
And if he wanted to I'll let him beat the pussy with no condom"
Bitch, what's your problem? You expect me to be optim -mistic, for the mischief you bring your senseless bitch you out of
Your mind I know you like the fact I'm so bad when I spit up on the track
Black and I rap with a little bit of swag and happen to have a little money in the back
What the fuck do you got that'll impress me so I can feel half of the magic?
A loose vaginal passage, uh uh bitch put that back in the package
I feel so sick and lonely, I want a real girl that will get to know me
No charcoal breath who be hitting a stogie and not one that'll say shit to blow me
I'm a beam just like the shining sun
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one

I'm down to earth and I'm an honest dude
You barely be giving me any homage dues
I would definitely regret it and probably get a big headache if I was stupid and got with you
How many guys have you let bone you? (Uhhh?) Let me guess, you don't have no clue huh?
Could've been 5, could have been 10, could have been a million nigga's that hopped on you huh?
I ain't trying to be another one on the list, that'll make me a true son of a bitch
Yup I know how you work, you ain't nothing but a flirt baby girl that's one of the risks
Best believe that I'ma pass on that, ain't got time for no asshole acts
You say you a good girl that's no fact, can't roll smooth 'cause your axles cracked
You can't find a good man that's so sad, I think it's because you act so wack
So don't be trying to blame the world for your nonsense bitch I'll fuck around a smack yo ass
I'm a beam just like the shining sun
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one

Tell em all what I came to do
KILL!
One word that explains the truth
REAL!
Bang out 'til your brain is loose
All your little fun filled days are through
Remember that I’m like this thanks to you

First off I’m a little bit psycho, I know
Dumb like a mentally retarded kid
I ain't got no friends, no ends to my stress
So I chill in the dark and shit
With a rifle and bomb, knife in my palm
Thinking 'bout the motherfucking lives I'mma harm
Swing at me then I'm slicing your arm
Then make you videotape me piping your mom
Ruthless!
Deceitful lies, listen up, you don’t want beef to rise
I really wanna murder Tomica Wright
I’m thinking of taking her out for a pizza slice
Then tie her ass up and then beat the life
Out her god damn skull 'til she bleeds and cries
The whole fucking time she was screaming "Why?"
Fuck you bitch, don’t be surprised!
Time after time you told me that my album would drop
It was all bullshit, then the day that it finally did
Bitch how come it flopped?
It’s Ruthless baby for sho'
 I’m tryna make me some dough
Get up off your ass to make a motherfucking marketing plan
And then maybe I'll blow
But no!
You wanna be a little bitch about it
Thought that I would never do shit about it
You made a contract with a twist around it
So I could never, ever, ever get up out it
No outlet so I'm pissed about it
I'd be really dumb if I just allowed it
Watch your back, you might get surrounded!
Bang, bang, bang you hit the ground!
Then

Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!

Listen up, don’t you ever hate me
'Cause I’ma blow up like a bomb when I’m detonated
See, you be tripping like a nigga
That's walking with his shoes untied
Best believe I’ma set it straight
Tie a rope around both of your legs, then hook 'em to 2 cars
And drive 'til they separate
Now your soul's in the sky, try to levitate
Bitch you gon' live life in a better place
You done fucked me once, you done fucked me twice!
Having me begging to drop must be nice!
Look at Eazy-E's lovely wife
Maybe the reason is my ugly eyes
I be the illest when I crush these mics
But it never occurred that I must be right
You’re the reason I say "fuck my life"
I hate you bitch, it's a must we fight!
Everybody keep on running around and asking
What do Tomica be doing with her time
I don’t really know though
I just keep it low-pro, 'cause I'm mad with the contract I signed
I was so happy at first, then it turned to a curse
How'd it happen to me?
That’s the question
I could not get the answer
So now I’m building a casket for  to rest in
Bitch you ain't nothing but a big phony
Lying to niggas, saying you signed with Sony, bitch
None of the staff up there knows me
How come my rap career's moving so slowly, bitch?
Now I got big enough buzz to destroy you and Ruthless
You can’t hold me, bitch!
I’ma fuck around and put some steel toes on
Wanna kick your ass in the ovaries, bitch!
ILL!
Tell 'em all what I came to do

Yo, I work hard and barely get paid
How did I get stuck on this page
I've been starving for like six days
I should go and get a switchblade
And try to find out where this bitch stays
I'm a lit flame, what's your future I predict pain
Slit veins, squished brains I'm just saying
Locked in the basement causes madness and errors
All I have to talk to is the fucking man in the mirror
But you never saw it from my perspective
The craft that I perfected got rejected
And thrown out the window with no proper exit
I was humble, now I'm not as pleasant
I'm dropping wreckage on your shady dynasty, bitch I'am not to mess with
You made me think it was impossible that I could blow and get a little money from selling records for copping clothes
Let's talk about the 42 records that Hopsin sold
You sleeping on a fucking pot of gold, so listen close

Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

Yo, hold on one second, I gotta see who's next on this real quick
Oh, this stupid-ass
Alright

Yo, since when are buddies supposed to be so mean
There must be hate in the air that we both breathe
Shit we used to be tighter than emo jeans
The day I boss, stand back and watched the c-notes gleam
I know you see me blowing up, growing up it disturbs you
When my words move fanatics, and in return you gotta post little blogs on the internet
Talking about I've been a wreck, my career is wack I'll never benefit
I hope you die a bitter death
Then lie in a graveyard in regret
Where all of the foul niggas rest
You hating 'cause you witnessing the best
So just confess
You shattered our friendship and you can't fix the mess
I'm not a bit impressed by nothing you've done
My name's stuck on your tongue
Motherfucker you sprung
Give it up, move on
You've taken this shit too far
You mad 'cause you unsatisfied with who you are, bitch
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

Alright, lets see who else we got on this shit
Morgan
Alright, yo

You were the love I used to see in my dreams
But when we met, how come shit can never be what it seem
I was pleased with the things we did together
It's like we was a team
But you would change when I flee from the scene
Around me you were pure hearted, loving and caring
And when we hung out you'd even brighten up your appearance
You fooled me like you were smart, cute and something to stare at
But you was fronting little bitch, now I'm struggling to bare it
Because you were the opposite of what you told me you don't do
Drugs, one night stands and you know that it's so true
You saw my heart exposed, grabbed a hold and then broke through
Hoes are just so rude, fucking bogus and cold too
Oh but there's no dude you would let interfere
With our love, that's the exact shit you said in my ear
When you arrived in my world, I thought Heaven was near
But time made it very clear that the devil was here
So fuck you
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy14Embed
Let's meet up tomorrow
How does twelve noon sound for you?

Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl

Can you believe it? She's finally 'bout to meet her soulmate
It's still trippin' her out; she's like "No way"
No more sad lonely nights of straight horror
Tomorrow she's meeting the lover God made for her
She's looking in the mirror, dancing around the house
With a mess of clothes on the bed trying on outfits
She's acting out how the day is probably gonna be
Like "Hi Pete, I'm so glad we finally get to meet"
She thinks to herself, "Hmm, I know what I should do
I'ma call Nicole up and tell her all the good news"
It went to voice mail 'cause Nicole was sleeping
So Lauren left a message, like "Girl, I'm gonna see him"
She hangs up and falls back on the bed smiling
Looking at the ceiling, daydreaming in dead silence
Eventually her daydreaming turns into sleep
It's love that she's feeling and yes the feeling is sweet

It already hit morning; oh darn
But Lauren so excited she wakes up before the alarm
And calls Pete, to see exactly where they're gonna meet
Then Pete picks up and tries to act like he was asleep
Lauren's like "So where we meeting at? We could try my place?"
Pete's like "Nah, how 'bout TGI Fridays?
I really love you Lauren, and I know you trust me
But it's our first time meeting, I don't wanna rush things"
She says, "That's fine, I'll see you at twelve
Until then I love you baby, hope you'll be doing well" *Mwah*
She takes a shower, does her hair and all that girl stuff
Make-up, lip stick, neck and wrist pearled up
Now it's about time she heads on out to Teej
She text messages Pete, "Hey, I'm about to leave"
And she's so damn excited as her heart pounds and beats
That she almost left the house without her keys, geez
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl

She pulls up, but Pete hasn't arrived yet
Should she go in without him; she hasn't decided
She doesn't really know how he would act if she tried it
So she just sits back and just relaxes her eyelids
It's twelve-twenty, Lauren picks up an appetite
She decides to go inside without him and have a bite
Then her phone rings, it's Pete so she answers it
Pete says "Baby, I'm gonna have to cancel it"
Lauren says "Why? What happened? What is it?"
Then Pete says "I just heard my grandmother's real sick
And I have to go and give her a visit"
Then Lauren says "It's okay, baby, go handle your business"
She loves him too much, so it didn't really bother her
She hops in the car, pulls off, a truck follows her
But she don't even notice 'cause her music's too loud
And she just caught up in the zone of a Ludacris album
Now she's home, she opens the door, moves to get out
Soon as the foot hits the ground, a man rushes up and pushes her down
She drops her keys; the man picks 'em up
Then drags her by her feet into her house like he don't give a fuck
He slapped her, then put tape on her mouth
To take from the sound of Lauren screaming rape really loud
He's going ballistic, her face is covered with lipstick
Then he yells out "Bitch, Pete never existed!"
Her heads spinning, then she just faints
The man rips off her clothes and Lauren gets raped
From that day on nobody ever heard from her
'Cause that so called Pete guy went and murdered her
He tossed her body in a off-road ditch
He said to her "see you at the crossroad, bitch"

Man, I don't even know what happened
I was born inside of this shit
My fucking parents scrappin', I was mortified as a kid
Police always at my house all because of my daddy's temper
Man, this shit been going on 'bout as long as I can remember
He always blamed my mom for the shit he didn't accomplish
I'd hide in the corner like a guinea pig in the process
Just knowing he 'bout to smack the fucking teeth out her mouth
It's like when it came to some type of drama
He got aroused, no joke
There was the moments where dad would slowly be creeping up
I would jump in front of my mama: "Please don't beat her up"
I ain't never spoke on this shit, the memories are rough
Smiles and hugs, that's just something you'll never see in us
You know the pain when your parents tell you to go and play
Then hours later you see your mom and she got a swollen face
I hope you don't relate, I just learned how to cope today
From the days when I would pick up the phone and say

I gotta leave here now
My mom and dad acting crazy and this ain't right
And they've been going back and forth all night
I wanna stay at your house tonight
'Cause I don't wanna hear my dad fightin’ momma no more
I don't wanna hear the police at the front door
Can I stay at your house?
I wanna stay at your house tonight (Your house tonight)
You might also like
I would go to school feeling so frightened, yeah, I was scared
Not knowing if I'ma go home finding my momma dead
Every other fucking day, dad was always losing control
He was acting like a fucking ape, runnin' loose in our home
Man ever since I was born they was pessimistic and torn
It's evident, but regardless they'd never get a divorce
God, I wish they got around it, just checking into some counselin'
We could have been a happy family inside our house again
I said again as if we ever were, that's false
Shit I dealt with growing up, will forever hurt, I'm lost
We were nothing like the families I used to see on the sitcoms
We were horrible with bonds, I can no longer sit calm
I would see that my friends had a life at home that was peaceful
They were lovable people, who didn't function like we do
Oh how I wish I could redo the pain of the wicked days
When I'd pick up the telephone, call a friend and say

I gotta leave here now
My mom and dad acting crazy and this ain't right
And they've been going back and forth all night
I wanna stay at your house tonight
'Cause I don't wanna hear my dad fightin’ momma no more
I don't wanna hear the police at the front door
Can I stay at your house?
I wanna stay at your house tonight (Your house tonight)
I ain't placing the blame saying it's mom or dad's fault
But all those traumas I had stuck with me as an adult
And it ignited these mad thoughts that I seem to have often
Yeah, that's Hopsin, music is where my last straw went
Now I'm devoted to always give you my true life
The love I never felt growing up I get it from you guys
Please don't get it twisted, I love both my parents to death
I just think there's issues a lot of fucking parents neglect
We all got these traumas we carry and sometimes it's scary
'Cause we buried a nest, right there in our chest
And we subconsciously air and project our nightmares and the stress that we dealt with when we were younger
And that's why therapy’s best, listen
If you got kids of your own and you throwing tantrums
Don't be oblivious and assume that it won't impact them
Children follow the protocol of their parents blueprint
So when there's an issue, they might handle it just how you did (You did, you did)

I gotta leave here now
My mom and dad acting crazy and this ain't right
And they've been going back and forth all night
I wanna stay at your house tonight
'Cause I don't wanna hear my dad fightin’ momma no more
I don't wanna hear the police at the front door
Can I stay at your house?
I wanna stay at your house tonight (Your house tonight)16Embed

Fuck getting a regular job (shit I'm too cool for that)
I hope I'm gambling right with all this rap shit
'Cause if I failed then I just wasted half of my life
And I'm a dropout, so that just means I'd have to shoot dice
Up on the corner with they line, or just stab you tonight
The type of guy who gives a fuck about my ass only
Get my shit straight and bypass homies
Always talking bout buy that for me
Nigga buy your own shit life is so sick why?

('Cause you're a motherfucker)
How come I always gotta be the one to stand out
Offend a damn crowd when opening up my damn mouth
How come nobody takes me serious wherever I go? I gotta know
('Cause you're a motherfucker)
How come I gotta be the one that everybody hated
Be the one that all the girls moms saying not to date?
How come this shit is always happening to me
Man I'm just being me

Who thinkin' they up with Hova, these niggas ain't fucking sober

At any fucking day, or time of the week, so I decided to be
A fucking asshole, retarded bastard

And I'm finna become that one nigga that y'all don't like
'Cause all those times y'all dissed me, laughed at me just to make your ass happy

It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong

Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!

Ayo it's time to bring the West back, pass me the exlax
So I can shit on all these niggas when I wreck tracks
Your flow ain't that ill, I think you should adjust that
Homie I don't mean to be rude to you, it's just that
You ain't the first nigga I seen with an attitude
Up on the mic tryin' to explain what the gat'll do
Your skills won't get you that place up in Malibu
You better off tryin' to go slang with a bag of fruit
And leave it up to me, I got the bubblies
I'll do in an hour what would take your ass a couple days
My contacts make the ladies fall in love with me
He's the joker of rap is what these motherfuckers say
I'm slightly psychotic and idiotic but modest whenever spotted
So logically I'm a prophet, face it niggas you just suck
And as far as your game, it ain't never had legs to step up

Man I'm tired of the ghetto, hope I make it out this place
Ill niggas running around like an ape up out the cage
And it ain't about the change, man these things are not the same
All these killers wanna leave my brain laying on the pave
And I ain't did nothing, all these little kids cussing
Learning from their big cousins how to go and get stuck in
A correctional facility, messing up their liberty
Acting a fool making unnecessary enemies
Yes it's very weird to me, I did not get caught in it
I was into rap, for some reason I love the art of it
I ain't never drank or smoked because I'm smarter than
That and I didn't want to grow up to be what my father is
Gotta make a living, got plans of moving out the hood, not stayin in it
I hate these cheap apartments, and these vague complaining attendants
Roaches in the kitchen but I ain't really trippin, I'll be rolling in a minute, singin

It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong
Come on!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
On the mic I burn niggas and turn rappers to singers
I learn that on the day I confirmed I was the slayer
I serve packs of these haters my words actually rape 'em
And where's daddy to save him? My urge has to be fatal
Up in this music shit the sky's the limit for rising in it
Long as I'm consistent and keep on using my eyes as gimmicks
I'mma be the talk of the town, walking around
Like "Yes this rap game, I'm the boss of it now"

It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong

Uh, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, turn me up
Yo, just leave this shit up to me, pal

They call me Hop, the king of this hip-hop
The moment that I hopped in the game it got hot (Okay)
Rappers thought that they would be ruinin' my plots
In this industry but homie I'm doing it voila
Soon as I step up the flow, niggas know I'm untouchable
With the mic I'ma cut ya throat, guess it's 'cause I'm so rugged, yo
I'm keepin' it real, fuck the dough
I'm lying, homie, I love it, yo
I'm a beast at this, I ain't really unleashed it yet
Obviously I have, I'm just bad at keepin' it secretive
If you do wanna piece of this, buddy you can receive it quick
Yeah, I know that you sayin' fuck Hopsin, he's a dick
I give the sheets a clip of how I metamorphed the game
I'ma wreck it off the chain, 'til my records often played
Spread a web across ya name, make sure you stuck in it
Grab ya belt and buckle it, time to end all this fuckin' shit

I got some flows and they super duper nice
Just gimme a dope beat and I'll be super duper tight
Lace it up, sell it for a super duper price
Why? Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly
Hey, I'm so fly (Fly)
Look at me flyin' away (Ooh)

But the apocalypse is finally here, a lot of these queers
Just run around thinking that they hot but they cold as fuck
When I drop that shit gon' be over and y'all gon' know wassup
Niggas acting like that they hate to show love
'Til they find out what I'm capable of
I'm finna fizz up like baking soda, put so much pressure on you niggas you'll be forced to exit the game, 'cause my games is so tough
But you muthafuckas is probably gon' keep on coming back like roaches
But I have the potion, I'll eat you just like a pack of vultures
'Cause I rap ferocious, y'all lack emotion that's needed in this
I bees the business so what can I say, I just need to win it

My image doesn’t appear to be vicious
But just by hearin' me rip this
I'm sure that you could tell I'm lyrically gifted
It's a conspiracy, is it?
Definitely, if you step to diss me
I'll make sure you restin’ in peace, switch a mic, I wreck an emcee
Evidently I'm known to killers, the devil in me
You can tell it's in me, my flow has been mastered elegantly
If you fellas tip me it's 'cause you feelin' the jealous envy
Next I put more thought in it before you sell ya cd
I wouldn't say that I'm the father of rap, but raps father died so I just adopted his ass
Since none a y'all will take him in, watch what I'ma make of him
The nigga finna be the muthafuckin' hottest thing again
Y'all been treatin' the game wrong, man Hopsin ain't ya friend
I ain't taking back none of my words, fuck who they offend
Y'all claimin' that y'all niggas from the hood and the streets
Then why's the motherfuckin' game Hollywood as can be?

Now may I kick a little flow for y’all
That’s slow and raw
For niggas who thinking the west coast fell off
But first, I’d like to give a little toast to all
Who’s souls was lost up in the rap flows in all (Gee)
Back to my original topic
Fuck the bullshit you should be getting with Hopsin
On that real rap shit man forget the imposters
Y’all destroyed hip hop - Good! (Mission accomplished)
Now I’ma make them regret this shit
Bringing back all the elements
Making these fellas swell up
And tell them that fucking hell is hit
I got to focus though
And come down on all my zoning's yo
Because I’m prone to blow
And destroy all my lyric chromosomes
I told you folks that it’s over
So go and roll up your soldiers
And be up out this bitch like hocus pocus
I’m so ferocious I had the potion but no one noticed
And now I’m about to blow up even bigger than my nose is

I’d like to bust another verse if I may
The mess I made, make rappers want to catch my fade
I’m just not sane, all y’all affect my brain
So don’t be running up trying to put me in headlocks mayne
It’s like I pin 'em like a poster, get 'em and then roast 'em
When it comes to this verbal abuses, do not approach him
I toast 'em, bury them in an oasis
Then write a book on how I did it like OJ did (Stupid stupid)
I’m that new nigga all the kids gonna look up to
With a middle finger in the sky screaming “Fuck school”
You don’t want your child bumping Hop? Nigga fuck you
Who’s a better dad? You or me? Let your son choose
Girl, why you acting so passionate?
You smiling at me like I was attracted to fat women
Shit, go dance your ass up in the cut with your big butt
Come to think about it, never mind I could use a nut
Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what
Get up (Get up), say what
Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what

Still the same nigga, still using Fruity Loops
Play this shit up in the club, watch what her booty do
I ain’t got to fuck with all the high tech shit
I keep the kitchen grimy cooking up my next hit
I guess it’s how I was raised, and now I get paid
To go and write some bullshit a couple hours a day
I just pop a tune on and the music will move me
My message is deeper than this shit if you listen closely
Yo, I got a habit for smashing faggots
In fact I’ma dashing rapping savage
Assassin who has a passion
To just see 'em, read 'em, eat 'em
Beat 'em, flee 'em then feed 'em to muselina
I seem to be the most heated speaker
I’ll defeat your leader
Freak your diva then freaking leave her
Hopsin, he a demon
Y’all knowing he a beast (what!)
How the fuck am I supposed to act?
The west coast is back! (Westside!)
Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what

Who sobbing from hiccups and vomit his liver (What?)
You wanna blow up? Stop gobbling liquor and probably consider
Plottin' some shit up to get popular quicker
Phonies get too many plays on the station
And leave me assed out of a deal while they on vacation
Shit I'll leave these rappers face on the pavement!
This game's filled with more whack niggas then a slave owner's basement
But I'm a freth of bresh air
I mean a breath of fresh air
MCs are next to catch hell
I leave 'em wrecked and then scared
Cause that's just what I do

Wait on me for a substitute

That just hypes my ass up even more to call YOU a bitch!"
This is my life, and this is my urge
This is my mic, and these are my words
You can't stop Hopsin
Forget it, its not poppin
I kick the shit that niggas love when they hot boxin

You ain't fucking with what I brought to the table
You just a tax write-off for your label, you outside flossing you Range Rove
Hoes eyeballing your bankroll
'Til you flopping all the money back
Am I watchin' the same show? I think so"
I'm the invincible, unpredictable, Mr. Ripper flow
Yes, it's pitiful, gimme some nipples to nibble on
Lyrical general, suck on my genitals
'Fore you get shitted on
Understand me or we never gon' get along

Bitch who do you think I am?
If you ain't thinking about letting me hit it, you need to quit it (Shiiit)
Bitch who do you think I am?!
My boyfriend dumped me, I'm so lonely (So?)

Marcus fuckin' Hopson, my guy, what up? Don't mean to intervene
How are things goin'? Talk to me, how you livin' G?
You look so confused right now, do you remember me?
'Cause I've been with you since a teen, fuckin' you up mentally
I love it (I do) stayin' inside your head, where the rent is free
I'm just here to make sure you keep all your crazy tendencies
Look at yourself in disbelief, struggle with your identity
Stuck in depression until you diagnosed with it clinically
How's your love life? It's still a triflin' mess?
Nigga you thirty-five, you haven't found a wifey yet?
I mean, if I was you would I be stressed? Y-E-S
I guess a mail-order bride is nice, it might be best
So, how did you manage to get rich, yet be so empty?
Constantly stuck in a deep old frenzy
Maybe your ego ain't eco-friendly, bro you got a life that we don't envy
And I bet suicide must be so tempting, do it

Wait, hold up (Damn) Fuck's wrong with me?
I can't leave me alone with me
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror
Wait, hold up (Shit) It's got control of me
I don't know who I'm supposed to be
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror

So, how's the rap life? Do people enjoy your music?
Or you still spittin' that bullshit to destroy the youth with?
Be honest, you live in the shadow of Joyner Lucas (Oh-oh)
You jealous? I know that you are, my point is proven
Fuck happened to you? You was spittin' so cold
You was the Ill Mind of Hopsin, on the list with the GOATs
Then you fell off, you should've took a different approach (Aw)
I hate to say it, but you'll never be like Kendrick or Cole, nigga
It's fucked up, that isn't fair, Marcus
I'm hopin' that God will answer your prayers, Marcus
But even if he does the chances are rare that you'll
Have hands in the air headlinin' Madison Square Garden
Nigga put the mic' down, don't you fight this fight
'Cause you the corny rapper only weird white kids like
So, every time the blogs post you, the comments gon' roast you
I would rather be dead than be caught livin' in your shoes

Wait, hold up (I'm trippin') The fuck's wrong with me?
I can't leave me alone with me
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror
Wait, hold up (Please stop) It's got control of me
I don't know who I'm supposed to be
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror
Aight, I got an idea, I'll tell you how it works
It's gonna sound a little outrageous, but hear me out first
You turn your phone off for two weeks and start an outburst
Of worried family members, which leads to a local town search
But when they find you, you dead inside of your crib (Perfect)
With a letter that says goodbye to your kid
But you don't get to see him anyway 'cause your ex is wildin' and shit
So, in his little head, it's like you already died, it's a trip
While you reside in Heaven or Hell, whichever side that it is
Your baby mom's'll regret the shit she never tried to get fixed
If you're alive, chances are she'll never try to repent
I'm just tryna show you ways to exercise your revenge
All you want is love, right? Well, you gon' have to get some balls
Shoot your fuckin' brains out until they splat against the walls
I mean it has to hit the blogs and all your fans'll get involved
And you'll be missed, 'cause people don't know what they have until it's lost

Hug your dad and kiss your mom before this transition is done
Into the new life, your current one is trash, it isn't fun
Yeah, everybody got problems and we all fightin' this big war
But your problems are different, you got nothin' to live for

Wait, hold up (Oh no) The fuck's wrong with me?
I can't leave me alone with me
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror
Wait, hold up (Please stop) It's got control of me
I don't know who I'm supposed to be
I'm like, "Who is this nigga and why do I fear him?"
It couldn't be clearer, the man inside the mirror
What I'm thinking, what you're thinking is not the important thing
We're alive right now, that is the important thing
It is important that you focus on this fundamental sense of aliveness within you
And then you'll see there's a natural distance between you and your thought process
Once you create a little space between you and your mind, between you and your body, this is the end of suffering
Don't identify any thought as negative, because it's just a thought Who told you it's negative? It's just a thought, you're making it up
Maybe you like it, what's the problem?
If you understand it's just a thought, it has no power
If you think it's a reality, then it destroys you18Embed
Una mattina mi sono alzato
O bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao
Una mattina mi sono alzato
E ho trovato l'invasor-sor-sor
O partigiano

This shit I'm doing is bigger than you, do not interfere
I'm so far ahead of you niggas, it look like I'm not even here
Although my road is not even clear, I don't see no other option than steer
I'm going out as a legend, you know it, my envious enemies droppin' a tear

You should know I get it poppin' by my name, I do
Man these hoes ain't never rockin' with no lames (Who's that?), that's you
Bitch I'm married to this motherfucking game (Damn right), It's true
If you really think you got me in your aim then shoot

Let's go
This isn't love, no sir, although I appear to bе grinnin'
You get in touch with my bad side, that's a bad ride, I'm sеverely demented
Check out the trophies, I seriously did it and you just vicariously winning
I'm kinda weird I admit it, bitch I'm in the building but I don't stay near any tenants
Lane on my own, the label is cold, we raking in gold, I'm labeled the G.O.A.T
You borrow my style and can't even pay off the loan
You phony, you fake, you a clone, I'm ape with the flow
You think you the greatest but no, put down the cocaine and Patrón
I aim for your dome, pow, I'm digging your grave, there's no other way it can go
Look bruh (Look) it's too late, the beast has been woke to confront your ass and greet your kinfolk (Hah!)
I'm strugglin' to fight this evil impulse, when I'm writing this shit down on the sheet, the pen smokes
I needed to bounce back, achieve the tenfold
Now the roof coming down with debris and lit coals
Should've been known H-O-P's a gemstone
Pay your homage, and send me the fees through Venmo, nigga
God damn, where the fuck has all the time gone?
Creepin' up but then I'm strikin' like a python
I'm the boogeyman, you better keep the lights on
I was plottin' on this living at a night time
Overseas, blowing all my fuckin' Thai Baht
Backstory, it'll probably make your mind rot
I'm using it as gasoline to make the fire hot
And that's the reason niggas never takin' my spot

Okay I dabble in sin (Yeah)
Revenge, oh yes I do care to get even
Wait, my mental state is about as stable as legs on a paraplegic
Clearly I'm very mischievous, I got my reasons, no good at burying demons
See my name, you should carefully speak it
Or you better prepare for some grieving
That's on my momma, I like irrational drama
I got a passion to slaughter, pass the katana
I murk these niggas and wear they skeletons like jackets and armor
Badges of honor, then repeat it after I summons they soul to come back in a conjure
Can you imagine a monster as savage and bonkers, actually ponder (Talk to 'em)
I been poppin' in total ghost mode
I ride streams like a solo rowboat
If you think Hop ain't got no more dope bro
Then you big cappin' like Mojo Jojo
No fake views through my promo's homegrown
This your world nigga? Oh no, no, no
You telling niggas that you so cold and iced out
I'm finna put a fuckin' flame on your snow cone
How do I do it is beyond us to be on such a level
I believe I'm just the Elon Musk of rap
Yes indeed I must, but read on up
I'm breaking through like ÆonFlux
You probably wouldn't agree on much, especially the way that I verbally beat on Trumps
And if you ever run into a nigga saying
He put a stain on my name, I'm willing to bet you he woke up
So keep dreaming
'Cause this shit I'm doing is bigger than you, do not interfere
I'm so far ahead of you niggas, it look like I'm not even here

Man, I hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it
I've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at
Who walk around bumpin' Raw with the shit blarin'
Saying "Fuck school!" and droppin' out like a miscarriage
I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed
I played a part in this devilish game
Makin' your common sense perish
But I ain't takin' the full blame
'Cause most of you chumps runnin' around here ain't never had strict parents
All of your brain cells rottin' from weed
You feelin' like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete
You havin' sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see
With a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat
But still you out in these streets, thinkin' you hot as can be
Without the knowledge to lead, so you just follow the sheep
Makin' sure your lame swag is all polished and clean
While your favorite rapper's like, "Yeah, he got it from me"
You been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'
When I say the word "fun," what do you envision?
Prolly drinkin' and smokin' out with your crew and chillin'
With clueless women you tryin' to bang, bumpin' New Edition
Is that all you think life really is?
Well, if so, then you're a fuckin' idiot
I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it
Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain — give me it!
Do you even have any goals
Aside from baggin' these hoes and packin' a bowl?
Well, let me guess — no
You're only in school because your parents make you go
When all you do is play beer pong and hang out with the bros
Yo, society's got you livin' for a wack cause
You're a fuckin' adult with no skills at all
You don't read any books or play ball
You don't draw — you literally do nothing at all!
Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits
You don't have, 'cause you idolize rappers that do
And all they say is, "I got money and it's stacked to the roof"
And now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you?
How? Your lazy ass don't commit to labor
You pick somethin' up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later
Then you complain about your life 'cause it ain't gettin' catered
Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater?
You wanna succeed, you have to try; or one day you'll get older
And regret it all 'cause you can't provide
Your friends are lowlives, don't act surprised
Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice

Girls, stop actin' like you want a guy
With traits like Romeo — bitch, that's a fuckin' lie!
You always talk about how every man's fake and you can't take it
And you want somethin' real — shut up, tramp, save it!
Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets
And head to the club half-naked with your ass shakin'
Pullin' a lowlife nigga who claim he cash-makin'
'Til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station
One of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it
But you caused it, your actions made a fat statement
You want Romeo, then act patient
And stop frontin' like he in the club posted in the back waitin'
It's the club, where guys put on a new persona
After they get loaded with a few Corona's
They always shoutin' and wild out
With habits that very few condone of
Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em
Then when they leave you, you cry and cry
Talkin' about, "Oh my God, I can't find a guy!
I've spent so many years and I've tried and tried!
Why am I even on Earth? I should die!"
You want Romeo, you're not worthy
You're cock-thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes
Sometimes the secret to findin' is to stop searchin'
Try a new formula, 'cause your last one's not workin'
The term "real nigga" is publicly used
And I need to know what it means, 'cause I'm fuckin' confused
Are you one for always bustin' your tool
With nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove
To homies up in your crew?
Is it because you're sellin' drugs to get loot
And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed
Like it's fun to be you?
But your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustlin' through?
Nah, you hamster-ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop
Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve?
'Cause you in the streets actin' like a neanderthal
It's clear you can't stand the law
You're lost as an abandoned dog
And all you're interested in is fightin', rappin' and basketball
I can't even fuck with you
'Cause if we out in public, you gon' get caught stealin' some shit, and get my ass in trouble, too
You'll get old and be nothin'
Livin' life in these streets, thuggin'
And starting shit with anybody mean-muggin'
Look at you, a real nigga, thinkin' your life's cool
Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you
'Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through
Then they regret it because it wasn't the right move
Your "real nigga" talk seems bogus
A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it
And his future doesn't seem hopeless
A real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit and he keeps focused
To all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong
You inspired the issue I wrote about in this song
You go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums
See, this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums
Hope the hour is long when I'm rollin' out with your tongue
The man above is my guide, you know the power is strong
All you menacin' freaks are only in it for cheese
And the mass-control limit was breached — fuck hip-hop!
They only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see
They purposely makin' the innocent weak
My existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me
Yo, we need to make a change while there's still time
It is hard, and sometimes I struggle tryin' to reveal mine
I can guide you if you feel blind
I just need you to be willin' to journey into my ill mind260Embed

Yeah, met you in the Netherlands, Purmerend, just to be exact
Every day through out the week that passed, we would chat
Girl, I really needed that
I used to always hope that we would be a match
And reenact a love movie scene in fact
See, my heart - you had a fucking key to that
And I was close to saying: ''I don't need it back''
But I know there's always got be a catch (Yes)
Still I'd Ubеr you to Jordaan
Every single day we spеnding more time, no denying I was yours and you were mine
I would fuck you looking into your eyes
Pussy gave me more life, that's facts
You was working mobile on your laptop
And during lunch, you would throw that ass back
Girl, I love your style and you're honest
Plus you got the fucking smile of a goddess
I was like, ''I want it now!'', I'm on a fucking cloud in heaven
Coming down isn't promised
You was damn near living at my loft, we was lost in the sauce, aw yeah
Everything I wanted it was all here
After that you hit me with a small fear, you was telling me you want to go to Spain on a holiday
Yeah, I was cool with it, I ain't go
I was here house shoppin' in the 'Dam, girl, I was too busy
So you caught a solo flight to Malaga
I just knew my motherfucking time was up
When you left, one week turned to two, two weeks turned to three, I'm out of luck
I won't lie, pain start to burn in me
I was walking through the city worrying
Then you facetimed me and told me that you met a nigga and you won't return to me
Ah shit, plot twist, is it real life?
All the sudden shit just doesn't feel right
Deep down I know that you are still mine

Fuck! Now I'm all alone
Single on Singel, with a microphone
Singing 'mo jingles, feeling all blue
'Cause' it ain't gon' be no more ''me & you''
Now you saying: ''We can still be friends though''
I'm already knowing how the plan go
Don't go making promises you can't hold
It's just not a question, you ain't gotta stress it
But you stopped the texting like your hand broke
Although you wanna have your cake and eat it, too
You just know he ain't gonna let you have both
Now you only hit me when your man gone
When he home he going through your damn phone
See my name using it as ammo, flipping on you like a fucking asshole
Saying, ''You ain't nothing but a rap ho!''
And you said he jealous of my cash flow
'Cause I sag my motherfucking pants low
Plus I'm going places that he can't go
So you had to ghost me, slowly
Just to maintain ya new nigga
You figured that'd be the best way to walk away without me feeling too bitter
And I swear to God I ain't roastin'
Listen close, here's what I notice
You're impulsive, even more than most chicks
Everyone around you know this
I ain't trippin' 'cause you met a new dude
Girl, do you? That's fine
Shit you got me tripping 'cause you only call when the nigga hurt you and you crying
Now you out of luck in Spain, living with a man who drives you insane
Everything that you and I had is changed
Now I'm just your therapist when it rains
Ah shit, plot twist, is it real life?
All the sudden is like nothin' feels right
I wonder if you wishing you were still mine
Tell me, baby, does he feel like...
Home to you?
I need to know
Does he feel like home to you?

Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (alright)

Mommy never had shit, neither did pop
And that's exactly the reason that he beat her a lot
So shit, as a kid I had to be a cheater and rob
Dealing with all of the consequences of me getting caught
Life appeared to be cool when I was young 'cause I ain't notice things
Rent was paid every month with no problems so it seems
And as I got older I would catch on to things
Then I start to notice that shit ain't the way it's 'posed to be
Come to find out we’ve been up in a rut
My mom feeling like she got a knife stuck in the gut
And dad tripping out for no reason, cussin' and stuff
I'm trying hard, sucking it up like, "Fuck it, it's us"
And Christmas in our household was not that popular
'Cause all I ever received was socks and boxers
My friend got a Power Rangers toy and a Mega-Zoid
It was official, mark it on our fucking family record: poor

Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)

And it was up to me to be the man to polish our future

I felt the pain all in my heart
When my mom would go and crawl in the dark
And cry her lungs out 'cause she knew that our good times is up now
I ain't know how to deal with none of it, I was strung out
Finally my 18th birthday hit
I would've left, but I had to help her pay rent
My homies got their own place, they living very nice
Sipping on some Bacardi and throwing parties every night
They mom buying cars, new 3-50 Z's
While my mom's in debt, at least 50 G's
That means I got to work harder just to get by
'Cause if I don't we'll be struggling for the rest of our life, fuck

Nothing's right, it's cold in my world, it's never summer time
Is it a test? Giving me this mediocre lifestyle
If I'ma get it then what needs to happen right now
I'm one week away from jumping off a cliff
Or putting heat up to my head, and then dumping off a clip
I know you think I'm just lying, 'cause last time
I stood next to a cliff side, I bitched out but I'ma do it this time
Man forget it, we both know I'm not
I just say that stupid shit because I'm so low on guap
But for real though, God man you've got to help me out
'Cause I know the road I'm rolling on is not a healthy route
From now back to the day I was a little kid
Shit ain't even brighten up a little bit
Now wouldn't you be just a little pissed if this was you
Yeah I'm cursed and it's the truth
Looks like I'ma have to resort to violence to get the loot
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
Thank you for listening to my story (alright)2Embed
Open your eyes
I'ma tell you a story, how I manifested this in my Momma's basement
I was complacent, 'till I seen the light and I thought I gotta taste it
See, they didn't know me as the man you know now, I was Hop with the braces
Now I'm the real deal, with the ill will, I'm not with the game, bitch
Little did you know, way before a nigga was popping, all that I can cop was some noodles
Too broke, to ever go out the places that you go
The frugal lifestyle threw me into a new mode
Deadly problems as heavy sumo wrеstlers
It was brutal, begging to get approval
Had mе thinking,  ''Shit, am I ever going to get my kudos?"
I couldn't be a quitter, the destination was too close
But I was a loser, no one there for me
Shit, I had the aura of Morty, boy, I was corny, every single whore'd ignore me
Lord, I was horribly damaged, and now it became my fucking origin story (Look at me)
Yeah, nigga, I'm Heath Ledger as Joker
That boy Hop is a beast, never approach him
I'll leave any MC left for the vultures
Act up, nigga, the beef and it'll be over
Word is bond, my verse is born from rainy days, the pen and pad is my first response
I then become a beacon in which the earth revolves
As meditated before you know it the burden is gone
My world’s beyond most, my legacy unfolds, to be John Doe doesn't come with the key I hold
And we all know, there's moments I could be y'all hope
To get you through chaotic dimensions that we all go
And as I fully unload emotions, I feel lost
Get my hopes up for fame was the real cause
It's like I thought getting my hands on a Lambo and how crazy the fans go will heal scars
But I'm still the same old me, same old insecurities, and they won't leave I hear a voice saying, ''Marcus, to make your peace, you got to surrender your ego and pay your fees''

Pray for me
I said, ''Pray for me''
I'm so exhausted for living that way
I just want these things to heal no more pain

Let me tell you a story, about how I built an empire from ideation
I ain't need no persuasion, just a pen and a pad with my ideas racing
I remember them days when I thought negative friends were my permanent placement
But they didn't embrace me, so I severed the ties and got back to the basics

Well, way to be optimistic, we made it all this way without a pot to piss in
All the ones that told us we should stop, we ditched them
Karma a bitch, you all should have stopped and listen
Day one homies was the same ones phony
Now we get them in the drive thru washing dishes
Cancel culture got the people mad sadistic
Bad bandit business, we done went from rags to riches
All that bullshit for the birds, you only as good as your word
That's why I own all of my masters, Is motion on all of my verve
All my opponents discouraged
In case they're on fire, though work is for hire, the word is inspiring
My , friends don't go slide every time
Like it's down to the wire, cause I ain't got nowhere to hide
Full clip on my intellect tech with extendo, forget what these niggas expect
Thinking that I end up like my daddy at best, my ascension is imperative and evident, yes
Start a war can get your spirits in checks, slap the bitch out you niggas
Snap ya ligaments next
Let my door down, that's infinite stress
So I won't let you drown, we the only ones left, look
All the cries when I begged and I pleaded
Fell on death and fears when my wounds started bleeding
Ran out of reasons to live, I realized in the end that our friendship was all that I needed

 cold showers
Couldn't throw in the towel, I'm no coward
Slow problems, all the blood, sweat and tears
And as I stand with my peers, the globe's ours

Pray for me
Pray for me
I said, ''Pray for me''
I'm so exhausted for living that way
I just want these things to heal no more pain

Just to find myself again, during low tides, I'm compelled to win (I have to)
I looked in the eyes of God and his face, I held my sins (Oh, no)
Told him, ''Don't mind the blood on my hands, I swear it's self-defense'' (He laughed)
But he knew I was lying, deep in my heart I felt revengeEmbed
