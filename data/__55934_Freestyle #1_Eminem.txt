18 ContributorsFreestyle #1 LyricsIt's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To Receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in Grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you
While you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired an arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartmentYou might also like4Embed
