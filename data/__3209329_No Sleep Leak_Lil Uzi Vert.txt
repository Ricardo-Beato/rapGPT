Floor it, two hundred, I floor it
(Young niggas, young niggas, fuck them old niggas)
I might get a 'Rari, two hundred, I floor it
(Young niggas, young niggas, fuck them old niggas)
I might get a 'Rari, two hundred, I floor it
Y'all get the shit, you get the message
(Young niggas, young niggas, fuck them old niggas)
Two hundred, I floor it

Better keep up yeah, that's a foreign (Yeah), hit your girl with endurance ('Durance)
She like, "I'm okay (Okay), 'cause I got insurance" (Oh yeah)
Your number, won't store it (Store it), call me, I ignore it (Hello?)
I might get a 'Rari ('Rari), two hundred, I floor it (Floor it)

New whip, with the big Forgis (Skrrt)
New crib, that's a new fortress (Woah)
You dig? Choppa with the cartridge (You dig?)
My slime move with the cartridge (Slime)
My time now, not the mornin' (Mornin')
My bracelet cost like forty, yeah (Blaow)
That shit forty (Forty)
That boy can't afford this (Afford)
My swag so important ('Portant)
Off-White collab with the Jordans (Jordans)
Me, I don't believe in extortion (Extortion)
Hear a lotta hatin' like I'm Horton (Horton)
Walk in and my neck got the pointers (Pointers)
Fuck your bitch only if she got appointment (Oh yeah)
You might also like
Appointment, appointment (Ayy)
Want it, point it (Point it)
Call me, ignore it (Yeah)
The 'Rari is roarin' (Roar)
It's blue, like Corbin (Yeah)
Eat oysters, and swordfish (Yeah)
Was broke last night (What?)
Was rich by the morning (By the morning)

Better keep up yeah, that's a foreign (Yeah), hit your girl with endurance ('Durance)

Nowadays, I think a lot of you
But I really don't wanna bow to you (Bow to you)
I put that dick right inside of you ('Side of you)
Not talkin' Twitter, I follow you
I fuck that girl just like a prostitute (Yeah)
I cannot lie, girl, I'm lovin' you (Lil Uzi)
I wish that it was more than one of you
So I can just, um, make a pile of you
Let me tell you 'bout the struggle
Let me tell you 'bout the pain, yeah (Pain)
Used to watch shit right in doubles
And I still feel the rain, yeah
Ooh, know what? We don't feel the pain, yeah (Don't feel the pain, yeah)
Go to the club, make it rain, yeah (Club)
Rain, rain, go to the club, make it rain
You get wet up like a sink
All of my diamonds, they pink
Jump in the 'Rari, switch lanes
Jump in the 'Rari, switch lanes
Boy, I can do my dash (Woo)
Watch me, I won't crash
Better keep up yeah, that's a foreign (Yeah), hit your girl with endurance ('Durance)
She like, "I'm okay (Okay), 'cause I got insurance" (Oh yeah)
