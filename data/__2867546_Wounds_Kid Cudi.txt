Wee-ooo, wee-ooo, wee-ooo, wee-ooo, wee-ooo
Oh, wee-ooo, oh wee-ooo

Hmmm, of course we all have times when we're weak
Where you can not find the version of yourself you seek
You should dig deep
Hmmm, don't go through extremes, hmmm
Oh baby don't get so down, oh baby don't get so down
Now that you know, now that you know
Hmmm, here's what you do, you gotta dig deep, deep
Oh to find your truth, your truth will speak, speak to you

I'ma sew these wounds, I-I'ma sew these wounds myself
I'ma sew these wounds, I'ma sew these wounds myself
Hmmm, hmmm

We all have times when we weep
It's a troubled life, traumatized psychologically
I pray, in the shadows when I'm speakin' to no one
Myself, did everything right, didn't I?
So why aren't I whole?
You know you better dig deeper
Don't lie to you
You better dig deep, deep
You might also like
I'ma sew these wounds, I-I'ma sew these wounds myself
I'ma sew these wounds, I'ma sew these wounds myself
Hmmm, hmmm

I'ma sew these wounds
(I, I, I, I....)9Embed
