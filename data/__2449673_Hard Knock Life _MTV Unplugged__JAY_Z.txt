8 ContributorsHard Knock Life (MTV Unplugged) Lyrics
Bounce
Left and right
Left and right
Come on
Uh
Uh
Che
Uhuh
Yeah keep it best man
Nah nah you don't sing yet man
Sing now!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us!
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
(I love you)

From standing on the corners boppin'
To driving some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For dropping some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock fleeing the murder scene
You know me well...
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all know me to fail? Nuh uh
Where all my brother with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mama rub on your hips, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of the homie Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, y'all Volume 2, y'all niggas get ready
Sing!
You might also like
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us!
(I can't hear y'all)
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!Embed
