35 ContributorsMy Team Lyrics
Maybe I can get a little more high

(Haha) Come and talk shit, who the boss, bitch?
Moon the crowd now, Randy Moss shit
Sharks swimmin' in the water you'll get tossed in
And fuck a first class, I'm in the cockpit
It's obnoxious, it's bumpin' out my car
Bass'll shake your dinin' room table from afar
Down the street, they can hear me pretty clearly
Makin' in a night what your daddy pull in yearly
See a little style, I got mine's patent
Always rock a smile, never a distraction
Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in
Fuck with Single Ladies, yeah, I did a little actin'
Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'
Overly dedicated and overly medicated, for certain
Buy her a brand new purse and it's gravy
I ain't talkin' Slim when I say these bitches Shady

Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads (Yup)
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans (Yup)
Never get no sleep (Yup), you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch (Yup)
Meet my team, meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
You know all about me, come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
Come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
You might also like
And if you see me, I'll be with my team (Team)
Got my homie Billy, probably in Supreme ('Preme)
Jimmy or Will be sellin' shirts to the fans
While TreeJay, Clock, they got you raisin' your hands (Ayy)
Then you got Q, that's my right-hand man
Shout out Little Dave, sittin' shotty in the van (Van)
Everyone I came with, travel like a gang, bitch
City after city, everybody speak our language
We just flex (Flex), get bootlegs checks (Checks)
Got all these people askin', "What's next?" (What's next?)
Success and a dumb fresh life
Takin' bets, you tryin' to lose a little money tonight?
I'm on top of the stage but under the lights
We invadin' your crib and fuckin' your wife
So have a ball, no sports, no Spaldin'
Poppin' champagne, gon' spray it on her awning

Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads (Yup)
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans (Yup)
Never get no sleep (Yup), you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch (Yup)
Meet my team, meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
You know all about me, come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
Come and meet my team (Yup, yup, yup, yup)
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
