9 ContributorsNo Smut On My Name Lyrics
In a quarter of a mile, take a left on Crip Street
Good God, damn

(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (This is a hold up, damn)
(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (Stop smilin')

I kicked, walked in
I been on four-twenty deep in a motherfucker
Iced out, pocket full of heat
Uncut, no smut, niggas try to run up
Barber shop, cut linin' 'em up, I'm linin' the cut
Yeah, busters keep talkin' and I'm tyin' 'em up
Duct tape, gasoline, yeah, we fryin' 'em up
Talkin' wreck out the neck, get your check for respect
It's a promise, not a threat, we are back in the West
Four-four dealers, lions and gorillas
Stars and fulfillers, scars and cat villas
Bars and rack dealers, ignored you rap niggas
You touched up the frame and fucked up the game, goddamn

(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (This is a hold up, damn)
(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (Stop smilin')
You might also like
It can knock you off the heel, you feelin' 
Squeaking like a donut, squealer we do you doggish
Me and Snoop mobbin' (Proceed with caution)
Every word on the streets that you count's involved with
Damn, it's a reckless, a sexy session
Hectic, rep it, nigga, learn your lesson
Hostels, asses, a violent mess
Nigga, better speak highly in and out our presence, homie

'Cause we been gangbangin', rack packin' (Ooh)
Crippin' so we keep it crackin'
In the six tray Chevrolet or we Cadillackin'
Struck up my name and recut the 'cane
You touched up the frame and fucked up the game, goddamn

(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (This is a hold up, damn)
(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (Stop smilin')

They go, Key, what it do?
Long Beach Club, we all blue (Westside)
Yes, I east in the Westside
San Diego to Long Beach home, this how we ride
From the surf to the turf, word sword
Take it on, break it down, bring it home, let it work
Keep yo' foot on they neck and stay good on the back
And fuck around to get the hood the respect
That it deserve, I swerve in the fast lane
I run it through your kids so they all know your last name
I struck up the game and touched up the frame and fucked up the game, goddamn
(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (This is a hold up, damn)
(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (Stop smilin', damn)
(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (This is a hold up, damn)
(Fucked up) Ain't nothin' funny
Never put no smut up on my name (Stop smilin')Embed
