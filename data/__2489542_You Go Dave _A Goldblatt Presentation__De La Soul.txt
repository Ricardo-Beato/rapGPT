15 ContributorsYou Go Dave (A Goldblatt Presentation) Lyrics
Your music means everything to you
Are you concerned about the status of your playlist and precious collection?
We feel you, and we're here to help
Have no fear, De La Soul is here

Hi, I'm Dave
And for the last couple of months
I've been waiting for every new album release in every genre
But all I've been hearing is garbage
I'm just not satisfied
Can somebody help me?

Well Actually Dave, there's nobody
The Anonymous Nobody
Providing comprehensive substance
For you and your loved ones
We offer peace you of mind
Knowing your investment
In our music lasts a lifetime

After I got my copy of the Anonymous Nobody, I felt amazing
I mean, my ears are glowing!
