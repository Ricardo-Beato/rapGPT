7 ContributorsCome Real Lyrics
I always wonder why you bother putting makeup on
You don't need it
And even though I always tell you that you're beautiful
I'll repeat it
Cause I don't want no singer, I don't want no model
And I don't want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
I promise you that's more than enough for me
Chorus:
All you gotta do is come real
Shawty what the deal?
Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way (2x)

Baby just because I wanna look good
Don't mean that I ain't real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails
Make me feel good
And I'll keep it up
Im not sayin what you been stayin to me
Ain't exactly
What I need to feel and know
You're the one I'm wearing for
And where I'll always go when I need a real love
You might also like
So stay real
What you make me feel
Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way (2x)3Embed
