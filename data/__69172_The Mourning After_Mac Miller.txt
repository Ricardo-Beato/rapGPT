51 ContributorsThe Mourning After Lyrics
Mornin' after, my lungs hurt
Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works
It's funny how we fucked but fell in love first
Been three years, I wish I finally trust her
She make me feel like how them drugs work
Itchin' for my fixture, when she gone the love hurts
I just get her temper, I just need somebody I can vent to
Someone get me stoned, be my Emma
Left your lipstick on the glass of your daiquiri
Ruby red, usually end up tragically
Work of art, you could be my masterpiece
But you fast asleep

Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense

Uh
Then she wake up, cryin' while she puttin' on her make-up
Trapped inside her love for me, ain't no escape for her
You wanna leave? Say the word, but she can't
Lookin' in my eyes, "Is everything okay?"
She lies, put on her disguise, play it safe
'Cause we've been fightin' for the past three weeks
She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak
Strong, baby, tell me what's been goin' on
I don't wanna be sober long
So you need to get me high again
I got all this money we could try to spend
Until we strung out like a violin
Come back to life, then we die again
Little angel, where's your halo?
Somewhere above them horns
You might also like
Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense

Uh
You get me high, girl, scared to overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
May I propose a toast? Someone usually does
To our fucked up love
You get me high, girl, scared to overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
Propose a toast? Someone usually does
To our fucked up love

Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
*Snorts*
*Exhales*
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
Don't cry, it's okay
It'll all be over soon8Embed
