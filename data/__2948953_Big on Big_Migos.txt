Big on big
Big on big
Big on big

If you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper
How you gon' big on big?
If you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres
How you gon' big on big?
If I got the Draco and you got the Sig
How you gon' big on big?
If I'm trappin' that gas, you trappin' that mid
How you gon' big on big?
If I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten
How you gon' big on big?
If your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten
How you gon' big on big?
You drivin' a Jag, I'm pushin' a Benz
How you gon' big on big?
What you talkin' about? We done been did
How you gon' big on big?

How you gon' big on big?
How you go Sig on Driz?
How you pour one up the seal?
How you gon' do what I did?
Niggas don't know how it feel
How you gon' say you is real?
Nigga lyin' sayin' he havin' Act' seal
But we both know that ain't real
Nigga lyin' 'bout a quarter mill
He ain't touch it or know how it feel
Nigga talkin' 'bout they independent
Turned around and 360 the deal
Nigga walkin' 'round with 30s on them
But they know they ain't ready to kill
All my niggas havin' cookie bags
Vacuum sealed and ready to sell
M&M in the mail, I done took a lot of L's
Hundred niggas with the shells, goin' big, whale
Pullin' out V12, pickin' up a plate at Kelz
You might also like
(Can't go big on big)
We the biggest shit poppin', wrist water, no faucet
Bando to a mansion, you havin' condo status
Can't go big and braggin', havin' real big passion
Ever since I was a lil' boy, yeah, I'm havin' Huncho status
Can't compare to this, I'm takin' all the risks
Know how to solve a problem, know how to sell a brick
You might be poppin' them bottles, I'm poppin' them bottles and models
You might be ridin' American, my whips is foreign, the throttles
You tryna go big on big? stop it
I put a big... hole... in your pocket
They say they ridin' around the city broke
That's 'cause they tryna keep up with the 'cho (Keep up!)
Eyes closed, whippin' it blindfold
She get on that pole, get bi-polar
Six cell phones and I ain't social
Still goin' big, cup like Magnolia

If you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper
How you gon' big on big?
If you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres
How you gon' big on big?
If I got the Draco and you got the Sig
How you gon' big on big?
If I'm trappin' that gas, you trappin' that mid
How you gon' big on big?
If I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten
How you gon' big on big?
If your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten
How you gon' big on big?
You drivin' a Jag, I'm pushin' a Benz
How you gon' big on big?
What you talkin' about? We done been did
How you gon' big on big?
How you gon'... flex on the squad?
When you know... the bag is large?
Where were you... when times was hard?
It's pitiful, how you gon' big when we extra large?
Four car garage... two bad broads
I don't flex or floss... I'm a rockstar
With no guitar, Lambo avatar (Lambo)
Sippin' on some tar (Act) I'm livin' above the bar
Wrist on froze, wrist on froze (Ice)
Your lil' hoe... been my hoe (Smash smash)
Green Lambo... Piccolo (Skrr skrr)
Diamonds drippin' on me, Nickelodeon (Splash)
You goin' too big, you talkin' 'bout money, you bother me
(You makin' me sick)
I own all of my cars, jewelry, and I got property
(I got some property)
Building these houses in places, I'm playing Monopoly
Please do not talk to me
You don't do nothin', you obsolete

If you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper
How you gon' big on big?
If you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres
How you gon' big on big?
If I got the Draco and you got the Sig
How you gon' big on big?
If I'm trappin' that gas, you trappin' that mid
How you gon' big on big?
If I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten
How you gon' big on big?
If your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten
How you gon' big on big?
You drivin' a Jag, I'm pushin' a Benz
How you gon' big on big?
What you talkin' about? We done been did
How you gon' big on big?
Can't go big on big
Can't go big on big
Can't go big on big
Can't go big on big7Embed
