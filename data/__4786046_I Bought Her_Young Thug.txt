DJ Durel
Yeah

I bought my bitch a bag, I bought a lotta ass
I bought my bitch a bag, I bought a lotta ass
My C no longer slashed, R.I.P. to Nipsey, yeah
I tripled up the stash, I had to tint the Jag'
She say she don't suck dick, I called that bitch a cab
New York, ain't goin' for no bap, I promise you'll get stabbed
I told her I go nast', I give 'em lifetime splash
I told her I got crops, that big, big Birkin bag (That Birk')

I whipped up in Beverly Hills, but it wasn't sushi (That big, big Birkin bag, that Birkin, yeah)
I couldn't afford her, that she was way better at Hooters (Took out a order, woah)
I gave her .40, took brand new AK to a shooter (Shootin' in 4K)
I can get a nigga ass smoked for a bowl of noodles (I can get a nigga ass smoked, woah)
I gave her 40 clip, take to the woadie, the shooter (Woah)
I brought the Carbon 15 and it's tall as a ruler (Woah)
I had the daughter come see me, I thought it was voodoo (Woah)
I left the car parked outside of the boogaloos (Skrrt, woah)
You don't go Need for Speed, yeah, I just been movin' 'em (I keep it goin', poom, poom)
I been in Trestletree and I just been boolin' it (I'm in the opp's hood)
I need to catch me some Zs, 'cause I just been booted up (I need to get me some sleep)
I had your bitch on her knees and I told her toot it up (Had this bitch on her knees)
Fish fork, ayy, I whip my wrist, I deep fry dope, oh baby
Acrobatic door Mulsanne I bought my baby
Florida water, pussy pink, I make her basin
Flawless diamonds, some are pink like a Mercedes

I bought my bitch a bag, I bought a lotta ass
I bought my bitch a bag, I bought a lotta ass
My C no longer slashed, R.I.P. to Nipsey, yeah
I tripled up the stash, I had to tint the Jag'
She say she don't suck dick, I called that bitch a cab
New York, ain't goin' for no bap, I promise you'll get stabbed
I told her I go nast', I give 'em lifetime splash
I told her I got crops, that big, big Birkin bag (That Birk')

Richest as it get, hundred on my wrist
Hundred on the necklace, hundred on the clip
Hundred on his head, I just splat a flip
Hundred on my bitch, couple of cribs
I can never rat, I can stack the chips
I will never fuck her, I just got the lip
I just gotta love it, I just gotta kill it
I just gave her chrome, I just got a VIP
Hoppin' out a jet, I can get her wet
Louboutin chest, under my neck
I came with the drugs, Hi-Tectavis
V's on my neck, as big as it gets
I came for nothin', too fuckin' restless
I'm a slimeball, baby, I'm treacherous
Iced out Herm√®s belt like a wrestler
Fuck her good, but I never kept her (Yeah)
I bought my bitch a bag, I bought a lotta ass
I bought my bitch a bag, I bought a lotta ass
My C no longer slashed, R.I.P. to Nipsey, yeah
I tripled up the stash, I had to tint the Jag'
She say she don't suck dick, I called that bitch a cab
New York, ain't goin' for no bap, I promise you'll get stabbed
I told her I go nast', I give 'em lifetime splash
I told her I got crops, that big, big Birkin bag (That Birk')

Fish fork, ayy, I whip my wrist, I deep fry dope, oh baby
Acrobatic door Mulsanne I bought my baby
Florida water, pussy pink, I make her basin
Flawless diamonds, some are pink like a Mercedes3Embed
