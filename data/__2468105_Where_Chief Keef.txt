DP on the beat

Nigga, where your shooters at?
They ain't shootin' at nobody, I know
Scorch you with that FN
Put his face on Forgiatos, auto
Running from the cops, bitch
I'm ducking potholes, I know
I just got a Ruger pack
Two twin Rugers and two Glock Four-O's, oh
Nigga, where your shooters at?
They ain't shootin' at nobody, I know, I know
Scorch you with that FN
Put your face on Forgiatos-oh-oh
Running from the cops, bitch
And I'm ducking potholes-oh-oh
I just got a Ruger pack
Two twin Rugers and two Glock Four-O-O's

2010 Jeep S-R-T, that's my old school
They like was lil' Sosa the recipe?
Nigga, that's old new-ew-ews
Slow down for this group
Had to spin a Benz like woo
I swear that money my boo
Riding around with my tool
This just what I do
I just been looping that loop
This bitch wanna give me that coupe
That ain't even what I'm tryna do
Baby girl, I want top
What the fuck wrong with you?
Only fix shit I shoot
Ask questions later, that too
Up this motherfuckin' Glock
Little D-Lo with that tool
Bop with your motherfuckin' crew
'Cause you scared that I'm finna shoot
You might also like
Nigga, where your shooters at?
They ain't shootin' at nobody, I know
Scorch you with that FN
Put his face on Forgiatos, auto
Running from the cops, bitch
I'm ducking potholes, I know
I just got a Ruger pack
Two twin Rugers and two Glock Four-O's, oh
Nigga, where your shooters at?
They ain't shootin' at nobody, I know, I know
Scorch you with that FN
Put your face on Forgiatos-oh-oh
Running from the cops, bitch
And I'm ducking potholes-oh-oh
I just got a Ruger pack
Two twin Rugers and two Glock Four-O-O's
