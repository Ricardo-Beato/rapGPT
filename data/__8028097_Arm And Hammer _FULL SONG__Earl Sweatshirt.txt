3 ContributorsArm And Hammer (FULL SONG) Lyrics
Yo what's up
What's up pimp, hi
I'm feeling myself
Uh, didn't have to listen

Sit the fuck up, this is no time to recline
They say time is money, so I don't do free time
I'm so productive, I'm reproductive
My rhymes bree rhymes and knows rhymes bree rhymes
And knows bree D' lies
So there's no getting past it
I spit gold M.J's casket, ya'll plastic
I'm so above average, my flow's in the attic
I spit crack, get your hands raised like taxes
No practice, ye a five star general
A nice guy, my flow is a certified criminal
Uh, so they try to get rid of him and me
But my creativity is red like me and Italy

That makes me say what's up pimp
Yo what's up pimp
Ye, Sly nigga
Uh, let it rise, that's that savage shit
You might also like
Uh, South's champion
Fly Sly, they ask when he gon' land again
Its so anthemic, the flow's cancerous
Niggas want the game back, they asking what the ransom is
How about when a Megan Fox's tits in a pack of cigs
And a kitty cat and an outfit to attack it in (Meow)
Straight rancid, I'm dropping shit like laxatives
White fleece nigga off a Hypebeast Antenna
Tell everybody I'm too crack to sniff
And add it to the fact that every addict is addicted
I subtract wackness faster than Shack Pack shit
Average ass rappers can't see me like crack glasses
Ye, I get cabs and spit savage
Strictly black magic, ya'll are craptastic
You motherfuckin' rap actors take action and get a hall pass for this class act shit

They can't take it anymore
Let me just get out of here they can't, nah man2Embed
