35 Contributors$teeze Lyrics
Soft white powder, clam chowder with your bitch
Snortin' up that line, she tryin' to ease up her mind
Two door on that black coupe, no gold, black jewels
Fuck you and yo attitude, I do what I got to
Man the pot ain't free stupid
Knots in my jeans, caviar and ice cream
It seems that I like these nice things
So I'm out here for that green
Peakin' through the sunroof, mesmerized on the clouds
I wish to be on that level, so I picked up that loud
Let yo chick roll the blunt
She made me proud, applause
I'm tryin' to get up in them draws
Better yet, I'm tryin' to get up in them jaws
So stop poppin' your jaws, and park the car

Cartier with the dollar bill
Rain, club (Yeah, yeah)
Trying to get all the bitches
All the bitches, all the bitches

Check my steeze bitch please
I got cheese
My whole team ill
Rick O, we blow by Os
Real cutthroat
Fuck a ho, we 'bout that dough
Skate racks, break club flow go on her jean jack'
You and your crew wack
Air pack, you on dat
Cash first that so I got that gold on deck
Nice coupe, bad chick in the front ho, then the pooch
White man wealth, I'm sitting tall like I hoop
Mad cheese, mad steeze, dopeness in my tissue
Money ain't the issue
I thought you niggas been knew
On the hours under the influence
Nigga, I am true to this
You lame niggas got me all bent
Y'all new to this
Talk about this money we involved in
Blow that jane then we vent, niggaYou might also like3Embed
