51 ContributorsSELF MADE Lyrics
Ch-Charlie Shuffler

Made it out my momma crib, then bought my moms a crib (Ooh)
Bought myself a chain, kept it short 'cause I ain't Jibbs (Uh)
She gon' let me fuck, she like that "Lil Boat" ad-lib (Lil Boat!)
And we at Liv (Ooh), later, I'm in her ribs (Ooh)
I know she your bitch, but I'm up first 'cause I called dibs (Ooh)
Niggas hate on me because I live the way I do (Yah)
Hatin' on a nigga ain't gon' make a better you
Self-made nigga with a self-made crew (Gang)

Took my bitch from D.R. to Peru (Ooh)
And I take my gang from the county to the Moon (Ooh)
I promise, I be ballin' 'til it's 2080 in June (Yah)
I'ma keep rocking these chains while they keep callin' me "coon" (Ooh)
And she ride dick like a broom (Ooh)
And I drop tops like it's June (Yah)
And you keep askin', "When we gon' do a song?"
I'ma keep tellin' you, "Soon" (Yah)
Big rocks on my wrist, might see a fish, dog, it's real water (Lil Boat)
Niggas better hide they daughter (Ooh)
Real raptor, Vince Carter (Yah, Lil Boat)

Made it out my momma crib, then bought my moms a crib (Ooh)
Bought myself a chain, kept it short 'cause I ain't Jibbs (Ooh)
She gon' let me fuck, she like that "Lil Boat" ad lib (Lil Boat!)
And we at Liv (Ooh), later, I'm in her ribs (Ooh)
I know she your bitch, but I'm up first 'cause I called dibs (Ooh)
Niggas hate on me because I live the way I do (Yah)
Hatin' on a nigga ain't gon' make a better you
Self-made nigga with a self-made crew (Gang)12Embed
