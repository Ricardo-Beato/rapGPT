12 ContributorsBlack Oprah Lyrics
I need a sixty minutes
We leave you on the cement, we creeping, the windows tinted
My nigga, I’ve been authentic
You mad ‘cuz you minuscule
I will snatch your forbidden fruit
Show your daughter what dick’ll do
Crime rate through the roof, one time missin’ proof
To sit us in the cell, so we givin’ niggas hell
Ship it, zip it, sit it on a scale
Do it in reverse though
Fuck being broke, it’s way too commercial
Bruh did things should’ve been in a hearse for
Bodies on the waterfront, washed another hurt soul
Never gave a fuck though
Laughin’ in the gun smoke
Hammers like the depot and tablets like the drug store

It’s HOV­
Got the block on swoll’ like Sub Zero
And you know, I’m La Flare, I ain’t got no heroes
Tell them niggas to beware. We ain’t got no fears, ho
This is rare, you could find them niggas at Sears, though
I’m one of a kind, I don’t even try
Gunnin to shine, I’m running your mind
Killing these niggas, one at a time
Play my song, the function is mine
You might also like
And that’s real talk nigga
Don’t act like you don’t know
It’s money

Ey it’s Horus, Horus, and my bitch is gorgeous
She icy like Isis, she shine like the mornin’
Goddess iron ma white tee, she know I’m important
Ma dro imported, and my plug deported
He’ll be back by fall though
I’m in the trap, no walls ho
Cookin CRACK in that loft ho
Work packed in that Tahoe
I serve packs with barcodes
You slackin like Waldo
You was acting and got robbed ho
You should get a job ho
This path, is not meant for you
Messages not sent for you
You in too deep, I’m in the coupe
Suede seats, she feel the truth
Don’t hate me, I'mma take her to a new world, new order
This feels like déjà vu, something new-­-­
I thought I told you4Embed
