17 ContributorsScared of You Lyrics
I'm gonna act like I don't but you know I wanna
1008 grams and that's a whole thing
Thugger got a million dollar persona
Girl you got me hooked just like cocaine
I'mma make it rain, I can never, never be scared of you
I'm gone make it rain shawty, I can never be scared of you
I can never be scared of you, I can never be scared of you
I'm gone make it rain baby, I can never be scared of you

You're a scaredy cat, I'ma scare a cat
I'm just playin', I love necks and brats
I was raised up off similac
But now, I eat chips and bakes
Goonies never slack, so come here
I can change your ears and career
I'm smokin' that sour leave a bitch in tears
This .40 electric just like a eel
And I am fuckin' for real
You got to know I ride for my bitch
And you got to know she one of the reasons I'm rich
And you got to know she have fun ridin' that shhh
And you got to know she can't wait it ain't free fish, yeah

I'm gonna act like I don't but you know I wanna
1008 grams and that's a whole thing
Thugger got a million dollar persona
Girl you got me hooked just like cocaine
I'mma make it rain, I can never, never be scared of you
I'm gone make it rain shawty, I can never be scared of you
I can never be scared of you, I can never be scared of you
I'm gone make it rain baby, I can never be scared of you
You might also like
Be with me, you'd rather babe
Fuck all of your friends, them hoes are scandalous babe
No lie you might can't get my dick for ransom baby
No homo but the dick so big that you might get captured babe
And I see you dressed to impress you the best
You a mess, you make them young hoes stress
They rockin' Jordans, you in a Hermes dress
The cheapest one cost $1500, no less
She wear Fendi slippers when she hop up out the shower
I get close behind her, like a e-way in Rush hour
She wear real boogers, she say princess cuts like powder
All my bros got power, baby girl, but we not Austin you

I'm gonna act like I don't but you know I wanna
1008 grams and that's a whole thing
Thugger got a million dollar persona
Girl you got me hooked just like cocaine
I'mma make it rain, I can never, never be scared of you
I'm gone make it rain shawty, I can never be scared of you
I can never be scared of you, I can never be scared of you
I'm gone make it rain baby, I can never be scared of you1Embed
