15 ContributorsBig Mouth Lyrics
You know there is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' shit. There's always some big mouth motherfucker hatin'. Always a nigga hatin'. It's always somebody that's displeased with what you do. You can never make motherfuckers happy. There is always somebody unsatisfied that feels entitled. There is always some bitch on the sideline talkin' shit with her big mouth There is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' 'bout what you shoulda do with your money and what you coulda, woulda, shoulda - it's just... you understand me? Big Mouth with your big mouth ass!

You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not of heard it or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horses mouth
Right then and there we can straighten it out
Because I don't get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
Because one day I just might not laugh
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass
You might also like
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

People used to say that you got a big mouth
Now I understand what they talking about
Because what we do is just between me and you
Not something that you run and tell your crew
But you had to told Sharon and she told Carol
Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarrow
Carol told Bibi and she told Pam
And Pam was overheard a-talking to her man
Pam was so rookie, what she thought she heard
And somehow my nigga Diddy Bop got the word
He told somebody I knew from fruit town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn story's been changed around
And that's the reason why I ain't fucking with you now
'Cause you never shoulda opened your mouth at all
And I wouldn't a had no reason to make this call
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

Now you're the dime-dropper of the neighborhood
And every time I see you up to no good
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around
Now you're the dime-dropper of the neighborhood
And every time I see you up to no good
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouthEmbed
