10 ContributorsOne For The Money Lyrics
They ask me why I'm still in the game
Is it for the love or for the money?
And if everybody gettin' paid in love, I'm in it for the love
But if everybody gettin' paid in money

One for the money
Two for the money, uh
Three for the money
What the fuck is so funny?
Just 'cause you got the honey, can't get nothin' from me
Who I look like, the fuckin' Easter Bunny?

Release the Kraken, yup, and I get it crackin'
Mother fuckers better run when I Enter the Dragon
When I'm stackin', all y'all fuckin' tails'll be waggin'
Still khakis and Chucks, bitch, you know the fashion
Never change even though you look so strange
I'ma keep it one hunnid, you can keep the change
Some of y'all in the game for sex and drugs
But I'm in the game for checks and love, nigga

One for the money (Yeah)
Two for the money
Three for the money
What the fuck is so funny? (Bitch)
Just 'cause you got the honey, can't get nothin' from me (No)
Who I look like, the fuckin' Easter Bunny?
You might also like
You bitches back up, you niggas act up
And knock down everything that I stack up
You better clean up before I re-up
I'm outta site bitch, Scotty beam me up
Some niggas hypnotized by the ass and the thighs
But pretty eyes won't get you on the Enterprise
It's shitty (What?), that God don't like ugly
It's a pity that I could give a fuck about pretty, bitch

One for the money
Two for the money
Three for the money
What the fuck is so funny?
Just 'cause you got the honey, can't get nothin' from me (No)
Who I look like, the fuckin' Easter Bunny?

Baby, baby, I know what you all about
Tryna get me to pull them dollars out
Fake hair, fake eyes, shit, I say no more
Fake titties, fake ass, what I'm payin' for?
Did it occur, you look like her?
And after these drinks you all look like a blur (God damn)
Even Superman lookin' for a bitch tonight
Understand that pussy like Kryptonite
One for the money
Two for the money
Three for the money
What the fuck is so funny?
Just 'cause you got the honey, can't get nothin' from me
Who I look like, the fuckin' Easter Bunny?

If ain't about a dollar, I'ma have to holla, get at 'cha
Go jump in my Impala
If ain't about a dollar, I'ma have to holla, get at 'cha
Go jump in my Impala

One for the money
Two for the money
Three for the money
What the fuck is so funny?
Just 'cause you got the honey, can't get nothin' from me
Who I look like, the fuckin' Easter Bunny?Embed
