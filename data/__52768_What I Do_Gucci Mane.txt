15 ContributorsWhat I Do Lyrics
Dirty Birds in this motherfucker
It's Gucci (Ayy, yeah, boy)
Matter of fact it's Big Gucci in this motherfucker (Ayy, yeah)
Flockaveli (It's Gucci), Birdman (Ayy, yeah, boy)
Ca$h Money, Brick Squad linked up
1017 Music Group (Brick Squad)

Hittin' the streets, make some moves, get my paper
This is what I do
Blow kush smoke on my haters
This is what I do
Fuck with the real, fuck you fakers
This is what I do
About my money, fuck you pay me
This is what I do (Huh?)
This is what I do (For real?), this is what I do (Word?)
This is what I do (Bitch), this is what I do (Huh?)
This is what I do (For real?), this is what I do (Word?)
This is what I do (Bitch), this is what I do

It's Big Gucci (Huh), mob moves, you wise fools
You can't mute me, my whole life on ProTools
First the appeal, then salute me or shoot me
I stand on my word, I'm like Luke in the Nineties
Cocaine crazy, Nineteen-Eighty, baby
Two-Twelve they birthed me, you'll find me in Miami
East Atlanta with me, always to the Grammy's
This time? Big bucks, no Whammies
My trunk slammin', my track jammin'
I'm too fancy, manners, I left 'em
I'm healthy, stealthy and wealthy, you try me?
I'll probably show a nigga how to drive a jet ski
Them Brick Squad niggas got me like I got me
Me, Flock and Baby back to back in red Bugattis
Brick Squad, Zone Six, Ca$h Money, what up?
I might just fuckin' buy mama a Maserati
You might also like
Hittin' the streets, make some moves, get my paper
This is what I do
Blow kush smoke on my haters
This is what I do
Fuck with the real, fuck you fakers
This is what I do
About my money, fuck you pay me
This is what I do (Huh?)
This is what I do (For real?), this is what I do (Word?)
This is what I do (Bitch), this is what I do (Huh?)
This is what I do (For real?), this is what I do (Word?)
This is what I do (Bitch), this is what I do

I got sixes on my red and black whip (This is what I do)
Watch the girls choose, iced up like a fool
Barny in my styrofoam, this is how I Screw
Hold on... (Flocka)
Flexin' with the crew, mean muggin' who?
Bad attitude, what you wanna do ?
Twenty bottles, forty blunts, meet me on the moon (Hold up)
Make it, make it rain, now my lil' bitch strippers call me Flocka Mane
Let my pants hang, watch me do my chain swing
Takin' pictures, mane, with this yellow diamond carat chain
Waka Flocka Flame, Gucci, Gucci Mane
We with the Birdman, this is how we hang
Hittin' the streets, make some moves, get my paper
This is what I do
Blow kush smoke on my haters
This is what I do
Fuck with the real, fuck you fakers
This is what I do
About my money, fuck you pay me
This is what I do (Huh?)
This is what I do (For real?), this is what I do (Word?)
This is what I do (Bitch), this is what I do (Huh?)
This is what I do (For real?), this is what I do (Word?)
This is what I do (Bitch), this is what I do

Ayy, ayy, ayy
This is what I do when I cut a damn fool
Man, I come through Chevrolet, but it look grapefruit
Get my money stack it up, this is what real players do (Yessir)
If he don't get no money then that nigga need to shoot
Smokin' kush at the house while your bitch clean my shoes
Real gangsta nigga ,mane, this is what I do
Say lil' partner just hit me sayin', "Man, I need a deuce" (Okay)
So I hit him with the Four's, this is what I do
Killed your baby mama, this is what I do (Damn)
Work six cell phones, this is what I do
Rims on my car look like, man, they runnin' out they shoes
With that blue twenty piece, look like my backyard swimmin' pool2Embed
