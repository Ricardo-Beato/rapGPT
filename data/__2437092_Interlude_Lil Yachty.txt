25 ContributorsInterlude Lyrics
Ayy, yeah, yeah
Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ayy, woah, huh

I said, "Lil bitch, don't you come over here if you ain't sucking dick" (woah)
Gang with me and you know they keep them sticks, (pew, pew, pew, pew)
Thirty clips, they gon' bust it at your lip (bust it at your lip)
Hollow tips, they gon' rip through your gang (through your gang)
I keep my squad with me (aye, yuh, aye, yuh, aye), I keep my squad with me, (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said, "Lil bitch, don't you come over if you is not sucking dick" (you know, woah, woah, gang, woah)
I said, "Lil bitch, don't you come over here if you ain't sucking dick" (I ain't got no time)
Last night, we was in that black Beamer (skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr)
My bitch love fur, she's so hated by PETA (you know my bitch, she too...)
All these niggas, they hate me (yeah, they hate Lil Boat)
They mad they bitch wanna date me (she wanna fuck Lil Boat)
But they only get one night (yuh)
Niggas wanna fight (they do)
'Cause they see I fuck they wife (I'm on)
Lil Boat hold the title, Lil Boat, that nigga be nice
I said, "Lil bitch, don't you come over here if you ain't sucking dick" (you heard the drill, you heard it)
I keep my gang with me, you know they keep sticks (you know they keep them)You might also like3Embed
