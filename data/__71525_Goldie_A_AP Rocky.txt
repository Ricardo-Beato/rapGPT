1 ContributorSpend It Lyrics
Whatever he got he spend it on me
Whatever I want he get it for me
If we go out he say it’s on me
He said no doubt he got what I need
Tryna be more than just the homie
Said if I ride he’d die for me
Whatever he got he spend it on me
Spend it on me
Spend it on me (2x)

I’m not a playa, I just crush a lot
Love the box
And I keep the game on lock
Spit flows like them Joes that bust the Glock
So you already know how we rock
New jays, cop those
2 chains, got those
Watch froze
All the homies way down on the block know
Sooo
It don’t really gotta be explained
But baby love don’t cost a thing
So if the ring ain’t gold
And the money still fold
Is the house still a home
Am I still the one you want?
If they ain’t like my sound and I’m down on my luck
Could I count on you to pick up?
If I died right now, would you mourn the loss?
Or skip the crying, get to plottin on the next come up
Baby, speak now or hold your peace
Keep it real, no games, is you down for me?

Whatever he got he spend it on me
Whatever I want he get it for me
If we go out he say it’s on me
He said no doubt he got what I need
Tryna be more than just the homie
Said if I ride he’d die for me
Whatever he got he spend it on me
Spend it on me
Spend it on me

Look
I'm not a playa, I just crush a lot
Get a lot more attention cause my songs is hot
I don't ever try to front like I am what I'm not
You know I'm still Cyn from the muhfuckin' block
Top notch
No tik, no tok
Like the watch he got, when my first song drop
Bust down on a AP
Rock rock baby
Batman and Robin like Dre and Slim Shady
I ain't no tramp shit I thought I was your lady
You got' question my love? Is you crazy?
Don't I hold it down daily?
Claimin' gold digga, oh, so now you Jamie?
Well you can call me Drizzy cause bae, you got me jaded
Like this was never more than Michael Kors
Like I'm asking for more and more and more
For you it's just a chore
You bored? I'm torn, I'm floored
You think this isn't sure?
Think it's time for me to bounce
Flip switch on 24s
Whatever he got he spend it on me
Whatever I want he get it for me
If we go out he say it’s on me
He said no doubt he got what I need
Tryna be more than just the homie
Said if I ride he’d die for me
Whatever he got he spend it on me
Spend it on me
Spend it on me

Giiiiiiirl
What you think this is?
Think I’m finna buy that shit cause I like those hips?
If ion got the matching purse you gon throw two fits
You could fuck your best friend I don’t give two shits
Cause when I pull up in the ride you gon ride this
Jersey nigga never wanna this
You a hot tamale baby oh so spicy
I guess opposites attract cuz I’m so icy
And I’m not a player but I crush a lot
Orange you so glad that a nigga crush the box?
Love me not
Then ima have to keep the drop
I’m in the slot
Snow bunny and our boots were knocked
Your move is hot
You know a nigga pistol cocked
Sit still bitch
I’m abouta shoot my shot
And that’s it
The only the real ones left
And I’m in the bitch
Leonard
Whatever he got he spend it on me
Whatever I want he get it for me
If we go out he say it’s on me
He said no doubt he got what I need
Tryna be more than just the homie
Said if I ride he’d die for me
Whatever he got he spend it on me
Spend it on me
Spend it on me
