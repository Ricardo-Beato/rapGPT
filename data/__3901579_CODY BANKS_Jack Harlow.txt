20 ContributorsCODY BANKS Lyrics
Cody Banks in a secret agent outfit
It's a bag for the money that I'm makin' out with
Real shit, drop bombs we don't make announcements
Need a flight, that's for me, and then I say about six
Go ahead and make 'em round trip
Doing eighty-seven, trying keep away from Crown Vics
Anonymous is what she layin' down with
Puerto Rican accent and the shit sound thick

Tryin' build things, know she got a past
Why she terrified to feel pain
Big checks, I been waitin' for the real change
I don't wanna' stress 'bout trying to get the bills paid
So what the deal say, let me know your thoughts
Got an Indiana chick and I don't ever go across
I ain't really into showin' off
But the show goes on, so I'm really goin' off
So tell me how you feel, what you think and what you heard
I been, I been working out the kinks
I got New B's on my feet that I ain't purchase and they pink
Got the neck lookin' like the surface of the rink, what you think

I'ma keep this shit a thou-ou with ya'
I been tryin' take a drive and go downtown with ya', uh
Steakhouse dinner, can I chow down with ya'
Head back to the crib and put a bounce house in ya', uh
I'm talking hella kids, yeah, uh
Bitch you know I move with the elegance, yeah, uh
I'm the one that you tell the friends 'bout, uh
Used to disrespect me, you irrelevant now, uh
That's just the way it goes
Used to have the chicks and the hits with the payin' shows
Now you bring it up like that shit was just a day ago
I got love for you, I just think you should be layin' low
