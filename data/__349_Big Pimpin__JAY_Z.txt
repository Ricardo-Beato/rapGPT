Uh, uh, uh, uh
It's big pimpin', baby (That's right)
It's big pimpin', spendin' Gs
Feel me, uh-huh uh, uh-huh
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah

You know I
Thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss, I'm breezin'
Talkin' 'bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust and believe 'im
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts, then it's
"Beep beep," then I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up? Shit, I
Parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen
I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins
I got no passion
I got no patience, and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in, and
Let's ride!
Check 'em out now
Ride
Yea, and let' ride!
Check 'em out now
Ride!

Yea, we doin'
Big pimpin'
We spendin' cheese, check 'em out now
Big pimpin'
On B-L-A-D’s, we doin'
Big pimpin' up in
NYC, it's just that
Jigga Man, Pimp C
And B-U-N B, yo, yo, yo
Big pimpin'
Spendin' cheese, we doin'
Big pimpin'
On B-L-A-D’s, we doin'
Big pimpin' up in
NYC, it's just that
Jigga Man, Pimp C
And B-U-N B, check 'em out now

Nigga, it's the
Big Southern rap empresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's "my scenario"
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: "There he go!"
Now these ma'fuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho's there out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But, nigga, if you hate now
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get your ass to the back as I fly to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Posted up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's sip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!
We be
Big pimpin'
Spendin' cheese, we be
Big pimpin'
On B-L-A-D’s, we be
Big pimpin' down in
P.A.T, it's just that
Jigga Man, Pimp C
And B-U-N B, 'cause we be
Big pimpin'
Spendin' cheese, and we be
Big pimpin'
On B-L-A-D’s, 'cause we be
Big pimpin'
In P.A.T, it's just that
Jigga Man, Pimp C
And B-U-N B (Uh,) nigga
Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it "buck"
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck wit' y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uh, now what y'all
Know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise (We be)

Big pimpin'
Spendin' cheese, we be
Big pimpin'
On B-L-A-D’s, we be
Big pimpin' down in
P.A.T, it's just that
Jigga Man, Pimp C
And B-U-N B, 'cause we be
Big pimpin'
Spendin' cheese, and we be
Big pimpin'
On B-L-A-D’s, 'cause we be
Big pimpin'
In P.A.T, it's just that
Jigga Man, Pimp C
And B-U-N B, nigga72Embed
