Does he feel like home to you?
I need to know
Does he feel like home to you?
I need to know
Does he feel like home to you?

Yeah, met you in the Netherlands, Purmerend, just to be exact
Every day through out the week that passed, we would chat
Girl, I really needed that
I used to always hope that we would be a match
And reenact a love movie scene in fact
See, my heart - you had a fucking key to that
And I was close to saying: ''I don't need it back''
But I know there's always got be a catch (Yes)
Still I'd Ubеr you to Jordaan
Every single day we spеnding more time, no denying I was yours and you were mine
I would fuck you looking into your eyes
Pussy gave me more life, that's facts
You was working mobile on your laptop
And during lunch, you would throw that ass back
Girl, I love your style and you're honest
Plus you got the fucking smile of a goddess
I was like, ''I want it now!'', I'm on a fucking cloud in heaven
Coming down isn't promised
You was damn near living at my loft, we was lost in the sauce, aw yeah
Everything I wanted it was all here
After that you hit me with a small fear, you was telling me you want to go to Spain on a holiday
Yeah, I was cool with it, I ain't go
I was here house shoppin' in the 'Dam, girl, I was too busy
So you caught a solo flight to Malaga
I just knew my motherfucking time was up
When you left, one week turned to two, two weeks turned to three, I'm out of luck
I won't lie, pain start to burn in me
I was walking through the city worrying
Then you facetimed me and told me that you met a nigga and you won't return to me
Ah shit, plot twist, is it real life?
All the sudden shit just doesn't feel right
Deep down I know that you are still mine
Tell me, baby, does he feel like...
You might also like
Home to you?
I need to know
Does he feel like home to you?
I need to know
Does he feel like home to you?
I gotta know (I gotta know)
Am I still on your mind? (Or not?)
I need to know
Does he feel like home to you?
Is that man your home?
Is he really worth your time?
I need to know (Girl, stop)
Does he feel like home to you?

Fuck! Now I'm all alone
Single on Singel, with a microphone
Singing 'mo jingles, feeling all blue
'Cause' it ain't gon' be no more ''me & you''
Now you saying: ''We can still be friends though''
I'm already knowing how the plan go
Don't go making promises you can't hold
It's just not a question, you ain't gotta stress it
But you stopped the texting like your hand broke
Although you wanna have your cake and eat it, too
You just know he ain't gonna let you have both
Now you only hit me when your man gone
When he home he going through your damn phone
See my name using it as ammo, flipping on you like a fucking asshole
Saying, ''You ain't nothing but a rap ho!''
And you said he jealous of my cash flow
'Cause I sag my motherfucking pants low
Plus I'm going places that he can't go
So you had to ghost me, slowly
Just to maintain ya new nigga
You figured that'd be the best way to walk away without me feeling too bitter
And I swear to God I ain't roastin'
Listen close, here's what I notice
You're impulsive, even more than most chicks
Everyone around you know this
I ain't trippin' 'cause you met a new dude
Girl, do you? That's fine
Shit you got me tripping 'cause you only call when the nigga hurt you and you crying
Now you out of luck in Spain, living with a man who drives you insane
Everything that you and I had is changed
Now I'm just your therapist when it rains
Ah shit, plot twist, is it real life?
All the sudden is like nothin' feels right
I wonder if you wishing you were still mine
Tell me, baby, does he feel like...
Home to you?
I need to know
Does he feel like home to you?
I need to know
Does he feel like home to you?
I gotta know (I gotta know)
Am I still on your mind? (Or not?)
I need to know
Does he feel like home to you?
Is that man your home?
Is he really worth your time?
I need to know (Girl, stop)
Does he feel like home to you?Embed
