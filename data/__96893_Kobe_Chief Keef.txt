78 ContributorsKobe Lyrics
Young Chop on the beat
Fft, beep, beep, beep
Think that I'm Kobe, swish
I think that I'm Kobe, huh? (Swish)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, bang

I been ballin' so damn hard, I swear I think that I'm Kobe (Swish)
Young bull of this rap shit, but I think that I'm Kobe
I swear I'm dunkin on these hoes, on these niggas, I'm free throwin' (Sos', baby)
These boys, they don't like me 'cause I think that I'm Kobe (Sos', baby)
Watch me hit the strip club, make it rain like I'm Kobe (Beep)
Industry full of lames, I play the game like I'm Kobe (Huh?)
And since I think I'm Kobe, my bitch don't like to know me (Huh?)
This is for them niggas that be thinking they Kobe (Ayy, swish)

I said, "Baby, I got the racks," she like, "You need to show me"
She gon' wanna blow me 'cause I ball like I'm Kobe (Sos', baby)
On my right wrist, Versace, on my left wrist, a Rollie
I hold my Rollie up and now them bad bitches on me
I pull them hundreds out my right pocket, fifties out my left (Beep, beep)
I'm ballin' like I'm Kobe, I got plugged with the ref (Swish)
Watch me shoot this three, if further, he step
I got twenty-seven more, and them be courtesy shells
Since I signed with Jimmy Iovine, I swear I think that I'm Kobe
You boys wan' be like me and I think that you owe me
Said since I signed with Jimmy Iovine, I swear I think that I'm Kobe
You boys wan' be like me and I think that you owe me (Sos', baby)

Man, I smoke so much dope, I swear I think that I'm Smokey
Tadoe off that molly, and me, I love smokin'
Hundred thousand in one pocket, I get paid like I'm Kobe
When these fuck boys play games, man, I just play like I'm Kobe (Bang, bang)
My lil' bitch just asked why I be stuntin' so hard
'Cause these guns shoot one-two, one-two, ain't no stompin' the yard
I want top in the car, she said, "Boy, you goin' too far"
I said, "I'm Kobe, bitch, don't act you never done this before"
I been ballin' so damn hard, I got them ugly faces
I sold Nowitzki, bitch, I'm Kobe, I got plugged with the yay-yay
I been ballin' so damn hard, I got them ugly faces
I sold Nowitzki, bitch, I'm Kobe, I got plugged with the yay-yay

I been ballin' so damn hard, I swear I think that I'm Kobe (Swish)

Watch me hit the strip club, make it rain like I'm Kobe (Beep)

This is for them niggas that be thinking they Kobe (Swish)36Embed
