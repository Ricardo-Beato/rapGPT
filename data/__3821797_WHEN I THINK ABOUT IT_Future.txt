36 ContributorsWHEN I THINK ABOUT IT Lyrics
Zaytoven
Oh yeah
Two
Ha, ha, ha, ha
When I think about it
It's cool
It's one thousand

Got on a million dollars in jewelry when I think about it
Got more guns than a terrorist when I think about it
All these cars, my kids inheritin' when I think about it
All this money I can't cherish when I think about it
These niggas rather see me suffer, now I think about it
I know they playin' undercover when I think about it
Ordered more whips, more jewelry
We take more trips, fuck the whole jury (fuck 'em all)

They got me in the courts like I'm losin'
I gotta be the one most improvin'
I know they gon' try to misuse me
Patiently wait while they come up with solutions
Twenty chains on my neck, man, they can't figure me out
Put a Rollie 'round my neck, they try and figure me out
They 'bout to gas up the jet, they try and figure me out
I had to get some more Fugazi, they tryna figure me out
Wetter than a pussy, got your nose runnin'
Kamikaze comin' out on all or nothing
We just gettin' the money, fuck the whole public
You can get the whole clip if you tryna touch me
You might also like
Got on a million dollars in jewelry when I think about it
Got more guns than a terrorist when I think about it
All these cars, my kids inheritin' when I think about it
All this money I can't cherish when I think about it
These niggas rather see me suffer, now I think about it
I know they playin' undercover when I think about it
Ordered more whips, more jewelry
We take more trips, fuck the whole jury (fuck 'em all)

Popcorn, movie, nigga snap a pic
You can see the Rollie shining on her, bitch
Full blown Burberry and she vegetarian
Caught her in Bahamas and she got interrogated
Chanel or Valentino, tell me what's your very favorite
I askin' a Latina, 'cause I'm in the very latest
They tryna keep up with me, that's just like investigation
They use a track up on me, thought I wasn't in Mercedes
I'm droppin' out of school but that didn't stop my education
I swear I'm most improved, I had to flood the population
She made a move, run and prove
She know my love is very sacred
Whip up in that spaceship
Check my registration
Got on a million dollars in jewelry when I think about it
Got more guns than a terrorist when I think about it
All these cars, my kids inheritin' when I think about it
All this money I can't cherish when I think about it
These niggas rather see me suffer, now I think about it
I know they playin' undercover when I think about it
Ordered more whips, more jewelry
We take more trips, fuck the whole jury (fuck 'em all)5Embed
