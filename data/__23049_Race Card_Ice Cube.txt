Everythang ain't black and white
Did you get your Race Card
Hell naw I didn't get my Race Card
Did you get your Race Card
Hell naw, I didn't get my Race Card
(everythang ain't black and white)
Did you get your Race Card
Homeboy when you get your Race Card
Did you get your Race Card
White boy, what is the Race Card

(I never leave home without)
Please don't believe the hype
Everythang in the world ain't black and white
Everybody ain't the stereotype
Just because I look wrong, I'mma 'bout to do right
(I never leave home without)
Please don't believe the hype
Everythang in the world ain't black and white
Everybody ain't the stereotype
Just because I look wrong, I'mma 'bout to do right

Black as midnight, or bright as snow white
You better do me right or I'm a have to take flight
Put you on ice, blast on you twice
If you a Zebra better come out them stripes
Just cause I'm dressed like I'm straight outta jail
Make more money than them white boys at Yale
And got more cents than your fuckin' president
That College graduate, he can't pay his rent
But don't call me brother man
Unless your ass got my money in your other hand
Pull that black man shit, that white man shit
But, see your suit and tie, are still get your ass euthanized
Cause I never my Race Card in the mail
Is that the reason why my life still hard as hell
I been to jail, just like Martha Stewart
And we both told the judge that we didn't do it
You might also like
Did you get your Race Card
Hell naw, I didn't get my Race Card
Did you get your Race Card
Everybody, show me your Race Card
(every thang ain't black and white)
Did you get your Race Card
Yo, what the hell was the Race Card
Did you get your Race Card
Could any body tell me what is the Race Card?

(every thang ain't black and white)
Please don't believe the hype
Everythang in the world ain't black and white
Everybody ain't the stereotype
Just because I look wrong, I'mma 'bout to do right
(every thang ain't black and white)
Please don't believe the hype
Everythang in the world ain't black and white
Everybody ain't the stereotype
Just because I look wrong, I'mma 'bout to do right

Did you get your Race Card
Did you get your Race Card
Did you get your Race Card
Did you get your Race Card
Please don't believe the hype
Everythang in the world ain't black and white
Everybody ain't the stereotype
Just because I look wrong, I'mma 'bout to do right
Please don't believe the hype
Everythang in the world ain't black and white
Everybody ain't the stereotype
Just because I look wrong, I'mma 'bout to do right
