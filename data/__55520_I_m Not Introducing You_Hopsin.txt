35 ContributorsIâ€™m Not Introducing You Lyrics
A lot of you females got me twisted
You assume just because I'm a rapper, you can approach me in a ho-ish way and get something out of it
Shit, you'd be lucky if you walk away with an autograph, bitch
You better come correct

I'm a beam just like the shining sun
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one
And I'd be the water that's raining down on the land
But I won't be your man
You see I got other plans
You know what you know what
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama

Man it's so hard to find a girl who's close to having a mindstate like me
A lot of you drink and smoke, suck a lot of dick on the low and probably got HIV
Don't get mad when you get played by me I'ma keep it real til the day I D-I-E
And for you girls who be up in the club that's underage with a fake ID
Listen, I don't give a fuck what you believe most guys don't want you to see
That they just wanna get your ass under the sheets fuck you then leave I don't know what prompts you to be
So stupid now you're crying your eyes out he's long gone and you're trying to find out
But I'm telling you why so don't cry baby girl now it's time for you to be back on the right route
Back to me, actually, I got a lot of girls throwing they ass to me
I throw it right back at 'em so happily, can't believe that they have the audacity
To even do that shit, like I'm that guy
Bitch come down 'cause you're not that fly
Kiss the first night, it's not that time. No hoes hopping inside my ride
You might also like
I'm a beam just like the shining sun
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one
And I'd be the water that's raining down on the land
But I won't be your man
You see I got other plans
You know what you know what
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama

Every girl I meet, always talking bout "I don't even wanna know Hopsin, ew
Yeah, he got some skills but every time he put them eyes in it look like he popped some pills
I just wanna know Marcus, he's a sweet little innocent boy
Oh god I'd date him with no prob
And if he wanted to I'll let him beat the pussy with no condom"
Bitch, what's your problem? You expect me to be optim -mistic, for the mischief you bring your senseless bitch you out of
Your mind I know you like the fact I'm so bad when I spit up on the track
Black and I rap with a little bit of swag and happen to have a little money in the back
What the fuck do you got that'll impress me so I can feel half of the magic?
A loose vaginal passage, uh uh bitch put that back in the package
I feel so sick and lonely, I want a real girl that will get to know me
No charcoal breath who be hitting a stogie and not one that'll say shit to blow me
I'm a beam just like the shining sun
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one
And I'd be the water that's raining down on the land
But I won't be your man
You see I got other plans
You know what you know what
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama

I like nature, ah you too? Wow, we got so much in common boo
Don't be assuming that I'm going to love you because if you do I'll cut you out of my life I promise you
I'm down to earth and I'm an honest dude
You barely be giving me any homage dues
I would definitely regret it and probably get a big headache if I was stupid and got with you
How many guys have you let bone you? (Uhhh?) Let me guess, you don't have no clue huh?
Could've been 5, could have been 10, could have been a million nigga's that hopped on you huh?
I ain't trying to be another one on the list, that'll make me a true son of a bitch
Yup I know how you work, you ain't nothing but a flirt baby girl that's one of the risks
Best believe that I'ma pass on that, ain't got time for no asshole acts
You say you a good girl that's no fact, can't roll smooth 'cause your axles cracked
You can't find a good man that's so sad, I think it's because you act so wack
So don't be trying to blame the world for your nonsense bitch I'll fuck around a smack yo ass
I'm a beam just like the shining sun
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one
And I'd be the water that's raining down on the land
But I won't be your man
You see I got other plans
You know what you know what
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama

Baby, maybe we can meet up tomorrow and we can give it one more try
But in the meantime I'ma have to say goodbye baby 'cause right now you're not my type
Now listen, I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama4Embed
