K.E On The Track
Me and my niggas we ballin'
We don't do no talkin'
I see it, I want it, I bought it
In my closet 'bout forty
Pullin' up in our foreigns, ignorance
I'm ballin', I'm ballin'

Me and my niggas we ballin' (Beep)
We don't do no talkin' (Nah)
I see it, I want it, I bought it (Beep, Beep)
In my closet 'bout forty (Beep)
Pullin' up in our foreign (Skrrt)
Full of ignorance (Bitch)
You niggas is boring (Yah)
I'm ballin' like I'm Jordan (Swish)

Bitches love KayKay, she ballin' (KayKay)
Every day I spend like forty (Beep, beep)
On my side a .40 (Bang)
So don't run up on me shawty (Nah, bang)
My money so gorgeous (Beep)
And my niggas clap guns, no audience (Bang-bang)
Bitches see me, they on it (Sosa baby)
Pullin' up in all foreign (Skrr, skrr)
Tats all on my body (Tatted)
Don't make me catch a body (Bang-bang)
This street shit is my hobby (O'Block)
Whack a fuck nigga like Aiki (Bang-bang)
These hoes love Chief Keef (Chief Keef)
They say they like my steeze (Sosa baby)
They say I got everything that a nigga dream (Beep, beep)
I say that his bitch wanna fuck me (Let's get it)

He sneak diss, it's ugly (Bang-bang)
I ordered the bitch a bubbly (Bitch)
And I got some Henny for me (Let's get it)

Give Tadoe the joint, he on it (KayKay)
Give Fredo the joint, he on it
He could lose his life if he wanna
But we'll take his life if we wanna
300 enormous
O'Block be on it
We don't give fuck niggas warnings
We gon' run up on 'em
Blowin' on this good chronic
I'm feeling like super sonic
Broke niggas make me vomit
Can't do what I do, stop tryin' it
Bitch won't get none of my money
But in her mouth I'm cummin'
Money call I'm coming
Can't miss that shit for nothin'
I say that his bitch wanna cuff me
But she can only suck me
I ain't with the lovey-dovey
That's why all these bitches love me
I say that his bitch wanna cuff me
But she can only suck me
I ain't with the lovey-dovey
That's why all these bitches love me (Let's get it)
