Juicy what up
Hey I'm trippin
On a whole damn bean, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
With my girl best friend, I'm trippin'

I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
With my girl best friend, I'm trippin'
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean
I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
On my girl best friend, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean, I'm trippin'
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin', yeah yeah

Woke up, seen a UFO
Last night I smoked a pound of dro
Jumped up and I poured a fo'
I pour the fo', let's have a toast
Swear a nigga just seen a ghost
That money comin' in overflow
Codeine all in my Sprite, Future live the rockstar life
Astronaut at the same time, gone to Mars at the same time
Pluto, Jupiter, same time, pick a planet at the same time
I'm trippin', I feel ignant, keep rollin', keep sippin'
She lookin', she wit it, my girl gon' have a fit when
She find out how hard I'm diggin' her friend, shit, I'm trippin'
But this exactly how a nigga feelin', when I'm higher than the ceilin'
Can't feel my face, it's numb, and ain't got no feelin'
And I'm in NASA blowin' strong, what the fuck I'm on?

I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
With my girl best friend, I'm trippin'
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean
I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
On my girl best friend, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean, I'm trippin'
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin', yeah yeah

I take off, I blast off, I razzle, I dazzle
Got horses, no saddle, my bitches are badder
With asses that's fatter, you trip and you chatter
I don't even talk, so it don't even matter
How high I get, over verses I spit
I dirty my Sprite, put it down in my kidneys
I'm goin' to space, she wanna come with me
The girls are pretty, the nights are long
Aye, no sleepin' for us, when we drinkin' tough
I gotta stay up, I took me an up
Now I'm buck as fuck, I go fill my cup
I crumble my kush and fill my blunt up
I'm close, I'm chillin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin'
I put the place all into motion, in motion
I grind and grind, keep goin' and goin'
I'm blackin' out on track, like I don't know where I'm at
Talk to Scotty and he talk right back
I'm diggin' your body, your ass really fat
I'm losin' my breath, asthma attack
I'm so busy I be gettin' dizzy
When I get drunk, Juice, I get sloppy, pissy
I blow good good in every city
Countin' money, palms still itchy
I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
With my girl best friend, I'm trippin'
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean
I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
On my girl best friend, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean, I'm trippin'
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin', yeah yeah

I'm smokin' presidential, drankin' yellow, this shit need a suit
Fucked up in the Phantom like Tony Montana, bitch let back the roof
Your girl down on my head, she grippin' that head just like a wave cap
And I get them bottles poppin', Juicy J don't save caps
I can't match this kush with yah if you smokin' babage
Addicted to the weed, I'm a fuckin' addict
I'm smokin' back to back, back to back, back to back
I flip a stack to stack, rack to rack, ball to the max
Smokin' all this weed, so geeked like I don't need lungs
Hate on me, I'm smokin' for free, you niggas ain't got the funds
And I keep a dime bitch on my side, plus a nina
And they both will get you wet like Aquafina

I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
With my girl best friend, I'm trippin'
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean
I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
On my girl best friend, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean, I'm trippin'
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin', yeah yeah8Embed
