Test, test
Yes, yes
Yeah

It's ugly outside, it's muggy, it's money outside
One hundred and five Fahrenheit, thunderous skies
The clouds shape a clown face above where you reside
Under his eye, teardrop got the ugliest cry
They call my city Gotham City, opposite of pretty
Weatherman cannot predict bullets rainin' from out the 50
It's ugly outside, Big L'd be here if it wasn't
Hell'll freezе over the day it doesn't gеt ugly out
How can we hug it out after we slugged it out?
We should be buying acres, adjusting each other's crowns
That was your brother back then, how could you gun him down?
Yeah, yeah
This what I live for, the inventor
The re-invention, I'm reincarnated, see what it hit for
Yo, even your mentor can get you sent for
Get you chipped off if it's a brick off, you hit a brick wall
Damn, big dawg, dove in that water and got hit with a cannonball
Ugly Christmas sweater party with no Santa Claus
Companies profit off of black trauma
That's ugly, mad ugly just like Sheneneh and Wanda
You been through shit, I been through shit, every day is an honor
It's ugly how Mercedes Morr lost her life to a stalker
I'm on offense every day until I see the love
KD3 on the way, this just to feed the buzz
You might also like
It's ugly (It's ugly, it's ugly)
It's ugly (It's ugly, it's ugly)
Shit is ugly (Shit is ugly, shit is ugly)
Yeah, one time, yeah

It's ugly outside, they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder
I see the envy getting closer through my optics
Knew I had vision before I seen an optometrist
I seen a whole lot of shit
Never altered my confidence or my consciousness
It's ugly outside, stay dangerous, stay out the mix
Poppin' back out on niggas, homie I'm poppin' shit
Kill 'em with no accomplices
Watchin' my rearview, the envy is obvious
It's ugly outside, it's grown men jealous outside
It's grown ass women that'll have you set up to die
You really not a stepper nigga, just step to the side
While I two-step on a beat, watch a veteran slide
JMJ seen him comin', wish he ain't hit the buzzer
Marvin Gaye to Young Dolph, we taking out our brothers
Distorted faces, solemn features, we kill each other
It's Mr. Ugly Man, Marlon Wayans in In Living Color

It's ugly (It's ugly, it's ugly)
It's ugly (It's ugly, it's ugly)
Shit is ugly (Shit is ugly, shit is ugly)
Yeah, one time
It's ugly (It's ugly, it's ugly)
It's ugly (It's ugly, it's ugly)
Shit is ugly (Shit is ugly, shit is ugly)
