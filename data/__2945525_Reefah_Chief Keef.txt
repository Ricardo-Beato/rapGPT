19 ContributorsReefah Lyrics
When I look in the mirror, sometimes I see a demon
I'm gettin' money, these niggas don't know the meanin'
I just got to leanin' 'cause I was double cup feenin'
Out there rockin' the Glock, niggas bet' not come in between it
When I was 16, I was on the Front wit' a nina
Up in the field while you was up in the bleachers
If I still went to Dyett, I would be fuckin' the teachers
Pullin' up on the Lam' and smokin' ounces of reefah

I'ma bring the guap and I'ma bring the hoes too
And I got my shooter, you can get your ass barbecued
Jump this motherfuck how deep, nigga how are you?
Ride on yo block lookin' for you, nigga where are you?
You was lookin' suspect, I ain't want to harm you
Goin' real fast, I can show you what the turn do
Yes I was wit' yo bitch nigga, that don't concern you
Steam out that choppa, gon' fuck around and iron you
Came out the streets, made it further than the block go
All my vatos countin' guap, eatin' nachos
Acting like you ride nigga 'til you hit a pothole
Fresh ass nigga I be flexing on 'em macho
K let off and it's soundin' like a congo
Go in my hood and it's soundin' like a jungle
Ain't been back yet, I'm still runnin' from the popo
This .45 got more kick than the .44
You might also like
When I look in the mirror, sometimes I see a demon
I'm gettin' money, these niggas don't know the meanin'
I just got to leanin' 'cause I was double cup feenin'
Out there rockin' the Glock, niggas bet' not come in between it
When I was 16, I was on the Front wit' a nina
Up in the field while you was up in the bleachers
If I still went to Dyett, I would be fuckin' the teachers
Pullin' up on the Lam' and smokin' ounces of reefah

I'm sippin' on Wockhardt tastin' like Kool-Aid
I love money like Jay love D'Uss√©
Countin' big bands like hip hip hooray
Hundreds in my pocket same color as a Blu-ray
Come get your fix, fuck around, be too late
Drank that you're sippin' fuck around, be bootleg
Chains on me look just like ice age
I got more pints than they carry at Rite Aid
Keep sneak dissin' boy, you don't wanna fight me
Got Tina on me and I beat it like Ike-y
When we let shots off, she was soundin' feisty
Plottin' on shit, she was soundin' real heisty
Lazy ass nigga always worried 'bout what niggas do
When I up the heat, nigga duck 'cause I'm finna shoot
Fuck around and hurt nigga, have the shells endin' you
If you get money, hit the lot 'tell 'em Bentley you
When I look in the mirror, sometimes I see a demon
I'm gettin' money, these niggas don't know the meanin'
I just got to leanin' 'cause I was double cup feenin'
Out there rockin' the Glock, niggas bet' not come in between it
When I was 16, I was on the Front wit' a nina
Up in the field while you was up in the bleachers
If I still went to Dyett, I would be fuckin' the teachers
Pullin' up on the Lam' and smokin' ounces of reefah3Embed
