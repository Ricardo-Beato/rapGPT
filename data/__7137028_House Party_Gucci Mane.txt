Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Ciroc all on my table bitches in the living room
They gon ask who at the door, tryna get in too
Only me and my n***as, tell her bring a friend or two
Bottles poppin', models watchin' all in my living room
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party

I tell em meet me in the bathroom
I fuck her while thе water running
Her friend knocking at thе door
And she screaming out "I'M CUMMIN!"
And my yungin in my other room, fucking up my sheets
She tell em boy don't grab my hair because you’re fucking up my weave
I got a hundred bottles, Ciroc Boy
All my jewelry cold as fuck but I'm a hot boy
All these stones in my chain make me a rock boy
And I heard you n***as talking money you should stop boy
I fuck bitches by the group I get money by the pound
French Montana on all these n***as ch-ch-ch-ch-chop em down
Every time I’m in the club these n***as is not around
Everybody talking money I say prove it not a sound
White girls, gone wild
We don't judge 'em though, they ain't on trial
Bad bitches got em on dial
It's bottoms up but is going down

Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, partyEmbed
