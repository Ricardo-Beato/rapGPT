Oh-oh
This that motherfuckin' shit right here, nigga
Smoke this shit, get shit off your mind

I know you don't trust me (Oh)
I'm sedated, baby, baby, did you drug me? (Oh)
Go on and ride it, ride it, ride it, gon' on and fuck me (Oh)
Let's take a vacation, get away from the ugly
How long is forever? I don't know
But I want you forever, that I know
I hate it when you're gone, I'm alone (Uh)
Money keep me company in the spare time (Uh)

Baby girl, don't run from me, don't run, I want it
(Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, oh)
Baby girl, don't run from me, don't run, I want it (I want it)
(Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, oh)
Baby girl, don't run from me, don't run, I want it (I want it)

Dior all on your lips, Rick Owens on your slippers
You too legit, I won't quit, ooh
Dior all on my kicks, we too fly, let's take a pic
Uh, shorty got that thang, wet like some water
Drown in it like water
Hey, can I hit it in the back of a Wraith now?
Fuck on a private jet, ain't nowhere safe now
Baby, hold me down and stay down
Goin' in raw, want you to feel me, I'm not playin' around
Your heart is my safe house
Oh-woah, oh-oh (Oh-oh), oh-oh (Oh-oh), yeah
Oh-woah, oh-woah (Oh-oh)

Gon' on and ride it, ride it, ride it, gon' on and fuck me (Oh)
Let's take a vacation, get away from the ugly
How long is forever? I don't know
But I want you forever, that I know
I hate it when you're gone, I'm alone (Uh)
Money keep me company in the spare time

Uh, baby girl, don't run from me, don't run, I want it
