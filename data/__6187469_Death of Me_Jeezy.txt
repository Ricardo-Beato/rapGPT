7 ContributorsDeath of Me Lyrics
Suede this my shit
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League
Yeah, yeah
Don't need you
Yeah, yeah

You there for me, you care for me
You rep for me, you stand for me
You flex wit' me, you next to me
Hey, you gon' be the death of me
I need you (I need you)
I need you (I need you)
You rob from me, you stole from me
You switched on me, you told on me
Don't fold on me, go cold on me
I need you (I need you)
I need you (I need you)
(Let's go)

I was young when I met her, had me sprung, I can't lie (Lie)
And I saw the way she playеd Marcus Clemons, I could die
Yeah, a junkiе killed my nigga, he was tryna make a scril
That's when I looked into her eyes and said, "Hey girl, you got a deal" (Yeah)
She was hood with it, boujee with it, sophisticated, calculated
All the niggas wanted her but she's the type that masturbated (Damn)
Every time them niggas switched up on me, she was there for me
Said nobody loved me in the world but she would care for me
If I helped her get it out the mud then she would share with me (Share with me)
When I see my first hundred thousand, she was there with me (Woo)
Stack this up, let's get some more, that's the way my mind move
Tonight we on that Hennessy, that shit make my mind blank (Ayy)
We blowing on that NyQuil, that shit make me doze off
Pockets looking mad frail, guess that's why I sold soft (Woo)
She can talk that money all night, you know I love that (Love that)
She just want love and loyalty, I said I does that (Let's go)
You might also like
You there for me, you care for me
You rep for me, you stand for me
You flex wit' me, you next to me
Hey, you gon' be the death of me
I need you (I need you)
I need you (I need you)
You rob from me, you stole from me
You switched on me, you told on me
Don't fold on me, go cold on me
I need you (I need you)
I need you (I need you)

Told my momma, yeah, I think your son in love, I guess (Guess)
She the one that's got him actin' like a thug, I guess
She the one that's gonna make him catch a slug, I guess (Woo)
Grandma praying for me while she at the church, God bless
Traded in the .38, .380 with the clip (Yeah)
I can sneak it in the club, you should see it, it's a trip (Damn)
Baby, I can't help but notice that you're acting kinda strange
I thought that we was on the same team, what's up with the games?
She started being scandalous and actin' all sheisty (Sheisty)
Every time I bring it up, she be actin' feisty
Your freedom and your life away
Watch out, how you fuck with her?
She just told on what's her name
Why the fuck you trusting her? (Ayy)
She just got your daddy killed
She just got your partner hit (Yeah)
Them last niggas you seen her with
They was on that robbing shit
Had that Glock in your face like, "Boy we gotta eat too
You ain't the only one, nigga, yeah, we love the streets too"
You there for me, you care for me
You rep for me, you stand for me
You flex wit' me, you next to me
Hey, you gon' be the death of me
I need you (I need you)
I need you (I need you)
You rob from me, you stole from me
You switched on me, you told on me
Don't fold on me, go cold on me
I need you (I need you)
I need you (I need you)Embed
