24 ContributorsNosebleeds Lyrics
Business cards from her attorney
Got probation 'cause her parents paid the money
Six-month rehab, but she back at it
Reflection stares at her, but she can't look at it
She wiped out the debit card, owin' on the credit
For student loans, they call her phone, but she don't sweat it
Cocaine on counter tops, separatin' lines
Every time she do it, she say this her last time
Chasin' that high from the very first time
Back in her dorm room in 2009
Never thought this relationship would come this far
Rolled singles in her nose, on plates, sniffin' hard
In nightclub stalls, her and her friends sniff it all
Never sleepin', random dude's apartment, missed calls
Unreplied texts from her boyfriend
Feeling like any second, the world can end
And when it freeze her, it make her pussy wet
Face rushin', goin' numb, nipples hard on them breasts
Sniffin' 'til it drip
Back of the class, blood runnin' down her lipsYou might also like3Embed
