Just come get all your stuff, I guess my love ain't good enough

Just come get all your stuff, I guess my love ain't good enough
You act so hard with me, but I just saw you in a picture lookin' soft with her
Be calm if you wanna get along with me
Way you talk, really think it's something wrong with me
Why I feel like I gotta share you with the city?
You don't even make a bitch feel like she pretty
Make a bitch feel like she pretty
Kiss me in the middle of the party when it's litty
Remember who you belong to when they friendly
I shouldn't have to teach you somethin' you should be feelin'

Don't rock me to sleep
Skip to the part that you really mean, yeah
Don't rock me to sleep
Baby, just say what you really mean

Blah, blah, blah, la-la-la
If you wanna leave, then bye, bye, bye
I'm a big girl, so I won't cry
Don't sing me a lullaby-by-by
Blah, blah, blah, la-la-la
If you wanna leave, then bye, bye, bye
I'm a big girl, so I won't cry
Don't sing me a lullaby-by-by
Blah, blah, blah, la-la-la
If you wanna leave, then bye, bye, bye
I'm a big girl, so I won't cry
Don't sing me a lullaby-by-by
Blah, blah, blah, la-la-la
If you wanna leave, then bye, bye, bye
I'm a big girl, so I won't cry
Don't sing me a lullaby-by-by

Don't rock me to sleep
Skip to the part that you really mean, yeah
Don't rock me to sleep
Baby, just say what you really mean

It's been about six months
Since I threw out all your stuff
You never stood a chance with me
Now it's looking like you're way better off with her
Hair grown, money long, now I'm in the city
All my friends like, "Girl, what you doin' different?"
Guess that fuckboy-free glow hittin'
Waist snatched, ass fat, feelin' real pretty
Yeah, feelin' real pretty
And my new boo got me feelin' real pretty
Hold my hand everywhere so they know he with me
He don't wan' fight, he just wan' fix it

Don't rock me to sleep
Skip to the part that you really mean, yeah
Don't rock me to sleep
Baby, just say what you really mean
Blah, blah, blah, la-la-la
If you wanna leave, then bye, bye, bye
I'm a big girl, so I won't cry
Don't sing me a lullaby-by-by
Blah, blah, blah, la-la-la
If you wanna leave, then bye, bye, bye
I'm a big girl, so I won't cry
Don't sing me a lullaby-by-by
Blah, blah, blah, la-la-la
If you wanna leave, then bye, bye, bye
I'm a big girl, so I won't cry
Don't sing me a lullaby-by-by

Don't rock me to sleep
Skip to the part that you really mean, yeah
Don't rock me to sleep
Baby, just say what you really mean

Blah, blah, blah, la-la-la
La, la-la-la
I'm a big girl, so I won't cry
Don't sing me a lullaby-by-by
Blah, blah, blah, la-la-la
La, la-la-la
I'm a big girl, so I won't cry
Don't sing me a lullaby-by1Embed
