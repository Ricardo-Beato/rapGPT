4 ContributorsLoverâ€™s Peak Lyrics
That's all I wanna do, baby
I mean really
I mean, I go out there, I work my whole life, baby
I put it down for you
I put it down for our kids
See, as a man I ain't got no excuse, baby
I'm the voice of the struggle
All I wanna do is write love songs about you

Love is a drug
Love is the gift, love is the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Love is so strong, take a hit, love is a drug
Love is the gift, love the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Never so strong, love is reap
When you saying love me it doesn't matter
You might also like
See, babe, I got so much love to give
I don't got an ounce, I don't got grams
I got kilos of love
Kilo, kilo, kilo, kilos of loveEmbed
