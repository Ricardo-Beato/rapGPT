22 ContributorsLucky Bastard Lyrics
Bang, bang
Hahaha, hahaha, I know, man, I'm just tweaking (Skrrt)
Bitch, let's have a chopper party (Bang, bang)
Bang, bang, bang, kamikaze (Bang, bang, bang)

Bitch, let's have a chopper party (Blatt)
It's a movie and them choppers starring (Blatt-blatt, blatt)
Produced by Uzi and them Glocks and Carbons (Blatt)
Bang, bang, kamikaze (Blatt)
I bought a watch, it cost a Maserati (Bang)
I bought a car, it cost a fucking mansion (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
It go skrrt-skrrt then niggas stuffed in plastic (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
I'm a young rich lucky bastard (Bang)

Baby, I ain't have no father (Ayy)
I only had my mother (Ayy)
They say that mothers raise soldiers (Ayy)
Well my mama raised Almighty (Ayy)
Remember when I was best friends with Pyrex (Skrrt)
Now I'm best friends with Ben Franklin (Beep)
I know you see my wrist dancing (Bling, bling)
Turn off the lights, now my wrist complaining (Damnit, damnit)
My chopper got Tourettes (Bang, bang)
It's steady screaming out this and that (Brrat)
Shooting for your neck and your head (Ayy)
Like, who next? Who wanna flex?

Bitch, let's have a chopper party
It's a movie and them choppers starring (Bang, bang, bang)

Bang, bang, kamikaze (Bang)
I bought a watch, it cost a Maserati (Bang)
I bought a car, it cost a fucking mansion (Skrrt)
It go skrrt-skrrt then niggas stuffed in plastic (Skrrt-skrrt)

You know I'm always glowing
I even got my bitch glowing
She ain't getting no cash, doughing
That bitch just got IG famous on 'em (Ayy)
I had my chopper snoring
Now you got my chopper roaring
Tryna drive-by, that shit not so smart and
Now my niggas shot up your car and
Now you got your face on a carton
And now your name is your block end
I got all my ice, I won't tuck it
Niggas don't wanna get killed in public (Ayy)
Like, welcome to the opera, meet Ms. Chopper-a
If you got a fuckin' problem with us, she gon' chop you up
I'm still bussin' like a Dillinger, but I'm on my chopper stuff
They be cuffin' like an officer, Chief Keef won't lock you up (Ayy)
'Cause who gon' hold me down? My chopper
Baby, I'm still runnin' from them coppers
I'm still screamin', "Fuck the oppers"
Spot 'em, got 'em, then I drop 'em
Bitch, let's have a chopper party (Blatt)
It's a movie and them choppers starring (Blatt-blatt, blatt)
Produced by Uzi and them Glocks and Carbons (Blatt)
Bang, bang, kamikaze (Blatt)

It go skrrt-skrrt then niggas stuffed in plastic (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
