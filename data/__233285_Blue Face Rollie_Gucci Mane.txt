15 ContributorsBlue Face Rollie Lyrics
Turn it up Keyshia
My engineer a girl
Damn, huh
It's Brick Squad, Big Money Talk
Huh, shut up nigga

Cookin' up oil based dope got residue all on this blue face Rollie, bezel
Whole lot of revenue new people try guwap, blue six Ninth avenue Gucci
Crip blue diamonds like tookie
Dope man Gucci
Got the fiends hooked like Pookie
Young Frank Lucas, VVS stupid
Red blue chain like cupid I'm boolie
Sleeping with the ruler
41 millimeter bigger than a muller
Gotta sit it in a cooler
Gotta drooler with a tumor
Bipolar is a rumor
That a nigga got a shooting disorder
Lookin' like I'm bout to go war for the green Travis Porter
Tatted like Travis Barker but nigga I'm Gucci
And I shoot dice with Waka Flocka's nigga, one monkey don't stop big Gucci
Mr. Guwop said he got loot then come shoot me
Big dog nigga y'all poodles don't want it
And I got bell hoppers in my closet nigga I know y'all broke niggas want to come loot it
Reminiscing with my Uzi
Cookin' up dope in Louie
Thug, Scooter, PeeWee my movement
We got foreign bitches if I choose it
