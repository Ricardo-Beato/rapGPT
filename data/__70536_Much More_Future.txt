Dont understand
Nah yeah dey dont unserstand
It ain't for dem to understand tho you feel me
Street the kid kid baby
Ay what we have ay what we have
True story
Astronaut kid roll some kush
Ay peep my signs yo

Now what we have once more than they can ever see
Ay we be rockin we be trustin elementary
Its been a century yeah you remember me
I hate to bring you up sometimes see I got kids shawty
And I won't want them to have the relationship we have
Miss layin through the pain you was always there
I set your heart on fire I put your love in the air
No matter if you hit the ground you went up in the air
Cloud 9 elevation ain't no limitation
For me this recreation to you this your creation
Ay you put the game on it
Every time I dont won't you
You always comeback

What we have is much more than they can see 3x
C roll the kush

I put my thoughts inside these cups
My vocal cards stope up my words comin out doper waffle house
Pen and serve yes sir
I feel like a baby again all dese baby bottles yes sir
Sip up like we had a lean party
Dirty sprite I even gave you a nickname
It dont take much to make you
Put u in a soda pop and shake you
Ice on ice we coordinate in a major way
Remember texas to detroit you get major play
The best cup secret it gone be hard to keep this secret
When you make me feel this good
We gotta understanding and we should

The lean taste good
Taste like kool-aid
Ohh yea my favorite kool-aid
