17 ContributorsSecond Coming Lyrics
*weather and* *always*
Damn man these radio stations be bugging
It's three o'clock in the morning
Damn, this hip hop shit just keep it
They gotta slow this shit down man, you know what I mean?

Fiends were never waiting in the hill
They ran one step ahead
But the jiggy was always there
Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress
As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then suddenly in the sky
Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the ear
With the melody of a train (Lord is suddenly here!)

False MC's are melting in the dark, all the weak LP's are
Going dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn
God released the tape out, early May
And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmme
You might also likeWu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress
Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the air
With the knowledge that God posses
As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then the Wu-Tang sign appears, in the sky

Billboards started melting in the dark, all the weak MC's are
Going dowwwwwwwwwwwn
God released the tape of, Earthly pain
And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmme
And I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmme

Hey, hey, hey
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang1Embed
