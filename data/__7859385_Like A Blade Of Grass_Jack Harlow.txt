Like a blade of grass wants sunlight, I just want that ass
You the type of girl I would've flirted with in class
Copied every test, be the reason that I passed
I know we could have a blast
We could have a kid, am I movin' too fast?
Know I'm not your first, but I could be your last
You can't even get gas without bein' harrassed, mm
Some of these girls in the mix more than engineers
But I think you'd rather disappear
You don't know where you gon' end up, but you know it probably isn't here
I gotta put you in a different tier
IG private, spend hеr own money on the whip that she drivin'
Thick thighs and I can tеll it's warm, baby, can I please dive in?
In her prime, she's thrivin'

Met you in the dark, tryna put that light on you
Could buy you anything, let me spend some time on you
'Cause I want you, mm
"I think I want you, too, I think I want you, too"

I think I want you, too
Truthfully, I only give it up to very few
"Truthfully, my body count is low, it's only two
I know that you probably don't believe me, but it's true
Had a boyfriend I dated for like five years in school
Then another one I dated for like two
'Til he moved, since then, I been cool
Focused on myself, what 'bout you?"
I mean, shit, I been chillin'
We just got off tour and we sold out every building
"You probably had hella bitches on you," not really
"Boy, stop lyin', ha, you silly"
Anyway, when you free I'm down to take you out, any day
Gotta duck the cameras, they gon' treat us like we Kim and Ye
I ain't tryna keep you low, but this is high stakes
Life like this sure is sweet, tell me how it taste, taste, taste, taste
You might also like
Met you in the dark, tryna put that light on you
Could buy you anything, let me spend some time on you
'Cause I want you, mm
"I think I want you, too, I think I want you, too"4Embed
