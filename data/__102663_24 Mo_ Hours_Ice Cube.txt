14 Contributors24 Moâ€™ Hours Lyrics
Put the whoop on 'em (Ice Cube, a.k.a. Don Mega)
Put the whoop on 'em (a.k.a. Poppa Don)
Put the whoop on 'em (a.k.a. the Big Fish)
Put the whoop on 'em (a.k.a. Brainiac)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (uh huh)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (Keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (all my life)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (all my life)

Everyting is real on this concrete and steel
Niggas peel your cap for a happy meal
I got to deal with this wall of confusion, world of illusions
We ain't losin' playa (never), we's winnin'
Playin' every night when we sendin' paper chasing, grinin'
While you still chasin' women 'round tables no lieutenants
You's your own man grown, (hook it up)
It's Ice Cube and the family stone
Breakin' bread every night in L.A
And I pray, for one more day that's unate (check it)
It's 90 degrees no enemies in sight
Even the Don gotta fall to his knees every night

Can I get 24 more hours (can I get get)
Without dealin' with these killers and these cowards (can I can can)
I don't wanna lose, all I wanna do is win
I fucked up today, can I try it again?
You might also like
I'm lovin' every breath like a cold sip of soda
While I'm bankin' down these back streets, thanks for lookin' over
Damn sure nice to know ya, fuck a four leaf clover
And thanks for this range rover
We gets down with this underground gangsta shit
Politians and parents, always havin' a fit
Everybody wanna know "who you with?" "where you from?"
Why you lookin' at me dumb?
Here's a bullet cause you number one
Nobody knows, the fate of a platinum rap star (nobody knows)
We gotta wait until tommorow
(yeah yeah)
And I'm a nigga like you (yeah yeah)
You know I got the bar

Can I get 24 more hours (can I get get)
Without dealin' with these killers and these cowards (can I can can)
I don't wanna loose, all I wanna do is win
I fucked up today, can I try it again?
Put the whoop on 'em (look to Allah)
Put the whoop on 'em (pray to your God)
Put the whoop on 'em (I look to Allah)
Put the whoop on 'em (pray to your God)
Mister prosperity, these niggas wanna bury me
Your bitch wanna marry me
Rollin' more than a cherokee
Don't, I drive what I want, and what I ain't drivin' I don't want
Let it be known (let it be known)
Permits hit the conk in the reagal
But weez legal niggas dollars got bald eagles nigga
You can't undermine Mister Grime
You rappin' 'bout the same shit I rapped about in '89
Tryin' to be the new find (never), but rap's complex
They love you one minute and they hate you the next
Push my lex thru the california sunshine
Look back on my life and say "damn I've done fine"
(damn) (I've done fine)
Mister Ice Cube, I'm always on the grind
(always, always)
The Don Mega Mega Don, Don Mega Mega Don

Can I get 24 more hours (can I get get)
Without dealin' with these killers and these cowards (can I can can)
I don't wanna lose, all I wanna do is win
I fucked up today, can I try it again?
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (everybody)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (Keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta y'all, Keep it gangsta (all my life)
I know we can make it, I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
I know we can make it, I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
I know we can make it, I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
I know we can make it, I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
And we can work it out, we goan work it out
My niggas work it out, help us work it out1Embed
