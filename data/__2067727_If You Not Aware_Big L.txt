8 ContributorsIf You Not Aware LyricsEy yo, what's up this is Big L, know what I'm sayin'
Calling to see how that joint, know what I'm sayin', came out
Hey yo fellas... Keep our eye open... watch out
Cause females be playing a whole lot of games like these
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
I know this lady by the name of Katie
If you broke, she's shady
You got cash? She's ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death, well dressed
In Chanel, Guess, nothing less
Body got more curves than an S
I smoke her boots like Sess
And I confess the sex was the best (yes)
Within a week she had keys to my res
And then later my man Squeezer gave her gees to invest
Then one day I overheard her talking to friends
Saying how she didn't like me, all she want is the ends
Yo honey was sheisty
Had me thinking she was wifey, tricking ridiculous
Given her dues that was icey
I said it's over
And what I gave you, you can have that
It wasn't even her - it was myself I was mad at
Letting that dame use me for my name and my fame
That's lame, but it's a shame how I fell for the game

Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
A year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, "Monique"
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right - it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that? I wore a Lifestyle
So watch out fellas... Watch out
You better watch out fellas
Yeah, you better watch out
Watch out fellas... You better watch out
F'real
So watch out fellas... Watch out
You better watch out fellas
Yeah, you better watch out
Watch out fellas... You better watch out
