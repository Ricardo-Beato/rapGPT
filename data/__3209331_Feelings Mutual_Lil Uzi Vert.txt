And I want you to know something very important before I even start this song
Something very important before I even start this song
I can't feel no more (Feel), no
I can't feel no more (Feel)
I told myself that I wasn't gonna pop no pills no more, no
I can't feel no more (Feel)
I can't

I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel (Yeah)
I can't feel, my body's numb
Maybe 'cause I am so hurt (Yeah)
I feel the pain in the rain (Huh?)
Tell me, what's my time and worth? (Worth)
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round, yeah (Chee)
Living life just with a curse (Huh?), before I go in a hearse (Chee)
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, ooh
Nowadays I gotta swerve you (Yeah)
I took you out of those fur boots

Back then I saw no one but you
Gave you my racks and I splurged too
Calling my phone and I curved you (Yeah)
Hope this song really don't hurt you
AP froze (What?), time so slow, yeah, hit reverse (Yeah)
Margiela all on my coat (Coat)
Got buttons, but leaving it open (Open)
So they can all see my shirt (My shirt), Rick Owens all on my shirt (My shirt)
I can't believe I made it out the dirt
That was back then when my pockets was hurtin'
Pockets so stuffed that them shits still be hurtin'
Walk with the Goyard, they say its a purse
Louis scarf, on me it look like a curtain (Yeah)
My main girl a doctor, my side girl a nurse
They keep on talkin' (Why?)
They keep on talkin' (They hatin')
All these girls up in the club, why you lookin' at Vert? (Why?)
I am not worried because when my niggas come, they gonna need a white curtain (Yeah)
Your boyfriend hate my Bad and Boujee verse
She gave me head so I called her a nerd
You might also like
I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel (Yeah)
I can't feel, my body's numb
Maybe 'cause I am so hurt (Yeah)
I feel the pain in the rain (Huh?)
Tell me, what's my time and worth? (Worth)
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round, yeah (Chee)
Living life just with a curse (Huh?), before I go in a hearse (Chee)
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, ooh
Nowadays I gotta swerve you (Yeah)
I took you out of those fur boots

I'm doing fine now (Yeah), I'm doing fine now
No, I do not need nobody now (No)
No, I do not need nobody now (No)
No, girl, don't make a sound
You don't wan' argue 'bout body count (No)
You don't wan' talk about body count
You don't wan' talk about body count
What is all this fighting all about?
It's still bodies that I'm finding out (Yeah)
It's still bodies I don't know about (Huh?)
So many bodies like a murder trial
Used to say that it's word of mouth
But I love you so you're bondin' out
But I love you so you're bondin' out (Yeah)
Grandma and Mom love you now
I'm so high, I ain't comin' down (Oh, talk to 'em)
I'm so high, I ain't comin' down
I'm so high, I ain't comin' down
Hate me then, but they love me now (Yeah, talk to 'em)
Love me then, but they hate me now
It don't matter, got the paper now
I'm so numb
I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel (Yeah)
I can't feel, my body's numb
Maybe 'cause I am so hurt (Yeah)
I feel the pain in the rain (Huh?)
Tell me, what's my time and worth? (Worth)
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round, yeah (Chee)
Living life just with a curse (Huh?), before I go in a hearse (Chee)
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, ooh
Nowadays I gotta swerve you (Yeah)
I took you out of those fur boots

I'm doing fine now (Yeah), I'm doing fine now
No, I do not need nobody now (No)
No, I do not need nobody now (No)
I'm doing fine now (Yeah), I'm doing fine now
No, I do not need nobody now (No)
No, I do not need nobody now (No)
