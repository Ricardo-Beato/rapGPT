3 ContributorsDone It Lyrics
Maine, Raw Dizzy...
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)

Steppin in this motherfucker live-r than a concert
No these ain't converse
No we cain't converse
I done went beyond berserk
I done got behind a trick
I line em up I knock em down
Stack em up I back em up
Ambulance rack em up
Body bag pack em up
White sheets bloodied up
Mean mug your buddy up
Tellin niggas buddy up
I catch em while they huddle up
They feel every slug
When the pistol go nuk uk uk
Run up in your girl crib
Now she all like but but but
I ain't tryna hit that shit
Ain't nobody innocent
I ain't wanna hear the shit
I got her with the pillow mint
I took out a bag of coke, sprinkled just a little bit
Know who you dealin with, a full hand of aces, I
Shuffle with kings, and cut off queens
And this here, is where the bullshit
Cut off, you NAHMEAN
You couldn't see me with some high beams, hey
You might also like
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Yeah

I'm a rapper but I'm not a writer
Cause I does it in my head
Only thing I write is checks
Homie I be gettin bread
Look how I tease the feds
Pink yellow blue diamonds got my PIECE
Lookin like a fuckin EAST-er egg
Mack maine tried to teach me how to count bars
I stack chains that's what keep me outta cop cars
My rap name carry weight like a fat broad
My gat game told you niggas in (? )

I'm so hood when I do it
It's the same Mack Maine I distribute the fluid
Let it rain in ya veins yea homie we could do it
And the gain in the game if I aim at your brains them bullets rippin through it
See I be labeled as the hustler's hustler
Got a few up in the trunk and got a few in the muffler
Paranoid when I stare through so paranoid I might
Motherfuckin steal you so don't be in my rear view
(Chorus: Lil Wayne)
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Yea

I'm not joking I'm tryna score a hundred of them
Things just to bust my block open
Glock pokin outta my shirt to stop motion
Seen my cousin get popped and got focused
I noticed the route that I've chosen could bring fortune
Plus sometimes it rains too hard so watch where the road is
I hear a lotta hoe shit
Gotta lil something but I'm tryna get some mo' shit
I'm a still thug it out I tell my body's so stiff
Ridin with my slugger I'm feelin kinda bogus with no motive
My main goal is to ball like Lamar Odom
And haul cocaine and use this rap shit as a token
Stress got me smoking a jo' toting a fo' fo' and
Scoping to kick somebody's no' in
Knowing I got a lil son to look after
But I'm a hustler fuck being a good rapper
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
