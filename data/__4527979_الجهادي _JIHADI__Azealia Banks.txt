14 Contributorsالجهادي (JIHADI) Lyrics
Ride the round, I mean around
How many party people trynna get wild
How many party people stepping this stomp?

Amarrao a mi cintura, bailando la noche entera
Alcanzarás la luna llevando este compás

Jihadi flew me to Tehran
Vacay, Djibouti Sands
Cop some Audemars, water my watch
Ships docked on the gulf, Obach
Papi slide inside this pussy
I bet you I’ll make you nut
Timbuktu for drinks and lunch
I sip the dates through the golden cup
This for my, this for my, this for my NuyoRicans
This for my New York bitches
Them Spanish Harlem bitches
That Gucci garter make them ballers slip they Arpels Clip-in
Y’all bitches starving, thriftin'
Y’all be retarded, strippin'
Yea nigga, yea nigga, I need some fucking money
Fuck what you, fuck what you, fuck what you talking 'bout
Fuck what you talking 'bout
You better watch your mouth
Y'all niggas outta clout
Banks bring in paper, frown and cry
Y'all niggas ain't got no clout
Y'all niggas ain't got no round
Take it for pound, for pound
I could take it pound, for pound
Paper, pack it down
Take it, ship it outta town
You might also like

Where you at?
A killa pot, pop
I-I run it up on ya
You don't want it really
Don't, don't, don't ya understand?
Don't, don't, don't ya understand?
Ha-ha, don't ya understand?
Call, call, call the
Call the, call the, call the cops
I'll kick you off ya block
8th, St. Nick or Audobon
Go, go call the cops
If I come it's a war to fight
These niggas ain't hard inside
Nigga you gonna die....1Embed
