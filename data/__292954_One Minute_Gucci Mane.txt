18 ContributorsOne Minute Lyrics
TM, gas
Guwop
I'm the CEO, CFO

I rock Giuseppe slipper shoes, got zippers
I'll fuck you out your money, need a rubber for my pistol
My check so big I'll make your breasts get bigger
My neck so wet it make her nut more quicker
And like Scarface, don't touch my sister (Don't touch her)
She a bad bitch but she still my nigga
Saran Wrap city, basement full of Big Tiggers
26s on my charger, Forgi's looking like Jigga

Gucci coming up, I'm 'bout to blow in one minute (Yeah)
Showtime, 'bout to turn it up in one minute (Burr, burr)
Brick man business, cook a deuce in two minutes (Skurr, skurr)
Eggbeater Gucci cook a deuce in one minute (Skurr, skurr)
How many bad bitches fit in one Bentley?
She's fucking me because she say you cum in one minute
She love me one minute then she hate me next minute
She 'bout to take her clothes off for me in one minute (Guwop)
Girl you gon' be late for work today
I ain't trying to fuck up your business
Eight in the morning, still in it (Still in it)
Let me get one more minute
I'm about to pull out my 'Vert today
Got a drop top Ferrari on skinnies
Spent a half a million dollars one minute
Zone Six, a nigga lose his life in one minute
You might also like
I rock Christian Loubs, rare reptiles on 'em
Five bands for some shoes with some spikes on 'em (Well damn)
My momma praying, say she want me to meet the right woman (Momma)
I'm not prejudice, I'm married to the white woman (Skurr, skurr)
I'm not a rapper turned actor, I'm a dope dealer (Dope?)
Could have been a dentist, touch a lot of throats, nigga (Huh?)
She's got high standards, date ball players (Yeah)
But she still give that pussy to them young niggas (Yup)
You a gold digging baby? I'm a gold digger (Huh)
I'd rather die rich than live like a broke nigga
She a sexy bitch, man, I can't live without her
But I swear, man, it's real hard to live with her
You see this H on my shirt stand for Hermes (Hermes)
Rich nigga, I don't wear Tommy Hilfiger (Nope)
Everybody say a prayer for the Gucci Mane
'Cause he's trying so hard not to kill niggas

Gucci coming up, I'm 'bout to blow in one minute (Yeah)
Showtime, 'bout to turn it up in one minute (Burr, burr)
Brick man business, cook a deuce in two minutes (Skurr, skurr)
Eggbeater Gucci cook a deuce in one minute (Skurr, skurr)
How many bad bitches fit in one Bentley?
She's fucking me because she say you cum in one minute
She love me one minute then she hate me next minute
She 'bout to take her clothes off for me in one minute (Guwop)
Girl you gon' be late for work today
I ain't trying to fuck up your business
Eight in the morning, still in it (Still in it)
Let me get one more minute
I'm about to pull out my 'Vert today
Got a drop top Ferrari on skinnies
Spent a half a million dollars one minute
Zone Six, a nigga lose his life in one minute4Embed
