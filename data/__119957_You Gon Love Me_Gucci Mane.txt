6 ContributorsYou Gon Love Me Lyrics
We ain’t lookin' at the price tag, fuck that
Baby if you like that, you get that
You gon' love me, you gon' love me
You gon' love me, you gon' love me
You see I got enough to get your life right
Money make you come, we gon' be fuckin' all night
You gon' love me, you gon' love me
You gon' love me, you gon' love me

I can’t lie, I’m into you
Baby what you finna do
Yeah I’m on some other shit
My hoes don’t wear no tennis shoes
I put you on the money, baby roll with me you never lose
I’ll take you to a island, fly you places you ain’t never flew
Every day’s a business move, your boyfriend tighter than a Jew
I’m richer than a average nigga, baby I wouldn’t lie to you
When I say you fine as fuck, baby girl I ain’t tryna flatter you
But your boyfriend is a rainbow and he tryin' to overshadow you
Gucci Mane'll splatter you, I’m the one she walkin' to
I’m sippin' Absolut, I change your longitude and latitude
Bitch show me some gratitude, what's up with this attitude
You mad these bitches jockin' me, they mad because I’m jockin' you
You might also like
We ain’t lookin' at the price tag, fuck that
Baby if you like that, you get that
You gon' love me, you gon' love me
You gon' love me, you gon' love me
You see I got enough to get your life right
Money make you come, we gon' be fuckin' all night
You gon' love me, you gon' love me
You gon' love me, you gon' love me

I got that Rolex, morn' sex, big dick
I got that Rolex, morn' sex, big dick
I got that Rolex, morn' sex, big dick
I got that Rolex, morn' sex, big dick
Handle mines in the bedroom, got you singin' somethin' like it’s iTunes
Then hit the rest of this bottle, get fucked up and I got you
We gon' tell them all up, baller call up your job tell em' you out
Soon as you hit the door they gon' Kodak, expensive shit and they know that
I keep you fly like you on that
Louie always in contact
Some say I spoil you, but I can afford to
We gettin' money, we gettin' money
1017 and it’s time to
Turn up, roll up, burn up 'til I’m so stuck
Poppin' bands, I got Rollies
Fuckin' nigga so loaded
It’s whatever you like yeah, it’s whatever you like
Just know you shop 'til you drop, and we gonna fucking tonight
We ain’t lookin' at the price tag, fuck that
Baby if you like that, you get that
You gon' love me, you gon' love me
You gon' love me, you gon' love me
You see I got enough to get your life right
Money make you come, we gon' be fuckin' all night
You gon' love me, you gon' love me
You gon' love me, you gon' love me1Embed
