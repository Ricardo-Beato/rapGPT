2 ContributorsCatch A Bullet Lyrics
Let it run, yeah, Joyner...

'Cause every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if I'll feel it
'Cause every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if ...

Life's passing me by, people just staring at me
Letting down a window, smoking my new kush
And all I ever wanted was to make my parents happy
The good American dream, life is too short
And fairy tales don't exist, you don't get shit from Santa
Pockets emppty to press, sleeping in different trailers
I'm dreaming condos in Vegas, maybe on in Atlanta
Pro'lly cop me a mansion out on a different planet
Blindfolded and bounded I guess I couldn't see
Watching niggas who made thinking: "That could be me"
Maybe I could be famous, maybe I could be free
Maybe I should just take the pain that you took from me
Remember, family first, though we were unstable
Who would've known that my could be my fucking angel?
I wouldn't made it this far if it wasn't for your halo
I promise soon as I make it we all gon' be fuego

And every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if I'll feel it
'Cause every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if I'll feel it
'Cause every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if I'll feel it
'Cause every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if...
Just a youngin with 
No direction I found myself in the face of fear
If I close my eyes maybe I disappear
My subconscious was spinning feelings but interfering
I told God: "If you take this pain then I'll stop sinning"
I got some brothers, we conversated for 5 minutes
We barely know each other, I think it's the time difference
Sometimes I blame myself when I spend no time with 'em
Never been a gangster, I'm cut from a different cloth
Don't think I'm weak 'cus you'll get to see if you piss me off
Turn off the TV and brain-repeating and you niggas lost
Your whole generation is built on some shit you saw
Haven't spoken a while, but ain't no feelings lost
And to date, you're my father, we've been through shit before
Because it wasn't so easy cutting a nigga off
I'm tired of facing these bridges we never get across

But every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if I'll feel it
'Cause every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if I'll feel it
But every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if I'll feel it
'Cause every single night
I stare at the ceiling
If I can take the pain
Then I could take a bullet
If I just pulled the trigger
Then that would take the feeling
I wonder if it hurts
I wonder if I'll feel itEmbed
