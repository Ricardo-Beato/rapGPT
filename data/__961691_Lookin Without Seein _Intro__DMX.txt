9 ContributorsLookin Without Seein (Intro) LyricsGrrrrrrrr...
Yoooooooo
Y'all don't know what I've been goin through
Y'all don't know what I'm about to do, to you
Cause you're lookin without seein
Yoooooooo
Y'all don't know how hard I'm gonna fight
Y'all don't know if I am wrong or right
Or what I might do tonight
Cause you're lookin without seein
Yoooooooo (hell naw!)
Y'all don't know if I'ma change this time (I'ma change!)
Y'all don't know about the frame of mind (the frame of mind!)
That I just might BE IN!
You're lookin without seein (seein)
Might as well be blindYou might also like2Embed
