8 ContributorsAll For You Lyrics
I wrote this song to tell you how I feel
Oh, the feeling is too real
Don't give a fuck 'bout your apparel I wanna peel
Our first date was cool 'cause you promised a sequel
It's all for you, it's all for you-ou-ou, all for you
It's all for you-ou-ou-ou
Girl, there's gotta be another way
I'm runnin' outta time, to tell you my favorite line
I need to know if you would like to be-e mine
Girl, it's gotta be another way, oh-oh-ohh
And girl, I cannot wait another day

I wrote this song for you, I wrote it for you-ou-ou, all for you
I promise I do-o-o
I do need you to come and stay, oh-oh-ohh

I wrote this song to tell you how I feel
Oh, the feeling is too real
Don't give a fuck 'bout your apparel I wanna peel
Our first date was cool 'cause you promised a sequel
It's all for you, it's all for you-ou-ou, all for you
It's all for you-ou-ou-ou
Girl, there's gotta be another way
I'm runnin' outta time, to tell you my favorite line
I need to know if you would like to be-e mine
Girl, it's gotta be another way, oh-oh-ohh
And girl, I cannot wait another dayYou might also like1Embed
