5 ContributorsWhat We Do (For Love) Lyrics
Kid 1 - I'm tired
Kid 2 - Me too
Kid 1 - Uncle Ricky
SR - Hmmm?
Kid 1 - Could you tell us a bedtime story, like you used to?
SR - Look, don't y'all think y'all too old for that now?
Kids - No
SR - Listen, I got an adult question for y'all since y'all
Like...11 now. Y'all ever get horny?
Kid 1 - Uncle Ricky!
SR - Now I don't mean to sound perverted, but do you ever
Have like sexual urges?
Kids - No!
SR - No? Well you will, so sit your behind down and listen to
Uncle Ricky...and De La...tell y'all a grown up story
Kids - Okay

I remember when Mama spoke of the birds and
The east side kept me off the curb and
Betsy Ross was sufferin from the scaredy cat
Till my man Ricky brought the remedy for that

I massage your mink, coat
Then part your leg's rope
And stroke so hard you'll start to smell smoke
You might also like
Ain't gotta drug problem but a love problem
But then again that may be one in the same
I claim possession
Pull the girl among the apes like Charlie Heston
Ride off on the horse and show no remorse

She look niiice
Honey oriental, brown eyes
Want friiiies?
Chicken, vegetable, fried rice
And I'm tryin to  you to go
Fast subtraction, grab some
"Oh don't stop nasty black man"

Man that action had me coughin up cars, keys, and cash
Just to sniff a fat rabbit I would give my very last

(When nature calls)
You know them boys will come runnin
(When nature calls)
You know them girls don't mind comin
(When nature calls)
You know them boys will come runnin
(When nature calls)
You know them girls don't mind comin
Just to get it started, for startin something
Is what we do to get some lovin
What we do to get some lovin
This what we do for love (do for love)
This what we do for love (for love)
This what we do for love
You ain't lyin
I 9-5 it, more like 12-12
Can't get the thought off (sex)
From off my mental shelf

I'm like Bruce Lee
Beatin up the cootchie profusely
My tomboy chicks that act a little too butchy
Recieve this (uh)
When my semen ceases
They'll be screamin out, "We love bein the female species"

Hello?
Veronica, it's Dove
Uh, I think you got the wrong number
What?
Veronica, your baby's crying
Yo, chill
Baby?
Whatever yo, later

For the past two summers I been sizin up Veronica
Southern belle, I heard she blow notes like a harmonica
Yarmulkes couldn't satisfy her spendin fetishes
She was all about gettin the head like she was lettuces
Yah, them types be actin like they ain't sleazy

Like this uptown chick playin opposite of easy
Delighted, the honey fly difficult, couldn't knife it
Tiiight
Seen the imprint on honey's private
Now she's love sick
Ruler Rick scoress agaaaaain

Sex present itself like trophies I'm out to win
And it's easier to claim through the fame I've obtained
Her mommy was a liar, she's so ashamed


Well, I got this rude boy Jamaican honey at the rest home
Complete with yellow hair and Cinderella dress on
"What happen"
Been around, stuck her till she poppin bout
"Hey take your blood clot finger off me bottom"
Anyway, another dime I met one time
I'm kiiind, chick in the world, butt fine
And her, structure pumpin, told her
Gotcha mumblin bout
"Slow down, what you tryin to rupture somethin?"

I don't bug out, I chill
Never copped a feel
But these pretty ass girls come and flaunt in the grill
Big ass eyes, with the matchin big ass thighs
Asked her if she spare a moment to exchange some lies
"But you got a girlfriend"

Yah trick, so do you
And I heard there's no preference in what gender ya do

So stop playin so squeaky clean
And let the dirty side see me later
So we can play 'let's wake the neighbours'

So stuck on the love you rearranging behaviors
Second episode, and you returnin oral favors
Buyin up groceries
Searchin for hosiery
Holdin hands publicly
And now you supposed to be
Mr. and Mrs. huh, lovin and kisses huh?
But while you away is when the milkman'll visit her
Dear to the heart, we dearly depart the fallen
So skip the games ma, I stay tuned to the calling
