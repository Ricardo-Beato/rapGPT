When intensity is risen women end up having children
By niggas who didn't love them in the first place
Gave it up on the first date, now she fucked in the worst way
(We don't love these hoes)
When intensity is risen women end up having children
By niggas who didn't love them in the first place
Gave it up on the first date, now she fucked in the worst way
(We don't love these hoes)

She was cute, was only tryna fuck her though
But I broke the rules, so now I gotta come for hoes
Told her from the jump, that I wasn't into loving hoes
And she wouldn't be any different from my other hoes
Since a young nigga, I knew she would become a hoe
Eighth grade year, sucking dick behind the bungalows
Daddy had a bunch of dough, paid her no attention
Only paid the whole tuition, gave her extra cash for spending
She was fiending for the type of life she wasn't given
Hanging with them shady niggas in and outta prison
Thought a baby was the perfect way to keep his interest
Soon aborted when she saw he wasn't fucking with it
Cold nigga, gut checked, but she rolled wit it
Packed up, left home, took her soul wit him
Now it seems that she's only good for one thing
The one thing that we all need
Eyes dry, but her heart bleed

When intensity is risen women end up having children
By niggas who didn't love them in the first place
Gave it up on the first date, now she fucked in the worst way
(We don't love these hoes)
When intensity is risen women end up having children
By niggas who didn't love them in the first place
Gave it up on the first date, now she fucked in the worst way
(We don't love these hoes)

We don't love 'em
We don't love 'em
Nah, we don't love 'em
Fuck that hoe
We don't love 'em
She gotta go
We don't love 'em
Get your bags bitch
Get, huh
Get your bags bitch
In that motherfuckin' wig, hoe
Yeah, bitch
Ya hear, they call you Kobe
Bitch, they call you Kobe, yeah
You got the two for the four
Pass the rock, rock!
Oh, she your sister nigga?
Aaaaahhhhh nigga3Embed
