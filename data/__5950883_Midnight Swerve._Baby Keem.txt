4 ContributorsMidnight Swerve. Lyrics
I spent midnight swerve
I still swerve my car
I still deny first
I still did it like first
I still midnight swerve
I still get my swerve
I still swing my swerve
I still with the bird
I spent midnight swerve
I still swerve my car
I still deny first
I still did it like first
I still midnight swerve
I still get my swerve
I still swing my swerve
I still with the bird

All of these bitches are bad, I'm no virgin, uh
Some of my boos up in my ghost
They already sexy the way that I'm swerving off
Perfect, uh
She say that she want a Birkin, uh
She do not really deserve shit, uh
She gotta show me she worth it, ayy
She gotta show me, said she gotta show me
All of that bullshit, I throw that shit in the air, ayy
The way that I move it ain't fair, ayy
I stay away from the fuck shit
Enough of the fuck shit
I gotta function, ayy
Niggas keep wolfing and they gon' get hunted
My momma told me shoot straight when I'm gunning
I like they heart when they really be running
I can't relate, bitch I don't have a conscience
