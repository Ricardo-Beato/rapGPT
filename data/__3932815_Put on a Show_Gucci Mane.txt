Holiday Season (Drumma Boy)
Yo, Faith, yo, Chim, know-it-all
Y'all lookin' good, man (Holiday Season, fuck)
Y'all Commission niggas think y'all run shit, huh?
Y'all niggas think y'all run shit, don't you?

Smokin' green and sippin' lean, sellin' pills and whippin' dream
Brandon took a drink and now I think I'm 'bout to green (Holiday Season, shrimps)
Quarter pound of more ring, hundred million for the team
Got two bitches, they Brazilian and there's only one of me
And I got 'em rollin' weed, all I hang around is G's
You with me, a bunch of D's, I do shows all overseas (Real trap shit)
Got about me stupid bad and some points I'll have to keep
And she smoke weed like I smoke weed, we gon' need like half a P
Selling bricks for 35, if I know you, charge you 3
And if you find a seat off in my pack, then you can get it free
Like the last nigga alive, it's so lonely at the T
What's the T? That's the T-O-P, I'll take you on a seat

I'm 'bout to bring them lights out and put on a show
I don't even need a mic to put on a show
I'm 'bout to bring that ice out and put on a show
Why'd you bring them lights out? I put on a show
Show, show, I put on a show
Show, show, I put on a show
Show, show, I put on a show
I don't even need a mic to put on a show

Money like a king, better yet, Yao Ming
Stupid guala in my pockets, britches bustin' at the seams
Yeah, I rock a lot of bling, yeah my 'Rari eatin' wings
And I know it's super clean, but I put rims on everything
Ten gray bridgin' with the cream, limpin' in a stress fur
Sippin', screamin' Pippen, pass the blunt back to my chaufeur
Gucci, I'm a trap star, I was in a rap war
From the trap, that's where I got this AK with the shoulder strap
TEC-9 with the coolie coolie, make your enemies amusing
Pour some Hennessey, 'cause his strap, he didn't get a chance to use it
On my birthday, got an Uzi, on Christmas, I bought a doolie
Valentine's, I fucked ten groupies, Gucci Mane is super stupid

I'm 'bout to bring them lights out and put on a show
I don't even need a mic to put on a show
I'm 'bout to bring that ice out and put on a show
Why'd you bring them lights out? I put on a show
Show, show, I put on a show
Show, show, I put on a show
Show, show, I put on a show
I don't even need a mic to put on a show1Embed
