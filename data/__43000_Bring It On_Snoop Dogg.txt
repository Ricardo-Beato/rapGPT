12 ContributorsBring It On Lyrics
In these times, of hate and pain
We need a remedy, to help us through the rain
Can't you see, I'm straight OG (OG)
Fuck you niggas, think you can fuck with me

Oh c'mon
Make a pimp wanna jump back
Bitch, and fuck that
Shit, I'm qualified to knock a hoe no matter where ever I go
Excuse me partner, this the pimpin' let a pimpin pimpin' let you go
Break the bitch you say "I will"
Tryin to break the bitch but you saying "I will"
Then nigga, shit; since you put it like that
I'm about to lace em right now nigga
And take them straight to the track (track)
I've never let a bitch pimp me
Trying to tell me what to do but I'mma stay O.G
Fresh out the pen only 32 days (32 days)
And I added and subtracted in a multiplied way
Now switch worlds
Why did the little girl walk around with a gold fish in her pocket
So she could smell like the big girls
And check the one with the fast mouth
Just get your money if you have to knock her motherfucking ass out
You might also like
I don't care whatcha do
Long you don't fuck with mine (C'mon sing it ya'll)
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time

Old "Blue Eyes," Dogg Sinatra
Make a nigga disappear like Jimmy Hoffa (Where is he?)
The Glock cocker, hoe hopper, show stopper
Watch your mouth, watch your mouth
I'll put you in a brick in a building
And separate you from your children (Daddy)
I stay G'd up
All the G's from my set ain't never PC'dup (hahaha)
If you hit the main line
You gonna get stompped
Paying motherfuckers off use a sucka duck
Me and my niggas go hard in the paint
Puttin paint where it ain't, makin bitch niggas faint
It's a clear blue sky here on the Eastside (Eastside)
Throw your set up and wave it from (Rolling) side to c-side
I'm talking big shit, holdin my dick
Banging on you cuz, nigga this crip

I got so many tricks up my sleeve (Oh y'all ain't knowin')
For you hoes to disbelieve (Hoes in amazement)
You wanna bang let's bring it on (Oh Oh)
We's about thousand niggas strong
I don't care whatcha you do (I don't care what the fuck whatcha do)
Long as you don't fuck with mine (As long you don't fuck with mine)
You think you can't be touched (Uhhhhh)
Niggas disappear all the time
No, I don't love you bitch, you a hoe, I never will (Never will)
Can't tell you my feelings cause the pimpin' don't feel
Bitch, matter fact be gone
Fuck around and have your Momma saying "Baby, he wrong!"
Talking about he a real pimp
Bitch, is gumbo laced with the proper crop of jumbo shrimp
Stepped out the pen with my hoe, got it crackin with my hoe
Steady mackin with my hoe, now I'm stackin with my hoe

I pop a bottle of Mo
About to model a hoe
I'm working them, serving 'em and breaking 'em off (You know)
Did the weed, man get here
Taking too long
But when he get here dogg
I'm taking a zone (Give it up nigga)
Niggas know how D-O-double G "doo's it"
Known for making that crip hop music, don't abuse it
Just ride to the rhythm of a pimp ass, upper class, cold motherfucker

(Humming) Long you don't fuck with mine
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time (Humming)Embed
