Down to wet your set up
Pussies better vest up
Mustard colored stones, but my donk look like ketchup
Mustard colored stones, but my donk look like ketchup
Mustard colored stones, but my donk look like ketchup
Mustard colored stones, but my donk look like ketchup

I take my hoes to islands, so they call me Gilligan
A gangster but a gentleman, seldom wearing Timberlands
Chameleon, Brazilian, Amphibian, Reptilians
Order fettuccine cuz I'm dining with Sicilians
Lobster tail, shrimp scampi, and calamari
Jumping out Ferraris with the ...(?)
I'm selling birds dirty, plus the mids sell good
$1500 so your girl can say I smell good
Scented candles, incense burning when I take a shower
I'd rather rot in prison before I go out like a coward
I top 3 G's, he make $10 an hour
I ain't hatin' shawty, but know you can do without him
Manicured nails, I keep pedicured feet
Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant couldn't swag like me
Bet you Tiger Woods can't pull the hoes that I've pulled
Give me two blue dolphins and a couple Red Bulls
You might also like
