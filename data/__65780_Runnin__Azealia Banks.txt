25 ContributorsRunninâ€™ Lyrics
I was born ready
I'm working your man up in that circuit
Bitch, I planned to look that perfect
Cheap little brand, but a bitch that certain
Clip that gan-ja, split that curtain
He wanna slam, wanna whip that serpent
He wanna wam, wanna get it in, wanna get it up
Wanna split it and wanna lick it up
But your nigga been listenin' to rough's
Now your niggas on the internet enough
So he think he know the Dickens and the -what
Damn, motherfucker, you be sniffing in the butt
You a fan, little nigga, you be living for the cunt
You be handful of scrilla while I'm jiggling the buns
I can stop moving still jiggling the buns
I can pop in the middle with a did up in the bun
Let it drop for ya nigga when he get up in the front
I could spot which niggas got the get-up's and the funds
But I'm not these bitches with the dick up on their tongues
Not these bitches all these niggas been among
So it's not with me with 'em when your nigga in the crumbs
And it's not me chilling with your nigga in the slums
Don't ru-run with 'em, never with 'em in the sun, huh
I'ma sp-spend this niggas sp-spinach
I tell him to eat the couchie then hit this nigga for lyrics
He know that I got that juicy
That juicy booty, that fruity, that fruity tootie
That natural beauty, he rich; he poppin' that bougie
I got that Glock and that uzi, that ch-ch-chop and the tuni
I hit your block with a goonie and put a dot on ya nugget
Split ya top and ya stomach, hit ya pops and ya cousin
Miss the shot if he runnin' and get as hot as he want it
You might also like
You, you don't want
I know you, you don't wanna fuck with me
You on one, I'm on two
Bang or get banged on, you choose
These niggas runnin, these niggas runnin
They stay pumpin' that game but these niggas frontin'
All beige up on this stage, oh, these niggas stuntin'
So these bitches comin', now these niggas runnin
Runnin', niggas runnin', niggas runnin'
These niggas runnin', these niggas runnin'
These niggas runnin', these niggas runnin'
These niggas runnin', these niggas runnin'

I'm in the creme Coupe seats, color: gingerbread
You know I got that bitch covered like a ninja head
You say you 'bout to get buttered, 'bout to spend your bread
So you 'bout to get smothered with that infrared
Bet that strawberry banana f-fanna click never jam-a
I'm finna damage your armor and plan to blam at your grandma
These niggas totin' they hammer but really open punanas
I smell these niggas, they pussy they pussy they needa douche it
Don't let him up in the cushion 'less he come with the right dues
If not, then bitch you better fuck you a white dude
If not, then bitch he better come with the right dick
If not, then bitch you probably know that he like dick
Fuck feeding these niggas, you bitches breeding these niggas?
I get the beats from these niggas then hit the streets with these niggas
Y'all tryna sleep with these niggas, I'm tryna eat with these niggas
I read these niggas the script and get sick of seeing these niggas now
You, you don't want
I know you, you don't wanna fuck with me
You on one, I'm on two
Bang or get banged on, you choose
These niggas runnin, these niggas runnin
They stay pumpin' that game but these niggas frontin'
All beige up on this stage, oh, these niggas stuntin'
So these bitches comin', now these niggas runnin
Runnin', niggas runnin', niggas runnin'
These niggas runnin', these niggas runnin'
These niggas runnin', these niggas runnin'
These niggas runnin', these niggas runnin'6Embed
