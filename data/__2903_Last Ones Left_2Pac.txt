Nigga, westside!
Westside in this motherfucka
Westside in this mothafucka right here
Westside in this mothafucka
Westside in this mothafucka right here
Westside in this mothafucka
Westside in this mothafucka right here
Westside in this mothafucka

Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin'
Packed in a Suburban, screaming, "Outlaw!", runnin' on the curb
They never try me, 'cause right behind me yo' killer team
I get the word, cut the head off a nigga, like a guillotine
This Hennessy will keep me calm though
Sittin' in the back of the club, tradin' convo
Livin' like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga, watch me with the chrome 9
All the time drinkin' champagne
Walk through the crowd, let the tramps hang
Niggas player hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doin' 80, down a one-way
Stuck in the trunk, caught in gunplay
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Gettin' high, wonder why we gotta die smokin'
My alibi; a victory
Victim of a rhyme in a mark for death
Spendin' my nights like it's the last one left
I'm an outlaw
You might also like
Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher, I'm the last one left
Tell me, am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher, guess I'm the last one left

I got my back against the wall, gat chillin' by my balls
Prior to war is a rider nigga that's only 5'6" tall
Napoleon only knows on we Outlaws, fuck fear
Better strap down to the fullest, ‘cause we outchea
Thug passion all up in me, feelin' like I took some Henny
It ain't easy, I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of two pennies
What we got is rep, nigga, wanna pull their gat, nigga
He’s only got my side 'cause they think 'Pac died, nigga
Blast niggas with our TEC's, takin' showers in our vest
'Pac, come and catch weight, nigga, we the last ones left

Indeed I'm knowin' it's own inside my own dome
Fresh outta jail, it was hell, but I'm finally home
Lookin' for niggas that was woofin' that shit, when I was locked back
Hands on the pump, make 'em jump when it cocked back
Fuck 'em all, they bitches inside a world of weak
Bitch niggas be afraid to speak, we the last ones left
Tell me, am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher, like I'm the last one left
Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher, last one left
Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher, I'm last one left

I eat and sleep the worst shit, cursed from birth
Me and my team super supreme, puttin' in work
I'm passed out, drunk as a fuck, 'til it hurt
And I call Earl screaming, "Fuck the world!"
I got a bitch on the side wanna be my wife
And wifey beefin', wanna know if she gon' see me tonight
And I know it ain't right, but it's the life I got
And that's until I see Yak, and that's until I see 'Pac
Young know I lost a troll, somebody owed me down
And if the world was a girl, I'd stick my dick in the ground
Fuck the world!
