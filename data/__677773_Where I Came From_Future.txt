(Zaytoven)

I'm true to the game, and fuck all that playin'
You see where I came from
Got that dope in my hand, they try jump out the van
You know where I came from
That thirty round clip, fuck all that playin'
You know where I came from
Chevy Impalas and Regals, man
Twenty-three bricks in the speaker, man
You know where I came from

Them feds picked a couple niggas up
Now we duckin' the feds, nigga (Yeah)
It's hard to come by some Actavis
Now we drinkin' that red, nigga (Yeah)
Cocaine all on my scale now (Scale now)
Molly, that Miley, my scale now (That Miley Cyrus)
I been gettin' at it since juvenile (Gettin' it)
I used to trap out my grandma's house (Yeah)
We get it poppin' on any corner (Any corner)
Pourin' that lean like it's straight Corona (Straight Corona)
I got that shit that the gutter feel (I do)
I got them pills make your brother kill (Future)
I done fucked 'round and took two of them (Two of them)
Gotta go serve at the house where your loved one at
I served my auntie that water (I swear)
Shit, I served my mama some water

I'm true to the game, and fuck all that playin'
You see where I came from
Got that dope in my hand, they try jump out the van
You know where I came from
That thirty round clip, fuck all that playin'
You know where I came from
Chevy Impalas and Regals, man
Twenty-three bricks in the speaker, man
You know where I came from

Cutlass, that Regal, the Carlo (Carlo)
That 'Rari, that Benz, Diablo (Diablo)
I pull up in a Diablo (Diablo)
Money, that mucho de nacho (De nacho)
Blood shot, eyes red (Red)
A couple guns, Iraq (Iraq)
Got this pretty young thing that'll bang on the south side of Chiraq
Got a pint of syrup and I pass it (Pour up)
I was re'ing up with that plastic
Hundred round drum, Bin Laden (Bin Laden)
Nigga ridin' 'round in these Ballys (Ballys)
I fuck 'em up and I jugg in 'em (Jugg in 'em)
I fuck with these niggas to a minimum (To a minimum)
I walk in a check and I talk a check (I talk a check)
I'm true to the game, and fuck all that playin'
You see where I came from
Got that dope in my hand, they try jump out the van
You know where I came from
That thirty round clip, fuck all that playin'
You know where I came from
Chevy Impalas and Regals, man
Twenty-three bricks in the speaker, man
You know where I came from
I'm true to the game, and fuck all that playin'
You see where I came from
Got that dope in my hand, they try jump out the van
You know where I came from
That thirty round clip, fuck all that playin'
