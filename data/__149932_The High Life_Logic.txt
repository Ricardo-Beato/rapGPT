61 ContributorsThe High Life Lyrics
Seem like my whole life changed in the last year
At parties with legends like "What the fuck I’m doing here?"
Waiting for someone to say "What the fuck you doing here?"
Until I realized I belonged and had nothing to fear
Who would’ve thought I would mingle with celebrity singles
In a room full of Grammy winners discussing they singles
Some people love you, some people hate you
Some people need you, some people act like they know you
But they can’t even read you
The effort I put into music is still the same amount
'Cause ain't a damn thing changed except the bank account
I remember the day I got my advance money
I’m talkin' so much bread, this shit'll make you dance money
What's the first thing I did?
Got my team out the way and then I got myself a crib
My boy Lenny gave me a place to stay for a year
Put food in my stomach, I had nothing to fear
And once that 365 was up, I told him to quit his job
And gave him a new career
So many rappers on that stupid superstar shit
But I plan to eat with the people I starved with
I’ve made money, I’ve lost money, I’ve spent money
I've slept outside due to lack of the rent money
I’ve been in love, been happy, been through a lot of pain
'Cause what the fuck is sunshine without a little rain?
And love is like leaves in the fall
'Cause some people get scared and leave when you fall
Speaking of which, I met this girl the other day
The type of girl that make the pain fade away
And I have a feeling she gon' be my next
'Cause she make me forget all about my ex
I’m talking something that’s deeper than just sex
But I don’t want her to be the third letter in the word next
Old soul in the sea of love
I’m just not current, none of the above
And man, fuck all that depressing shit
Let’s get this money and fuck these bitches
You know what I’m sayin?
Sike, nah, all of y'all just know that I’m playin'
'Cause all the money you possess ain’t what makes you a man
Big shot, tough guy, blow 100 grand
But you still in the same place, damn
But man, the world is so fascinating
Ambition got these girls gravitating
And honestly, it strokes the ego
But beautiful women ain’t good for nothing
Except procrastinating
I got a show in Paris coming up
Followed by London, I'ma tear it up
So many people just don’t care enough
Analyzing faces in the crowd staring up
What's the difference between me and them?
How come I ain’t in the crowd at they show seeing them
What that guy see in me that he ain’t see in him?
'Cause honestly I see no difference between me and him
We all people, all equal, we all the same?
Lookin' for control tryna play the game
We all got issues, just different magazines
We all sleep but have different dreams
However, once you’re awake and your life ain’t what it seems
And that’s the reason I’m living within my own dream
Hell yeah, fuck 'em all like I’m runnin' from the law
Haters probably think they phase me, I’m like no, not at all
I’m too high up, now to fall
Like a sphere, bitch I ball
Never asked me where my team at
'Cause you know I brought em all
And if you’re looking for a problem then we can get it solved
I just kill them with kindness, keep it peace and it dissolve
You got bitches, I got Bobby Soxer girls that be ride or die
A shawty on another level, let me catch a vibe
Super bad girl, IQ is in the sky
She graduated cum laude, your bitch went to DeVry
God damn, oh girl, she a go getta
At the party takin' shots like a Beretta
Doing anything and everything to feel better
And now she in the crib getting high like a falsetto
How you feeling, I be yelling
"Why these motherfuckers grilling?"
And she give me life ‘cause I’m making a killing
Bring it down, do it slow, show me how that really go
Girl I’m new in town, I don’t really know
They be like, when you gonna tell me that you love me?
I be like, "Bitch I gotta hit the studio, ho"
Now she got me on the crib, talkin' that she wanna do it
Condom on the dresser looking at me like ain't nothing to it
Thinking should I do it though, I don't even know the ho
I don't even know the ho, I don't even know the ho

Sayin', "Ohh, mama I made it"
Ohh, mama, I made it
You cannot tell me no
But the young boy made a way
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I said, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh20Embed
