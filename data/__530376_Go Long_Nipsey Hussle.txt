10 ContributorsGo Long Lyrics
If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
'Cause you don't want me to put my
I said you don't want me to put my slap hand on yo' dome
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long

Look, I'm forever the flyest, my revenue rise
My hustle is strivin', don't have to take no consignment
I'm drivin' a 6, got a selection of kicks
And it's not your day if I'm selecting your bitch
I got a watch on my wrist, it's made by the Swiss
Worn by the rich, with that shit you can sniff
Got not time to play 'round, it's way too much in my mix
I'm talking dollars and cents, making dollars and cents
I made an honest attempt, take my dollars and split
Amongst Impalas and Crips, I'm talking violence and shit
Without no sign it exists, I made my mind, this is it
I weighed the risk and the reward and put my grind to this shit
And now the money, the power, I'm entitled to this
And all the hatin' and debatin', that's the cowardice shit
Plymouth Rock, you ain't believe 'til I arrived at this shit
So hatin' nigga, go long or you can die where you sit, uh

If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
'Cause you don't want me to put my
I said you don't want me to put my slap hand on yo' dome
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long

Who your OG is, cuz? His name DJ Screw
Nowadays that's my nigga DJ Eric
If it ain't him I see like, "DJ who?"
I got a bitch looking so fast, every time I do it people be mad
They want a replay, fool
I ain't even in the vehicle im still road raging
Hand cannon knocking vehicles off the freeway, too
Yeah, I'm fuckin' with my nigga Nipsey
We fucked up way past a little tipsy
Goddamnit, that's the second goddamn thing that this week I'm waiting on
Triple-A to come and get me
FN on a daily basis unless I'm at war
And if am I'm rolling with the fifty
Ain't talking bout a pistol either, bitch, millimeters, bitch
And if you ain't behind it then you don't wanna see this shit
Put your glasses on
Yeah, officer I had it but I passed it on
I'm in and out the airport, no cash involved
White bitch, big tits, no ass at all, just a bag of raw
I gotta keep it on the low
If a bitch nigga see it he gon' raise up his hands and tell it
But all the real niggas see it, and they ain't seen shit
Bet I can check a hundred thousand by breakfast
It's the same old Thugger, still the same Hustler
Still going up, I ain't never going down
I do this rap shit just to rep for my town
Got a crib out in Cali in the hills blowing pounds
Minding my business, me and my bitches, roll so low whenever I go get it
It be your best friends have you in the pen snitchin'
Put money in his pocket, nigga still turn witness
My circle small, I don't fuck with y'all
You say you won the trial, I heard you told it all
Asking me for work, bitch nigga, hell nah
You 5K1, I done seen your file
You niggas fake, you niggas snakes
When you see my face don't touch your brakes
I ain't tryin' to end up in that place
Get the fuck on, go long, that'a way

If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
'Cause you don't want me to put my
I said you don't want me to put my slap hand on yo' dome
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long7Embed
