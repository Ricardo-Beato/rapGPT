8 ContributorsStand Down Lyrics
Bitch, I ball hard like Cailou
Ballin' so hard might foul you
Money in my pocket, might buy you
Start gettin' cash, they love you
Life that I live not for you
You fuck niggas in trouble
What comes with bein' loyal
That mothafuckin' royal
I'm a real fuckin' nigga, I don't care now
All that tough, talk get your man slammed
Swear I be feelin' like Bank Roll
Around these fuck niggas, can't stay 'round
Slide on your block, that's a man down
Fuck around and get your fuckin' mans drowned
Woo-Woo, that's that ambulance sound
I got the shooters ridin' with me nigga, stand down

These lame ass niggas can't stand me
These niggas can't feed of my energy
They ain't puttin' shit under my Christmas tree
Make the work stretch out like a centipede
Put a couple tracks down for my mini-mes
More bulls like I'm about to hit a Fendi
Get low 'cause I'm 'bout to hit a enemy
You turned 'cause you about to hit a penalty
I got the eyes of a lion, don't I?
I am the shit I am the fliest, aren't I?
See what I like, I'ma buy it, aren't I?
I'm part of them breeds that are dyin', aren't I?
I don't wanna drive, bitch, I wanna fly
Blue cheese on me, .40 on the side
You not down to ride
Niggas gonna die
This a homicide
We ain't gonna lie
Bankroll on me like P.J
Hoppin' on a PJ
Hunnid band bands for a speed race
Baby, I'm sorry for the delay
I was on the phone buyin' hundred band shit off eBay
You know when we on tour
We gotta make a stop for some snacks
On the mothafuckin' speedway
You know when we on tour
We gotta make a stop for some snacks
On the mothafuckin' speedway
You might also like
Bitch, I ball hard like Cailou
Ballin' so hard might foul you
Money in my pocket, might buy you
Start gettin' cash, they love you
Life that I live not for you
You fuck niggas in trouble
What comes with bein' loyal
That mothafuckin' royal
I'm a real fuckin' nigga, I don't care now
All that tough, talk get your man slammed
Swear I be feelin' like Bank Roll
Around these fuck niggas, can't stay 'round
Slide on your block, that's a man down
Fuck around and get your fuckin' mans drowned
Woo-Woo, that's that ambulance sound
I got the shooters ridin' with me nigga, stand down

You and your motherfuckin' boy lame
Me and them boys totin' things
And that right there is a sure thing
And I am smokin' that cure thing
I know you're smellin' this pure thing
You don't be movin' that pure 'cane
This cash that I'm spendin' is lil' change
A quarter the size of my earrin'
Gettin' to the guap don't stall dog
Pass me the ball I'm a ball hog
Doin' more numbers than a call log
Smokin' on dope, it's a fog log
And I just poured me a eight
And I just copped me a SRT8
Sosa just copped that Wraith
Who wanna bet that cake?

Bitch, I ball hard like Cailou
Ballin' so hard might foul you
Money in my pocket, might buy you
Start gettin' cash, they love you
Life that I live not for you
You fuck niggas in trouble
What comes with bein' loyal
That mothafuckin' royal
I'm a real fuckin' nigga, I don't care now
All that tough, talk get your man slammed
Swear I be feelin' like Bank Roll
Around these fuck niggas, can't stay 'round
Slide on your block, that's a man down
Fuck around and get your fuckin' mans drowned
Woo-Woo, that's that ambulance sound
I got the shooters ridin' with me nigga, stand down1Embed
