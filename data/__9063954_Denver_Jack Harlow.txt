Wonder, oh, why this ever had to be? (Uh-huh)
So many losing hope in those dreams that they—

Walkin' past the homeless in a Rolex
Just got off the stage on the TODAY Show and I basically felt soulless
Years go by and I keep saying I'm gon' use my phone less
But I should just be phone-less
Ignorance is bliss and so is bein' underground
'Cause it was fun when we were known less

Sober and focused, I cannot walk down no deli alleys
I still got the fellas 'round me, I love 'em and tell 'em proudly
