31 ContributorsRaw (How You Like It) Lyrics
Ha! For you!
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, how you like it
La la la la la (Thank you, thank you)

Bow! Bow! I came through the door
With the raw Martin Margiela
Superstar status, everything stellar
With some bad bitches and some ex-drugs sellers
Niggas already jealous
We in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers
She already wanna pick, bitch don't be so over zealous
Go to the bar to get around like a propeller
The barmaid's name is Stella
I'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me
Am I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party
Wanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah
Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah
Seen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah
Wanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha
Hmmmm! Well let me take my time
She ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight
Seen that ass cause I got hindsight
She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight
'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt
She said "You rap?" Yea mummy
I'm Tutankhamun kicking and spending this rap money
You might also like
Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go
Wanna feel you close, keep touching
Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go
Wanna feel you close, keep touching

La la la la la, how you like it
La la la la la, how you like it
La la la la la, how you like it
La la la la la, how you like it

She was all couture, in a Tom Ford
Security guard let me in cause I'm lord
Of finesse, the under, the rings, the dress
Code is to always stay fresh
Aware of a chest cause I stay abreast
She was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest
This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess
Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled
I'm locked into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove
I won't have to take it back to high school
Rewind! No need to take me back in time
Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline
Cause what's in front of me is this behind
Up north, she's thick; down south she's fine
Tuned in to what I'm doing
I'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing
The ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade
Showing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me
Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady
Dude got foul like crack in the 80s
Uh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo
You never know who got a Tec up in the disco
"You Hollywood." Nah nigga, I'm Chicago
So I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle
Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go
Wanna feel you close, keep touching
Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go
Wanna feel you close, keep touching

La la la la la, how you like it
La la la la la, how you like it
La la la la la, how you like it
La la la la la, how you like it5Embed
