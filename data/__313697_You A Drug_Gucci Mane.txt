20 ContributorsYou A Drug Lyrics
Baby you a drug
Baby you a drug
Baby you a drug
This lady you a drug
Baby you a drug
Baby you a drug
I fell in love with drugs
I fell in love with drugs
Baby you a drug
I fell in love with drugs

Gucci on the drugs in the club
I’m in love with drugs
Strippers giving hugs to a thug
Know im on the drugs
Promethazine one thousand a pint
That’s designer drugs
Po the whole pint in 2 liter
100 dollar cups
Double cuppin stuffing like a thug
Your head too good this lady
You a drug
I'm pouring codeine on a blunt of kush
This percocet, it got me wantin' to fuck (want to fuck)
I got Oxycontin, Lortab
Dig in the bag, no molly caps
OG gas, his swag bad
Clean lean, I’m double sippin'
I got Roxies, and Xan bars
Benzos, amphetamines
Promethazine and codeine
And coca leaves and coffee beans
You might also like
Baby you a drug
Baby you a drug
Baby you a drug
This lady you a drug
Baby you a drug
Baby you a drug
I fell in love with drugs
I fell in love with drugs
Baby you a drug
I fell in love with drugs

I’m in trouble took too many uppers
Can’t even stand on my two feet
My legs they feel like rubber
I try to keep that shit discreet
It leaked out to the public
They know that Gucci Mane get geek
Now he’s a drug lover
Just like big meech & terry
Me & my brother drug runners
We like the felix
Brothers kill ya see you to your mothers
I'm smoking blunts I dump ashes on your fucking corpses
I'm on that clean molly the 9
Meal 6 courses pull up in 6 porches
Follow by 6 Rolls Royce’s
With 6 stretch limos
Follow them in secret compartment
They say that zone 6 is Kingston
And I'm Bob Marley
I'm smoking on some orange i growed it out
My own garden
Baby you a drug
Baby you a drug
Baby you a drug
This lady you a drug
Baby you a drug
Baby you a drug
I fell in love with drugs
I fell in love with drugs
Baby you a drug
I fell in love with drugs6Embed
