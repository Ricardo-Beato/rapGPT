30 ContributorsMy Ho 2 Lyrics
It’s all about Little Mexico
That’s my ho, that’s your ho too (man)
That’s my ho, that’s my ho (Bitch), that's my ho, that's my ho
That's my ho, that's my ho (Free that game from this bitch )
(That's my ho)

I pissed on her (That’s my ho), you kissed her (That’s my ho)
You fell in love with her (That’s my ho), I think I miss her (That’s my ho)
You took her on a trip (That’s my ho), I tried to pimp her (That’s my ho)
I’m cool with her mama and her little sister (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
She sexy (That’s my ho), she fine (That’s my ho)
She say she love you (That’s my ho), I know she lying (That’s my ho)
We stayed fucking (That’s my ho) from time to time (That’s my ho)
You can marry her today (That’s my ho), she still mine (That’s my ho)

Excuse my lingo when I call you ho but bitch you know I talk like that
Get the red bottoms, turn up on them niggas, I taught her that
Get them stacks and some blow yo stacks and come and bring that pussy back
If you with a model crack cause I know where your heart is at
I run my team, I run my team
I'm the owner, coach and quarterback (Freebandz)
Ain’t got the time, I know you love me baby
She told her boyfriend to buy her a new Mercedes
Ain’t going to drop no name, Future drive her crazy
We could talk about anything and she going to be there for me
Give her a wedding ring and I’mma be around eternity
Her friends stay hatin' but she could never understand
He treat her real good, but he can’t make her feel like I can
You might also like
I pissed on her (That’s my ho), you kissed her (That’s my ho)
You fell in love with her (That’s my ho), I think I miss her (That’s my ho)
You took her on a trip (That’s my ho), I tried to pimp her (That’s my ho)
I’m cool with her mama and her little sister (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
She sexy (That’s my ho), she fine (That’s my ho)
She say she love you (That’s my ho), I know she lying (That’s my ho)
We stayed fucking (That’s my ho) from time to time (That’s my ho)
You can marry her today (That’s my ho), she still mine (That’s my ho)

She in my call log, she in my text message (go crazy)
He hittin' it raw dog, I’m skeetin it on the breasts
He bought her big bags, I fucked her on her dresser
That nigga old news, I’m talking Clyde Drexler (turn up)
She want that New Future, she want that new school (straight up)
Me and her brother jugg together, we too cool
She won't even get wet for you, for me she's swimming pool
If you don’t cut the check, she gon be mad at you (she want yo cash)
I might put a flex on her, I’m talking tycoon
See I got real money and fuck her like a broke goon (I'm a rich nigga)
And I never paid her, what she paid the kids
She might not never forgive me for what I just did (Astronaut)
I pissed on her (That’s my ho), you kissed her (That’s my ho)
You fell in love with her (That’s my ho), I think I miss her (That’s my ho)
You took her on a trip (That’s my ho), I tried to pimp her (That’s my ho)
I’m cool with her mama and her little sister (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
If that’s your ho (That’s my ho), that’s my ho too (That’s my ho)
She sexy (That’s my ho), she fine (That’s my ho)
She say she love you (That’s my ho), I know she lying (That’s my ho)
We stayed fucking (That’s my ho) from time to time (That’s my ho)
You can marry her today (That’s my ho), she still mine (That’s my ho)5Embed
