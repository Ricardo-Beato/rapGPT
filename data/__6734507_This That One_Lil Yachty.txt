26 ContributorsThis That One Lyrics
(Enrgy made this one)
Ooh, ok (Dumbass)
KrispyLife (It's with a K, dumbass)
This one them ones for me (Mhm, mhm)
This one them ones for me (Yup)
This one them ones for me (Whew, whew)
This one them ones for me

You was a ho in high school, you used to run from me
I went to school with niggas like you, you are not on nothing
Used to sell #8's on Hardwood, we had the block jumping
Beat his ass bad he thought the whole, whole club jumped him

Yeah, nigga, this one them ones for me
Okay I done wеnt pop star, I'm getting that one money
It's a couplе thousand on me cash, but it's store money (Alright)
Gotta let the money talk for me like I don't show money

I tote Glocks with certain clips, it hold a 50
I'm taking shots of purple water, lil' bitch I ain't tipsy
I think this thot want a rich nigga and his pockets empty
Call that lil' nigga R. Kelly cause he broke and pissy
She chasing money, chasing clout you know she rolling with me
Look in my stairs, that shit off Lulu like the Rolling 60's
Lil Boat just made me pick between a 'Rari and a Bentley
It's Mickey ears on all our choppers, look like a show on Disney
You might also like
Punched him in the mouth, I ain't like how he blinked at my momma
The backyard got sticks and trees but this not the Bahama's
Wood grain OG AK feel like I'm Osama
Got gas they all said I changed up, I'm Yachty Obama
Bringing a bank back, I got too much
Pull up in a sixty thousand cash, I ain't do much
F8 and it's all white like the Klu Klux
I just got it and I already need a tune up

I'ma get rich or die trying like I'm 50
This drac' will make a nigga dance, just like he Diddy
I'm lit, that's why she got my name on her titties
I'm plug, I ran through hella grams in this city
You told, boy you ain't no star, you a witness
This lean, gon' fuck around and make me need a kidney
My bitch, she mad at me cause I show no attention
But listen, bitch I'm on my grind I gotta get it

Riding with the Glock 23 these the one Jordans
Got a team full of shooter, we pull up scoring
Lil Yachty pulled up in a—, ahhh
Lil Boat just pulled up in that—, yeah (That's that one foreign)
Everywhere I go, I keep a 10, bitch I'm Eric Gordon
How the fuck it's 17 dollars and you can't afford it?
I got bitches lined up like they waiting for the one Jordans
(Baow) I just shot him in the ass, that's my first warning
I need to pop this bitch Dirk like a dungeon
I'm in Neiman's calling out shots, like I run it
Run with all apes I guess, I'm from the jungle
I'll let this bitch burn a Glock mixed up wit Usher
Get a nigga whacked, I'll push the button
Before I tell on myself, I hung my cousin
The thirty poking too hard, I gotta tuck it
I see you over there shining nigga, you better tuck it

Since he told I'll take the blood out my cousin
DNA I need that back we ain't fam no more
Brother and nem jumped out the store, yea they ain't saying no more
Stick singin' loud, just like D'Angelo, yeah
Hit him in his head, bust his cantaloupe
Tiny just pulled up with that sh-, yeah, the antidote
Fingered on this bitch for 50 minutes my hand had broke
Now my sister hold my journal, it's murder she wrote

Sneezed on my nigga, that's my slime for real
I can drive this bitch how I want 'cause it's mines for real
I can damn near hit who I want, it's that time for real
I don't know about no other stories, but mines for real
I'm finna pay Kidd to do a whole song without cussing
I was young used to mob to the store wit my cousins
I'm with four out of town bomb boes by the dozen
I'm with four out of town wit PJ like it's cousin
If it's Sprite and it's dark, look like hair dye
We gon' find out where he at, we gon' air it out
I fucked that bitch so good, that she wanna know my whereabouts
Off two Percs then I pulled her fuckin' hair out

I be fucking hoes in first class, this a doonie plane
I don't wanna hit that pussy, you play coochie games
Bitch keep squirtin' on my covers, she left coochie stains
Group of bitches in a soul line, this a coochie train
New custo' bald head look like Bobby Lashley
Ball bitch, I'm all about a bill, but I'm not Bradley
Perkies taste good, bite down, but it's not candy
Grim reaper ride around with Billy, it was not Mandy2Embed
