18 ContributorsThe Things That Hate Us LyricsSee I come from a time when
They didn't put rear view mirrors on the passenger sides of vehicles

And this is for those that still drink malt liquor
Put the poison in your body just to pass out quicker
When death calls best believe it's gonna get all
Emotional cause I ain't goin to hell without my menthols
Damn cable TV got me trapped in
Girls acting dumb and cops beating black men
Overfill, overkill, tryin to deal
Call the toll free and order my some diet pills, aight?
Got me looking at the sugar in the Kool-Aid that you made
You need to chase it down with some toothpaste
Still stuck to the simple things
Yep, the struggle in between a couple of Krispy Kremes
I have to ask if you could pass that half in half
To get my coffee back on track
Big ups to all the carbonated hiccups
The energy drinks and the suicide big gulps
Gonna find happiness in the fast food
Supersize, a triple bypass heart attack too
Distract you with these colorful tattoos
To cover up the fact that we feel like bad news

Uh, we love the things that hate us
Push snooze again girl, I don't want to wake up
America the beautiful, that's how she played us
Wasn't that cute, it must have been her make up
Tryin to grab everything that she gave us
Just take it back in the math on that pay stub
Lookin at the neighbours like wait up (wait up)
Uh, we love the things that hate us
You might also like
Pain killers help find some feeling
Crack the Vic in half just to break the time seal and
Take it by yourself on the living room carpet
Do a little bump just to clean your apartment, huh
I seen your wife, she's not the truth
I understand why you like to pay them prostitutes, yes
Strip clubs, gun shops, oh Jesus
Right next to the liquor store for your convenience
Everybody say "Ho" for the Cuervo
You can drive if you promise to be careful
Turn the radio up and light a doobie
And keep actin' like life is like a movie
This is for the needles you shared
Cause them after school TV specials is too square
Cook the coke for your own consumption
On some JoJo dancin old school, what's your function?
As American as herpes and hot dogs
Got lost between the mustard and the hot sauce
Unprotected sex with that one you just met
You ain't even got all your Hep shots yet, it goes
