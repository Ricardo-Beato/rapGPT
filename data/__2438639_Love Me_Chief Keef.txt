6 ContributorsLove Me Lyrics
She love me, she don't (Bang, bang)
She love me, she love me not (Gang, gang, gang)

She love me, she don't, but she know that she love me
She love me, she don't, but she know that she love me
She love me, she love me not (She love me)
But she know, she know that she love me
She love me, she don't, but she know that she love me
She love me, she don't, but she know that she love me
She love me, she love me, she love me, she love me
She love me, she don't, but she know that she love me

She love me 'cause I got a sack, ayy (She love me)
I be spending racks, ayy, ayy (She love me)
Walk in the mall, I buy it,  fuck a tag (Ayy, ayy, ayy, she love me)
She love me, she love me, she love me, I know that bitch dead, ayy (She love me)
She say she love my swag (She love me)
How I be swagging, my swag is in my bag (She love me)
And my bag cost bands (She love me), it's Louis (She love me, she love me)
And I got bands in these Trueys (Ayy)
It's a Glo, fuck a movie, ayy (She love me)
Crash your shows, bitch, we shooting, ayy, nigga (She love me)
And I'm with your boo thang (She love me)
She told me, boy, you hatin' (She love me)
She love me, she love me not (She love me)
She love me, she love me not (She love me)
But I'm still getting that guap (She love me)
I don't even give no fuck (She love me)
She love me, she love me not (She love me)
But I'm smoking on this pot ('Cause she love me)
And I'm hot, ayy (I'm hot)
