Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home

She a loyal bitch, you gotta pay for those
She a spoiled lil' bitch, I bought her all her clothes
You know I treat you good, I don't wanna meet your hoes
I took you out the hood, I took you to my shows
We took a lot of pics and now we look like goals
We tried some new things, we fucked a couple hoes
You changin' mood swings, you got me, I don't know
We gettin' back in, walked through the back door
You had some surgeries, but it's still fat, though
You like the cash, girl, you helped the cash grow
You drive a Lambo' with some leg room
Girl, I'm waitin' on you, bring that bag home, ooh

Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home

She don't play with bitches, she don't play with hoes
Yeah, she with the shits, she might kill a ho, yeah
If it's 'bout Yung Carti, yeah, my bitch on go
When she on that molly, anything goes
She was in Miami on a fuckin' boat
With some ball players, she left them niggas broke
She just text my phone, told me, "I'm alone"
I respond back, "When you comin' home?"
She respond back, "I was in my zone"
The money counter on, the money counter on
Uh, hold up, what you talkin' 'bout? Come here
Girl, I'm waitin' on you, bring that bag home, ooh

Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home22Embed
