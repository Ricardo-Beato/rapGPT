Woo

Cook the dope, let me cook it, yeah
Junkies layin' outside the bushes, yeah
Do-si-dos syrup, yeah
You gold diggers, I deserve, yeah
A gang of **** bought purses, yeah
I did it off of one verse, yeah
I'm sippin' syrup inside the vert, yeah
I'm leavin' my mark on the Earth
Takin' my drugs in doses
**** my bitch by the pack (I be)
Came from the-Came from mud (I be)
First to put the hood on thе jet (I be)
First to put the hood on Molly (I bе)
Then we put the hood on X (I be)
**** what a **** gotta say (I be)
I'm now securing my bag (I be)
Trappin' in Atlanta (I be)
Bought three, four, five Phantoms (I be)
Drug dealers, murders, and the scammers (I be)
Crocodile Birkin for your mama (I be)
Fourty-seven racks on sandals (I be)
Burberry Mink on camera (I be)
Pour the Wock' down in the Fanta (I be)
Walk a **** down on camera (I be)
Ski mask cover my face up (I be)
Skull wallet chain, Santana (I be)
Show a real-real what you made of (I be)
Hit 'em in the top right now (I be)
Drankin' on Wock' right now (I be)
Clutchin' my Glock right now (I be)
Marni on my sock right now (I be)
Your **** give me mop right now (I be)
To finesse on the road outta town (I be)
Drink the pain up then smoke up the pound (I be)
Selling dope outta grandma house (I be)
Bust juugs at grandma house (I be)
Cut sixteen-hundred out a ounce (I be)
Bought a foreign, could barely pronounce (I be)
One chain and it cost 'bout a house (I be)
Had them all a couple fives then bounce (I be)
Go tomato on the guts, a Ferrari (I be)
Hit this new lick, I'm snatchin' Bugatti (I be)
Sippin' oil out the drank, it's exotic (I be)
Get paid just to talk out of pocket (I be)
Once you finish loading up, then you cock it (I be)
Think these bitches outta France got me cocky (I be)
Rappers take off with the lingo and chop it (I be)
Make me crush up the scene with no problem (I be)
Swearin' these **** gon' try me in Atlanta (I be)

Hopped out the Uber, next thing you know, I bought Uber
Hopped out the Uber, next thing you know, I bought Uber
Don't come in with the rumors, don't ask me nothin' you can Google
Do I look happy, do I look happy to you?
(Do I look happy to you?)
Comin' in like, damn, where you get it from?
Comin' in like, damn, where you **** from?
Had just hopped up out the Uber
Next week, that man probably bought Uber
Don't wanna come at me startin' with a rumor
Matter fact, ask me nothin' you can Google
**** runnin' up a million being frugal
**** I was at yo' mama house, eating noodles ****

And we all wanna be happy
Do I look happy, do I look happy to you?
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy to you?)

And I know  with a tenant
And throw somethin', ain't somethin' I invented
Thought I had enough  get rented
 goin' dumb, pour some money in it
When the gun of sun, when I'm in it
Tinted, squint it, been it, y'all know it been a minute
Throwing in these 
Hold up, I'ma let you finish
'Pac goin' throw it up with a mini
I gave one song, count too many
Two mans hop out but I don't see any
How I'm gon' , leave you with me?
Dun-dun, come and get me
Throw the lights on and hit the getti
Four  now they hear me
Cocaine house round at Diddy's
Propane house like Minnie
Two night time like 50
Told my mama don't want many
Told my mama I'm winning
Tell 'em finna wanna live there
And we all wanna be happy
Do I look happy, do I look happy to you?
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
And we all wan— (Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
And we all wan—

When we done something, it's a movie
Probably get the job back at Louis
Probably got a nine, act a foolie
Someone actin' unruly
Pass out, wake up with a IV
I be—told my jeweler I'm too famous for the chain
Told my stylist I'm too famous for names
Told my jeweler I'm too famous for chains
Told MTV I'm too famous for the fame
Man, we ain't playin' no more games
Mortal Kombat and I finish you
Wanna throw me in the institute?
All you can do is salute

And we all wanna be happy
Do I look happy, do I look happy to you?
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
(Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
And we all wan— (Do I look happy to you, do I look happy?)
And we all wan—
Woo
