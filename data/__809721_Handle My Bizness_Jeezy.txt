I Said Young Was Busy Counting Money how Dare you Niggas Count Me Out
Made You Niggas Trap Stars Gave You Something to Trap About
Gave You Niggas Streets is Watchin' , Trap Or Die The Inspiration
During The Recession And The Drought Who Gave You Niggas Motivation
Now the Streets Is Talking Niggas Is Plotting
Public Enemy Number 1 Feel Like Bin Laden
5 4 3 2 1 I'm About to Blow Up
See Me Off In Platinum 2 1 I'm Gettin' Toed Up
Take The Vodka Straight To The Head I'm like you know What?
Just Keep It Trned Up On These Niggas Cause They Don't Know us
If You Never Hustled Don't Matter Now Then You Don't Know Dawg
That Black 745 On Dey Ass Like I'm Going To Show Ya'll
Let Me Handle My Bizness 

I Said You Can Get With This Or, You Can Get With That Shit
That Recompressed ready Rock, Never Coming Back Shit
Have You Whipping All Day And All That's For Practice
Bow our Heads Let Us Pray 20 Years Under My Mattress
Now Lay Me Down To Sleep I Had Dem Streets Dreams
Why The Hell Do You Think My Song Sound like A Street Theme
Never Spossed Shit Where You Stay Guess That's A Street Theme
In The Streets 24/7 Just Like A Street Team
You might also likeSomewhere off In The Lonely Cell Somewhere In Prison
They Layin' there With They Eyes Closed Seeing My Vision
Cause They Know We Come From The Same Cloths Perfect Position
They Jus Glad I Left The Game When I Did, Perfect Decision
Let Me Handle My Bizness

All Hail Your Trap Highness, Your One And Only
