9 ContributorsYa Know Lyrics
Girl, ya know, ya know (ya know)
Girl, ya know I be counting guap (ya know)
Girl, ya know I will send some shots (ya know)
Girl, ya know I don't freak with opps (ya know)

Girl, ya know I be counting guap (ya know)
Girl, ya know I'ma send some shots (ya know)
Girl, ya know I don't fuck with opps (ya know)
Girl, ya know I don't fuck with cops (ya know)
Girl, ya know I don't fuck ratchet hoes (Ya know, ayy, ya know)
Girl, ya know I keep my ratchet close (Ya know)
Girl, ya know I'm quick to blast it though (ya know)
And ya know I'm all about flexing though (ya know)

Girl, ya know I count my racks up
I got the .30 for my back up, ayy
Click-clack, nigga, back up
Click-clack, nigga, guess what? Ayy
You wifing that bitch but she coochie popping
Know that girl don't keep her coochie silence
I sip lean, girl, that boose invalid
Girl, ya know my gun too damn solid, ayy
I just start popping Xanax
Me off Xanax equals mans wet
Me off 10 flats, 10 dead mans
Dead mans in my pocket, dead man pants

Girl, ya know I don't fuck ratchet hoes (Ya know, ayy, ya know)
Girl, ya know I keep my ratchet close (Ya know)
Girl, ya know I'm quick to blast it though (ya know)
And ya know I'm all about flexing though (ya know)
