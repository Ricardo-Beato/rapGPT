12 ContributorsRun A Lap Lyrics
It's young hussle an' I'm bout to make it crack
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out to bitches on the stage getting racks
Told her it's a marathon, now she out here running laps
It's young hussle when I'm bout to make it clap
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out my niggas on the block selling crack
Told them it's a marathon, now they out here running
Laps
Verse 1:
Chip on my shoulder, for niggas that hated on us
Labels that hesitated when radio wouldn't play us
Rappers dropping they disses now see us start explaining
Bitches I used to date wouldn't shut up and stop complaining
Now they looking salty cause I'm sucka ducking full time
Sipping dolce at the roosevelt, cabana poolside
Hundred thousand ain't enough to buy a new ride
See that's the type of disrespectful deal you sign
What happened nigga? last year you was cracking nigga
This marathon got me lapping all you rapping niggas
Been steady rising since the world got a half a whiff of 'Hussle in the House'
And Felli Fel ran it back on niggas
Streets love me cause they know I got crackin' in 'em
Took a stand, never ran and got gaffled in 'em
Bailed out with block money, kept trappin'
And I took this rap game and put some real nigga passion in it
You might also like
It's young hussle an' I'm bout to make it crack
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out to bitches on the stage getting racks
Told her it's a marathon, now she out here running laps
It's young hussle when I'm bout to make it clap
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out my niggas on the block selling crack
Told them it's a marathon, now they out here running
Laps

Lo and behold, he getting his dough
Got that presidential roley flow, you niggas should know
Criticize me for the jewelery that I rock at my show
But watch the value of the dollar drop and gold explode
I got no time for these "I ain't tryin'a stand in line" homies
Think I owe them the world but never did nothing for me
Talking under they breath till they bitch just making her want me
See me or hit me with some fake shit like hey brody
Got enemies, trying to kill me for the rep
Couple smart niggas, think they playing chess go gonna get
Tony montana at the lot with my bitch
Tell them bulletproof that and bulletproof this
Guns behind the AC, I'm stashbox crazy
You can look at me and tell I was a match box baby
I'm game tight so niggas will never play me
Four words for my haters, look: fuck you pay me
It's young hussle an' I'm bout to make it crack
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out to bitches on the stage getting racks
Told her it's a marathon, now she out here running laps
It's young hussle when I'm bout to make it clap
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out my niggas on the block selling crack
Told them it's a marathon, now they out here running
