10 ContributorsCirculate Lyrics
Yeah
Cannon I see you Nigga (Cannon)
See Imma' start off so slow yeah I said so slow
They love me out in D.C. just like gogo
I said gogo yeah I said gogo
See I'm back with Don Cannon it's a gogo
See I want my song like Cocoa
I like to heat mine up like Cocoa
See them 87 Jeans see the logo
Every time of day, count em' baby gogo
You know how the drought be everything slow
You know how the drought be anything goes
Remember back when, when I got the snow low
And I was in and out of state just like Romo
Lookin' out for them boys, no homo
Can't tell em what you're drivin' thats a no no
I'mma tell you this but keep it on the low low
If his number's too low he might be the popo

Things are gettin' higher (things are getting higher)
Makes it hard on the buyers (makes it hard on the buyers)
Unemployment on the rise(it's on the rise, it's on the rise)
Gasoline engine filled with flies
Rent being paid late (rent being paid late)
Please, (please)
Let the dollar circulate (yeah)
Let it, let it, let it, let it, let it, let it, let it
Circulate circulate, circulate, Circulate, circulate

Sitting here staring at this empty safe
Like what the fuck im gonna do with all this empty space
Got me looking at my bills
Like this ain't my place
Who am I to stop the party
But that ain't my place
And im never giving up, that ain't my place
If it was my case, Then I plead the 5th
But the way im feeling now
I might drink me a fifth
Make sure you pray tonight, He might send me a gift
Might send you a ride, Might send you a lift
Might send you a roll, Might send you a script
Might send you a bag, might send you a plug
Might send you some thangs, might show you some love
Yeah, don't be the next to get flexed
Know this this yo' bank but you might wanna check
I tell you what, this is what I'll tell you
When shit get rough,No tellin' what they'll sell you

Interest rates going up (interest rates going up)
Seems like no value in the buck (somebody might give a fuck)
Meat prices up to stay (They up to stay, baby)
Utilities are on their way (Goddamn, )
Airlines are running late
Please, (Please,please)
Let the dollar circulate(Let the dollar circulate)
Let it, let it, let it, let it, let it, let it
Circulate circulate, circulate, Circulate, circulate
I hate to have to be the one to say I told you
Lord knows I can't wait until this recession's over
Gas higher than me, shit I'm tryin' to see
And where ever they be at it, thats where I'm tryin' to be
It was all good a week ago, Young the big tipper
Grind it all week, and threw it all at the strippers
Got me looking at my stash, like where the fuck the rest at
Looking at my watch like it's a bad investment
Speakin of investments, we talking investments
My re-up money, yeah im tryin' to invest it
Sell a nigga dream, Man tellin' me its up
Folks got it on hold, still ain't heard nothin'

Cities with millions going broke
The industries polluting the air with smoke
Politicians talking crazy
Workers being too lazy
Is it all because of Watergate?
Please (please)
Let the dollar circulate(Let the dollar circulate)
Let it, let it, let it, let it, let it
Circulate, circulate, circulate, circulate, circulate2Embed
