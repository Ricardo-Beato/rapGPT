4 ContributorsOpen Ya Mind Lyrics
Have you seen the news?
They legalized in California
But the feds still tryna
Put the pressure on ya
Forever we grind
Until the end of time
Yea we blowin some smoke
Then let's open ya mind
Have you seen the news?
They legalized in California
But the feds still tryna
Put the pressure on ya
Forever we grind
Until the end of time
Yea we blowin some smoke
Then let's open ya mind

How this the land of the free?
They want us all in a cage
They tryna lock me away
They found some pounds in my safe
Feds surrounding my place
The warrants all in my face
Damn I thought this shit was legal
Boy that's just not the case
Now i'm fighting a case
But the laws in the state
Ain't the same as the federal
So now these charges hold weight
Got me stressin
Shit depressin
Couple miles away
At the dispensary they sellin weed everyday
You might also like
From a clone and a seed
They consumin the weed
A continuous need
For a hunger we feed
A sativa to ease
Got you feelin right
An indica will
Put you to sleep at night
It's a passion of mine
That compassionate time (Yeah, right?)
They take ya money and rob you blind
Just come to the doctor
For a peace of mind
Yeah, come to the doctor
For a peace of mind

Have you seen the news?
They legalized in California
But the feds still tryna
Put the pressure on ya
Forever we grind
Until the end of time
Yea we blowin some smoke
Then let's open ya mind
But the feds still tryna
Put the pressure on ya
Forever we grind
Until the end of time
Yea we blowin some smoke
Then let's open ya mind
I started with a couple clones
Now my home is a grow
Had to pay off a few neighbors
But keep that on the low
Now all I gotta do is cut em down
Bag it, then go
To my local weed shop
And sell it back to the store
Who knew the habits that I had would be so profitable
But Uncle Sam wants to put taxes on the ounces I sold
That ain't legalization
That's just some more domination
Free the nation from the hating
On the tree that we blazin

I'm pushing out so many jars
You're as high as the stars
You're losing gravity in your midst
Like a mission to mars
The future was so bright
Now we uplifting with ours
Oppositions still wanna see us behind bars
Special interest money comin
Like Monopoly runnin things
But there ain't no stoppin me
They can't offer a fuckin' thing
Legalize and i'll advertise
California high in your eyes
Have you seen the news?
They legalized in California
But the feds still tryna
Put the pressure on ya
Forever we grind
Until the end of time
Yea we blowin some smoke
Then let's open ya mind
Have you seen the news?
They legalized in California
But the feds still tryna
Put the pressure on ya
Forever we grind
Until the end of time
Yea we blowin some smoke
Then let's open ya mindEmbed
