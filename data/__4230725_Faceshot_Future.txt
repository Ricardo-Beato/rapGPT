39 ContributorsFaceshot Lyrics
I'ma run this one all way down
Non-stop, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Boy)
See how I'm comin'?
(I just told Richie we rich)

Yeah, playin' with the girl out in Fresno (Yeah)
I like to get hyphy for a kilo (Yeah)
I fuck with lil' shawty, she got deep throat (Yeah)
Get your ass hit for a C-note (Yeah, yeah)
Push start, big foreign (Big foreign)
In the nick trap with the big 40 (Big 40)
Stuffed the M inside the Goyard (Million dollars)
My entourage all dope boy (D-boy)

Skrrt, skrrt in a fast car (Skrrt, skrrt)
Skrrt, skrrt in a fast toy (Skrrt, skrrt)
Skrrt, skrrt, cook the yay' up (Skrrt, skrrt)
Skrrt, skrrt, got my weight up (Yee)
Gold-wrapped ten stack, got a nigga geeked (Skrrt)
I go shoppin' in Europe, nigga, I ain't cheap (Skrrt)
Lost count, put up all the profit ten weeks (Skrrt)
Just in one week, it sold a thousand pounds on one street
Gold on my teeth, put some red bottoms on my feet
I fuck with freaks, one, two, three, keep it a G
Motherfuck them hoes, we treat 'em like the police
Motherfuckin' throwed, my niggas tryna OD, yeah
You might also like
Yeah, playin' with the girl out in Fresno (Yeah)
I like to get hyphy for a kilo (Yeah)
I fuck with lil' shawty, she got deep throat (Yeah)
Get your ass hit for a C-note (Yeah, yeah)
Push start, big foreign (Big foreign)
In the nick trap with the big 40 (Big 40)
Stuffed the M inside the Goyard (Million dollars)
My entourage all dope boy (D-boy)

Skrrt, skrrt, that's my wrist talkin' (That's talkin')
Skrrt, skrrt, the pot moonwalkin' (Moonwalkin')
Skrrt, skrrt, that that new forty (That new forty)
Skrrt, skrrt, they goin' 730 (730)
Since we made it out the swamp, it must be hell (730)
I'm Young Pluto, bitch, I'm trappin' out Chanel (730)
One thousand dollars for all my shoes, I'm very rare (True story)
Ayy, fuck a dog collar, nigga, I'm a bear (Dog)
Ain't gon' front, I brought out the egg beater (Pluto, Pluto)
Rich nigga but I'm seein' dead people (Ain't gon' front)
Majority all these models all head eaters (Yeah, yeah)
Half of these bitches sleepin' with the Grim Reaper (Woo)
Rich nigga, put eight in a one-liter (Woo)
Had to buy some extra diamonds to make my arms even (Woo)
You not upper echelon, you not a don neither
We gettin' the same money as Illuminati ('Luminati)
He wanna prove a point, he tryna catch a body (Catch a body)
They gon' double up the money for the faceshot (For the faceshot)
They gon' kidnap his wife for the safe spot (For that safe spot)
Tell 'em shoot her in the face, bitch, I hate thots (Yeah, I hate thots)
Yeah, playin' with the girl out in Fresno (Yeah)
I like to get hyphy for a kilo (Yeah)
I fuck with lil' shawty, she got deep throat (Yeah)
Get your ass hit for a C-note (Yeah)
Push start, big foreign (Big foreign)
In the nick trap with the big 40 (Big 40)
Stuffed the M inside the Goyard (Million dollars)
My entourage all dope boy (Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy)5Embed
