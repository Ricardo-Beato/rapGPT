Get it, yeah
Where it's at, right here, yeah
Now

I'm the rap maniac with the hooligan eyes
Who's cooler than I? Wack niggas, move it aside
When you heard I was a big deal, you were surprised
West Coast, bitch, put your W's in the sky
I spent my days as a refugee till the rap game came to rescue me
And left my wrist paved in accessories
A dangerous necessity, I came here to wreck emcees
You're wrong if you thinkin' Wayne was the recipe (Nah)
He ain't worthy of that, the controversy is back
Get out the Kool Aid, stir me a batch
See, I prefer to relax, but I can't and God knows it
Gotta stay raw with the flow that I'm diagnosed with
Oh shit, niggas keep fuckin' with my emotions
Maybe that's the reason I suffer from psychosis
Shockin' as high voltage, fuck it, my life's hopeless
So I had to make sure I killed it when I wrote this

Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Like a trampoline
You might also like
Ayo, bounce like a trampoline, thousands are amped as me
Kids, run up on your school campus and slap a dean
I grew up on baggy jeans, pornographic nasty dreams
Moral of my damn story, life isn't a happy scene
Wish I was stackin' cream, wish I had a Lamborghin'
Wish I had the cover on a Rolling Stones magazine
I'm sick of the radio playin' all these faggot teens
Keep it real, show me somethin' ill that I haven't seen
For ten years, I've been workin' on ill flows
And finally got a fuckin' record deal and I'm still broke
Man, that's not common, bombs that I'm droppin'
Are dope, but all that I can afford is some Top Ramen
I notice that ya'll niggas like to dumb the stats
I should stomp your ass out until your lungs collapse
No more corny cowabunga rap, we done with that
It's a wrap, keep it up and get your tongue detached
Come on

Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Like a trampoline
Uh, yeah
I'm the last of a dyin' breed, hip-hop lacks a variety
That's the reason I thrash on society
I get laughed at when I clash with a rivalry
Until they feel the wrath when I smash on their dynasty (Word?)
But I ain't Hollywood, I'm still the same, kid
Up on the same shit, rappin' in the basement
Catch me at your local school, skating, bustin' tre flips
Left shoe lace ripped, you know how them days get
Listen while the bass hit, only thing that changed is
The way that girls act 'cause now they think I'm amazin'
I used to be the nigga chicks didn't wanna hang with
Sittin' alone with a Capri Sun and raisins ("Ew")
My senior year in high school, I was always truant (So?)
Had a lot of homework but I would never do it (Fuck that)
Screw it, I'm the king now, homie, take a bow (C'mon)
You need the crowd jumpin'? I could probably make 'em bounce

Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em  bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make 'em  bounce
Hop can probably make 'em  bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em  bounce
Like a trampoline
Hop can probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make 'em  bounce
Like a trampoline
Buckle up...9Embed
