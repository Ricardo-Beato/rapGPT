30 ContributorsOff the Boat Lyrics
Hah, go
Marii Beatz, turn me up
Guwop (Hah, Gucci)
It's Gucci (Gucci)
(Gucci, hah)
Dun D-D-D-Deal (Ayy)
Hah

My bitch came off a boat, boat, boat, boat (Mwah)
I'm never goin' broke, broke, broke, broke (Hah)
It look like we sellin' dope, dope, dope, dope (Wow)
Fur coat on, I'm the goat, goat, goat, goat (Burr, burr, burr)
My foot on niggas' throat, throat, throat, throat (Hah, pussy)
Diamond cross on like the Pope, Pope, Pope, Pope
Jewelry really cold, got me really froze
Like J. Cole, I think my neighbors know I'm sellin' wholes

Me and the white girl just eloped (Hah)
Same day, my bricks came off the boat, boat, boat, boat
I think I'm Pablo on the low (Pablo)
But free El Chapo he the goat, goat, goat, goat (Chapo)

All these similarities (Huh?)
I donate to charity (Yeah)
I'm a good Samaritan (Mmm)
My bitch ain't American (Mwah)
This is not a parody (No)
Gold dope, that's a rarity (Gold)
Gucci Mane's a murderer, you sure you wanna marry him?
Big rock clarity, your jewelry's embarrassing (Hah)
LIV on a Sunday 'cause the load came Saturday
They call me Runway, I'm wearin' it
Skip da Flip', I'm havin' it
I'm Rich the Kid, I'm dabbin' it
And fuck your clique, we darin' it (Fuck 'em)

My bitch came off a boat, boat, boat, boat (Mwah)
I'm never goin' broke, broke, broke, broke (Hah)
It look like we sellin' dope, dope, dope, dope (Wow)
Fur coat on, I'm the goat, goat, goat, goat (Burr, burr, burr)
My foot on niggas' throat, throat, throat, throat (Hah, pussy)
Diamond cross on like the Pope, Pope, Pope, Pope
Jewelry really cold, got me really froze (It's Gucci)
Like J. Cole, I think my neighbors know I'm sellin' wholes

My plug from Mexico-co-co-co (Gato)
But all my folks on Gresham Road, Road, Road, Road (Gato)
Bouldercrest and Candler Road, Road, Road, Road (Gato)
I had them bricks right by Flat Shoals, everybody know

He's a huge music exec, never been exposed (Whoa)
Sold that boy a brick, like to treat his nose
Gettin' skinny as a stick, like to treat her nose (Mwah)
Let her snort it on my dick 'cause I'm really gross
All these lights, all these lamps, points, they really glow (Whoa)
Want one-quarter mill' a verse, I'm like "Really, bro?" (Hah)
Gave my bitch five million dollars, hold it, hold it, ho (Mwah)
All these snitches gettin' exposed 'cause they really hoes
My bitch came off a boat, boat, boat, boat (Mwah)
I'm never goin' broke, broke, broke, broke (Hah)
It look like we sellin' dope, dope, dope, dope (Wow)
Fur coat on, I'm the goat, goat, goat, goat (Burr, burr, burr)
My foot on niggas' throat, throat, throat, throat (Hah, pussy)
Diamond cross on like the Pope, Pope, Pope, Pope
Jewelry really cold, got me really froze
Like J. Cole, I think my neighbors know I'm sellin' wholes2Embed
