That's dope
Yo, ayy, won't you go out there, brodie
We need, you know, somebody to go out there and talk to the people
Yeah
You know, somebody to really get things going on, you know?
Yeah, I see what you're saying
I think you the man, so what you gon' do about it?
Well, see, I'm 'bout to drop some knowledge and some righteousness shot for the people that don't know
Well, you've been doing a lot of talking and stuff but I ain't seen nothin', so what you gon' do right now? Right now, right now
This is for the people, the people
Alright

Ya mom is so fat (How fat is she?)
Ya mama is so big and fat that she can get busy
With twenty-two burritos, but times are rough
I seen hеr in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (What?) ya mama smokеs crack (What?)
She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back
Her knuckles drag down to the ground when she walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk

Naked on a mountain top, tootin' on a flizute (Flute)
Ridin' on a horse drinking whiskey out a bizoot (Boot)
She's got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama
You might also like
Ya mama look like she's been in the dryer with some rocks
With the big bust nose sucking dirt out of socks
Held up the ice cream truck with a slingshot
She grabbed a bag of Cheese Corn and a soda pop
Ya mama root'n'toot and stole my loot and my suit
She may have the muscles, but no, she's not cute
She's not pretty, oh what a pity, got the glass titty
Filled up with Kool-Aid, just for the kiddies

On a cliff butt naked, tootin' on a flute (Flute)
Ridin' on a horse drinkin' whiskey out a boot (Boot)
She's got the teeth and the wings of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama got the wooden legs with real feet
Ya mama got the wooden legs with real feet
I said ya mama got the wooden legs with real feet
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama

Watch out, I'm thinking about your mother to a funky beat (What?)
I went to your house (What?), and she licked me on the cheek (What?)
I said excuse me lady, but I remember seeing you at the Palladium
Way back in September
'Cause you was beatboxin' for Lou Rawls
In some bright red boxer drawers
You said ya moms was pretty and young
But she's old as dirt and got hair on her tongue
Ya moms, ya moms, she uses Brut
Ridin' on a horse drinkin' whiskey out a boot
She's got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Ya mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand
Ya mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand
I, I, I, I said ya mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama

Ah, ya mom is so fat (how fat is she?)
We rode up on her back to get some burgers from Wendy's
And her skates went flat; I got stuck in her butt crack
They thought I was lost but I was caught by the G-strap
Heaven forbid a giant fart would give way
'Cause that would blow me 'round the world in a day
We drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
Because we dressed her up to look just like a Chevrolet

Naked on a mountain top tootin' on a flizute (Flute)
Ridin' on a horse drinkin' whiskey out a boot (Boot)
With the wings and the teeth of an African bat (Ba-aa-aa-at)
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama's got an afro, with a chin strap
Ya mama's got an afro, with a chin strap
I said ya mama's got an afro, with a chin strap
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama
Ya mom's so black, she can spit coffee on a hot day
Ah nigga, that's why your mama's so black, she can spit chocolate
Nah, nigga, ya mama's so—, ya mama's ugly, they had to tie a piece of meat around her neck so the dog would play with her
She turned into mud
Ya mama got a five-hundred-pound attack bat on her shoulder named "Careless Whispers"
Ya mama is so old, she owes Jesus a quarter
Your mother has to eat arrows to get her shit straight
Pound attack bat named "Careless Whispers"
When they go on trips, a'ight, nigga, ah, nigga, ya mama
Talkin' about yo' mama
Nigga, Johnny J's mama
Ah, talkin' about your mama selling little kids for broomsEmbed
