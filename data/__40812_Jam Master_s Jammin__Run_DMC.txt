Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam

He's a one-man band, in his own right
Jam Master jams to the broad daylight
No instruments needed, just two record players
A stage, a crowd, and two rhyme sayers

Ingredients are here, so have no fear
Definitely defy the position is clear

You couldn't be late, hesitate to debate
Jam Master is here and you could not wait
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*half of guitar riff*}
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*half of guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}

Now he's the Jam Master, and we're the emcee's
Like lightning and thunder, we're knockin down trees
While sucker DJ's, are bustin out Z's
My man Jam Master's stretchin hard 'cross seas
So why don't you listen, or you'll be missin
The cuts and the scratchin, bass, treble, and the mixin
The force and the power comin hour after hour
So get up off the walls, don't you be a wallflower
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam

The alert is red, this is what we said
The meaning of Master means he's ahead
The meaning of Jam is a recording
The records that he plays when the crowd's applauding
And when he comes on, the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock, there's nothing soft
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}

He adds a little soul, to rock 'n' roll
Every record that he touches, turns to gold
He's well conducted, self-instructed
His style's worthwhile, heavenly constructed

Mechanically inclined, and if you don't mind

He adds spice to your life, time after time

I think it's bout time, to heed the long lecture

We rock our rhymes for the Jam Master
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*guitar riff + half of "WHOO!"*}
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam

 + overlaps last scratch
His name Jam Master, call him Jay
The crowd goes wild when he starts to play
Everything is correct, and A.O.K
Jam Master's on the move but his sounds will stay
{*guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*half of guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}

From end to start, start to end
Not only does he scratch, but he's our friend
We could not wait, to let you see
 The things that he does for D and me
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*guitar riff + "WHOO!"*}
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
{*guitar riff to fade*}Embed
