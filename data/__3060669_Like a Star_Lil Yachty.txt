Ohhh Boy, where do I start
Darnelle Boat here checking in once again
I just wanna tell y'all
I am so so thankful and appreciative for everyone who has been supporting my nephews
Yachty and boat have been working so hard over this past year and we just want to welcome y'all to Teenage Emotions
Well they both have lots to say they've been working really hard
I think this time Yachty wants to go first

I done did a lot this year
Made a lot of friends, some came, some go
And I still never took a sip of beer
Still fuck hoes by the pier
Still ride around without a roof
Still ride around with k$upreme sippin goop
And my managers know lots and lots of goons
So let me know if there's pressure in the room

I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done had sex with six different whores
At the same time on they grandmother's back porch
Yeah, I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done rode around in a brand new Porsche
And I switched it up to the Bentley with two doors
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star

I used to wanna be rich
Now Lil Boat on the Forbes list
And my mom walk around with a frozen wrist
And my sister walk around with the nicest kicks
I used to wanna go far
Now a nigga up in the galaxy
Tryna figure out why these niggas mad at me
Sending shots while I'm livin' so lovely, like a star

I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done rode around in a brand new Porsche
And I switched it up to the Bentley with two doors
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star

Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
I'm a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
He's such a showoff
Man, I can't even talk, Boat's more of a showoff
Speakin' of Boat, I think right now he's with Digital Nas
Let's go over thereEmbed
