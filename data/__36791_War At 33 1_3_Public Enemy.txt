14 ContributorsWar At 33 1/3 Lyrics
Yo, move on 'em! Grab his soul and get the black mind back!
(They just hope that he'll never wake up! Because they never wanna meet him on the battlefield)
 Listen!

War at 33 1/3
Haven't you heard
I got quick and clever
At the level of a scientist
With this list my fist pumps chumps
And don't miss
Sorry majority grudge against the enemy
And any other nigga wit an attitude see
And any other rapper who's a brother
Tries to speak to one another
Gets smothered by the other kind
Not so divine so I heard through the grapevine
Sent the feds out to get mine
Time yo-yo to go Bronco in 90-91
Laughin' while they're searchin' for my 98
Accelerate the race from the chase
Look at my face
That they hate, but they don't want a debate
To take, great
Can I live my life without 'em treatin'
Every brother like me like I'm holdin'
A knife alright time to smack Uncle Sam
Who don't give a damn, look at the flag
My blood's a flood
Without credit
Black and close to the edit
I fed it, you read it, just remember who said it
You might also like
If you challenge them in theology! Don't challenge their political thinking! Don't challenge them in education! Don't challenge them in science! For that breaks the mold, that they are not used to!
 Yo, listen!

War at 33 1/3 not really live
I rather do it at 45
Went west in the quest for my intelligence
Climbed a fence took a teacher on
Ain't seen him since, hence he winced
And convinced that the Black
Was back revolving to a renaissance
Bronze to gold I told felt bold
Taught a so called teacher our role
In civilizin' the whole globe
Banned unplanned as I said
I don't break down religion, why?
There ain't a smidgen for a pigeon
Just nature for bird, dog, worm or lion
So my question to man is
So why the lyin'
God's law I saw is natural factual
Only man creates a waste
Defiance in his haste
Based on a scheme a scam
From some mastermind damn we read it
And still be blind
No need to search a fake church
Evangelical hustler
Anglo taxin' to muscle ya
Check I wreck you guess yes
All the bullshit, yeah! Now that's progressEmbed
