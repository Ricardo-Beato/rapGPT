(Southside on the track, yeah)
Yeah
Got the 'Rari outside, got the Maybach outside, no lie, no lie
(Got the 'Rari outside, got the Maybach outside, no lie, no lie)

In the penthouse in my room, I can touch the sky, yeah, yeah
I just woke up with a dime, holdin' a nine, yeah, yeah
I just stuffed a Backwood with a three-five, yeah, yeah
Off the top rope, Andre the Giant, yeah, yeah

I just put a brand new Phantom on my credit card
I just bought the Rollie store with my credit card
Put two hundred racks on my bitch debit card
I put two hundred racks on your whole squad
I'm a big time nigga, I don't owe no niggas
Cut a five million-dollar check, I blow that, nigga
Twenty million-dollar liquid, I can show that, nigga
Aquafina on me drippin', you can't pour this, nigga
I perform with my drum, you must don't know me, nigga
Got a thoroughbred bitch down in Texas, nigga
I can tell she got a man from how she text me, nigga
I been flexin' all my life, you can't finesse me, nigga
