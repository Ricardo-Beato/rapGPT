Right on time
(it's Gucci)
Right on time
(Ziggy)
Right on time
(Zaytoven)

Got two hoes they flyin' in, right on time, right on time
And that thing just kicked in, right on time, right on time
See that pack just touched down, right on time, right on time
Guwop headed to your town, right on time, right on time
This lil' freak done hit my line, right on time, right on time
And I'ma hit that from behind, right on time, right on time
Can't get that jaunt off my mind, right on time, right on time
Why this lil' monster so fine, right on time, right on time
I just wired a half a mill', right on time, right on time
Just so my roof could disappear, right on time, right on time
This hoe keep eating prescription pills, right on time, right on time
Somebody give this bitch a seal, right on time, right on time

Right on time, right on time, right on motherfuckin' time
Right on time, right on time, right on motherfuckin' time
Right on time, right on time, right on motherfuckin' time
Man I just walked in the club right on motherfuckin' time
Right on time, right on time, right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time, right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time, right on motherfuckin' time
Man these hoes done hit the club right on motherfuckin' time
You might also like
Right on time, right on time, Gucci back it's right on time
I forgot so many bitches man, I shoulda wrote them down
Roll me up then wind me down right on motherfuckin' time
And my watch so stupid icy I can't even tell the time
These niggas lyin' they commit a crime then they drop a dime
If you's a man why you bitch up nigga? stand and do your time
Right on time, I'ma freestyle ain't got time to write a rhyme
And so many want a feature man that they done made a line
I know she yours, but just for tonight I'm fuckin' her like she mine
She give you pussy but she give me stomach, I'm one of a kind
Made her vomit, gush out like a comet, hit her in the eye
But she a big girl then she ask for more, man she didn't even cry

Right on time, right on time, right on motherfuckin' time
Right on time, right on time, right on motherfuckin' time
Right on time, right on time, right on motherfuckin' time
Man I just walked in the club right on motherfuckin' time
Right on time, right on time, right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time, right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time, right on motherfuckin' time
Man these hoes done hit the club right on motherfuckin' time
