Enviyon on the mix

Two cups, pour me up an eighth
New drugs, do you wanna taste?
New girl from around the way
New car, do you wanna race?
Why these niggas in my way?
Highkey, all these niggas lame
Nike, checkin' up the game
Cartier all up on my frames
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way

Running up the money, come and go
Every day, I'm ballin' on my own
Remember, I ain't wanna be alone
Now I gotta get it on my own
I ain't never ever going broke
I ain't ever lovin' on a ho
Even though I'm sluttin' on the low
Bitches always frontin' on the low
I just wanna pull up in the Rolls
Always rocking pretty nigga clothes
Ksubi jeans with the VLONE
Always got Ksubi jeans on
Always got pinky rings on
Get the green, put the team on
Get the green and put the team on
You might also like
That's how that go
Double cup, get my lean on
Double cup, get my lean on
I'm in slo-mo
Get the green, put the team on
Get the green and put the team on
That's how that go
Double cup, get my lean on
Double cup, get my lean on
I'm in slo-mo
Get the green and put the team on
Get the green and put the team on

Two cups, pour me up an eighth
New drugs, do you wanna taste?
New girl from around the way
New car, do you wanna race?
Why these niggas in my way?
Highkey, all these niggas lame
Nike, checkin' up the game
Cartier all up on my frames
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way
Everything's going my way2Embed
