(MCV, bitch)
I'm in my act, I wanna dance
I'm on that yac, I wanna dance
Come get your man, before I put him in a trance
I'm in my act, I'm on that yac
I wanna dance, come get your man, come get your man

I woke up paid and pretty (Yeah)
Hair hangin' down to my back (Huh)
I put it on him last night (Woo)
He callin' me back to back (Hey)
Bitch, this a new outfit (Huh)
Turn to the back for a pic (Huh)
Cognac Queen, I'm lit (Woo)
Henn dawg, henn dawg, henn dawg, henn dawg
She pullin' up with a forty (A forty)
I'm pullin' up with a shorty (A shorty)
I'm fresh off the plane, I'm imported (Imported)
I'm fuckin' a baller, we courting
I'm makin' it clap, he record it (Damn)
And he keep on makin' them noises (Yeah)
Damn, fuck (Fuck), shit (Ooh), ooh (Yeah)
Drop me a pin, where you at? (At)
I'ma come 'round like a lac (A lac)
I get in my act on that yac (Yeah)
He call me Megan the Mack
It's turnin' him on how I rap
He doggin' it, I'll make it fat
And he tell me "Girl, you the best"
But I already know what I am, yeah, yeah
He know I only wanna come over put it on him
I got that woah-na-na-na, he drink that shit like water
I got that supernova, that super grip, that choker
I got that ditch yo' bitch (What?), tell her I'm comin' over
You might also like
I'm in my act, I wanna dance
I'm on that yac, I wanna dance
Come get your man before I put him in a trance
I'm in my act, I'm on that yac
I wanna dance, come get your man, come get your man (Ayy, ayy, yeah)

Cognac Queen, huh, Cognac Queen, ayy
Fuck is you saying? Fuck do you mean?
I get on that yac, then I lean, ayy
Cognac Queen, uh, Cognac Queen, huh
Together forever when we on the drink
Fuck it, I don't wanna think

Top down when I ride (Down when I ride)
Gettin' high like a five (High like a five)
Bitch, I pull up on your boo (Bitch, I pull up on your boo)
Tell his ass "Get inside"
Let a real bitch slide
Got him drinking nine to five (Yeah)
He know that I'm droppin' that game
But I'm not gon' tell him a lie (Uh-uh)
Drank, drank, I been drankin'
I hit you up when I’m faded
I know you're tired of me playin'
I call you back to back, call you back
Until you call me, call me back, baby (Mwah)
I know it's late, you been waitin' (Yeah)
My cognac kisses make you crazy
These other bitches can't fade me
You look good, you look good to me
Give me a hug, it feel good to me (Yeah)
Pour me up, you're too good to me
Cut 'em off, I know you would for me
He like "Damn, goddamn, girl
You should let me gon' be ya' man girl" (Yeah)
And he know I only agree
When I'm gettin' full of the drink
Went Courvoisier crazy
Got him thinkin' he my baby
Don't care what he sayin' (No)
I'm speakin' all body language (Body)
Fall in love, would be dangerous (Yeah)
Fuck you like I’ve been drankin' (Uh)
Cognac on my blankets (Yeah)
Real bitches don't fake it, ayy, ayy
I'm in my act, I wanna dance
I'm on that yac, I wanna dance
Come get your man before I put him in a trance
I'm in my act, I'm on that yac
I wanna dance, come get your man, come get your man

Yeah, Cognac Queen, huh, Cognac Queen, ayy
Fuck is you saying? Fuck do you mean?
I get on that yac, then I lean, ayy
Cognac Queen, huh, Cognac Queen, yeah
Together forever when we on that drink
Fuck it, I don't wanna think

Drank, drank, I been drankin'
I hit you up when I’m faded
I know you tired of me playin'
I call you back to back, call you back
Until you call me, call me back, baby
I know it's late, you been waitin'
My cognac kisses make you crazy
These other bitches can't fade me (Fade me)9Embed
