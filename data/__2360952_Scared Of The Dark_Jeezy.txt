11 ContributorsScared Of The Dark Lyrics
Scared of the dark, scared of the dark
You niggas is scared of the dark
Scared of the dark, scared of the dark
You niggas is scared of the dark
They all want the light, they all want to shine
They all want to shine, they all want the light
They all want to shine, they all want to shine

No body building but I stay flexin'
Executioner fresh, I’m bout to dome check 'em
All my bad bitches got they own section
Do they own grinding, pay they own bills
Full of liquor yeah I’m hella tipsy
Talkin' bitches, yeah I’m hella picky
Great white I’m goin Jaws on 'em
Kyrie Irving I’m 'bout to ball on 'em
Nigga switching teams like the draft nigga
Nigga left the Cavs joined the Mavs nigga
Had a vision nigga, I’m a visionary
They should put your picture in the dictionary
Right next to ungrateful nigga, you the definition
With yo' ungrateful ass I was in denial had to face it nigga
Can’t do epic shit fucking wit basic niggas cause they
You might also like
Scared of the dark, scared of the dark
You niggas is scared of the dark
Scared of the dark, scared of the dark
You niggas is scared of the dark
They all want the light, they all want to shine
They all want to shine, they all want the light
They all want to shine, they all want to shine

Crumbs to brick yea I’m a made nigga
Busting juggs and licks made me a paid nigga
Couple flaw niggas done went awol
This a real nigga role call
If her head crazy, I’ma kill the body
Just killed my show now where the after-party
Woke up pissing champagne
Woke up drunk the same thang
I was tryna help you get ya bread up
I’m the type to help you hit the bread truck
Plug blessed me so I had to bless niggas
Living stress free tryna stress niggas
Fuck you think he got a name from
Fuck you think he got the game from
Woke up every morning getting paid nigga
When the sun went down you got afraid nigga cause you
Scared of the dark, scared of the dark
You niggas is scared of the dark
Scared of the dark, scared of the dark
You niggas is scared of the dark
They all want the light, they all want to shine
They all want to shine, they all want the light
They all want to shine, they all want to shine

Type of nigga be pocket watchin
Type of nigga be clique hoppin
Yo' table then my table then yo' table then they back again
Type of nigga be in all ya pictures
Some of you niggas worse then ya bitches
Every nigga in my section like family nigga
Rolex’ like Grammys nigga
Raise ya bottles lets make a toast
To them pussy niggas that you hate the most
Fresh to head to toe bag money
Magnum bottles the jag money fake niggas
Throwin gang signs nigga
All the chains got hang time
Follow the sparkles tryna chase the light type of nigga
Be out every night cause they
Scared of the dark, scared of the dark
You niggas is scared of the dark
Scared of the dark, scared of the dark
You niggas is scared of the dark
They all want the light, they all want to shine
They all want to shine, they all want the light
They all want to shine, they all want to shine1Embed
