32 ContributorsCOOK IT DOWN (Freestyle) Lyrics
I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness
So now I’m just asking you to listen
I’m living in a World, where my truth can be my lynching
Last words “fuck you all” feel the ropes tension
I’ll never compromise, in it 'til the powder dries
Best friends drowned in quick sand and help you cowards rise
I floss in their honor, there legacy’s in bottles
Make them walk like their 30 years is right around the corner
We was all fucking Shawna, you and E was fucking on her
I was jealous when you both said her mouth was like piranha
Yeah, spend money like we print money
Buck fifty on the car, that's little Dent money
The AC is forever broke, that's vent money
Cocaine snowballed from gambling my rent money
Everyday struggle get money, get the crown for
Always thinking big now they praying for downfall

Say you telling on me, told them folks bout me
All this coke round me like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down everytime I come around
I just bought the house, put the pent on it
No rent couple hundred K spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down everytime I come around

Got me loooking at the crown from a birdseye view
Cause I hit the ground running from the birds I flew
Now I’m standing at the top from the words I drew
Rap shit’ll drive you crazy, it done drove Shyne Jew
Mazel tov, now I’m hotter than a Molotov
Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues
A small price for my cocaine catalogue
Scalp the coupe like a tomahawk
Travelodge stories, I pray that you ignore me
If you can’t feel the joy off a hustler in his glory
Hiding money in a wall from the first to third story
ATL, Glenridge, condo’s true story
A man of everything that I say I am
A little better than the fans, hope and pray I am
Weed the jokers out the deck and just play my hand
Smokers getting stuck and going nuts like it’s Peter Pan

Say you telling on me, told them folks bout me
All this coke round me like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down everytime I come around
I just bought the house, put the pent on it
No rent couple hundred K spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down everytime I come around3Embed
