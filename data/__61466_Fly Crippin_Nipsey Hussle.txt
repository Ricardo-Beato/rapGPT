19 ContributorsFly Crippin Lyrics
I got a swag when I step
Blue rag to the left
All the girls know im the biz
I think I know what it is
It's fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'
I got this 40 on my waist, Louis suit case
And I'm tattooed on my neck, my chest, my face
Fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'

Look, TMC is my new shit
I don't make no excuses
Fly crip in my blueprint
Niggas talk but I do this
I gave a AR to my new bitch
I had a Rolex before music
Money talks, loud and clear
Niggas looking like two cents
So we could line them up and we could shoot shit
We could range Rover, Benz coupe shit
Turn a couple of zones into a few bricks
And turn a couple of bars into a new hit
New Louis bag, new Louis kicks
And my trunk right where my roof is
Nigga stay in style like I'm boostin'
How they say they fly when they flew shit
I got tats all on my neck, tats all on my face
Get 10 G's so up and I don't hop bout till I pay
I drink that Clicquot and that Ace
Smoke Kush weed and eat steak
She can't resist to fly crip
So she get wet when I get on stage
And yeah I dropped out in 10th Grade
But I fly first class on these planes
Never stand in line at my bank
All money In is incorporated
They say "Damn, Hussle you made it"
I said "No, you just think basic"
And if them niggas fly, then I'm a spaceship
You might also like
I got a swag when I step
Blue rag to the left
All the girls know im the biz
I think I know what it is
It's fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'
I got this 40 on my waist, Louis suit case
And I'm tattooed on my neck, my chest, my face
Fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'

I got that rag all on my left
Bank when I step
Tattoo on my neck, my face and all on my chest
What you gonna do next?
Take your main bitch and have sex
I keep a 40 on my in case a nigga trying to flex
So niggas stop with all that press, cause you ain't gonna do shit
I hear you talking loud, well nigga talk about my dick
And how your bitch swallow this
You go home and you kiss
But guess what you hater, you be kissing on my dick
No homo trick, she look at you like you a lick
She fuck with Cob Supreme 'cause I'm a fly ass young crip
I got Polo socks on my feet
Polo draws on my waist, Louis belt on my Levi's
And these diamonds be all on me
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my wrist
I look like a robbery but nigga that will be a risk
Ride around in that jag, I roll around in that range
But if a nigga walk we are still not the same
'Cause I got
I got a swag when I step
Blue rag to the left
All the girls know im the biz
I think I know what it is
It's fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'
I got this 40 on my waist, Louis suit case
And I'm tattooed on my neck, my chest, my face
Fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'3Embed
