5 ContributorsMake A Hole Lyrics
Coming through coming through real spitters
We wrap your guns everyone you feel us
Make a hole make a hole for my niggas
Or force us to make holes and they fitted

Why you little niggas bucked for an outfield
Through the thing get pass me I'm out here
Out where their guns bust we ??? hit up
Something wrong with his head shots and run to it
What's good boy the ??? you freeze up
The pants too tight for the guns that we tucked
Let me hit you the sudden this I don't do often
But once I tell you gotta kill nigga hit your coffin
Get a good look not really get a good look
You want to play I move your chest piece like a rook
Straight up and down you niggas shook
Take a picture show you how real winner look
Riding around with my trophy
Ask Pokey a rat being low key
But who's hiding a slide through a back block
G'd up with my motherfucking mad cop

Coming through coming through real spitters
We wrap your guns everyone you feel us
Make a hole make a hole for my niggas
Or force us to make holes and they fitted
You might also like
Come on, uh good maybe in winter cold
Travel with a magazine like a centerfold
Being broke childish you bitch getting old
Se her in the video so with the something tinted
Stallions  riding in it, stallions in the engine
Styling with a vengeance on them hating ass bitches
Keep me in your vision hope watch how I do this
On the toilet right now stay on some new shit
Miss exclusive hide in the ???
Drunk at the venue but on point like a pencil
My sexual preferences is whatever you into
I'm here with my Pitbull's you hand with you shit soon
I got issues mentally challenged
You stay focused try to avoid violence
You know what I be
You got a problem come with Clipse like Pusha T that means no Malice

Coming through coming through real spitters
We wrap your guns everyone you feel us
Make a hole make a hole for my niggas
Or force us to make holes and they fitted

This is Mobb Deep like 1000 Mafia dons
The black mark back up hit you better come
All the way to fuck down bandana home
I take my crime did my time, I'm gone
Off to the top like a rocket ship
In this  soft with your top if you pop your shit
I got billionaire friends, millionaire girls
You got the blocks on I've got the whole world
Rock shows in Chile, Italy, Bombay
Why you yap out that I can't come back round the way
Huh I'm way ??? put around in your back
Respect how I move will get moved on out of respect
This is it this is Mike Jack monumental
I sat in the box and roll wraps with a pencil
Why the calendar pages is flew
I was plotting and scheming on what I'm gon' do
Coming through coming through real spitters
We wrap your guns everyone you feel us
Make a hole make a hole for my niggas
Or force us to make holes and they fittedEmbed
