4 ContributorsThe Original Lyrics
Untouchable
Before you could touch a made guy, you had to have a good reason
You had to have a sitdown and you'd better get an okay
Or you'd be the one to get whacked

All I smoke is OG, ridin' 'round low-key
Higher than the nosebleeds, reppin' L.A., that's the home team
L.A. original, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
All I smoke is OG, ridin' 'round low-key
Higher than the nosebleeds, reppin' L.A., that's the home team
L.A. original, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

It's Senny Sosa, ridin' in the Roadster
A Brand You Can Trust like La Coka Nostra
Boy, I thought I told ya, watch how you approach us
Cypress hold it down for the coast like we supposed ta
When I spot a vulture, put him on a poster
"Have you seen the body?," said the pig, "I don't know, sir"
I'm reppin' for the best coast, I'm reppin' for the hometown
Where money, weed and bitches make the whole world go around
When gangs pop up, it turn into a ghost town
Where some call it Los Scandalous where it goes down
I do it for my family, I do it for my day one
When we meet up, best believe we gonna blaze one
You might also like
All I smoke is OG, ridin' 'round low-key
Higher than the nosebleeds, reppin' L.A., that's the home team
L.A. original, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
All I smoke is OG, ridin' 'round low-key
Higher than the nosebleeds, reppin' L.A., that's the home team
L.A. original, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line
You got out of line, then you got whacked
Everybody needed rules

It's the almighty Cypress, fuck if they don't like it
I know my real ones gonna bounce to this hype shit
We never sleep, keep it tighter than a vise grip
The beat is knockin' on yo' head like a nightstick
Started outta South Gate, nowadays I'm worldwide
Gotta keep a loaded .45 on the 405
I keep my eyes wide, so think before you try
Anything can happen in the city, boy, it's do or die
Where we're from, we had to choose a side
But this music took us levels only few could rise
Shit blew my mind
The streets dangerous, that ain't changin'
Better watch what you cats be in the papers
All I smoke is OG, ridin' 'round low-key
Higher than the nosebleeds, reppin' L.A., that's the home team
L.A. original, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
All I smoke is OG, ridin' 'round low-key
Higher than the nosebleeds, reppin' L.A., that's the home team
L.A. original, gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
