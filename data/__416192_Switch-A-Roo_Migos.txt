She like the MPA Bandcamp (Bandcamp)
She like the Migos too (Migo, she liking it)
You know how we do

Lil bitty bitch say she loyal
Knowin damn well we ain't gone spoil her (Nooo)
Let me tell her what da hell a young nigga do (What?)
Switchin our hoes what we call it (Switch-A-Roo)

Switch-A-Roo my diamonds dancing (Talk to 'em Quavo)
In the jungle with chimpanzees (Woo)
