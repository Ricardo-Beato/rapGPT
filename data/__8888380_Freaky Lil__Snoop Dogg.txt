1 ContributorFreaky Lil’ Lyrics
Oh, yeah, papa
She's the freak of the week (Freaky, freaky, freaky)
She's so fly and so petite and so sweet
She's the mellow in my yellow
She's the high in my "Hello"
Do you dig what I'm sayin', fella?
Yeah, rock, rock, y'all

Oh, I, oh, I, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I (Oh, I)
Oh, I, oh, I, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I (Oh, I, yeah, yeah, yeah)

This girl is the freak of the week
But I'd be damned if I let her out-freak me
Do you know who you freakin' with?
It's Dr. Freakenstein
Here to freak with your body, your soul, and your mind
Can I hit the cool pack one more timе? (Yeah, hahaha)

The girl's a freak, thе girl's never missin' a beat
The girl's a freak, the girl's never missin' a beat, yeah, yeah
And I just need deep sugars, throw the leaves, when she went down on me
You might also like
She went down on me, 'cause that's what she wanna do (Wanna)
It ain't about what you wanna do or what you gonna do (Gotta)
You gotta do what you gotta do, now do it
Get to the task, do it real fast (Fast)
Go on, baby girl, go and shake that ass
You know you wanna break it down and try to give it to me
'Cause you wanna fuck with the P.I.M.P
And it's all great, baby (Yeah)
Give it to a nigga, 'cause you're oh-so crazy
And shake it, drop it, pop it, quick
And let a nigga hit that ultimate

Take me in and turn me out
Show me what the lil' muffin all about
I show you what a real nigga all about
Make me take it out your pussy, now put it in your mouth
Take me in and turn me out
Show me what the lil' muffin all about
I show you what a real nigga all about
Make me take it out your pussy, now put it in your mouth, lil' freak

Freak with me, freakin' with your mind
Freakazoid's around the world
This is Dr. Freakenstein, one more 'gain, my friend
Here to sin the end to the win, and put the juice to the gin
And as we say in the streets, it's all to the good
If you lose, or if you win
She's a freak, she was born to be a freak
She can't do nothin' but freak
You ask her to speak, and she can't do nothin' but freak
Seven days a week, the girl was born to freak
And me bein' the freak that I am
Come freak with me
And I'll freak your mind, body, and soul
And show you how to maintain and do this thing
But Doggystyle is the way I freak
How else could I get to the booty if I don't attest from the back?
Yeah, freak of the week
This is dedicated to all the freaky nasty girls
That like to shake what their mama gave 'em
Misbehavin' is the thing to do
I love it when a girl does somethin' that she's never done
And she has fun while she's doin' it
Suck me, bitch
Oh, I, oh, I, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I (Oh, I)
Oh, I, oh, I, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I (Oh, I, yeah, yeah, yeah)Embed
