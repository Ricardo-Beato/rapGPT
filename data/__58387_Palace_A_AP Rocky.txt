Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (SEX)
I don't know what it's like to stop
(Run that back, Turbo)
Ayy

Got a Glock on my side, but it's more like my main bitch, woah (It's more like my main bitch, yeah)
Keep it real, baby girl, I'm the one you could bank with (I'm the one you could bank with)
Yeah, keep it real, I'm the one that's not with the banquet
Or not with the stank shit (No)
Fix your attitude or I ride with a bad bitch (Skrrt-skrrt)
You talkin' to the big slime (You talkin' to the big slime)
Del Frisco's with a big thot (Oh)
Micro Draco got big knots (Big knots)
To any rapper, this a big swap (Swap)
Lifetime goal, call the big shots (Yeah)

Uh, if you can't stand him, go sit his ass down like a desktop (Woo), woo
Thankin' the Lord that my nigga made it out of the cell block, woo (He made it out)
Keep it one hunnid, my oath was never to tell cops, yeah
My sales popped, I been mixin' this Act' with the cherry pop (Woo)
Yeah, black matte the pano'-ca-'ramics, these niggas'll never catch up, yeah (Or let me just push out the skrrt)
I gotta tiptoe your pussy, my flask is Red Sox (Sip red, ooh)
I had to tell that lil' thottie she walkin' on tight rocks (Yeah, yeah), yeah
Keep a dramatic lil' baddie on top of the top floor (Oh)
Big slap on the wrist, I learned my lessons
Way too many millions to be cappin'
Squirt on her titty, now she think she know us
And I keep a .40 on my waistline (Let's go)

Fix your attitude or I ride with a bad bitch (I ride with a)
You talkin' to the big slime

Big drip on me, VVs on me, congratulate myself
Got that on me, live like Tony, AR on the shelf
Light speed when in motion, melody I made myself
Big B's on me, yeah
Ice, I just need my AP, no pres', I stay to myself, wavy
Gold teeth, niggas can't bite me, this ain't no rabies
Blame me, oh, why you wanna blame me? These bitches be crazy
Blessin', come follow me, baby, teach you a lesson
Got a couple cars for a couple hoes, might fuck 'em all in my whip
Come through in this carpool, I skrrt-skrrt and we dip
I'ma pray to God for purple rain, that double cup, I sip
Ooh, fantasies, I'll show you that it's real (Yeah, yeah)
Got a Glock on my side, but it's more like my main bitch, woah (It's more like my main bitch)
Keep it real, baby girl, I'm the one you could bank with (Oh, oh, yeah, woah)
Yeah, keep it real, I'm the one that's not with the banquet (No)
Or not with that stank shit (No)
Fix your attitude or I ride with a bad bitch (I ride with a)
You talkin' to the big slime

Big slime
You're talkin' to the big slime (Yeah)
We get a b-dub in Magic (Yeah)
I think this might be a classic (Classic)
I hid some racks in the attic (Racks)
I'm on a 30 P, Addy (Oh)
I got an addiction to fashion (Yeah)
I walk in the club with that static (Yeah)
I'm just tryna get me a backend (Backend)
Tell my driver to pull up, then back in (Back in)
Helicopter to fly over traffic (Traffic)
On my grind, ain't no time for relaxin' (Relaxin')
Spend it up, I been bringin' that cash in
I'ma go grab that Maybach wagon (Nah)
Think I'm headed to space-age status (Nah)
I might go cop that big boy Patek (Patek)
She was takin' a picture, uh, uh
She was takin' a picture with my jacket
Just don't buck 'cause these bitches really petty (Woah)
I'm controllin' the stick like it was Madden (Nah)
I'ma get up and make me something happen
Ain't no use in me wastin' my talent
We never lackin'
I'm smokin' 'Woods like a cabin
I put my bitch in some fast shit (Fast shit)
Turn my whole crib to a palace
In London, I'm shoppin' at Harrods
Got this money, we 'bout to get married (Married)
Niggas runnin' they mouth like a parrot (Parrot)
I'm a bunny, I keep me some carats (Ayy)
Got a Glock on my side, but it's more like my main bitch, woah (It's more like my main bitch, yeah)

Got the Glock on my side, but the FN my main bitch (FN my main bitch, yeah)
We done got rich, but I cannot get caught with the same bitch (Caught with the same bitch, uh)
I got some hoes in LA and they speak different language (Speak different language, yeah)
Drop off the Porsche, and I bought me some work in the bank
Whole lot of racks and this shit still ain't changin'
Used to be juggin' and traffickin' 'bows (Traffickin' 'bows)
And I came up with some killers and you cannot trap if you don't got no pole (Don't got no pole)
All of my niggas, they millionaires, they think we sellin' our souls (Our souls)
I'm never tellin' her no (No)
I get the head and I go (I go)
I'ma go run up some more (Run up some more)
Stack up that paper, not stuntin' these niggas at all (Stuntin' these niggas at all)
Cakin' that bitch, she a freak, and I beat up her walls (Her walls)
Pull up my pants right after I fuck her like I gotta leave, but I never call (No)

Won't settle for less, we want it all (All)

Got a Glock on my side, but it's more like my main bitch, woah (It's more like my main bitch, yeah)
