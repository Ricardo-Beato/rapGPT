15 ContributorsStay Loyal Lyrics
Me and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal
Me and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal
Me and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal
Me and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal
Me and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal

And I do not fuck with fake niggas so miss me with that snake
But I know pro 3 chrome versace whips is how I'm skating
Pistol on my lap, niggas making threats
Me I'm tryna ball, niggas wishing death
Probably all just talking, probably idle threats
I seen this shit happen I can't take this shit for less
Smoking as I drive, watching for the people
All I know is eat while in these streets don't let them eat you
This for all my dogs, this for all my locs
Fucking with that fuck around, fuck around and get smoked
One time for my killas, go hard bitches
Worldwide bosses, young real niggas
Had to make it happen, plus I gave my word
Started out the trunk got it off the curb
Trapping 'round the world, lessons that we learned
Blessings we deserved cause niggas kept it firm

All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
You might also like
All I know is banging, all I know is rap
Got put on the hood then I went and bought a strap
Couldn't understand the stack so I put it on my lap
Slauson Boy tat, put it on my back
Had to flip some money I put it on a sack
Invested in my music finally put it in this rap
Started with my niggas so I put my heart in it
Never switch real, still here with who I started with
Loyalty respect against betrayal and dishonor
So when a real nigga stands it killavates you when you spotted
Don't get me cause I got it, really cause I'm bout it
This one's for my niggas sippin Remy in the projects
Look how far we came without a record deal
All Money In now you niggas know the drill
Lessons that we learn, just from standing firm
Blessings that we earned we got what we deserved

All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)

Yo you can look up and thats when at the highest level of business
That's they model, equity
You know what I mean?
At the highest level of business there's mailbox money
They gon' give the masses the checks
That's what they gon' do
A percent of what you gon' make
They gon' cash that check on the back of them
It's like hip hop is so much inspired and you know
Respect and honor to us, you know what I'm saying that
It's just, it's hip hop that's doing this much
You know what I'm saying that, it's just you know
Play the game have, you know the pros playing
And you switch them out for, you know what I'm saying
What's the intention what's cool, whats braggin rights?
What's them braggin rights gonna be
That's what the braggin right is it used to be
I used to be the Mexican  success
But to me it's like, you know, what would you want?
You want something what's your position?
Can you make shit move?
Can you have power? Can you have true power?
Then you have control of your desitiny
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)
All my niggas (All my niggas) stay, stay loyal, loyal (All my niggas)2Embed
