Huh, uh
Huh, uh (Yeah)
Huh, uh (It's Gucci)
(Once again I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit)
Go

They don't wanna see me on the top, lotta crabs at the bottom so you lucky if you make it to the top (You lucky)
Yeah, it get lonely at the top, but I fuck her from the back, then I tell the bitch to get on top (Slick)
Tell the haters I won't stop, I'ma let the top drop in the hood, call me No Top Wop
Ridin' in my vert, no socks, run up on Wop, light on, lights off, get clocked

I don't even like giving dap, I don't even take snap 'cause I'm rich and a nigga might snap (I'm rich)
They done took a nigga out the trap, but you can take thе trap out a nigga 'cause a nigga can rap (Yeah, bitch)
Wrapping up work like burritos, thеy eat 'em like Fritos, bricks like Dwight at the free throw
Peepin' out the peephole, looking at the camera
Listen to the scanner watchin' out for the people
Still selling dope like it's legal, first car was a Regal I remember we was cold, no heater (Hot, hot)
That is well known for serving niggas. now they see me in the rentals, the boy gettin' real Velveeta (Cheese)
Nigga gon' pay but he weighin', if he weighin' what I'm weighin' then the price does not get cheaper (I win it)
I remember hoes used to hit my beeper all the bad hoes now still hittin' my people (Well, damn)
I don't really need no features, I don't like no leach, don't try to leach off me neither (Eh)
Hear no evil and I see no evil, stretch chinchilla real fur, call PETA (Yee)
When you on top, you know you can't fumble (No), niggas gon' maximize when you stumble (No)
You would be mad surprised that I'm humble (Woah), I'm Gucci the stunna can't wait 'till this summer (It's Gucci)
