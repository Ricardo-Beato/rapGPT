20 g's put a choppa n da paint nigga, smoking stanky nigga you know what the fuck im dranking nigga
Bitch im high everyday thats what the fuck i say, Broad day AK until its empty, See Jeezy thats my mufucking dog, its mufuck him and its mufuck yall
That boy jeezle one real ass nigga, say what the fuck they want bitch he still that nigga
Extendoo! thats how the clips be, all stacked up pretty thats how the bricks be, mane i squeeze this mufucka till its empty, fuck around and cook your whole shitt RICE CRISPIES
Certified ain't a pussy nigga realer, as far as im concerned ima pussy nigga killa
And you already know nigga im dying about mine, and i really mean that, and I ain't lying about mine
50 g's just to bulletproof the lambo, one hundred K in case these niggas try to gamble
See jeezy get the strap and think he rambo, choppa with a shoulder strap and all wood handle
(Chorus)
You want a half brick i got the whole thang, lets say you gimme 28 i keep the whole the thang
Nothing said getting money like some cocaine, shoot at the gas tank watch it blow up like some propane, BOOM!
Man this rap shit remind me of the dope game, the only thing none of yall sold cocaine
The only thing none of yall sold kilos, the only thing none of yall sold half o's
I told him holla nigga when u see tha Po-Po, 2010 Maserati on some low pros
See fucking 'round wit Young that's a no no, choppa go BOOM! then it flash like a photo
