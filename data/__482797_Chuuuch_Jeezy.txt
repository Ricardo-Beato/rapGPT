3 ContributorsChuuuch LyricsSix thirty a m eastern time
Codes in my eyes nigga seein dollar signs
Yeeeeeaaaaa
A pyrex pot in the kitchen ????
And i dont eat bacon so i ain't cookin pork
Gyeah
Peel the top off the bakin soda
Give my granny a couple hundred she dont like the odor
???? digi scale ziploc bags
Might save a lil bit but ima blow half
Gyeah
A nigga hungry all i want is bread
Put the whip on it we call it scrambled eggs
Thaaaats riiiight
Back and forth like the globetrotters
Lean it to the side add a lil cold water
Yeeeeeaaaaa
A bag full of tricks
Crazy wrist game got me all this extra shit
Keep it silent the hate shake dog
No pool table still playin 8ball
What you know about this
What you know about that
What you know about soft
What you know about trapsYou might also likeEmbed
