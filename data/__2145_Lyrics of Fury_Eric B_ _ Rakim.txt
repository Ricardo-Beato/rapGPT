I'm rated R, this is a warnin', you better void
Poets are paranoid, DJs destroyed
'Cause I came back to attack brothers in spite
Strike like lightnin', it's quite frightenin'
But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park
Not a scream or a cry or a bark, more like a spark
You tremble like an alcoholic, muscles tighten up
What's that? Lighten up, you see a sight, but
Suddenly you feel like you're in a horror flick
You grab your heart, then wish for tomorrow quick
Music's the clue, when I come, you're warned
Apocalypse Now, when I'm done, you're gone
Haven't you ever heard of a MC murderer?
This is the death penalty and I'm servin' a
Death wish, so come on, step to this
Hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist
Friday the 13th, walkin' down Elm Street
You come in my realm, you get beat
This is off limits, so your visions are blurry
All you see is the meters of the volume pumpin' lyrics of fury
It's aâ€”
A furified freestyle

Terror in the styles, never error-files
Indeed, I'm known to exile
For those that oppose to be level or next to this
I ain't a devil and this ain't The Exorcist
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep or wink
The pain's a migraine every time you think
Flashbacks interfere, you start to hear
The R-A-K-I-M in your ear
Then the beat's hysterical
That makes Eric go get an axe and chops the wack
Soon the lyrical format is furier, faces of death remain
MCs decaying 'cause they never stayed
The scene of a crime every night at the show
The fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
It's only one capable, breaks the unbreakable
Melodies unmakeable, pattern unescapable
I haunt if you want, the style, I possess
I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest
For those that envy an MC, it can be
Hazardous to your health, so be friendly
A matter of life and death, just like an Etch A Sketch
Shake 'til you're clear, make you disappear, make the next
After the ceremony, let a rhyme rest in peace
If not, my soul'll release
The scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated
I'm glad you made it
'Cause you're about to see a disastrous sight
A performance never again performed on a mic

You might also like
The R is in the house, too much tension
Make sure the system's loud when I mention
Phrases that's fearsome, you wanna hear some
Sounds that not only pounds, but please your eardrum
I sit back and observe the whole scenery
Then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me
Strictly business, I'm quickly in this
Mood and I don't care if the whole crowd's a witness
I'ma tear you apart, but I'ma spare you a heart
Program into the speed of the rhyme, prepare to start
Rhythm's out of the radius, insane as the craziest
Musical madness MC ever made, see it's
Now an emergency, open-heart surgery
Open your mind, you will find every word'll be
Furier than ever, I remain the future
Battle's temptin', whatever suits you
From words to sentence, there's no resemblance
You think you're rougher? Then suffer the consequences
I'm never dyin', terrifyin' results
I wake you with hundreds of thousands of volts
Mic-to-mouth resuscitation, rhythm with radiation
Novocain ease the pain, it might save him
If not, Eric B.'s the judge, the crowd's the jury
How do I plead to homicide? Lyrics of fury
They're gettin' furier
