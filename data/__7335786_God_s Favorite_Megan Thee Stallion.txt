10 ContributorsGod’s Favorite Lyrics
HitKidd, what it do, man? (Ayy)

Skin glowin' 'cause I hit the water in Jamaica (The water in Jamaica)
Ain't got no favor for a hater, bitch, I'm highly favored (Yeah)
I bought a crib next to my crib 'cause I ain't want no neighbors ('Cause I ain't want no neighbors)
I mind my business, I ain't trippin', God said I'm his favorite (Ayy)

Hmm, yeah, God said I'm his favorite (God said I'm his favorite)
My favorite clothes my birthday suit, they love when I get naked
My favorite drink my haters' tears, it calls for celebration, ayy
Here's a toast, who you love the most?

I'm not saying I do voodoo, but I got the magic (Got the magic)
Any time they go against me, shit gon' end up tragic (Damn)
They hatin' hard, but you know I'm prayin' evеn harder (I'm prayin' even hard)
Thе way he answer got me feelin' like his favorite daughter (Ah)
Man, you bitches dusty and your lips crusty (Crusty)
Hatin', but you want a pic, bitch, don't touch me
Face card pretty, you know God don't like ugly
Face card pretty, you know God don't like— (Hahaha)

Skin glowin' 'cause I hit the water in Jamaica (The water in Jamaica)
Ain't got no favor for a hater, bitch, I'm highly favored (Yeah)
I bought a crib next to my crib 'cause I ain't want no neighbors ('Cause I ain't want no neighbors)
I mind my business, I ain't trippin', God said I'm his favorite (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You might also like
Hmm, yeah, God said I'm his favorite (God said I'm his favorite)
My favorite clothes my birthday suit, they love when I get naked (They love when I get naked)
My favorite drink my haters' tears, it calls for celebration, ayy
Here's a toast (Yeah), who you love the most? (Who you love the most?)Embed
