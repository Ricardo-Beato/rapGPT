19 ContributorsBlock Episode Lyrics
Woke up this morning hearing shots below my project window
The TV's on from playing all night on Nintendo
Jump out of bed, tryna to see what's up with all the noise and
I see somebody else has caught a case of lead poisonin'
This type of shit around my way's a regular occurrence
Because the same shit just happened to my nigga Terrence
A week later now, somebody else is laying dying
Surrounded by a crowd of people and his momma crying
The way he's laying there, it looks to me like duke's a goner
I seen the cats who just did it run around the corner
I start to wonder who it is and why they had to wet him
I bet I knew him, or at least, I bet I probably met him
I can't pretend that I'm shocked like electrocution
'Cause any night, there could be an execution
My momma told me that that thug shit'll get you buried
The next day, there's your name in the obituary
I asked her, "Why we gotta live in this environment?"
She said, "Your grandfather drank up his retirement
Plus when I fucked around and had you, I was just a baby
Just maybe, if I wasn't being miss lady
Things could've been a little bit better"
Threw on my jeans and my double knit sweater
I hit the block tryna find out who got done in
Who had the gun and who that was I seen running
You might also like
Another body on the ground, cold; and
Another day, another lost soul; and
Same shit in every zip code
No matter where you go
Its just another block episode
Another story on the street told; and
Another turn down the wrong road; and
Sit back and watch it unfold
Yo, I'll let you know
Just another block episode
Yo, I roam the streets with my peeps and a gun by my crotch
I got beef with this cat that resides on my block
He getting popped - I swear, when I see him, it's on
He'll just be a tattoo on his best friend's arm
My friends screaming, "Punch, be calm"; y'all can save it
He borrowed five Gs two months ago, still ain't pay it
This girl hit me on the cell about his location
I grabbed my gun, jumped in the hoopty, then I started racing
Turned out the lights a block away so he don't peep the caper
I see him and a bunch of cats by the bodega
Don't wanna kill him, I just wanna teach this cat a lesson
Stepped on the gas, grabbed the gun, cocked back the weapon
Shot up the whole corner, but hit him in the kneecap
That's cool, 'cause dead niggas can't pay your cash back
I'm nuttin' to laugh at, I keep a bad temper
I hit him, a bystander, and one of his crewmembers
(gunshot)
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Last thing I heard was a blast, car circling past
I wasn't nervous, thought they might be searching for gas
Soon as Rob came out dispersing the trash
Car sped, and lead went through his windows, curtains and glass
Dove in the dirt and the grass
I look - bullet struck my right arm
Glass in my left palm, I lost my neck charm
I knew it was Punch, 'cause Rob owed him money
But never had it, always got new kicks and gear to match it
I'm in the ambulance, I thought that beef was squashed
That's why when he seen Punch he crossed the street and dodged
See Rob's records with the DA is forfeit
My records 4.0 GPA, going to Harvard
Athlete's a hundred miles and running, he's a convict
Other hand, my high school football team, I lead in yardage
Boys, regardless - blood pressure drop, artery vessel clogs
Cardiac arrest, next my chest was shocked, IV
Oxygen mask, bleeding heavily
We need to get to the hospital fast; I'm doing 70!
Why I gotta be a causality of war? Did good most my life
My career was growing gradually and more
Hearing, "Hold on, you'll be alright, you're gonna make it"
Sirens up ahead, construction on the pavement
Slowed down - from this moment, I didn't have a chance
Seein' hazards flash, can't believe I died in a traffic jam
