Lil' Cannon
Oh, oh
I'm skrrt
They looking at me like I got answers  (Uh-uh)
I don't know nuffin'

Nigga got hit in the head 12 came round
Fuck you looking at, fuck 12 nigga, pigs
Nigga I don't know nuffin'
Why the fuck a fuck nigga talkin to me, like I'm dead like
I don't know nuffin' like we don't know nuffin'
Now I'm gettin' money nigga look at me like I owe them something

But I don't know nuffin', like I don't know nuffin'
Yeah I'm gone off the lean, drink promethazine nigga I don't know nuffin' (Like I don't know nuffin')
Say I don't know nuffin', say I don't know nuffin'
Big long magazine, hit a nigga fifteen but I don't know nuffin'

 lil' nigga, with it on ya'
Better get dumbfounded on shit like I don't know nuffin' (Like we don't know nuffin')
I don't understand how a nigga be rattin' on they own damn cousin (On their own damn kinfolk)
They did that shit in my hood now a new nigga
Don't know nuffin' (God damn, god damn)
I don't fuck with a rat nigga don't fuck with a bitch nigga never
Hit a nigga up with a motherfuckin' Glock ten
Right through the leather (God damn, god damn)
Yeah I'm driving around in that new new
Yeah I got money like what (Let's get it let's get it)
And my bitch look like new new
But buff in the body, in the butt
Nigga what's up
Like I don't no nuffin'
Bout that money I know something
Ain't bout that money I don't know nuffin'
All the bitches over there, all the bitches over there

Talkin' bout your shootin' at my squad
Nigga swear to god that a bitch nigga be bluffin' (Whatever)
Yeah the bitch nigga bluffin' (Yeah, yeah)
But I don't no nuffin'
I ain't gon go on twitter tell a nigga I'm gon' kill em
'Cause I don't know nuffin' (Cop shit)
'Cause swear to god you know that the god damn cops be watchin'
So you know the god damn feds be comin'
I don't fuck with 12, I don't fuck with jake
I don't fuck with the pig, I don't fuck with the narc
Hit a nigga in his head now a nigga dead shit
Like I don't know nothin'

Bitch nigga, swear to god I don't know nuffin' (That's true)
You got work well who the fuck you frontin'
Cause if you start frontin' my squad

But I don't know nuffin',  I don't know nuffin
Yeah I'm gone off the lean, drink promethazine I don't know nuffin'
Like I don't know nuffin'
Say I don't know nuffin', say I don't know nuffin'
Big long magazine, hit a nigga fifteen

Started off with one, started off with two
Now watch a nigga go to trippin'

Like literally, like literally (Longway)
Got your bitch on me yeah she fuckin' with a lil' nigga
Lil Uzi Vert pull the trigger
Tell a bitch I be makin' money I be gettin' fifties, hundreds
Nigga I was just a feenin' (God damn)
I get a lot of mothafuckin' thangs

Dumb motherfuckin' pussy nigga
Ten niggas fuck with it (Fuck with me, fuck with me)
I'm a real nigga seveteen when I first started gettin' money

Yeah I will  when ya nigga won't wit em

Nigga just be peepin', no old people or children
Money just come and go (Come and go)
Young nigga got bankroll (Got bankroll)
Come up on me, suicidal

Nigga got hit in the head 12 round

Fuck you looking at, fuck 12 nigga, pigs
