Okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, ladies and gentlemen, settle down
Okay, so, this next brother we're gonna bring up to the stage usually does not come in on Monday nights
You're in for a real treat, ladies and gentlemen
Give it to Mr. Hall

Rip out my soul from the depths of my flesh
Flesh from my blood I caress
Right on the page so it's fresh
I take my time, but express
Lot on my mind, but I guess
It's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene
Kick in the door, we blow it off the hinge
Music my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe
It's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend
Therapist tell me I don't need to defend
Therapy tell me I don't need to explain
Just drop the record on the needle and express my pain
Can't wait until my son shine and together we reign
My queen's by my side like Manhattan
Fuck rapping, this is poetic conviction
My rendition is not meant for your diction
Battled addiction in the womb
A crack baby by definition
Keys to ignition with no permission
That mean that I'm driven
Alive 'cause I'm living
Fuck workin' with what you've been given
I knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five
And I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did
'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did
Didn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid
All I knew was alcoholism and prison
Only saw domestic violence and racial division
Social worker trying to take me away
But I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way
At least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay
Adapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay

Keep that one just in case, yeah

I'm just an entity
My DNA, not my identity
Finding serenity
Become a better man, I better be
For the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy
We get big bread
Tryin' to be the greatest, that shit been dead
I'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead
I'm trying to get ahead like a fetus
Money don't complete us, but it feed us, it can lead us to depression
Being rich is not a blessing, fame is not a blessing
Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous, I learned that lesson
What's the meaning of life, to live it, what I'm guessing

Live it, live it
Living life like this is so crazy
Hip-hop is amazing
One day, you're on top and the next, they want to erase 'em
Goddamn, what I'm facing
Every day a new frustration
People thinking I'm complacent
People thinking that I changed like a cashier
But I can't let that register, get the fuck up on out of here
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, get high as the stratosphere
I can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme
Give it up, you're out of time
Never even had a prime
Like the Preemo never linked up with 5'9"
Bitch, I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae
Okay, fuck what you gotta say
I keep it going, already know when I'm flowing
For the listener, you're kind of like a therapist
Or rather Cole in 2005, flowing like Canibus
That throwback shit, yeah, that throwback shit
Fuck what you heard, my catalog, it ain't got no wack shit
'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum, everybody wanna be him
'Til they feel like they can't be him, then they wanna see him lose
Wrote this poem in navy, that's what I call singing the blues
Word to Dot D, my family got me, no carbon copy
Life can hit you harder than Drago
But if I roll with the punches when it's rocky, don't ever stop me
Never top me, never cocky, I'm never cocky
Okay, well, maybe sometimes
Occasionally in some rhymes
But it's fine, in due time
I'm the illest to ever do it, come now, Bobby Boy, cool it
An indigenous era of the indigenous emcee
Riding this motherfucker 'til the tank on E
What's up?
(You-you-you-you-you)
(You-you), yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah (Yeah)
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah
(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)

Fuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside
I wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride
Reflecting on memories from my childhood
Bringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good
All I ever gave a fuck about was my career
But all that shit out the window now that my son is here
Fuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams
Fuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less
If it ain't 'bout my happiness, then I could give a fuck less
I remember window shopping
Now I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room
Bobby coming soon
And that's the type of line I would've second-guessed
Putting on my shit before
Out of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate
'Cause it wasn't relevant
Give a fuck if it's evident, this right here is the evidence
I'm like Leo in Revenant, bear with me
You could tear me apart
But that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart
Where it's built from the start
Where it's finna stay
I've learned every day's a good day
Surrounded by people that love me
Don't want nothing from me but my happiness
Off the internet, that's when I'm at my happiest
Scrolling so much, my thumb fucked up
We call that carpal tunnel vision
Follow me like religion on this course of collision
Feeling imprisoned, and this is my freedom through these lyrics
As I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis
All this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus
I think I finally found my paradise, that's word to Thomas52Embed
