23 ContributorsSwiss Army Lyrics
YMCMB, haha, alright

My patience wears thin with lacks of violence
Put the world on my shoulders I play it like violins
And sense, I really make none in present tense, I
Really write my lyrics in hieroglyphics, I
Really fight my lyrics can not be condensed
And the best will never feel the need to convince
My Army's offence exceeds any resistance
Be nice bitch, I just might let you meet Vince
The lights switch, so brakes are something I don't need
My reign roams, I'm Constantine with gold teeth
I play ours, realer than the words that speak in same songs
And I own every day of the week, I go hard
There's no telling where time goes
But my slow-mo flows put the world on hold
I roll like snowball effects, just watch me grow
I'm Jack Frost, I'm so cold my shadow glows

Merry Christmas you filthy animal! (Gunfire)
And Happy New Year. (Another gunshot)You might also like4Embed
