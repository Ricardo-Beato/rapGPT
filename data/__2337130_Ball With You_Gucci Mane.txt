6 ContributorsBall With You Lyrics
Whats up? Its Gucci
I just wanna ball with you, with you

I just wanna ball with you, with you, with you, with you
I just wanna have fun with you, with you, with you, with you
Have some one-on-one with you, with you, with you, with you
I just wanna spend funds with you
Fuck the mall up
Ball baby, ball baby

'Cus you talk so nasty (nasty)
And you dress so classy (so classy)
And you talk real jazzy (jazzy)
Couldn't let her get pass me (can't)
Had to buy the bitch a Louis
I keep her dressed in Gucci
You she know she fucking with Guwop
And she'll slap a bitch, Tooley
Drop top, she ruthless
That nigga broke he clueless (clueless)
And I don't worry about rumors
You know them hoes just choosin'
And you been all around the world
You'll never find another Gucci
I'll never treat you like a groupie, I never treat you like a groupie
You might also like
I just wanna ball with you, with you, with you, with you
I just wanna have fun with you, with you, with you, with you
Have some one-on-one with you, with you, with you, with you
I just wanna spend funds with you
Fuck the mall up
Ball baby, ball baby

Girl, girl, girl, it's nothing in world you don't deserve
Girl, girl, girl, I don't think that you know your worth
Girl, girl, girl, I would be so proud to make you mine
I'm telling you, your my girl

I just wanna ball with you, with you, with you, with you
I just wanna have fun with you, with you, with you, with you
Have some one-on-one with you, with you, with you, with you
I just wanna spend funds with you
Fuck the mall up
Ball baby, ball babyEmbed
