16 ContributorsDonâ€™t Get It Twisted Lyrics
Neeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrdd!
Westside, Baby, what's good?
I'm only gonna do this once, man, once
Till the album come
So, check it out

From the M-A...D-I, to the S to the O-N
Potent, to get ya open
Moving like a nigga supposed to get the dough
In the 'Go with the flow that I'm holdin'
Yo, man, they ain't "On Enuff" or up on enough
To stay in the zone that I go in
That I go in, when I go in and go in
Of the poems, that were wrote and
Crucial Conflict was smokin'
But a nigga like me, I don't be chokin'
So I proceed at a low speed, low key
Like a OG in a '03 Loc-in'
Rollin' like a OZ, in a b-leaf
Both pins, like a bowlin' ball when I ball
But I never fall for the okey-dokin'
Whitewalls and the slow-speed motion
Stash-box for the police pokin'
Rolie showin, shorty showin, Hokey Pokin'
Turnin' it around with me
To bust 'em down cause they know he golden
Exactly, I'm in it from the minute I was in it
'Til the minute that I spit it and I'm finished
And it's sad for me
Until the second wind, and reinvent it with a vengeance
Revisit it and make 'em give it back to me
You might also like
All right, that's all you get
I'm done, you know what I'm sayin'?
In the streets where the traffic be, nigga, what
Shout out to all of Chi-Town
Crucial Conflict!
Wildstyle, what's good? Coldhard, what up?
Never, what up? Kilo, what up?
Psycho Drama! The Snipers!
Do or Die! Um, let me see
Twista! C-Wall! Legit Ballaz!
Um, Traxster, what up, baby?
Um, who else out there?
Oh! Triple Darkness!
Um, Soldiers at War! Um, who else?
Y'all gotta forgive if I, if I can't remember everybody
But, y'know, there was some people that had a lotta influence
On the kid
Revenge!1Embed
