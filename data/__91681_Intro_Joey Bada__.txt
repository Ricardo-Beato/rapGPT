Back when rappers was really rappers
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs

It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
Clouds'll stay limits cuz we in em'
Eyes low, squinting, more L's but we winning
Acting like it's hard to find women when I'm in these hard to find linens
Remeber those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ends and its only the beginning
Big pimpin', foolin' dimes rob em' for they innocence
Cake like Entenmann's, flow sweet like cinnamon
He a child but they treat him like the bigger man
Cuz when the pen in his hand they big him up like he Jigga Man
Know you see em' in the mirror fam
The ones who say you ain't hot be your biggest fan, like nigga damn
Before he got popular he been da' man
With yo' chick, in the can, rollin' thru an instant gram
Got a whiff a' grands now everybody say they distant fam
Know the haters still jelly but fuck it though, it's the jam... manYou might also like3Embed
