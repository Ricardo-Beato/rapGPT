Who the fuck are you? Ayy
Who the fuck are you? Ayy
Who the fuck are you?
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my Coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
Why you walk so cool? Ayy, thousand dollar shoes, ayy
Hunnid on my jewels, ayy, I got all these groupies
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my Coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my Coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my Coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy

Why you walk so cool? Ayy, thousand dollar shoes, ayy
Fuck bitches in twos, ayy, fuck bitches in twos, ayy
Fucked that bitch on Monday, fuck her sister Tuesday
You is not gon' do a thing, with my squad like Wu-Tang, ayy
I'm gonna knuck if I buck
Let a lil' nigga try us
Hit a nigga with a truck
Leave a lil' nigga so stuck
Brittany turned me to a slut
Brittany turned me to a slut
Brittany turned me to a slut
Hit the bitch all on her back, ayy, never put it in her butt, ayy
Put that shit all in her pussy, ayy, leave that shit all in her gut, ayy

Sometimes Fear of God, ayy
Saint Laurent the boots, ayy
I feel like I'm Dro, ayy, car ain't got no roof, ayy
That bitch kinda cute, ayy, blow me like a flute, ayy
Diamonds drippin', they so wet, I gotta wipe my jewels, ayy
I can't wife no fool, ayy, got no time for mood swings
Spent like 50 on the ring and I brought two rings
Remember that bitch ain't want fuck me
Now that bitch wanna just fuck me
Remember that bitch said I'm dusty
Look at that hoe, like, "You ugly", ayy
Your man ain't got no money, ayy
I just be smokin' the dope, Skeme, he be smokin' the clove
My brother whippin' the stove
Jump in the crowd at my show, fucked the bitch in the front row
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my Coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
Why you walk so cool? Ayy, thousand dollar shoes, ayy
Hunnid on my jewels, ayy, I got all these groupies
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my Coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my Coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy

Cannon, Cannon went crazy
Treez, what up Treez?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, uh
Hotel party for these bad hoes
For these bad hoes, that trip
Ayy, ayy74Embed
