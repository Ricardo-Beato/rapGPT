14 ContributorsNever See Lyrics
Yea
If Trap Music ain't motherfuckin hip-hop
I can't tell my nigga
Cause y'all doin' what we does
It's Gucci, Shawty Red nigga
Let's go

A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen (I've never seen)
A bitch I can't catch I will never see (I'll never see)
She come around me, she won't wanna leave (won't wanna leave)
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The feel so strong, make you breach a tear
The smoke so strong, higher down the tree

I'm a Success story, take a look at my journey
In a trap house full of niggas, tryna get them some money
Remix, fix fake bails, pills and dummies
RIP my uncle Sunny and my homeboy Lonny
I trick so many people, should go church on Sunday
But I would be a hypocrite because the work come Monday
I grew up so fucked up, that's I'm oh so cunning
And I can honestly tell you niggas that I'm so dishonest
Let's give a shout out to the ducks, in the world I punish
You think Gucci give a fuck, you got one thing coming
If you's a buster, me and you have nothing in common
Trap house, stash house, all I rap bout money
It's Gucci
You might also like
A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen (I've never seen)
A bitch I can't catch I will never see (I'll never see)
She come around me, she won't wanna leave (won't wanna leave)
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The pill so strong, make you grit your teeth
The smoke so strong, higher than the tree

Futuristic wrist watch if you rollie tic toc
Then it's not a rollie, hold your rollie it to the tip top
Six shot, big shot, top down but tits out
Rolls Royce, drop top, call Alfred Hitchcock
I miss Big, I miss Pac
She walked out, she bitched out
She suck the dick non-stop
I think I hit the jackpot
She act out, she ashed out
We ranned out, you're handout
Rappers say they stand out
But yet they got they hand out
If trap music ain't hip-hop
Then Gucci Mane ain't hip-hop
Humble county grow houses then we have a great crop
Hard in the paint trap but nigga I can blake out
They shorted me 300, But I served his ass a shake ounce
A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen (I've never seen)
A bitch I can't catch I will never see (I'll never see)
She come around me, she won't wanna leave (won't wanna leave)
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The feel so strong, make you breach a tear
The smoke so strong, higher down the tree1Embed
