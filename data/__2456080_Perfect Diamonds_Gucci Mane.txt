5 ContributorsPerfect Diamonds Lyrics
This little watch of mines is like a diamond mine
Call it perfect timing, it got perfect diamonds
It's a light of mine, it's supposed to shine
Better Close Your Blinds or shawty Hold Your Eyes
Burrr, Burrr, fly perfect timing, it got purple diamonds call it Perfect Diamonds
You better close your blinds, you better hold your eyes
And hater close ya eyes...

I Got A White Car, Same Color my white Broad
Plus I got a white watch, Plus I got them white rocks
414 my roll dog, told that nigga Go Hard
So Icey The Ice Boy, Chain is in The Paint Shop
Catch Me in my Tanktop, Gresham at the Hotspot
Bouldercrest I won't stop, block go Tick-Tock
Plus I Got Them 3 blocks, Diamond Like A earring
Watch Cost 200, The Woman Is Near Me
I Don't Think You Hear me, My Jewelry is talking
Girlfriend is Stalking Me, breaking what it cost be
Jacob cost me 60, My J Cost Me A Ticket
Light little One, Say I'm Into Karasilin
Mama Pay Attention, Ridin In My Bentley
Burr Burr Look At Him, Matter Fact Look At Him
So Icey Gucci Mane, Quarter-Mil on my arm
So Icey Gucci Mane, Quarter-Mil on my charm
Gucci!

Gucci is a dumb dude, but he got a old-School
Frost Misty, my gold Tooth, my necklace is So Cool
Juiceman got a chain too, and he got a H2
Bought it for his deal cause That nigga is a trap Fool
Bitches fucked the Whole crew, you can Hear My New-New
Gucci And The Kid Whoo, got something to tell you
Frenchie got a watch Too, Walter Like To Fight You
And We Like to Shoot You, Lawyer Is A Damn Jew
And He Got A Watch Too, So he like the clock too
Ooh Gucci So Cute, Ooh Baby Not You
Ooh I Am On You, Watch Cost Me Bout 2
Gucci How About You? Bitches love my Tattoo
Ooh I Am So Blue, Plugged In, Dope Too
Bouldercrest Road Fresh, Show Gresham Road Too
It's Gucci...
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh, Bouldercrest Road
Burrr Burrr Burrr Burrr
Please Adjust The Temperature, Gucci Southern Hemisphere
I'm Icey With My Winter Fur, Wow Blinging Right Now

But You Could Call Me Light House2Embed
