They thought I was gone, back from the grave
Mind of a master, blood of a slave
Heart of a king, stuck in between
The devil and an angel on my shoulder when I speak
Lost in the streets, found on the beat
Still kept a clip, asked, and got it for cheap
Now I'm in the world where they pray for the weak
Stand-up niggas take shots to the knees
Lord, have mercy, pray for me
Need to calm down, so pass me the weed
Got me stressed out, situations look bleak
Time's runnin' out, how'd my days turn to weeks?

Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in my drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up

I'ma keep goin', you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
I'ma keep goin', you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never

Every other day, always some shit
I'm the underdog but I'm never over it
Gotta keep a grip when the rent due
Niggas tryna get you for every last cent
Ain't no pretend, ain't tryna make amends
Just tryna keep my legacy, I'm legend in the end
So never try the scene, 'cause you could get bent
'Cause I protect mine from beginning to the end
Lord, have mercy, pray for me
Distanced from my friends, enemies close to me
Gotta stay at work, things change in a blink
Gotta stay woke, they all in a deep sleep

Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in my drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up3Embed
