22 ContributorsMillion Dollar Liq Lyrics
I met a new Migo, he said he got kilos
I met a new Migo, he said he got kilos

I met a new Migo, he said he got kilos
He asked me how much can I move, and I told him a few
I'm 21 Savage, I rob all my plugs, and he don't have a clue
He told me, they touch down in a week or two, so be ready to move
A week or two passed, he pulled up with bricks
I'm looking like shit, I'm finna be rich
I took a brick, took a nine out and turned it back into a brick
And it's still coming back, nigga, I got the cleanest dope in the six
I got clean dope down, big Migo, he just changed my life
If he pull up with a hunnid, I might have to take his life
ManMan caught him at the back door, he was looking like
"Papi, why you wanna cross me? I thought you was on my side"
I told you, pussy-nigga, Young Savage with the bullshit
Running off with niggas work, bitch, I'm with the bullshit
I'm a backstabber, but I'm really not with the cool shit
I think the fuck shit that I'm on should be a movement

Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
I just wanna hit a motherfucking million dollar lick
With a million dollar lick, you can fuck a bad bitch
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
I just hit a million dollar lick, and went and ice my wrist
I just hit a million dollar lick and brought it to the bricks
You might also like
I just hit a million dollar lick, million dollar shit
I just robbed a Migo for his bricks, now I'm serving bricks
Got your , got your , juugin' every chance I get
If I'm down bad, then give 'em  take a shit
I took the plug on a your through the six, on some chill shit
Ever since they  valid, then I've been on ill shit
Born in the South, so you know I'm on that drill shit
Bitch, I'm ManMan Sav' so you know I'm on that trill shit
I've been with robbin' niggas in the cut, nigga, get up
Led that plug to threw the job and let that nigga get up
Ain't no face, no case, I know some niggas quick to spray you up
I let off fifty shots and  pick those bullets up
I done came up, I ain't changed up
Still on the same shit, I know some niggas done changed up
I ain't with that gang shit but, nigga, I stay strapped up
Usually I don't rob the plug but, nigga, shit done changed up

Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
I just wanna hit a motherfucking million dollar lick
With a million dollar lick, you can fuck a bad bitch
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
I just hit a million dollar lick, and went and ice my wrist
I just hit a million dollar lick and brought it to the bricks2Embed
