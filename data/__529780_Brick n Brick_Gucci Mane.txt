12 ContributorsBrick n Brick Lyrics
Young niggas with these old dubs
Got a young bitch and I'm hood rich
Brought old money to this new club
In this strip club getting group hugs
I got ? keys I got fresh weed
Party real hard on Venice Beach
458 Italia, but ain’t nothing Italian about me
The last nigga you had he spared ya
Baby girl I'll overwork ya
Ain’t nothing can prepare ya, and I ain’t even trying to scare ya
When you walk around the 6 be careful
These niggas might snatch your hair from you
Tell your mother say a prayer
'Cause a nigga might snatch your air from ya
Let me tell ya something about me
Thirteen year old's already a O.G
Selling big weed
Big bra send me thirty P’s
Steal the shirt right off your back I'm a fucking thief
J's up the street, call me black with the gold teeth
Pistol whip your cousin now a nigga got no teeth
Keep it brief, where you speak
'Cause you talkin' to a chief
Shootin' like I'm Chief Keef
Kick you with your own feet
Shoot you with yo own gun
Running from your own peace
Rob ya dead put some change on yo kill you with your own cheese
Long money, long gun short pace and short sleeve
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
You might also like
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, bri-bri-brick and a brick
Bri-bri-brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick and a brick and a brick
Then I put, then I, then I put that in my Rollie

She goin' Pedro
My Migos no Quavo
Diego got yayo
My bitch looking like J-Lo
My diamonds Bugatti
They drip like a faucet
Got bucks like Jabari
God damn, my plug in Milwaukee
I got nuggets like Quincy Miller
I'm dealing, go figure
I throw it like Philip Rivers from SD to fillers
Got them hawks just like ?
Got them dolphins from Florida
I own them Hornets like Jordan
How you think I copped this foreign
Sellin' brick after bricky
My Rollie watch match my pinkie
I'm gettin' bread like I'm pinkie
I'm smoking kush and I'm stinkin'
Flipping bricks
Hittin' licks
Hunnids blue like a Crip
Red bottoms on my kicks
On my way to chop the bricky
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, bri-bri-brick and a brick
Bri-bri-brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick, man, I put that in my Rollie
Brick and a brick and a brick and a brick
