3 ContributorsSo I Lyrics
Yo, Hav, come here
Tell 50 to come here, listen to this shit
Aight, aight
Yeah, yeah, a true story 'bout a bum ass nigga
Who became the world's richest bum ass nigga
Haha, woooo, word up
Fuck all you niggas
A-yo

Man, I've been fucked up for so long, and now I'm rich
All of 'em broke niggas that I used to fuck with
Got that look in they eyes, got that scheme on they face
When I pop up around the way like shit changed
Look here: Don't make me put yo' brains on display
You niggas never gave a fuck about P
Now it's all about me, and why I don't break bread
Where do we sleep, and how can we break in?
Is he in his Jeep? Or maybe it's the Porsche?
Let's catch him in the V, and tear the nigga all up
No, I don't think so
I'm all in my mirrors and out my windows
I get up out the car with the Desert Eagle
Shorty don't like me, said I got a ego (Let's get him, let's get him)
So she tell niggas they should stick me
Gassin' niggas up to make history
So they take the jooks so they can make the books
But I banged the heat when they came for me, like
You might also like
Niggas think they so big
P make a lil blood spill
Now you punk ass niggas know
If you fucks with me, it's a must you bleed

Catch me New York cruisin'
Stick in a movie, smokin' that Sour Diesel
Won't point every time that I blew it
Nice gamin', homie, it's foolish, don't think about it, just do it
I'll put ya through it like that hurricane that ran through Houston
You ain't shootin', you ain't scarin' nothin', y'all just flukes
Robbin' niggas, strip they ass to they birthday suit
I never picked grapes, but I cut me a bunch
I'm that nigga in the club watchin' yo' ass get duffed
Niggas wanna hang up once they finally got bored with us
And they baby momma sluttin' out there on tour with us
Pass it to the homie once a nigga get bored wit' her
Almost couldn't nut 'cause your ass got caught in her
Duke frontin', come on, baby, you ain't got no guns
All you got is that rusty ass Revolver, son
And you can't fool me, I know they borrowed, nigga
Niggas think that they ill, but the Mobb is iller
You know the game
