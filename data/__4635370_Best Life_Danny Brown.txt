La la la la la, la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la, la la la la (Sugar sweet, let's shine)

Came from the sewer where hot dogs got boiled
Right up in the same pot unc' cooked the rock
Went from flippin' on mats to flippin' them sacks
Hide and seek, send spots to out on, we sell crack, facts
War on drugs was a chess game
Was a pawn, guns drawn on my front lawn
Just a young nigga, starin' down the corner
Checkin' out the hustlers with the latest kicks on 'em
Know a nigga want, mama ain't got it
Fuckin' up in school, lyin', what she know about it?
I was just a young nigga, know what I was headed for
Jumped off the porch, really, I wasn't ready for it
Get up out the hood, find a way out
Route I'm on, either death or jail house
Wanna get away from all this stress
For me, mama just wanted the best (Uh)

'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
Livin' my best life
'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
I'm livin' my best life
You might also like
Let the past be the past like a bitch with a ass
Left you for a nigga with cash, came back
Ass fatter, lookin' better than ever
Talkin' 'bout gettin' back together
Nigga, I'm 'bout to smash (Uh)
I'm a bad whatchamacallit, used to blow out the toilet
After lockdown in the county, smoking squares with my bunkie
You the type to cry and yell out "'Torney!"
Not supposed to be here, dead, like Weekend at Bernie's
Used to bag up the weed and live off of the coke
By myself in the spot and I never got lonely
Shit, you could ask all of my homies
Caught the bus with some stacks, and I kept the heater on me
(Uh)

La la la la la, la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la, la la la la (Sugar sweet, let's shine)

'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
Livin' my best life
'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
I'm livin' my best life
Livin' my best life
I'm livin' my best life, I'm livin' my best life
'Cause ain't no next life, so I'm livin' my best life
I'm livin' my best life10Embed
