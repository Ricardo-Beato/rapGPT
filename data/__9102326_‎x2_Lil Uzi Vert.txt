All black like it's Kray
This shit is too cray

Shoutout to Tay-K, man, it’s time I did the race
I knew I was a star as many times I drove the Wraith
I just had a seizure from that top, she made me shake (Woah)
This shit way too—

Cray, cray (Tubular)
Cray, cray (Radical, she made me shake)
Cray, cray (She made me shake, she made me shake)
Shit goin' too crazy, I lost my breath
Let's go

This shit is too cray

Step in this bitch with my boots untied, I feel safe 'cause I got all of the steppers
Most of these niggas out here be façades, never ever they could step in my sector
Please give me my credit 'fore I'm gone, hey, dude (Yeah)
Chopper on my body hang all way down to my shoes
If it's stuck, it's up just like it's some glue
Diamonds in my mood ring just to change my mood
I got fangs in my mouth, but stare at the moon
I fuck with the vamps, but I'm werewolf times two (Yeah)
Twilight, twilight moon
I fuck with the vamps, but I'm werewolf times two (Yeah)
Twilight, twilight moon
I fuck with the vamps, but I'm werewolf times two

Yeah
Huh?
It's Lil Uzi Vert
