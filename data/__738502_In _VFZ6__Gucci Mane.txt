6 ContributorsIn (VFZ6) Lyrics
Got them pints in, tell me what you want to spend
Is you drinking? These niggas know I got that med
Got that cake and, Imma put that FN on your friend
What he thinking? I bet he won’t try that shit again

F is for Fendi, this FN is my firearm
My four second assassin, let bygones be bygones
Ice cream on my right cheek, tattoos on my right arm
Cold blooded like a python, and my auntie stole my ball
I’m fresh greeting these Barkley’s, got a quarter pound of these broccolis
And the neighbors can watch me, but the police can’t stop me
Fuck trying out for JV, Marcell up in the hot seat
I’m in the ninth grade, fucking seniors, so I gotta still borrow car keys
I’m lowkey but I mostly, be with niggas that sell Ds
Smoke weed, I still cough, street  doing nine to three
 sound, that was 92, 91, where was you
8 ball jacket in middle school, always had something to prove
Ease off of these ice cubes, yeah I’m a nigga with an attitude
Cartier, I bought a pair, head so good got to hold her hair
Give her 500, that’s more than fair, brought attention so she got to stare
Woke up in the morning, I was out of there
Gucci Mane, the real Laflare

Got them pints in, tell me what you want to spend
Is you drinking? These niggas know I got that med
Got that cake and, Imma put that FN on your friend
What he thinking? I bet he won’t try that shit again
You might also like
Mid end, it’s packed in, the back end of the caravan
Dudes speak  they understand, got rubber bands on rubber bands
Fuck your girl, one night stand, had her on her knees while I stand
Paint her face and her chin then never call that bitch again
Getting money my operation, getting money no hesitation
Super charge, you were made for racing
Sport rims, sport breaking
Kicking juugs all down at 
1000 for these niggas, come from 
I got em now so fuck waiting, you cash out, fuck debating
Fucked up a dime at the station, I’m counting money and contemplating
Glock 40 for any situation, I know how to equal the equation
Know I’m high, my eyes glazing, if you running then I’m chasing
Letting it go, that Glock blazing
Mask on, Vorhees, Jason
I’m running through it, thumbing through it
Serve him a dummy brick, he wish he knew it
Before he got to his state line, I was counting money, having a great time
Smoking great pound with a bitch that was real thick, you know this bitch fine
Served one nigga like two times, came back and ate about two nines

Got them pints in, tell me what you want to spend
Is you drinking? These niggas know I got that med
Got that cake and, Imma put that FN on your friend
What he thinking? I bet he won’t try that shit agai nEmbed
