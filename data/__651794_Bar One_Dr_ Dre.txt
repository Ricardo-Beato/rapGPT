21 ContributorsBar One Lyrics
Damn girl, it is hotter than a motherfucker up in here
You got that right
I need to go to the bar and get me a drink, please
Yes
Hello
Yeah, what the fuck you want?
Hmm
Let me get a Cosmo
What the fuck you want?
Damn, I'll have an apple martini
This motherfucker drunk as a mother
Thirsty bitches
This a drunken-ass nigga
Oh, ooh, shit girl, those niggas are looking over here! Oh shit, don't look, don't look
Damn, what's up, what they look like though?
Shit, shit, damn, they look, they look aight
