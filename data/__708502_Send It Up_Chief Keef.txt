Sosa, baby
Glo Gang, baby
Blood Gang, baby
Fifth Gang, baby
Sit Gang, baby
Get It Gang, baby

I'm that nigga, I squeeze triggas
I'ma tell you one time, not again ya
This shit i mean it, no pretend ya
I up this mothafucka, send this bitch up
Let it hit ya, I won't miss ya
I got aim mothafucka, I'm gon' hit ya
Send this bitch up, send this bitch up
We ain't playin' mothafucka
We send this shit up

There ya go boy, yeah ya know boy
I'm a Glo boy, used to be a O boy
I was on the front boy, slangin' coke boy
The feds knocked on my grandma's door boy
Where ya coke boy, cause my choppa down
Let this mothafucka catch it, you catch choppa rounds
Where ya drugs at, where your lots of pounds
See you flexin' on IG but do you got it now
My chain like bling-blow, my watch like bling-blow
Let a nigga try to take it, my gun go bang-bow
What I'm smoking loud, what you smoking mild
In the club and I got my pipe on me now
You might also like
I'm that nigga, I squeeze triggas
I'ma tell you one time, not again ya
This shit i mean it, no pretend ya
I up this mothafucka, send this bitch up
Let it hit ya, I won't miss ya
I got aim mothafucka, I'm gon' hit ya
Send this bitch up, send this bitch up
We ain't playin' mothafucka
We send this shit up

Send this bitch up, bitch I'm from the 'Go
I been jumped up off the porch, jumped off the bungalow
I smoke lots of dope, walkin' a tightrope
It's cold outside, I got my pole I know
Pulled up to a Wokcano, to get some curry doe
I'm a curry eatin' mothafucka, hurry ho
Walked into the bank, right before he close
And then I got that gwap and then I hurried home
'Member when I was young, my mom told me hurry home
Now I'm grown, I can buy my momma 30 homes
I still got my 30 holmes, think you sweet you'll be buried holmes

I'm that nigga, I squeeze triggas
I'ma tell you one time, not again ya
This shit i mean it, no pretend ya
I up this mothafucka, send this bitch up
Let it hit ya, I won't miss ya
I got aim mothafucka, I'm gon' hit ya
Send this bitch up, send this bitch up
We ain't playin' mothafucka
We send this shit up12Embed
