9 ContributorsSwerve Lyrics
Ayy, one thing for certain
I'm an eagle, not a bird
Believe that, boy, you heard?
Bitch, that's my word
Nigga, mark my word
Pulling up on the curb
Hop out, thots on my nerves
Cops come, hop in and swerve

Hop in my car and go skrrt skrrt (Come on)
I be flying like a bird
Thought I was in that red V
I was in that Bimmer
'Member waiting on the first and the third
Thot top me, know I had to swerve
In my car where I'm smoking reefer
I am up, girl, I'm not no sleeper

Ayy, one thing for certain
I'm an eagle, not a bird
Believe that, boy, you heard?
Bitch, that's my word
Nigga, mark my word
Pulling up on the curb
Hop out, thots on my nerves
Cops come, hop in and swerve

Teacher said I wasn't gon' amount to shit, couldn't believe her
'Cause now I can fuck my teacher
Not a follower, bitch, I'm a leader
Got cash, fuck your bitch when I see her
Too many blunts, I might have a seizure
She said she selling, I don't wanna see her
Two hundred on this Bimmer meter
You know I had to basketball seat her

Ayy, one thing for certain
I'm an eagle, not a bird
Believe that, boy, you heard?
Bitch, that's my word
Nigga, mark my word
Pulling up on the curb
Hop out, thots on my nerves
Cops come, hop in and swerveEmbed
