39 ContributorsXO Lyrics
You and me, I'm curious to see
Could we be everything you need?
You don't have to go, go, go
We can be alone, alone, together in this

Yeah, uh, yeah
She just walks, and talks to the noise in her heads
Safe in the middle but destroys at the edge
Burns up the nest and poisons the eggs
When the sound hits the ground, the tone seems to beg
For the dark, wanna dart but it's too hard to march
When your heart's nailed down to the "start, on your mark"
Then a spark but she parked, too caught up in the blitz
To risk ripping them apart
So she wanna stay, on a high tonight to survive
The eyes pry wide down the manor
Opening the face to be gouache and awash in the glow
Of the faraway souls of downtown Atlanta
My report, a million similar souls signalling
Hoping to be a synonym for now
Put in a pill again when it drowns, when the night comes 'round
And the sky opens up and the lights come, down

Fluorescent, iridescent
Are you gonna take it all away?
Fluorescent, luminescent
Are you gonna take it all away?
You might also like
You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Come too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Gone too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)

Uhh, she just runs, and comes to the back of the beginning
Which once was the happiness of winning
The killing contrived the inner vibe, tried to fill her in size
But didn't survive the attack of other feelings
Cracking at the seals, life-hacking it, backing it
Something real as the key to the ease of the bees in the ceilings
Fauceting all the things down from the dark clouds
The valve house, canals, the foul, the undependents 'til it breaks
The surge, tsunamis down advantages
Knocking down establishments, washing out the catalyst of fate
Weight filling the room, moon, the moon
And the wanderlust stuck in downtown Los Angeles
(A report!) A billion similar souls signalling
Hoping to be a synonym for now
Put in a pill again when it drowns when the night comes 'round
And the sky opens up and the lights come, down
Fluorescent, iridescent
Are you gonna take it all away
Fluorescent, luminescent
Are you gonna take it all away

You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Gone too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)

They're right where I stay
Surround us
In the revend night babe
They found us
Fluorescent, iridescent
Are you gonna take it all away?
Fluorescent, luminescent
Are you gonna take it all away?

Uhh, they combed Earth to seek out a soul to research
Identify the atoms united to make it work
Then wreck it, re-order, re-organize and perfect it
Then let it, forget it, then stepping into the method
Let it shed its aesthetics into ascetic
State of ethics vetted to better his new genetics
Medics, headed where warfare's kinetic
The square's self aware and dares to self edit
And pregnant, batters, data no longer matters
Platters shatters scatters the fragments all on fanatics
Damage, managed to still be able to feel
Some of the long lost magic of downtown Damascus
Infinity, similar souls signalling
Hoping to be a synonym for now
Put in a pill again when it drowns when the night comes 'round
And the sky opens up and the lights come, down
You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Gone too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (X-XO)
You and me, ecstasy (XO)
'Round and 'round, we can't slow down
Gone too far, we can't stop now (X-X-XO)6Embed
