You might also like
(Quavo)
Look at my dab (Dab)
Everybody sayin' dab (Dab)
Trap niggas on the map (Trap)
Trap niggas like to dab (Trap)
Trap niggas in the bowl (Uh)
Trap niggas on the stove (Ayy)
Trap niggas worldwide (Worldwide)
Play with the power with no eyes (Eyes)
Dabbin' goin' in the dictionary (Dab)
Birds sangin' just like Mary Mary (Brr)
The bricks got wings like the tooth fairy (Bricks)
Pinky ring yellow canary (Ring)
Touchdown on the Pack and I run it like Barry
Migo like Ed, Edd and Eddy
You mad 'bout your hoe but that's petty
Spray the chopper like confetti
Look at my dab, got me feelin' like I'm Fab
Look at my dab, spreadin' dab across the map (Oh)
I'm dabbin' when I walk up in the trap
I look at the pot, I'm like "get in there!" (Get in there)
I play with the water need swimwear (Swim)
Look at my dab, get in there! (Get in there)

Look at my dab, dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab

Look at my dab, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Look at my dab
Get in there, get in there
Got me dabbin', Yung Rich Nation gear
Lookin' like I'm not from 'round here
Young nigga dabbin' out the atmosphere
You niggas still sayin' swag
My niggas switched it up we call it dab
Step out with a light dab I call it a jab
Michael Jordan I'm perfecting my craft
No money counter, count it up with my hands
Young nigga, I can show you how to do math
Sippin' on drank and I pour up some muddy
My nigga not tryin' to remember my past
Don't come to my hood if you ain't got a pass
Eat up the dab like linguini and crab
Mr. McMahon, I fire you and your staff
Watchin' you niggas dabbin' made me laugh (Haha)
Dabbin' is a way of fashion
Touchdown like I'm Takeoff McFadden
Call a play like I'm Takeoff John Madden
Should get a platinum plaque from all this dabbin'
You niggas should get a Grammy, the way you actin'
Enough of that swag I put it in a casket
Look at my dab, yo bitch droppin' her panties
I feel fantastic, immaculate dabbin'
Stay off my grass, call me Takeoff Stanley
Look at my dab, dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Get in there, get in there, bitch dab
Look at my dab

So now niggas dabbin'
Before it was swaggin'
Nigga thinkin' that it's just a dance
When dabbin' is a way of fashion
See I'm tryin' to teach y'all the rules and regulations
Cause there's a lot of niggas out here perpetrating
No temptations, Migos sensation
Seen a lot of faces, why not make a Young Rich Nation, ayy!8Embed
