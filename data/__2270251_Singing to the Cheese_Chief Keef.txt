26 ContributorsSinging to the Cheese Lyrics
Hopped on the road and let's go get that money
I pull up hopped out and I'm smoking on Chronic
Explain this to me boy how you allergic to money?
You can't be allergic to them 50s and 100s
I pull up hopped out and I'm reeking of weed
I pull the racks out and I'm reeking them G's
I pull the guap out and I'm singing them G's
Like Ba-da-ba-ba-ba singing to the cheese

Boy ya know, pissy wrist pissy throat
My pissy finger, pissy ear get pissy hoes
My palm itching plenty guap get plenty o's
You think it's sweet them weapons I get plenty those
I want some head this nigga bitch she 1-10
I want some grands, want some millions
Want some billions, don't want no friends
Want some weed, want some killers
I want some streets, want some houses, want some buildings
I pull up flex a nigga like "Gotta be kidding me"
I got the Tec the P11 it gotta be with me
Don't be against me boy you better be with me
You better call the SWAT and they better come get me
Bitch I'm rich but I still got that savage in me
I'm high as fuck bitch I got two 7s in me
Point out the fuck nigga think he better than me
This Sons of Anarchy, I got the Jax up in me

Hopped on the road and let's go get that money
I pull up hopped out and I'm smoking on Chronic
Explain this to me boy how you allergic to money?
You can't be allergic to them 50s and 100s
I pull up hopped out and I'm reeking of weed
I pull the racks out and I'm reeking them G's
I pull the guap out and I'm singing them G's
Like Ba-da-ba-ba-ba singing to the cheese

Like biddy-bop-ba-bop singing to the cheese
Like Sosa Wonder I be with the keys
Call Me Sosa Ray Charles or Sosa r&B
Told yo bitch come here call me Sosa Scorpion
Call me Sosa Subzero I'm the man with the Big Glo
Call me Sosa Liu Kang I'm the man with the kicks on
Call me Sosa Budokai I'm the nigga with the Dragon Ball
Call me Sosa Yu Gi Oh I'm the nigga with the dragon card

Hopped on the road and let's go get that money
I pull up hopped out and I'm smoking on Chronic
Explain this to me boy how you allergic to money?
You can't be allergic to them 50s and 100s
I pull up hopped out and I'm reeking of weed
I pull the racks out and I'm reeking them G's
I pull the guap out and I'm singing them G's
Like Ba-da-ba-ba-ba singing to the cheese4Embed
