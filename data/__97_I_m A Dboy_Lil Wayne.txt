40 ContributorsIâ€™m A Dboy Lyrics
Yeah
Okay, I'm strapped
Get 'em
Black hat (Yeah), black shades (Yeah)
Black diamonds (Yeah), oh, behave (Haha)
No, he can't with the bucket seats back
Got the paint job dope and the fuckin' seats crack

I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power
I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power, I'm gone

Thinking of a master plan
I get money, but I'm thinking of a faster plan
I'm tryna cash it in
I got five in that garbage can
And the wrap Saran, I need cash advance
See, I know three sold, the other two a jam
I'ma sit on one and whip the other one much as I can
Hot-ass fuckin' sedan
Windows rolled down, no sound
Them bricks got the speakers drowned
I ain't listenin' for shit but sirens
I ain't tryna get to my ship sunk, fuck you pirates
I'll touch you cowards, it ain't nothing to a boss
The niggas in the hood tryna floss and ya head got a cost, nigga
Take a loss, nigga, SS 55 all-black with the top chopped off that
Catch me in the spots where the shots pop off at
I ain't tryna prove nothin', I'm just tryna move somethin'

I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power
I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power, I'm gone

See, we cooking up a thousand grams (Thousand grams)
I'm in the kitchen over the stove with pots and pans (With the pots and pans)
Triple color with the platinum jams (The platinum jams)
Fifty birds, homeboy, in the back of a van (Bitch)
A hundred grand in rubber bands (In rubber bands)
We got them birds in the coffee cans (In the coffee can)
We got the whips with the extra clips (Yeah, nigga)
Got bitches outta state, nigga, flippin' them bricks (Flippin' them bricks)
Been in the Caddy, been in the alley (Uh-huh)
Nigga been on the block (Yeah), right in front Miss Gladys (Right in front Miss Gladys)
Nigga know about hustlin' ('Bout hustlin'), know about stuntin' ('Bout stuntin')
Did the curb-serving (Yeah), shined every summer (Bitch)
Been on front, been in the back (Yeah, nigga)
Nigga roll with duct tape and ride with the MAC (Pow, bitch)
We see these haters like, "Fuck them niggas" (Like, "Fuck them niggas")
We made-men millionaire, hustlin' our nature
I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power
I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power, I'm gone

8 a.m., open my eyes
Yeah, kick my bitch, tell her open the blinds
And I'm over the stove at 9
Yeah, I'm cookin' breakfast for the block, then I let her cook mine, yeah
Quick line in the bathroom 'fore we bounce
Not me, I mean her, she go a day an ounce, damn
Y'all pray for her
While I'm at the bus station in the Bentley sittin' low as I wait for ya
I'm gettin' dough, I'm a paperboy
I will take you for the right paper, boy
I will take her, shake her, tape her waist up
Send her to the money, she be back before I wake up, hah
Get your cake up, y'all niggas lame ducks
You probably get your game up when I'm givin' the game up
My name Wayne, what? Hot Boy, flame up
You niggas tryna change up and I'm gettin' my change up
I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power
I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power, I'm goneEmbed
