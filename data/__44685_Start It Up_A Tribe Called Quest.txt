Yo, yo, I hope y'all ready
Are ya ready? Here we go
What ya deal with? Uh
What ya deal with? What ya deal with?
Turn me up some more

Incognito, speakin', to ya
Feel this, have it, makin', music
Men and, women, boys and, girls and
Welcome to the movement, the fifth with improvement
Aristotle, Plato, Freud
Yeah right, Abstract, never, void
I make it, easy, for y'all to boogie down to
Hard to the ground, ooh, the Tribe with the sound boo
Touch me, tease me, feed me, squeezy
Take it, easy, never, sleazy
Promise, that I, will not, answer
The phone when it rings, love, while we do out thing, love
Never, fakin', enslave, spirits
Through the, music, is our, mission
Money's, cool, but not, cooler
Than a ghetto rebel risin' to overthrow a ruler
Dearly, beloved, dearly, departed
There's a, reason, why we, did it
Cause it's inside the body and the hearts
So here we are fam, let's start, c'mon

Don't beat me in the head with the bullshit bat
C'mon everybody, let's start (Uh, yo)
Don't beat me in the head with the bullshit bat
C'mon everybody, let's start (C'mon)

Ummah, Mos, Jane Doe, Willy
Punchline, Wordsworth, SV, Chrissy
S.O.S., Tribe Called Quest
Get it off your chest, say it (Tribe Called Quest!)
Can you, feel it, when it, hit right?
Can you, feel it, when we, do it?
Truth, power, taste, devour
Niggas in the street, here comes the illest beat now
Move, oceans, with your, mental
Think it, do it, be it, embellish
Here's another point for everyone to relish
When Ski busts his tools, all y'all foes will embellish
For somethin', wicked, at y'all, faces
What I, see is, longin', needin'
Hey I got you with that good stuff
And ya probably won't get enough
Ayo, lyrics, I got it, lyrics, cadence
Do it, with fun, and, patience
Funky, rhythmic, characteristic
Ebonically lingustic with the ghetto futuristic
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
With the bullshit bat
C'mon everybody, let's start
Don't beat me in the head with the bullshit bat (Ghetto futuristic)
C'mon everybody, let's start

Beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head
Don't beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head
Don't beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head
Don't beat me in the head, head, head, head
So here we are fam, let's start
So here we are fam, let's start
So here we are fam let's start
To The Ummah family, let's start
Ayo, get off your ass and let's start
Uh, ayo, here we are fam, let's start
C'mon, get off your ass and let's start
Here we are fam, let's start
Here we is fam, let's start
Get off your ass and let's start
Here we are fam, let's start
Get off your ass-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
And let's start2Embed
