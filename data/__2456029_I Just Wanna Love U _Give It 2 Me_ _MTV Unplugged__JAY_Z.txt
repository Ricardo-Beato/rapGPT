Hov
Uh huh Hov
Oh right up top huh
Slow it down

I'm a hustler baby, (Hov)
I just want you to know, (Hov)
It ain't where I been, (Take em up)
But where I'm bout to go, (top of the world!)
Now I just wanna love you, (You know I love you)
But be who I am, (you know you love me)
And with all this cash
You'll forget your man
Now give it to me
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)
But don't fool with me
(C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)

When the Remy's in the system, ain't no tellin
Will I 'em will I diss 'em, that's what they be yellin
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin, I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Crist', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
"And I wish I never met her at all..."
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth Mart jeans, take that off
You might also like
Give it to me
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)
I said give it to me
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)

Yeah, save the narrative, you savin it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you savin it for carats
You wanna see how far I'mma go
How, much I'mma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Crist', (but that about it)
Might light your wrist, (but that about it)
OK, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice
Know how to work your hips and your priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's sold
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me
Give it to me
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)
I said give it to me
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)

I'm a hustler baby, (Hov)
I just want you to know, (Hov)
It ain't where I been
But where I'm bout to go
Now I just wanna love you
But be who I am
And with all this cash
You'll forget your man
Now give it to me
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)
But don't fool with me
(C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Ro-mancing girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah, to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L.A., Bubblin' in Dublin
Can't deny me, why would you want to
You need me, why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me, Hov'!
Give it to me
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)
I said give it to me
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)
You gotta give it to me
Give it here, don't say nothing
I said give it to me
Uh huh
Give it to me
Ok
Give it to me
Ok Ok Ok

Uh uh uh uh uh
Give it to me
Hold on hold on hold on. Break it down for me. Can we please sit down for me. I'm sorry, I just wanted to have a little fun
No no I just wanted to have a little fun
We blocking the camera's, it's my fault I was being a bastard
I love you too baby
I was being a bastard I'm sorry
My fault blame it on me
Right now we gonna take an Armi break I hope y'all got some Armadale over there for me
Uh, I wanna let my man Questlove introduce the whole band, the Roots band make some noise for them real quick
I'll be right back
(To stage right, we got big Kenney on guitar
