10 ContributorsIll Mind of Hopsin 2 LyricsWho am I? why am I even here man?
Red or blue
Ok before you start something that's so daring like this and hard you wanna um make sure you have something good to eat
Ok so it's just a large pepperoni
Yeah
Your total's gonna be 15.35
So I got my delicious dominos pizza mmm
I'm gonna um shove this right there
I'm gonna have to heat the bottom up and just shove it through
So it can burn through and then it's gonna sit on this thing right here
Ok this is gonna get too crazy
Alright this went all wrong
This is what I'm doing now you know I'm just letting it burn at the bottom you know
Lettin' it sit there for a while I'm not gonna touch it
Ok now you're gonna get some water because it gets really dangerous
Fireballs are still dropping
There now we got a nice tripod not too low not too high
This is what it looks like so far ok
I'm about to break this little tripod and attach it to this rod
I'm gonna place this middle section right on there, fits on perfectly
This is what the full thing looks like
Busted up the shopping cart taking this red part off
Lets come down here real quick
Get that out, ahh now we gotta dolly somewhere
I still gotta lot of work to do I'm probably gonna add a seat to it or something
Tune in Ill mind of Hopsin
Lil bitch
Jesus man
Pull this thing out, push it back, and sit down
I bought a pole, so I can put the tripod in it
And I can still put the tripod in the back
There's two ways: in the front or the back
Depending on what your preference is or what type of shot it is
Sit down right there
You look through the lens
And yeah, this is the 360 view of it
Dolly is officially finished
I spray painted it and everything
But it's sick though
Started from a dream and I made it into reality
Goes to show that you can do whatever you put your mind to
This world is mine and I'm gonna show you guys that it is
No I shouldn't have said that never mind, forgive me
So when we need hard shots using our videos we resort to the volume mobile
Welcome to the pain in my life
Yeah babyYou might also likeEmbed
