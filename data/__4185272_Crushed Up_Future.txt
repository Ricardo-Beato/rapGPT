77 ContributorsCrushed Up Lyrics
Plain jane, Jackie Chan, Richard Mille
You gon' be the one bust it down, I can see it

Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it (Wheezy outta here)
Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face, di-diamonds in the face

Half a ticket for my wrist, spill so big
I put five pointers in the face, you can see it
I just put my whole damn arm in the fridge
Ten chains on, Lucky Charms, I'm the shit
Ten, ten different exotic cars how we slid
Meet me in Chanel in the back, we goin' big
I been gettin' NBA money, Jason Kidd
I just charged a whole damn M for a gig
And I got that Nitro for a pig
I'ma make it spark when you see it
You can call the narcs, I ain't quittin'
Diamonds in the face crushed up, you can see it

Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face, di-diamonds in the face

Bust down my Swiss watch, I'm throwed off
I just joined the big league, Lonzo
Tell me what that lick read, one call
Pink diamonds poppin' out, cotton ball
Bodies get to droppin' nigga, bonjour
I got some' to say to the pigs, yeah
I just got an M for a gig, yeah
I just blowed an M on my kids, yeah
Foreigns in the driveway, you can see it, yeah
Meet me in Hublot we goin' big, yeah
A plain jane, get it remixed, yeah
Diamonds in the face crushed up, you can see it

Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face crushed up, I can see it
Diamonds in the face, di-diamonds in the face

Diamonds
Crushed up, diamonds in the face
Diamonds in the-
Up, I can see it
Crushed up, diamonds crushed up
Diamonds in the face crushed up, you can see it
Crushed up
Diamonds (And I got that Nitro for a pig
I'ma make it spark when you see it)
Diamonds (You can call the narcs, I ain't quittin')17Embed
