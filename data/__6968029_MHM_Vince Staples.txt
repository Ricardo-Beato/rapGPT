35 ContributorsMHM Lyrics
Come get a body (Yeah), thirty deep on Poppy (Ugh)
Police won't stop me—that's on Johnny, come and find me (Ayy)
I ain't hidin' (Nah), they homies dying, they ain't riding
She cute, she wet, I'm water-sliding (Yeah, yup), yeah
It's been a minute (Ayy) since I been up in the trenches (Yeah)
South and Cherry, it get scary by that Church's Chicken
You niggas bitches (Yeah), kill you if you look suspicious (Bang)
Tryna make it in the game, you gotta know the glitches

Chip cuz, tell 'em, "Come and zip cuz"
Hundred on his headstone, homies call me "rich cuz"
Mhm (Uh-huh)
Flip cuz, candles 'causе they miss cuz
I ain't gotta diss 'cause you know what it is, cuz
Mhm
Dog ways, baby, 'cause I'm park-raisеd
We can do it late-night, we can do it broad-day
Mhm, hmm (Yeah), mhm (Dead homies)
Hmm, hmm, mhm (One in the head, all the time, yeah)
Yeah

Baby got the strap in case I gotta blast (I love you so much)
She been with me since we was on Olive Ave (Mhm, free HD)
'Fore corona, I was at Ramona with a mask (Free B. Skrap, yeah)
'Fore corona, knew the streets was over, washed my hands (Dead homies)
Full of vultures, so you know I watch my back (One-in-the-head shit)
Couldn't give it up; guess I got attached (Yeah)
Still without a scratch (Huh?), still with all of that (Yeah)
Snitching niggas even got the water tapped, damn (Snitch, ayy, ayy)
You might also like
Chip cuz, tell 'em, "Come and zip cuz"
Hundred on his headstone, homies call me "rich cuz"
Mhm (Uh-huh)
Flip cuz, candles 'cause they miss cuz
I ain't gotta diss 'cause you know what it is, cuz
Mhm (Yeah)
Dog ways, baby, 'cause I'm park-raised
We can do it late-night, we can do it broad-day
Mhm, hmm (Yeah), mhm (Dead homies)
Hmm, hmm, mhm (One in the head, all the time)
Yeah

When you take the 91 East
Get off on Cherry, turn right
(Mhm)
Take it all the way straight to South
Then, when you get to South, make that left—that's all the hood right there
Go down South; matter-fact—
(Mhm)
Go down South 'til you get to... Clark, Bellflower—that's still the hood
Make that left on whatever you choose, then make that left on Artesia until you get back to Cherry—that's all the hood
