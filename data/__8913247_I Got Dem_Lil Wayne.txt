1 ContributorI Got Dem Lyrics
Quarters and halves, chick-chickens and bricks
Ball-ballers of dope, and ounces and shit
Quarters and halves, chick-chickens and bricks
Ball-ballers of dope, and ounces and shit (I got em)
Get what they lookin for, keep what they lookin for
All they got to do is tell me what they lookin' for
I’m da dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
I got em'

Alright, yeah
Money to be made, best believe a nigga got it
I run it myself, like a quarter back option
I pitch ya ten g's, tell a bitch to go shoppin
She buys ha’ self some clothes and shе brought me back a chopper
See nigga try to cook it, but know I dont play sucker
I'm all about my cakе, I'm tryin to marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way, you know my whip game proper
Ya know for one ki, I see seven thousand dollars
Now I will shoot dice, smokin on a joint
I bet with Yo Gotti, he hit five straight points
We over here hustlin, we over here grindin
We rap about money, and a nigga might sign ya
Rap about me, and a nigga might find ya
Banana in ya ass, its what you hear right behind ya
Dope game bitch, let his momma where I bought em
You can holla at me, a feat
You might also like
Quarters and halves, chick-chickens and bricks
Ball-ballers of dope, and ounces and shit
Quarters and halves, chick-chickens and bricks
Ball-ballers of dope, and ounces and shit (I got em)
Get what they lookin for, keep what they lookin for
All they got to do is tell me what they lookin' for
I'm da dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
I got em'

Yeah ya understand me nigga
We the motherfuckin stunnas nigga
Young Money, Cash Money nigga
Yo Gotti what it do stunna niggaEmbed
