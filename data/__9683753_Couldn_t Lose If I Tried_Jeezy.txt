8 ContributorsCouldnâ€™t Lose If I Tried Lyrics
Big boss, I ain't never been fired
Dozen times, nigga damn near died
Red Bull, 'cause I don't get tired
Couldn't lose if I motherfuckin' tried
(Tried)
Mogul status, I'ma need me a trophy
And I'm always at the bank, yeah, they
Know me (Know me)
Big boss, I ain't never been fired (Right)
Couldn't lose if I motherfuckin' tried
(Tried)

Give me 6 feet, you better back that ass
Up
Or the paramedics gon have to pack
That ass up
Booked the room for a month, nigga
Stacked that cash up
Got a house on both coasts, yeah, that
Adds up
The motherfuckin' wire, and I'm feelin'
Like Marlo
White 458, that bitch cost a Diablo
Fireworks, niggas, like the 4th in Chicago
Two million on the ket, tell them bitches
Free Ralo
First, I saw, then I came then I figured I'd conquer
Barked on them niggas like that nigga
From Yonkers
Soulja rag on them niggas like I'm
Straight from uptown
Feel like Deion Sanders, when that pack
Get's touched down
They been countin' me out since day
One, my nigga
I just like to make them mad, shit fun
My nigga
Yeah, palm trees can't block the sun, my
Nigga
Meanwhile bank account on Big Pun, my
Nigga, woo, yeah

Big boss, I ain't never been fired
Dozen times, nigga damn near died
Red Bull, 'cause I don't get tired
Couldn't lose if I motherfuckin' tried

And I'm always at the bank, yeah, they
Know me (Know me)
Big boss, I ain't never been fired (Right)

You motherfuckers still talkin'?
I see you thinkin' bout me often
Big dog, no flees
Fuck that other nigga, he a breeze
And life's good like Esco
Might buy me a jet like Creflo
Ten figures in the escrow, same nigga
Who used to hustle at the Texaco
Had to catch him smokin' Bob Marley
Then a nigga moved next to Steve
Harvey
When he speakin' on me ain't no glory
But they always win tellin' they story
In '97 had a Lexus, now let's just talk
About perspective
The only niggas doin' that was the Big
Tymers, nigga, I had the Rollie and the
Necklace
Big boss, I ain't never been fired
Dozen times, nigga damn near died
Red Bull, 'cause I don't get tired
Couldn't lose if I motherfuckin' tried
(Tried)
Mogul status, I'ma need me a trophy
And I'm always at the bank, yeah, they
Know me (Know me)
Big boss, I ain't never been fired (Right)
Couldn't lose if I motherfuckin' tried
