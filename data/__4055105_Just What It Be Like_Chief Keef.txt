19 ContributorsJust What It Be Like Lyrics
Sos' baby
Bandana boys
Cap or die
Yup, yup
BG, L
Put the K to your face
DJ's on the beat so this a banger

These niggas acting like they want smoke
They don't really want smoke
They don't really want smoke, ayy, ayy
Baby, my watch cost a condo
Pocket full of hunchos
'Bout to pull up in London, ayy, ayy
These niggas acting like they want smoke
They don't really want smoke
They don't really want smoke, ayy, ayy
Lately, I been wearin' my jeans tight
Still got the Glock with the green light
Sometimes shit don't seem right
But that's just what it be like

I remember runnin' 'round high school with a tool, thinkin' I'm cool
I played duh-duh-duh-cooly, didn't have the flu either
Rocking my jewels
Probably pull up to the high school reunion, look at my coupe
I cannot hoop but I know some niggas that really know how to shoot
Fuck you think you?
You don't fuck with me then I don't fuck with you
Thought we was cool
We gon' come out the blue and give your ass the blues
Stick go Kanye, scoopity scoop
My son mama say he been bad, I'm like,  "Ooh, what he do?"
You might also like
These niggas acting like they want smoke
They don't really want smoke
They don't really want smoke, ayy, ayy
These niggas acting like they want smoke
They don't really want smoke
They don't really want smoke, ayy, ayy
Baby, my watch cost a condo
Pocket full of hunchos
'Bout to pull up in London, ayy, ayy
Lately, I been wearin' my jeans tight
Still got the Glock with the green light
Sometimes shit don't seem right
But that's just what it be like

Come get your bitch, she on my heels
Tryna pull up in heels, 'cause I live in the hills
Shorty know I keep it real, you ain't really from the field
Ice got me on chill, been running up the mills
But we not gon' give, Kool-Aid man, oh yeah
Turn a nigga to a car, put some bands on him
His mans ran on him, so I had to put my mans on him
Think he hot, throw a tan on him
If he got the drip, we gon' swim on him, ayy
These niggas acting like they want smoke
They don't really want smoke
They don't really want smoke, ayy, ayy
These niggas acting like they want smoke
They don't really want smoke
They don't really want smoke, ayy, ayy
Baby, my watch cost a condo
Pocket full of hunchos
'Bout to pull up in London, ayy, ayy
Lately, I been wearin' my jeans tight
Still got the Glock with the green light
Sometimes shit don't seem right
But that's just what it be like

Came through stuntin', smoking on skunk
Bitch we want it, bitch we done it
Bitch them fifties, bitch these hundreds
Like I ain't got it, bitch I'm on it
Can't run out of gas, can't be stuck
Tell me the price, can't be much
Niggas be talking like they can't get touched
We gon' knock 'em down, you can help em up
And I don't give a fuck
Tadoe come cook 'em, pick 'em up
Get your forty-four (Finish 'em)
It's a whole lot of bullets left
You wanna take it there? We can take it there
You lil' soft ass teddy bear
Put the K to your face, give you the Glock
And make you kill yourself
These niggas acting like they want smoke
They don't really want smoke
They don't really want smoke, ayy, ayy
These niggas acting like they want smoke
They don't really want smoke
They don't really want smoke, ayy, ayy
Baby, my watch cost a condo
Pocket full of hunchos
'Bout to pull up in London, ayy, ayy
Lately, I been wearin' my jeans tight
Still got the Glock with the green light
Sometimes shit don't seem right
But that's just what it be likeEmbed
