84 ContributorsWeâ€™ll Be Fine Lyrics
Yeah

Never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it like it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it, and here I am
In the presidential, do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing movin' through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast, Lord
Seem like yesterday that I was up-and-coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here? The drink here? The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no (Say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)

Yeah
Used to make us proud, we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man, uh
You keep talking how you was this and you had this
And you deserve some fuckin' credit, how did anyone forget it?
Got a show up in your city, your girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfuckin' time
You should take it as a sign, man, I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it, 'cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She says, "You're such a dog," I say, "You're such a bone"
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days, women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, "Show me some"
But girl, you ain't the only one that's tryna be the only one, uh
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no (Say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)
Yeah
Drizzy, your turn, nigga
Take care of the business, nigga (Shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business, nigga
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck 'em, we don't love 'em (Blatt)
Yeah, it's just that uptown gangster shit (Yeah)
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas, Drizzy
With the realest flow, you know?
Toast to this gangster shit (To this gangster shit)
OVO, YMCMB, nigga (Believe that)
Yeah, you understand me?
Playin' with these motherfuckin' millions like they ain't nothing (Throwin' hundreds)
Rubber band stacks
Yeah, that YMCMB shit, nigga
Flashy lifestyle
