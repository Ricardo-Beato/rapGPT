Ohh there go that bullshit again
You heard that shit?
Nah I ain't hear that
That's that bullshit from the other day
They done took the Buffalo Girls beat and changed it all around
They playin themselves!

You remind me when I reminesce of you (Yeah)
Of all the freaky things I want to do, to you (That's right)
So rub me up, rub me down, rub me all around (Rub me up, run me down) (What)
Kiss me here, kiss me there, kiss me everywhere! (Kiss me here, kiss me there)
Tell me what the cost to get in line 'cause you are mine tonight (It's goin' down tonight)
Gonna give you all I got to give, if only for one night (If only for one night) (I like that)
I will love you right (I don't care if you diss me) (Uh)
I will do you right (I don't care if you don't want me) (Come on)

Baby baby won't you be my baby baby
Be my baby baby baby baby baby baby (come on, come on, hahh)
Baby baby won't you be my baby baby
Be my baby baby baby baby baby baby (yo, hahh, knowhatI'mean?
Gonna set it like this, what)

Now I forgot how to forget so I remember your face
With your pretty accent, wearin man-attract scent
Others fakin constantly stakin out pockets of dreams
Always tryin to sham too that's why they crave champagne
But the blame still remains not to be on you
I know your style and your love lasts Long like the Island I'm from
I'm on the drum man, and it's all good
Cause I flexed on your ex, make sure he understood
That you would, never again want to be his wife
So we connect lips to hips, and uhh, eyes to thighs
You're my so-phisti-cated, lady
All mine, if you wasn't I'd go cra-zay
