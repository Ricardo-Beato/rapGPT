34 ContributorsDOH DOH Lyrics
Count it up, count it up, count it up
I get more, more, more
Super
They jacking, they got me bad
Count up
Money bring power, ask your hoe, hoe, hoe
Yeah (Zaytoven) skrrt, skrrt

Take no days off, I get dough, dough, dough
Lift the AK up, swangin' door, door, doors
36 ounces raw, I smell blow, blow, blow (remix)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, I get more, more, more (count up)
Space couped up, can't go slow, slow, slow (skrrt, skrrt)
Hundred shooters, they all go, go, go
I need a M n' M for a show, show, show
Summer lit now, damn, we want dough, dough, dough (Freebandz)

I got cho, I got blow, fifty racks, we used to swing the dough (yeah)
Six trap houses in a row, I'm shooting dice, bank ten or four (trap)
Future get a mil' a show, that's why my fucking price is low (yeah)
220 on the dash, nigga, you know how fast the Aston go (skrrt)
Road running, 20 East, you know I got the package though (finesse)
1, 2 or 3, I got that dope boy a magic bowl
Most you niggas gon' fold, all my niggas on go
Super good in the streets, name a place I can't go (street)
Real talk nigga, I've been street before Bankroll (yeah)
I can still touch a mill' cash when the bank close
Quarter mill' every month, that's just for my payroll
Lost a hundred racks a day ago, got it back today though
No days off, we be chasing them M's (work)
Young Scooter got them trees, I ain't talking 'bout timbs (fo' sure)
I got bullshit work but still I jump out the gym (remix)
Treat the trap like Nipsey Hussle, you know all money in (count up)
You might also like
Take no days off, I get dough, dough, dough
Lift the AK up, swangin' door, door, doors
36 ounces raw, I smell blow, blow, blow (remix)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, I get more, more, more (count up)
Space couped up, can't go slow, slow, slow (skrrt, skrrt)
Hundred shooters, they all go, go, go
I need a M n' M for a show, show, show
Summer lit now, yeah, we want dough, dough, dough (Freebandz)

Pa-blo
Cha-po
Cuban link, Cas-tro
Count it fast
Tur-bo (brr)
Big bags, coco
One thousand grams in a kilo
They jacking, they got me back in beast mode (2)
I'm taxing, I hit the bank and reload (reload)
The coupe, it went to space, ten fold (chuu)
Treat me like Bin Laden
Pluto but I'm going to Saturn (gone)
I made her fuck my Patek (Patek)
I turned her into a baddy (baddy)
Put eight new whips in traffic (woo)
My watch come out the casket
Our love is everlasting (yeah)
Money wrapped up in plastic
365 ducking po-po-pos
Truck loads coming to your door, door, door
24 hours like a store, store, store (Freebandz)
Money bring power, ask your hoe, hoe, hoe
Take no days off, I get dough, dough, dough
Lift the AK up, swangin' door, door, doors
36 ounces raw, I smell blow, blow, blow (remix)
Count it up, count it up, count it up, I get more, more, more (count up)
Space couped up, can't go slow, slow, slow (skrrt, skrrt)
Hundred shooters, they all go, go, go
I need a M n' M for a show, show, show
Summer lit now, yeah, we want dough, dough, dough (Freebandz)3Embed
