So icey entertainment banging in this muthafucker
Chain hanging in this muthafucker
Bling, blow, bling, blow, wow
I smoke kush, and I pop beans
And I don't give a damn how you feel about me
I sip lean, pure codeine
And I don't give a damn what you say about me
X2
I'm so iced up feel me up
I'm so kushed up dog I'm stuck
Sumbody help me I can't get up
I bought a whole pound
And I smoked the shit up
No more purp, lets restore
Call the kush man tell him bring much more
We ask another 2 liter
We gon do four
I'm so drowzy I might snore
Chain so bright what you call a eye sore
If you ain't wanna fuck wat you spend the night for
Pulled all the ho's
What I got the ice for
To win all the money
What I shot the dice for
Thinking to myself
Damn I'm high
I roll another swisher
I'm lookin for some fire
I'm dui, we so drunk
Yo girl manned up
When she seen my dunk
Pussy nigga it's gucci
You might also likeI smoke kush, and I pop beans
And I don't give a damn how you feel about me
I sip lean, pure codeine
And I don't give a damn what you say about me

Pussy nigga its Gucci!
Cool me down
While yall sell ounces
Nigga I blow pounds
Pussy ass fuck nigga
Get tha fuck from round
Gucci class clown
Nigga you can laugh now
Neva back down, east A-town
Boulder crest my stomping ground
I make sun valley proud
Me and throwback, what it do blood
We showin hood love
Nigga we some hood thugs
I'm hot I'm cold, hood I'm street
So iced out check my new piece
Heart shaped diamonds baby ain't life sweet
Gucci frames on so I can't see
Gucci MVP, I bring that heat
In my all red dump
Wit the all chrome seats
Yeeeeaaa I'm on fire
Catch me in da hood
Drag racing for tires
I smoke kush, and I pop beans
And I don't give a damn how you feel about me
I sip lean, pure codeine
And I don't give a damn what you say about me
