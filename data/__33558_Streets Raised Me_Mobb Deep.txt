26 ContributorsStreets Raised Me Lyrics
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, that true shit
That shit to make you feel shit
To all my niggas and my bitches
Yo, check it, uh huh

It's kinda bug how I dose sometimes; know they staring
Brain feels like a wheel lost without the ball bearing
Stuck, contemplating who I can trust
But like llello in a bill my feelings just get crushed
But thats why I stick with my duns, like I stick with the guns
Don't get mad, rip your hun, concentrate on my funds
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist
Never get patted down when I step in the place
Jiggied up, scope the spot, confirm beef, if it's not
Bally up, after this get followed straight to the crib
Gem star, double edge apply pressure
Shave 'em down, blow marks intruding through your mecca
Wanna be a thug, now you got the thug look
Stick 'em up, leave Medicaid with the bill to foot
God-Body, with a rubber grip black shottie
Pump one in that ass make a nigga switch hobbies
A dosage, hand delivered, without postage
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice
Niggas get sniped like, clog your bronchite
Show 'em how to rock right, when bitches are holdin mics
(Street life)
You might also like
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (street life)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me

This is something you feel nigga, like the theme song from Hill Street Blues
This is real, this is ill street news
How he gone, and left his moms mind struck
And now his brother not giving a fuck
Little sister giving up the butt now, dun don't wet that
I want you to rest black, 'cause you can believe that Noyd gon' handle that
Cause when I get 'em, I'm gonna have 'em
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at 'em
I'm no killer, you know me
But I'll be damned if I don't ride for my co-D
And then this OG, scold me, and told me, coldly
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homie
But I, gotta redeem, get this cream by any means
I never been clean
Nigga, my whole click got dirty
From the vials, to the trials and the bloodied up syrtie
Nigga you heard me, it's gangsta (and to the block)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (and to the block)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me

Vision the canvas I paint a picture
Similar to Ernies Barnes, nigga
But mines is more ghetto more guns
More drugs, mostly thugs
All my dunns, their baby moms daughter and sons
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out
Park benches is broke, a nigga stretched out
Jumped off the roof and fell to his death, it's real
Hand Ball walls displayed with R-I-P murals
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building
Devil's Spring, keep 'em going while the snows blowing
Grams get dipped, 50's is moked, cookies is broke
And Spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off, don't get clipped off
(Street life)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (street life)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me (and to my dunns)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (it's real...)1Embed
