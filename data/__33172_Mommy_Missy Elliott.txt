5 ContributorsMommy Lyrics
Please stand UP!
In 2005, the industry will be pussy-whipped
It won't be EA-SY
 Mommy look good yeah mommy look right

They like mommy with the cute face, can I get a date
Mommy got a cool shake, mommy make 'em wait
Papi havin' trouble tryin' to keep up the pace
Mommy got a hook I let my pussy be the bait
Mommy got that good shit, that really good shit
The type of chick you get with, that really good shit
Mommy got them niggas goin crazy for the ass
Call me Flash, make a dash, get a nigga for his cash
Mommy nuck and buck with a quick uppercut
Mommy sport shell toes, I put my Nikes up
I used to dress D-boy, now I dress girly
Wake up real early with my brais lookin curly
Mommy let 'em know who she is, what she 'bout
Yeah she 'bout money, mommy turnin niggas out
Mommy got bills, car sit on big wheels
In the club mommy chill while them haters ice grill

Mommy cute like Fendi suits
Mommy fresh these my real breasts
Mommy sex cause mommy groan
Mommy be that good shit at home
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy
Damn mommy, roll like armies
Mommy ass like a Cadillac
Mommy give 'em heart attacks
You might also like
They call me lil' momma lookin big in my Hummer
Momma on the corner, lil' momma be a stunner
Fly to the Hummer quick faster than a runner
Foot on the gas, VROOOM, engine gunner
Mommy look good, yeah mommy look right
Mommy stay hood, mommy be yo' type
Mommy get excited, mommy ask you to bite it
Mommy know you like it, tell papi don't fight it
Capital M-O-M-M-Y
Mommy got 'em pussed, take any chick guy
Mommy got a deal, mommy spit shit real
Mommy give 'em chills when she wear high heels
Mommy get the money get the money get the money
Mommy find a man who can go and get it for me
Mommy look fresh in Respect Me sweats
Stay best dressed, showin off my breasts

{*beat changes*}
 Mommy get the money {*repeat 4X*}

Yeah mommy get buck like whoa lil' momma
Back it up like whoa lil' momma
When she shake it like whoa lil' momma
She get naked like HOLD UP MOMMA
Mommy be a freak, mommy let the world know
Mommy want 'em lickin from her head to her toe
If papi say no then lil' papi gotta go
If he broke no no mommy kick him out the do'
