30 ContributorsOn Fire Lyrics
Mama bad, mama mean
Gasoline, she's on fire (She's on fire)
Put her out, as a matter of fact
Take her out, 'cause sheâ€™s on fire (She's on fire)
Got on my knees and asked my Lord
To keep me clear from the Devil, 'cause my girl
She, she's on fire, yeah
But everything is so cool, yeah

Now gimme them back shots, I want them back shots
I said, shorty, let me play up in that matchbox
And she's on fire, yeah (She's on fire)
Sh-Shorty let a nigga rub his dick against her matchbox
And she's on fire (She's on fire) she's steamin'
She's screamin', she, she's creamin' (She's on fire)
She's fiendin', I redeem it
I get between it, like I mean it (She's on fire)

Now hit me
And now she's on fire (She's on fire, fire, fire, fire)
I left her steamin', yeah
But everything is so cool (She's on)
