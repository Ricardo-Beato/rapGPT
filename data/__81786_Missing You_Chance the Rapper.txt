74 ContributorsMissing You Lyrics

In the real world, these just people with ideas
In the real world, these just people with ideas
In the real world, these just people with ideas
In the real world, these just people with ideas

That shit cray, that shit dead, that shit fake, plastic head
Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need an Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking, "What up?" I said on my soul, I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands and my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I'm going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I called up my lil' homie, bought him a .45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they momma and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And now for something completely different
And I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And hoping that I find you
I been hoping that I find you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
In the real world, these just people with ideas
In the real world, these just people with ideas
I'm missing you
In the real world, these just people with ideas19Embed
