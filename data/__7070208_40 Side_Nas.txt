Mmm (Hit-Boy)

OG talk, project halls
40 Side where a nigga seen it all (For real, for real)
I can send niggas to slide, I'd rather show them the ropes
Integrity matters the most, I gave the hood hope

Damn, I gave the hood classics
Something to open your mind, instead of going out crashin'
How was you real when you hate the real?
My nigga, I'm simply askin'
Can't just talk about the plan, you gotta put it in action
Ain't no pity party for yourself
You gotta get up, rise for your wealth
Can't spend all that time in your feelings
Tryna sympathize with yourself (For real, for real)
Don't nobody owe you, ain't nobody holding you back (Woo)
You stuck in illusions, attached to something that ain’t even that
South Beach, Nassau, Amalfi, Maldives, same beach
Unless you are after somethin' most men just can't see
Shorty off the block, shorty off the runway, same freak (For real, for real)
We all got the access to open doors like we share the same key
OG talk
You might also like
A lot of things go down like incarceration
You know, crime, drugs, violence
Outta alla' this you gotta look for the positive
OG talk!

OG Talk (OG talk), project halls (Project halls)
40 Side where a nigga seen it all (Seen it all, for real, for real)
I can send niggas to slide (Slide) I'd rather show them the ropes (Ropes)
Integrity matters the most (Most) I gave the hood hope (Hope)

Damn, niggas really got it jumpin'
They finally gave Nas a Grammy, just front me the gold
That wasn’t the goal
First clip was a warning shot, nigga, we spinnin' back up the road
Through the boroughs, pull up our Rolls
Empty this bitch and reload (For real, for real)
When you been in it this long, it's gon' look like it's magic
Only island that my niggas knew was Rikers or Staten (LI)
You get your first V12, tap the pedal then stab it
Get your first ten milly, watch that shit like a habit (For real, for real)
OG Talk, shout out 41st (Side)
Jackson Heights, Flushing, Elmhurst (Right)
Keep your blicky, you know how the streets work (For real, for real)
Seen too many of us die over the turf
OG talk (OG talk), project halls (Project halls)
40 Side where a nigga seen it all (Seen it all, for real, for real)
I can send niggas to slide (Slide), I’d rather show them the ropes (Ropes)
Integrity matters the most (Most), I gave the hood hope (Hope)

'Til then
We gon' be thuggin' behind the project buildin' (For real, for real)
Plottin’ on our way that we can make a million, a billion
Until then, we gon' be thuggin'20Embed
