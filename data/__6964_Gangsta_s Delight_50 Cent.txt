15 ContributorsGangstaâ€™s Delight Lyrics
This is hip hop, it go clip pop
It hit 'em if ya hit me, the clip pop
It popped and it don't stop
Papa said we bang bang boogie, we get' em
Oh goodie keep the hoodie
When you're fucking with me, me, me

Now what you hear is not a test
I said it's not a test, nigga, it's not a test
Got my Teflon on wrapped around my chest
I do it the best, ya heard, I do it the best
Tuck the nine by my spine all the time
Stunt when I want a dead nigga, fuck with mine
My neck and my ear get to flicking like a strobe
My wrist and my whips have niggas like whoa
I'm the underground king, I reside on the throne
In the club wilding out over Henny and Patron
Me I'm in the zone, yeah me I'm in the zone
It's bottle after bottle til G-stacks are blown
Shawty in my ear like ''please take me home''
Before the next song, come on dawg, we gone
Off to the hotel, motel, the Holiday Inn
She said ''if I knew you worked the cat from the back like that
I would've brought my friend''
Uh huh huh huh huh
You might also like X2
It go clip pop
It hit 'em if ya hit me, the clip pop
It popped and it don't stop
Papa said we bang bang boogie, we get' em
Oh goodie keep the hoodie
When you're fucking with me, me, me

I'm so raw, yeah, I'm so raw
Me I'm so ghetto, I'm oh so hardcore
I'm down by law, this style ya never saw
I give 'em just a little then watch 'em fiend for more
Yeah, they want more, they hot and they want more
They love the way I kick it, they addicted to your boy
I'm ecstasy, I'm the ultimate trip
I have ya in the morning like a dope fiend sick
Now feel the rush, I'm like pure cocaine
I have the whole night club going insane
No matter how rich I get I'm never gonna change
I will let it rain, push me, I let it rain
I do this shit myself, lawyer money ain't a thang
The unit is the gang, the yin and the yang
We went from poor to rich, now look we the shit
You best control your bitch or she'll be in the six
Uh huh huh huh huh
 X2
It go clip pop
It hit 'em if ya hit me, the clip pop
It popped and it don't stop
Papa said we bang bang boogie, we get' em
Oh goodie keep the hoodie
When you're fucking with me, me, me

I'm fresh to death, I'm rocking the vest
I'm strapped moving 'round with the heat
I said I do it the best, I'm not the one you should test
That's why my name ring bells in the street
I put that work in, yeah yeah
I put that work in, yeah yeah
I put that work in, yeah yeah
I put that work in, yeah yeah
 X2
It go clip pop
It hit 'em if ya hit me, the clip pop
It popped and it don't stop
Papa said we bang bang boogie, we get' em
Oh goodie keep the hoodie
When you're fucking with me, me, me1Embed
