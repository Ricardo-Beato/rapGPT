19 ContributorsMoment I Feared Lyrics
I wear my heart on my sleeve, but it’s a purple heart (purple heart)
North bay, water mammals, swim with killer sharks (killer sharks)
I’m from the 7-O-7, it’s no heaven (it’s no heaven)
I’m a top five mob, hyphy veteran (hyphy veteran)
Ricky Rock my nigga, I got slaps (got slaps)
You can play him for hours, back to back (back to back)
Listen, niggas on your team that love that money over everything
Can never be loyal, now take that back to the soil
Anywhere on earth, and it’ll work
I’m just sharing my experiences on earth for what it’s worth
Maybe it’s just me tho, ‘cause I don’t trust y’all (trust y’all)
I’m in a lough off some grapes and a BuzzBall, trippin’ like
Look at this shit here (here)
This sucker shit is running rampant, it’s the moment I fear

It was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared

Let me talk to 'em, nephew
Ricky is tricky, the game is gettin’ slippery
This shit is a maze, cuz singing like a Tempree
I disappear for one minute ‘til they miss me
Another TV show, more dough, I’m makin’ history
Now I'm back at your service
Wish me luck dear, I’m scared and I'm nervous
You never left you brought that hood back with ya
I'm the real deal, I ain't gon' bullshit with ya
Another one I wanna make, another joint I wanna make
Open the oven put some candles on my cake
Twenty-five and countin’, etch my face into Kushmore Mountain
Can’t be scared of your opponent dog-gone it if you want it, trip this
This sucker shit is running rampant, it’s the moment I fear

It was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I feared1Embed
