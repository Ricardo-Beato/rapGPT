I don't know...
I just ain't got none right now, man
What?
Thank you, God
I don't know what to say... (uh!)
But I do wanna address you lame ass fuck niggas (fuck nigga!)
That's what I do wanna do
Stealin' m flow, huh,? Ain't even got no hook man!
You niggas you know, no hook, you niggas you know that you stealin' my flow
Y'all know a fuck nigga don't rap like that, man
Takeoff!

You rappers, you wanna be 33, still tryna copy me (Old ass rappers)
Young rich nigga only nineteen, and you'd better acknowledge me (I'm only nineteen)
Fuck nigga you spitting and rapping like this without Migos consent want apology
The labels keep talking, the critics keep writing and
All because we gettin' currency
I think itâ€™s time for extortion
Or killing you babies, abortion (kidnap you niggas my Migos will torture you)
I told you I'd rather be rich than famous
Fuck nigga dissin' my label
These fuck niggas done stole so much Goddamn swag, might as well sell it
The critics done said it, I might as well tell it
On Actavis with my shirt off, screaming fuck the world like Makaveli
QC the label! (QC) Solid Foundation!
Young nigga on the block with the work to the sun come up
Trapping like a fundraiser
Fuck nigga, you know I'm a Migo
If I don't have Emmitt, get poked with a razor
You might also like
Which one of my cars should I drive today? I don't know
(they all foreign)
Which one of my hoes should I fuck today? I don't know
(they all bad)
Which one of my chains should I put on? Put 'em all on
You niggas you know, you niggas you know that you stealin' my flow
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, whatever you with
My nigga we pressing, my nigga we pressing no button
My niggas ain't stressing got money
Whatever you with, whatever you with
You know that my niggas we with it

They copy the name, they copy the gang, they copy the slang (they copy my name)
Versace, Versace, we brought that shit back and you niggas is lame (copy Versace)
We hearin' the way that these rappers is rappin' that shit not creative
What's the difference? (difference)
We some young niggas that signed to no label
My squad is so deep in the club, your fans and your people don't notice you (deep in the club)
All of my niggas got diamonds, they flashin' they look like a photoshoot (diamonds, they flash)
I pull up in valet, the Audi got soft top but my top is bulletproof (skrt, skrt, skrt)
And now they want jugg and finessin', now they want 'sace the necklace ('sace the necklace)
At first we didn't expect it (expect it) and now we expect it (press it)
At first the flow they neglect it (neglect it) and now they respect it (respect it)
I'm thanking God for the blessing (to not have a rat in my session)
I know that this game is dirty, Smith and Wesson
Which one of my cars should I drive today? I don't know
(they all foreign)
Which one of my hoes should I fuck today? I don't know
(they all bad)
Which one of my chains should I put on? Put 'em all on
You niggas you know, you niggas you know that you stealin' my flow
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, whatever you with
My nigga we pressing, my nigga we pressing no button
My niggas ain't stressing that money (*you with it, we with it, nigga*)
Whatever you with, whatever you with (*Offset, nigga*)
You know that my niggas we with it

You must got the rabies, you bite (rabies)
You copy my swag and I like it
Young nigga, I'm for sale
Give 'em hell!
Put a nigga on a mission, a young nigga won't fail
Y'all pussy ass rappers, these niggas they wise
Never trap, never cap, never been in a trial
You with it, I'm with it, them hollows start spitting
These niggas, they shaking like Diddy
Gotta pay to trap on my block, extortion
80 percent of your guap
No lie, Versace, it got me a fortune ('sace)
Enormous money ain't never gone stop
Woke up this morning and I played the radio
Nigga's remedial, sounding like Radio
Them niggas not talking, just pullin' that cards
Dunk a nigga, Vince Carter
Bullets have a nigga dancing like Carlton
Which one of my cars should I drive today? I don't know
(they all foreign)
Which one of my hoes should I fuck today? I don't know
(they all bad)
Which one of my chains should I put on? Put 'em all on
You niggas you know, you niggas you know that you stealin' my flow
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, whatever you with
My nigga we pressing, my nigga we pressing no button
My niggas ain't stressing that money
Whatever you with, whatever you with
You know that my niggas we with it28Embed
