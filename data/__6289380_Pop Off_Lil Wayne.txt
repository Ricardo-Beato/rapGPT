Here we go

Huh, piss me off, I piss back
S-Sixty-nine, that's a 9 tucked right by my six pack
I'm with my slime, treat a toe tag like I treat a trim tac
W-We send you to a different world, please say hi to Sinbad
Now, it's so hard to not bust down the presidential wristband
Got so much platinum on me right now, I look like the tin man
Tunechi a gardener, I'm about to water that bitch implants
You kick it off, I kick your ass, don't piss me off I shit back, huh

Sh-She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
And then tomorrow I forget 'cause it's too hard around this bitch
Need some water, I'ma pop me a blue dolphin, that's for Nip
And I can't go without the sip, bitch, I've been sippin' sincе Lil Flip
Dosing off inside my bitch, so, nigga, I woke up like this
I'm bringing homе the bacon like a pigsty over here, bitch
Pigs fly over here, get shot down and fried over here
Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered everyday that's law and order
Stick his head in boiling water
Leave eighteen holes on his corner, now I'm golfing
Rickie Fowler, Arnold Palmer, get my shot off
Come in your church, and Peter pop off
You might also like
Come in your church, and Peter pop off
Come where you work, and Peter pop off
Come in your turf, and Peter pop off
Whatever is first, I Peter pop off
Innocent person, Peter pop off
After I squirt, she clean her top up
Pop a perc, so Peter pop off
Whatever is first, I Peter pop off

Faded for real, skating for real, my niggas brazy for real, yeah
Get paid to get killed, get sprayed to get spilled, get shot from your head to your heels, yeah
She head over heals, she taking these pills, they give her the craziest thrills
I'm sedated a lil, but ain't no big deal, still fuck like I'm straight outta jail
The feds is raiding my crib but ain't no big deal, I'm way ahead of the field
These diamonds invaded my grill, got me from ear to ear, smiling like I'm Draymond for real
Go sicko mode, hungry hippo mode
24 carats shining like a glass of Michelob, here's a toast
Here we go, I can not tell if you're really real or not, can't take a loss I can't take a L
I'm famous as hell, I ain't really well, but I'm hanging in there like Patti Labelle
I'm stainless as steel, I'm flawless as fuck, the pain is concealed from all of the drugs
Brr, Hello I'm calling your bluff, here we go

Sh-She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
She gone be up till like 6, micro-dosing on this dick
I'm micro-managing prescriptions, said tomorrow, I'ma quit
And then tomorrow I forget, it-it's too hard around this bitch
Need some water, I'ma pop me a blue dolphin, that's for Nip
And I can't go without the sip, bitch, I've been sippin' since Lil Flip
Dosing off inside my bitch, so, nigga, I woke up like this
Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered everyday that's law and order
Stick his head in boiling water
Leave eighteen holes on his corner, now I'm golfing
Rickie Fowler, Arnold Palmer, get my shot off
Come in your church, and Peter pop off
Come in your church, and Peter pop off
Come where you work, and Peter pop off
Come in your turf, and Peter pop off
Whatever is first, I Peter pop off
Innocent person, Peter pop off
Pull up the skirt, I peel her top up
Pop a perc, so Peter pop off
Whatever is first, I Peter pop off
