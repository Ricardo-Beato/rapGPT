10 ContributorsPop Off Lyrics
Shattering glass
And motherfuckers be like, "But what type of niggas will wife you?"
My type of niggas will wife me! The type of niggas that like bitches that pop off and suck dick all day motherfuckin' long, bih
Thanks to all my followers that always defended me
Y'all like my god brothers and my god sisters
I would dead jump in your fight, I would dead jump in your fight
Now what's poppin?

Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off

I'm startin' to lose my patience, weak bitches hatin'
Bitches throwing subs like I won't kick your face in
Baby mama's mad 'cause I'm in first place, and
When it comes to you bitch, there's no conversation
I been to give it up grimy, I'm the Bronx bitch, I'm feisty
"Cardi why you feisty?" Shut up bitch, fight me
NY raised and so you know it's very likely
That when I hear some shit that I don't like, I get hype B
Who would wanna wife me? Your nigga wanna wife me
You think 'cause I'm a stripper hoe, that nigga won't think twice B?
Put this pussy on his face, ride that shit nicely
Set his ass up, then you really ain't gon' like me
So what you tryna do? You and you and you
I feel some type a way, a bitch finna get loose
Tell me what's the deal? I'm 'bout to start the hill
The wig is comin' off, shit 'bout to get real
You might also like
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off

Got beef with Cardi B? I'm poppin' off
Shit get hectic? I'ma drop it off
Oh you shinin'? Your chain and your watch is off
You was never with this shit, nigga, knock it off
Youse a pussy, and your whole block is soft
You caught feelings, could she ain't even drop you off
You thought that bag was gettin' you pussy, not at all
You was gettin' lied, you ain't know she made that call
To the dog's dinner, and they starvin'
I gotta feed all 'em
I'maget that nigga, you gon' get that bitch
What they thought switched 'cause we both got rich?
Nah, we on the same time
You got yours, I got mine
You got a problem, get in line
It's Cardi B, and 2 times
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off
Who wanna pop off? Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit? I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off, weaves, off
Rings, off, everything, off

Shit, that bitch six three and she bodied
Superman calves, and her shoulder somethin' retarded
I ain't backin' down, Cardi got the heart regardless
You gon' have to knock me out if you think I'ma forfeit
Gang gang, squad up, and have my niggas all on it
Pay a couple niggas and they had you out in a coffin
And I put that on my life, I really don't do this often
But the way I'm feelin' now, like whatever, I'm on it
Have you laid out on the stretcher with your socks off
Had the pastor prayin', like, "Sorry for your, loss"
Throw dirt on my name, you better pop off
My name ring bells like Mayweather, box off
I'm Cardi B, east coast newest contender
5'3" lookin' good with the nails bananas
Freddy Kruger on these bitches, I cut their lights off
Should have read the memo, Cardi B pops offEmbed
