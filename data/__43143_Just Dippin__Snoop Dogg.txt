24 ContributorsJust Dippinâ€™ Lyrics
Yeah, uh (Ridas)
Wanna say what's up to all them riders (Biatches)
All them siders, all them gangstas, and all them beyotches
Yeah, we keep it gangsta (gangstas, bitches)
Yeah, we keep it gangsta

Dippin' down Long Beach Coulevard
I only rides with my Doggs (wuh-what)
And I don't give a fuck about none of y'all
I'm ridin til the wheels fall off
I only rides with my Doggs (wuh-what)

Dippin' down Compton Boulevard
I only rides with my dogs (say what)
I don't give a fuck about none of y'all (fuck y'all)
I'm ridin 'til the wheels fall off
I only rides with my dogs

Beware of the big mash, you knew he wasn't finished with yo' ass
He'll stay on it til it's burnt out, looked how it turned out
Nuthin' you can do, can't help you out
So fall down, Dr. Dre done fell back into the House (DPG)
With the Pound, bitches keep throwin' pussy at us
We don't want it, you bitch it don't matter
It's all about the money, if you got it, throw that up (throw it up)
Hmm, ride along with ya' set (Eastside)
And watch us, you motherfuckers can't do that yet
I skirt out, I hit a corner on ya, fuck doin' halfway
I do it to the fullest, I'll probably catch bullets on my last day
I hope a prayer come through so I can eat
My shoes lookin' like about a buck fifty each (but I ain't trippin')
But I'mma come up, that's on my momma
Now that's on me, 'cause that's a burden on my momma
And she done suffered, the shit's gettin rougher
And when the goin' get tough, the tough get a strap
And low-ridin's on the map Snoop Dogg's number 1
The whole Pound's got snaps (nigga)
Yeah, tell me, have you seen us?

Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah however you need it (we just dippin')
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah however you need it (we just dippin')
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it

Uhh, actin a fool, nigga done paid his dues
And got my receipt in return, so I recline the leather seats
With a trunk full of beats and
Chronic filled leafs to burn
No concern as I make a left turn on the 'Shaw ('sup nigga)
Off of Jefferson, feelin' awfully naked at the U-turn
Shit, left my gun, that's a no-no
Fuck Bernard Parks, I'm my own po'-po'
Nigga talkin' dirty after dark, startin' stuff (what's up nigga)
May have to mark up a nigga FUBU logo
Lettin off like a Ruger promo
And even though I'm about the hoes, I never doubt the dulos
You know the rule goes, where there's a ho there's a hater
(Fuck them niggas) Well there's some hoes over there
And I concentrate on the haters later (what)
Give these bitches numbers to the pager
Invite 'em to the next Dre function as party favors
Who said pimpin's hard labor?
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah however you need it (we just dippin')
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah however you need it (we just dippin')
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it

Hey, oh yeah, oh yeah
Better watch out, cause here we come
Always, dippin'
Better watch out, cause here we come
Always, dippin'
Better watch out, cause here we come
Always, dippin'
Better watch out, cause here we come
We're always, dippin'
Better watch out, cause here we come
Al-always, dippin', hey
Better watch out, 'cause here we come
We're always, we're dippin' (we're dippin')
Better watch out, 'cause here we come
In them streets, dippin' (dippin)
Better watch out, 'cause here we come
Hittin' them corners, dippin' (dippin')
Better watch out, cause here we come
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah however you need it (we just dippin')
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah however you need it (we just dippin')
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it1Embed
