7 ContributorsLifetime Lyrics
Sometimes I ask myself
Why the fuck we still doin' this shit?
For the love?
For the dough?
For these hoes?
For the life?
Yeah, uh

Death'll cometh, purgatory punish
Dumb muthafuckas and grimy ass bitches, yeah
Flex on me, I'm paying you a visit, yeah
I come through there with horrible intentions
My rifle get lit, it's a terrible weapon
There ain't nothin' when I shit
Gon' clean up the messin'
All because I'm a gold decorated veteran
Platinum and precious stones, my necklace
Still on parole, still pop a nigga quick
She feelin' me? I'll pop a nigga bitch, uh
King-sized ego, they hatin' on me for
All I do is shine, baby, shine writin' these dope
King Size B-R'S and you a little beeyotch
Kick you in your muthafuckin' head 2 or 3 times
You'll be aight, baby boy cryin' for mommy
You wasn't really 'bout that life
You might also like
They be actin' like they know somethin' they don't really know
Man, I spend all my days, my nights locked up in the studio
Feel like a lifetime, I'm-I'm-I'm
Spillin' my lifetime, I-I-I
You not in yo right mind, uh-uh-uh (Yeah)
You niggas tryna take me for a joke?

Skin tone dark skin, camo hoodie, Timbs on
Full on type of shit that rip a nigga grill off
Live by the code, sleep with an iron
One eye open, hope a nigga try it
Accumalated riches raised out of sweatbox
Now I'm countin' bread, transfer money off of a desktop
Top lawyer so the jury came back deadlocked
Snitch down, all he saw was fire when the lead popped
Permanently on bed rest
Shorty talkin' marriage, she ain't even give me head yet
Dead wrong niggas, not a bit of conscious in us
Said, "fuck the world," went ahead and just did us
Did us, never look back, it's survival
Up and ready, never let these little niggas try you
One slip'll have a nigga headed to a grave
Pine box, timeslot took the fuckin' way
They be actin' like they know somethin' they don't really know
Man, I spend all my days, my nights locked up in the studio
Feel like a lifetime, I'm-I'm-I'm
Spillin' my lifetime, I-I-I
You not in yo right mind, uh-uh-uh
You niggas tryna take me for a joke?1Embed
