2 ContributorsDJ Krill, DC Yung Hot & Gucci Mane Intro Lyrics
DJ Krill and worldstarhiphop.com exclusive
Stepped up my game first, stepped up my chain next
Took off that bullshit, bought me a Rolex
Iced out my homeboys, iced out my main bitch
If not this trap shit-
Crest Road, what's happenin' Zone 6 checkin' in, man
Gucci Mane, Gucci Gucci, iced out shorty, moneybag shorty, sack, kush back shorty
Yung Hot, DJ Krill
V12, East Atlanta
Young Hot in the motherfuckin' booth homieYou might also likeEmbed
