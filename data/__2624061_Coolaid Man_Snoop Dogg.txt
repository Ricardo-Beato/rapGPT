26 ContributorsCoolaid Man Lyrics
Hey, Snoop Dogg, can you pour me another glass of that Coolaid?
(Cardo Got Wings)

On the set, my nigga, I'm my own man
Upgrade, just like your phone game
Big Snoop Dogg, I do my own thing
And I stays in my own lane
My rap style, is dynamite
A lot of y'all niggas do sound alike
You do it how you do's it
See, you can blame it on the drugs, and you can blame it on the music
Where I come from, if you sound like another nigga
That's called bitin', yeah, you the other nigga
Let my demeanor be the meaning, got you screamin'
While you leanin', now you fiendin', while you dreamin'
To have a big car, rap star
Ten-room mansion with a lake in your backyard
So disobedient, flavor is the main ingredient
And you lack it, it's all in your jacket

But I'm hot, and as cool as a fan
You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man
Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man
I'm hot (he's cool), but as cool as a fan
Bitches drinkin' lemonade, but I'm the Coolaid Man
I'm standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man
Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man
Now drink up, yeah girl that's the Coolaid Man, they call him the Coolaid Man
Now drink up!
You might also like
The reason that I say that I'm the Coolaid
Look at all the flavor that I gave to the gizzame
Just add water, it don't get no hotter
You got your whole get-down from the Doggy Dogg father
Never mind it was never mines
Inquire intellectual, clever minds
Bet a dub that this shit pop
Bitch niggas mix love with this hip-hop
Just to be on, now what the fuck are we on
LBC, we've been known to get our G on
They call me Don Corleone, that's the corner he on, P-I-M-P on
She a freak of the week, I'm teachin' niggas how to eat
Cause I'm deep in the streets
Look, don't get it fucked up loc
Cause every now and then, niggas need a line of this dope

Cause I'm hot, and as cool as a fan
You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man
Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man
I'm hot (he's cool), but as cool as a fan
Bitches drinkin' lemonade, but I'm the Coolaid Man
I'm standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man
Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man
Now drink up, yeah girl that's the Coolaid Man, they call him the Coolaid Man
Now drink up Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man
Now drink up, yeah girl that's the Coolaid Man, they call him the Coolaid Man
Now drink up!
S-N-double-O-P, Mr. Coolaid Man, that's who he be
S-N-double-O-P, Mr. Coolaid Man, yeah, that's who he be
Now drink up (hot diggity dog)
Don't let the snare hit you, baby
Now drink up!
Mr. Coolaid Man, he's cool2Embed
