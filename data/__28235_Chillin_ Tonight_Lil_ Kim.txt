4 ContributorsChillinâ€™ Tonight Lyrics
Yeaaah!
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Yeaaah!
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight

My girls is goin' out tonight (yeaaah!)
But I'mma fall back tonight
Me and my man takin' it in tonight
Yeah, we gon' get it in tonight
We gon' smoke something, drink something, toast something
So he can beat the pussy up like it stole something
Get it poppin' all night 'til like 4 somethin'
And then we right back at it 'round 6 somethin'
It's supposed to be girls night out
So you know he got my girlfriends cursin' me out
Sayin' that I'm whipped and he turnin' me out
No need for the gym 'cause he be workin' me out
For me, he got a huge appetite
Lick my ice cream like a tasty delight
The bond between us is tight
I heard duvet poppin' tonight but

I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with my nigga tonight
We 'bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight
You might also like
Tonight it's just me and my boo
Candlelight dinner, sippin' some wine too
Lingerie see-through, you know how I do
Playin' slow jams to set the mood
Some Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, a little Anita
In the bed laughin' at Martin and Gina
All eyes on us like Brad and Angelina
No one can come between us
The things he do give me the chills
Like writin' out "I Love You" on hundred dollar bills
He don't even think about playin' the field
He in ecstasy without takin' the pills
He treats me like a queen I love the way he courts me
Makin' love in the Ferrari he just bought me
Playin' PlayStation Fight Night
I heard stereo poppin' tonight but

I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with my nigga tonight
We 'bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight
From the bed, to the kitchen, to the living room couch
We done blessed every room in this New York penthouse
Miami estate, house by the lake
We ain't watchin' pornos, we watchin' our own sex tape
I pour the Henny all over his jimmy
So when he stick it in me, he's drunk off of Kimmy
I make a nigga bust faster than a semi
'Cause Kimmy get the jimmy rock harder than a penny
Full body massage, champagne bubble bath
Then we make love on a bed made of cash
He can't get enough, he always ready to smash
He love how I'm shaped just like a hourglass
His niggas is tight, he chillin' with his wife
But they don't come before the love of his life
We in the crib havin' a pillow fight
I heard Lotus is poppin' tonight but

I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with my nigga tonight
We 'bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonightEmbed
