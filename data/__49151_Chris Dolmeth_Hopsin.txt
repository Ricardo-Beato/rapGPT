32 ContributorsChris Dolmeth Lyrics
His name is Jesse, we kicked it since we was little kids
Throughout his life there's a bunch of stuff that he shouldn't have did
He was cool but there's a lot of stuff he could have fixed
But addicted to drugs is what I had thought he couldn't get
Until he had started hanging around them other kids
Who showed him how to drink a Corona and puff a cig
And introduced him to weed with added supplements
So whenever he was feeling down he'd take a couple hits
It ain't really bother me cause it was nothing big yo
It only bothered me when he started to fuck with crystal
I'm sure he knew that doing it wasn't a smart move
He'd walk around with humongous pupils like cartoons
I tried to tell him his life goals'll be ruined
But he just told me to "chill out", he knows what he's doing
And now I'm thinking hard if I should get hostile
And said fuck it
And watched him take it right up his nostril

Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me

Eleventh grade where he's supposed to be
But he's in the ninth
He'd wake up for school feeling like it's the end of life
He'd hop off his bunk bed to go and sniff a line
A couple minutes later, now he's energized
He'd go to school and wide open's how he'd get his eyelids
Then he'd get excited
Cause he finished his assignments
Now it's big surprises from the teachers when they find it
Jessy's doing all his work
Well shit aight then
I guess it wasn't that bad after all that he did meth
It made him actually do his work, and not cheat on tests
It boosted up his confidence, he felt like he's the best
He'd stay up all fucking night like he don't need to rest
Until he had none left
Now he's acting strange
He couldn't buy anymore, cause he didn't have the change
So he sold his Xbox and his whole rack of games
I never thought that the crystal could make him act this way

Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me
Jesse's sister walked inside of his room to get something out
Then she noticed Jessy on the bed foaming from his mouth
Now she's tearing up, scared as fuck
Oh he's done it now
So she picks up the phone gives 911 a dial
She tried to give him CPR, before the kid was lost
Then he had woke up and saw her on him and it pissed him off
All of sudden he went crazy just to fucking get her off
He threw her up against the wall so hard it made a picture fall
He can't really get a grip
She can't believe he did this shit
She kinda knew what made him flip
She yelled, it's drugs isn't it
And now the paramedics at the door
So she runs down to open it and they run up with all these antidotes
They tried to tackle him but he's too hard to handle though
They called for back-up
So the station sent another van to go
When they arrived he was spitting in their face and eyes
So they injected him until he had a stable mind
They told his sister that it's time for them to take a ride
You lucky that your brother made it
Cause he almost died
She went up to say bye but he must have dozed off
And I had barely pulled up when the truck drove off
From our apartment buildings, so I didn't see crap
And I ain't get to see him till he got out of rehab
Even when he got out he was still depressed
Until he heard a little tiny voice in his head that said
Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me12Embed
