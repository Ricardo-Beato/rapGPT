3 ContributorsM.O.B. LyricsNigga
Sometimes I feel I got to
Get away
From these streets like a fiend for crack
But pullin' me back it's real got a nigga goin'
'Cuz no matter the drama or gossip
My heart is your hood my dogs niggas I rock wit
(Get away)
Before you get clapped put the tougnes to two loose
Have everybody on the corner goin'
Holdin' they mouth shock as fuck
I haven't just aired that boy out
And now there's blood on my Tims snitches callin' 1 800 crime stoppers
When they see me they like
'Cuz they want that thousand dollars
And not only that police will die to catch a fucking collar
(Get away)
And I'm out of here ain't no telling when I be back
Get rid of this gat
Dog you know I flew hell out of dodge
Nigga 'bout this paper ain't no time to be sitting behind bars
I got to get away
But fuck that never let a nigga take me out of my zone
If he try, then blow 'em and go
Wit no remorse kid it's the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimey retarded
You know
I got to get away
But fuck that never let a nigga take me out of my zone
If he try, then blow 'em and go
Wit no remorse kid it's the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimey retarded
You know
(Get away)
'Cuz I'm not playin' I'm bangin' hammers on niggas
Put hands on that niggas life
Just beat the shit out you I brawl like a animal
Your whole team is scrambling
(That's right)
(Get away)
When we come through pushing new trucks
Bitches be pushing and shoving to look at us
They go, yeah take a good look bitch
It might be last time you'll see gangsters like this, then
(Get away)
'Cuz somebody bout to die
And it's going to be a stampede when them shots fly
Rip that nigga you know
R.I.P your soul just lift up and
(Get away)
Uh huh yeah, you out of here nigga
I'll see on that other side bye nigga
(Other side)
(That's right)
Families cry rivers
Courtesy of my niggas, we terrorize rappers
I got to get away
But fuck that never let a nigga take me out my zone
If he tryin blow 'em and go
Wit no remorse kid it's the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimey retarded
You know
I got to get away
(No doubt tell it like it is)
It's either me or you
Believe it dog no a nigga like you ain't got shit to loose
'Cuz you walking that thin line
I'm clapping you first time for a motherfucker trying
(Get away)
To put it past me
That ass be bleeding somewhere like a hemophiliac exactly
(Shut the fuck up)
Before it's to late go at your gut
You ain't a gangster and yes you could get touched
(Get away)
Saw it before the henny was talking
It wasn't him but you know that nine stopped that
(Grow up)
I swear these niggas like bitches
Why is that ?
'Cuz these niggas always laying on their back
I got to get away
But fuck that never let a nigga take me out my zone
If he tryin' blow 'em and go
Wit no remorse kid it's the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimey retarded
You know
I got to get away
Get away
