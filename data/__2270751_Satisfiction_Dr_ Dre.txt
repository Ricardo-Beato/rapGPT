Simple pleasures, rock star livin'
Drugs and mansions, hit the ceilin'
Cars expensive, blow this action
True revealin' - satisfiction

Yeah, I mean, I listen to these rap records
Half the time I'm suspicious
You niggas sound so fictitious
Believe me, I know the difference
I got some words for you niggas
You're the definition of (Satisfiction)
Listen up, I been where you goin' three times and plus
Big houses, cars, jewelry, bad bitches all around this motherfucker, uh
I seen it all and guess what?
It's the (Satisfiction), you feel me?
Oh yeah, oh I see what you sayin'
I know some niggas just like that
Frontin' ass niggas, man, really ain't got no bucks like that
Stuck like that, its cool if you cool with gettin' love like that
Flashin' down to Southside Raleigh
You'll be runnin' outta luck like that
What I mean by that is why your name always in these rental records?
Spendin' rent money gettin' that bottle service into your section
You leased your car, leased your house, leased your spouse
Know she leavin' if you run outta paper
And might be smashin' your neighbor
I know you think you a star 'cause followers clickin'
Guess your ambition is to keep up with social tradition
Like sneaker shoppin' some of you niggas is fuckin' sickenin'
'Cause you'll take your soul out, just so you could fit in
You might also like
Simple pleasures, rock star livin'
Drugs and mansions, hit the ceilin'
Cars expensive, blow this action

Cuz, fuck wrong with these niggas?
These labels always askin' me to do a song with these niggas
Doc, I think its time for you to open up the pharmacy, nigga
And change this fuckin' music shit, my nigga, you should consider
Nah, I've been doin' me lokin, keepin' these bad bitches open
And keepin' 'em wet, yep, see 'cause Long Beach right by that ocean
Still sippin' that gin and juice, my nigga, yep I'm still on that potion
And all these random niggas fake as fuck and I'm still gettin' noticed
God damn, man, how we 'sposed to handle this shit, cuh
Everything we built these niggas done dismantled this shit, cuh
We gotta get back to that real, that's on the dub
Another lesson from your uncle Snoop, what, what, what?

I'm just statin' the facts
Don't get no realer than that
Satisfiction, attention, listen, play your position, player
Shouldn't be too hard, my nigga
It's supposed to be like a lay up
Shouldn't be so hard to be yourself
My nigga, wake up
Stay up, pay up, straight up, cake up
That's what I'm made of, high? Yup
My life is all authentic, that's why I'm goin' way up
Your satisfaction fictitious, your happiness is made up
Simple pleasures, rock star livin'
Drugs and mansions, hit the ceilin'
Cars expensive, blow this action
True revealin' - Satisfiction
