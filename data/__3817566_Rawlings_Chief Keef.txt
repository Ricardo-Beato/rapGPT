36 ContributorsRawlings Lyrics
DP on the beat
Smokes
Glo
Blood Gang, man
Motherfuckas know how we rockin', man
Glo Gang or no gang, man
Stupid blunts, man, four-wheel drive, man, stupid kush
So motherfuckin' high right now, man
Motherfuckin' mansion, man, got all these acres, square feet
I don't know where the fuck I'm at, man, you feel me?
All type of whips outside
M6's, Audi's, and shit

Ayy, Bally
Ayy, ayy, pass me the Rawlings, ayy, ayy
So I can ball
Bitches already know that we ballin'
I'm at The Mardi Gras in New Orleans
Choppas out, get 'em, boys
Got them dogs out, sniffin'
Runnin' 'round your kitchen, where yo' shit at?
Send my locksmith at yo' door
Send my block, at your folks
You see that Glo, we posted on the Glo block with big ass poles
Where the Glo block at? North suburbs
In my mansion, bitch, ya never heard
Where it's at? You never know
Try to follow me, then I'ma blow
I can be drivin', still got the pipe
Be drivin', and I'll still take your life
Pull up on ya, bitch, I'm still taking flight, ayy
I'm off the Tooka and I'm still getting high
And higher, ayy
Waiting for the days to go by, and by-er, ayy
Only thing that matter is the money, ayy
Wake up in the morning yawning, ayy, gettin' money
Fuckin' honey's, fuckin' thots
Fuck nigga, fuck up your party or your posse
Turn it to a pool party
Almighty, you mighty, ayy
In my 290
Catch you, you a body
Under him, ayy, what was wrong with him?
I don't know, 'cause I'm bipolar
When he shoot, he shoot at your shoulder
Have yo' pipe up, catch you, rawlings
Nigga, we don't carry holsters
Riding with a interlapse, ain't got time for that chitter-chat
Fuck nigga got me, I'ma get 'em back
This choppa break a nigga back
Dududu, niggaYou might also likeEmbed
