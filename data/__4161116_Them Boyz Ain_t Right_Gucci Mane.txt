2 ContributorsThem Boyz Ainâ€™t Right Lyrics
Burr!
It's Gucci, huh
It's Gucci, Flocka, squad
Holiday season
It's Gucci, huh
It's Gucci, Flocka, squad
Holiday season

Them boys ain't right, the hood so crazy
These hoes so crazy, they still ain't nice
I swear these hoes ain't right
The boys sell cake as they whippin' up babies
And dodgin' cell cases, them boys trap tight
The hood gone crazy, the world go rabies
I think its Slim Shady, them boys ain't right
The hood gone crazy, the world go rabies
I think its Slim Shady, them boys ain't right

Sellin' that white, get everything together better have shit right
They don't fist fight, we don't throw right
We East Atlanta niggas and we like to throw dice (Holiday season)
They up all night, gone off X, sippin' that lean, thinkin' 'bout sex
I fucked a lot of , so who's up next
I ain't tryna brag but Flocka's here flexin'
I'm flexin', I'm flexin', my bodies tatted up like a Mexican
And I got no heart like a tin man, I killed ten men and their next of kin

Them boys ain't right, the hood so crazy
These hoes so crazy, they still ain't nice
I swear these hoes ain't right
The boys sell cake as they whippin' up babies
And dodgin' cell cases, them boys trap tight
The hood gone crazy, the world go rabies
I think its Slim Shady, them boys ain't right
The hood gone crazy, the world go rabies
I think its Slim Shady, them boys ain't right

I'm in love with nice lips and lip gloss
Short long hair, I don't care
I need a girl who can party all night with me
Real party girl this here can live in Flocka's world
Grab some girls for my homeboys
Bust it wide open for Brick Squad dope boys
Patron got me open, passion' out bins in VIP like I'm the pill man
Three chains on my neck, lime green flag I'm a Grove Street vet
See, that's a bet, you gon' get your ass wet
Girls screamin' out they love chief Waka's 

Them boys ain't right, the hood so crazy
These hoes so crazy, they still ain't nice
I swear these hoes ain't right
The boys sell cake as they whippin' up babies
And dodgin' cell cases, them boys trap tight
The hood gone crazy, the world go rabies
I think its Slim Shady, them boys ain't right
The hood gone crazy, the world go rabies
I think its Slim Shady, them boys ain't right
Them boys ain't rightEmbed
