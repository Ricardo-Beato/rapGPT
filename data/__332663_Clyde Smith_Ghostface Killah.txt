20 ContributorsClyde Smith Lyrics
My name is Knuckles nigga
Niggas call me Knuckles straight up
Yeah, My real name is Clyde man
Straight up and down man
Clyde Smith, nigga, I'm from the Wally Era, nigga
Straight up, and all my big niggas know
All my niggas that did all that time?
They know how I get down
When I come in, I come in
Straight up, P.O.'s all those niggas, salute me
They, listen man, straight up and down
Five boroughs and all that, I owns that, I owns that
And I'm a Staten Island nigga, straight up
Niggas see that, niggas be like "Yo, let him thru"
That's a made nigga right there
And he gonna punch you in the mouth if you say somethin slick
You see these shits right here?
I'm a die with these on, dig?
Yeah, that's right
And I'ma be up here for a minute
And I ain't goin nowhere
And I'm usin' that phone, and I'm have my little snacks and all that with me
And I dare a nigga to go in my locker
Because yo I'm not playin wit ya niggas man
I'm tellin, you
If you want some ask me for it
And if I like you like that
I'm a hold you down
Whether you think you gon try to on me, that Tom & Jerry shit on me
And have my fingers smashed on the ceiling
Never, never duke
I'm tellin you, I'm a snatch you up there
I'm a snatch you out that little Iceberg t-shirt you got on and that little platinum bullshit ass chain you got
Straight up, and your haircut game is fucked up
I too tired of niggas
Them niggas dudun dudun nigga
Straight up, yo that nigga 50 Cent?
That's yo, I don't even know why he try to do that little dumb ass shit
Right there
But I'm a tell you somethin
You could say all them other niggas name
But niggas, niggas gon see them based on that big daddy
I know why they ain't bark on you
Cuz they ain't try to let your new broke ass trying to come in the game
And act like they lettin you live off they scruff
Ok, you ain't even that big, dig?
And if I see you up in here
I'm a have about 500 wolves on you
And that's *kiss* that's word to everything, duke
You just fucked up, you fucked up bad
I don't even know man
Matter fact, I'm a kick you in ya ass and all that shit
Gon take ya little watch and all that
You know?
But yo like I said 50, you a bird and niggas gonna see you
Faggot ass niggaYou might also likeEmbed
