Fuckin' with me now, but they never was
Tell me where was y'all back on the come up way before the buzz?
Chillin' with my homies in the basement like it really was
Fuckin' with me now, top down, just the four of us
RattPack to the fullest, the people want more of us
Man, now we've finally got connected
Did it all without a plug and so they fucking with me now
Yeah we've got it now, yes I've got it now
So I gotta keep it real right now
Tell me how you feelin', bitches grillin', we making a killin'
The villain chillin', I'm livin' the life I've got the feelin'
For the realest on the rise, shootin' for the sky
VMG fuck all them other guys, been advised to give up
We live up to the bar set, Bobbysoxer doin' 120 in a Corvette
Blowin' up like a war vet
Goddamn, everybody wonder who I am
'Cause I came out the cut like a stitch in your hand
And, my music flowing through your city like drug money
Made a mill' off rap, fuck drug money
And now you hit me like I got you whatever you need
But deep down, hope a motherfucker bleed, yeah they

Talk about they hold me down, yeah?
Acting like they know me, now they know me now, yeah?
Where you been? You gon' be there when I need a friend?
Say I've got 'em when I hit rock bottom and get up again
Sippin' gin, now would you pick up the pen
If I was locked up in the pen?
Tell me can you reminisce on way back when it did begin?
When I look at you, I do not see a friend
When I look at you look at me
I can tell you only see some type of end
Fuckin' with me now, actin' like we kin
But you don't know where I've been
