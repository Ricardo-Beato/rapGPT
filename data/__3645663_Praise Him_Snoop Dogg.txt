4 ContributorsPraise Him Lyrics
I said I woke up early this morning
I'm nowhere near where I need to be
But look at me, I'm feeling free this morning
Get out my bed, move my head, stand on my feet
I'm thankin' Jesus this morning, yeah
I know I don't talk to Ya much
When times get rough
I'm on my knees and I'm callin' You
Cause I know that You will always bring me through
And I know the plan, yes
Sometimes I take advantage
But at times I try to do
Things on my own
And I make a big mess
But I know God got my back
Even when self don't know how to act, yeah

I'm not letting one minute, moment, second pass
Without saying, "Thank You, Lord"
Thank You, Lord
For Your many blessings
Gave me everything I need and more
Even when I don't deserve it
You still watch over my family
And keep 'em safe from all harm and danger
A better man is what I'm tryna be
You might also likeSo I praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Thank Ya, thank Ya, thank Ya
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em

I know this is something I shoulda been doing
No excuses, I know the Word, I was raised the right way
I was off track doing no good
But thank the Lord I got a second chance to make it right back
Would I be a fools to look back to the hills
From which cometh my help
Lord knows I need help
If not I might fail
Thought I was doing great, but
I was just feeling myself, so

I'm not letting one minute, moment, second pass
Without saying, "Thank You, Lord"
Thank You, Lord
For Your many blessings
Gave me everything I need and more
Even when I don't deserve it
You still watch over my family
And keep 'em safe from all harm and danger
A better man is what I'm tryna be
So I praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Thank Ya, thank Ya, thank Ya
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em

Jesus still on the mainline
You just tell Him what you want
My God is still on the mainline
Yeah, praise Him, praise Him
