Tat my name on you, girl, so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real

Tell a bad bitch "Girl, let's go hang"
You know me, Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO Gang
Get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches
Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows and Screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Now, let me gon' hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything to make shit go slow
Yeah, money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us, oh, no

Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?
You might also like
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
It's simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My momma still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker, drums playing
Tap-dance to my drum roll (Uh)
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled

Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?

I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up in some old shit to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I give everybody a piece of this and I make do with what's left
Yeah, I do this shit to the death, yeah, I do this shit 'til I'm gone
Yeah, I told you that it's our world and you're foolish thinking I'm wrong, ooh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real
What's up?
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?37Embed
