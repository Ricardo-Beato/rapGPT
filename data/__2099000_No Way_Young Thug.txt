54 ContributorsNo Way Lyrics
Yeah, Thugger
London on da Track, nigga
Yeah, yeahhh
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ooh
Thugger

These pussy niggas peasants, yeah (What?)
All my niggas gon' be presidents, yeah (Here)
Bitch, I'm wrapped up like a present, yeah
I got credit fuck a debit (Fuck it)
And I'm the truth, this not no flexing
I got, skinny jeans with a weapon
And I'm the future and the present
Baby, pop that pussy like a Pepsi (Pop it)
Baby (Pop it), water like a water fountain
My money colored like a clown
Show me them places like a noun
She can't, can't ride this dick without a sound

No, no, no way, no-no way (No way)
No, no, no way, no-no way (No way)
No, no, no way, no-no way (No way)
No-no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no way no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no way no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no-no way, no-no way

Uh, I flood that bitch, she pop that pussy like a handstand
I get them bricks and bales and go do the Saran dance
I told that bitch suck my vienna out the can, man
She started doing it without a command
I want you to feel this dick inside your hips
And I wanna eat that pussy creamy like a dip (Uhm)
Her pussy wetter than the bottom of a ship
And I wanna make it clap without a clip
Put your motherfucking hands in the sky (Put 'em up)
Throw it up, plus I'm too drunky to drive
Wanna put that pussy, pussy in the sky-y (Sky)
Wanna make that pussy squirt without a try-y (Try)
I might hit that pussy wrong and make it right-ight (Right)
If I start from the ground, I'll hit the sky-y (Sky)
I wear big time glasses
But I got these bands like I'm fuckin' Ray-Ban bitch

These pussy niggas peasants, yeah
All my niggas gon' be presidents, yeah (Here)
Bitch, I'm wrapped up like a present, yeah
I got credit fuck a debit (Fuck it)
And I'm the truth, this not no flexing
I got, skinny jeans with a weapon
And I'm the future and the present
Baby, pop that pussy like a Pepsi (Pop it)
Baby, (Pop it) water like a water fountain
My money colored like a clown
Show me them places like a noun
She can't, can't ride this dick without a sound
No, no, no way, no-no way (No way)
No, no, no way, no-no way (No way)
No, no, no way, no-no way (No way)
No-no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no way no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no way no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no-no way, no-no way

I called my baby my shorty, I got her looking up
I told that club I need fifty bands if they're booking her
I woke up and ate it just like my chef was cooking her
Or room service, watch out she at school nerdy
What's up to Boo Dirty, walk 'round with a cool 30
I don't care where they flying I just wanna know who birdy's
Babe, don't waste no time, come on suck it's 2:30
I left my bitch 'cause I found out she was too flirty (What?)
Yeah, I designed all of my pants
I ain't give no damn I used to spending fifty bands
Yeah, green land Tarzan
I got bitches piling up like we some yams
She wish she could get my dick inside a can
I got three lil' boys which means that I'm the man
I'ma pick my carats out a rabbit
And I get mostly green like a salad
These pussy niggas peasants, yeah (What?)
All my niggas gon' be presidents, yeah (Here)
Bitch, I'm wrapped up like a present, yeah
I got credit, fuck a debit (Fuck it)
And I'm the truth, this not no flexing
I got, skinny jeans with a weapon
And I'm the future and the present
Baby, pop that pussy like a Pepsi (Pop it)
Baby (Pop it), water like a water fountain
My money colored like a clown
Show me them places like a noun
She can't, can't ride this dick without a sound

No, no-no way, no-no way (No way)
No, no-no way, no-no way (No way)
No, no-no way, no-no way (No way)
No-no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no way no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no way no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no-no way, no-no way
No way, no way, no-no way, no-no way16Embed
