7 ContributorsAngel Lyrics
You were my angel
What happened to your wings
Girl I need you to fly
Oh you don’t want to fly
Fuck you then
I thought they would be happy to see me do good
Now they wonder why I’m steady screaming fuck that hood
Niggas talk crazy because I ain’t there, they ain’t crazy
They know me for beefing until I let off that 80
Even my baby mamma, we don’t even talk no more
She like you Hollywood ass nigga, your ass done changed
Im like child support, welfare, your ass the same
When its you against the world, tell me who do you trust
Some punk bitch that want to be in love on a bus
Yeah my hustle done changed but I got the same ambition
Same mentality, the same intuition
Besides a little money, man ain’t much difference
Still got the same bob when I walk with the Ruger
Nigga stunt if you want and I’ll put one threw ya
Not when I drive by, I’ll walk up to ya
Not from across the street, I’ll walk up to ya

Homie, you frown when you see me up
Then got the nerve to smile when you see me down
I don’t understand niggas fuck it
You niggas in the hood are like crabs in a bucket
Homie, you frown when you see me up
Then got the nerve to smile when you see me down
I don’t understand niggas fuck it
You niggas in the hood are like crabs in a bucket
You might also like
Do the sight of the Porsche got them sick, yeah
Hope so, and if so, eat a dick or let it go homie
Had a hood full of friends now I seem so lonely
Money I made changed them, now who’s the phony
Shared 40s with niggas, let them tap the bottle
We was in the same boat and had the same old problems
Dreamt for the top, had to start rock bottom
Shit ain’t fall in my lap, fuck is on a niggas noggin
Hav so cool, but now I want to rob and blow your mother fucking head off
Nigga won’t die from starving
The rate of niggas turning on each other is alarming
My lady’s my ex-lady, yeah she got the same problem
Last record went wood, voicemail was empty
G-Unit Rugers now this shit is so full
A nigga eating good, my stomach so full
Now niggas want to stick me, oh this world is so cruel
Fuck y’all niggas


I know that you ain’t believe in me
I know you just with me ‘cause you make it easy
You ain’t got to pretend, we ain’t got to be friends
You can go on with your life babygirl go ahead
Running around chasing clowns that you choose to fuck
The kind of pussy I’m getting right now, you fucked up
You just like a lot of niggas that I grew up with
Get to know you long enough you just a regular bitch
Niggas do long years, come home like they the shit
Nigga I’ll make you wish you had nine more in
You were safe in that cell, now you in my world
I catch you without a pass, that ass get twirled
Like the weed, you get smoked up
Its too much police, you getting poked up
I know that you thought that P was Pooh
I know you had no idea but now you do
