Please subscribe to the membership
Of unorthodox penmanship
25 arms in yet the hunger and the eye still cries
Let the games begin
And the bull wins death at the matador's test
The bully can't pull me out the S direct
Came from super MC skateboard dunk fresh
And the way we school was the JD rule
The rock the hips turn it up and pay that nigga his chips
Yeah, paid to the J all day
And they say the Soul is one of the best
To do it over a track from Dill
I'm like naw you need to study Phat Kat or Slumville
The will of God was to give the man wings
To ascend and make music and blend
With the king of kingsYou might also like1Embed
