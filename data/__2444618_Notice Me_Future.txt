8 ContributorsNotice Me Lyrics
DJ Scream, Hoodrich bitch!
Notice me..
Future (Bitch, bitch)

Wear the most expensive clothes, just so you can notice me
Fucking with the baddest hoes, I know that you notice me
Dropping 80 bands on a piece, so you can notice me
The space coupe a beast, can’t help but to notice me
(Ooh-ooh) I know you know you notice me
(Yeah, yeah) can’t help but notice me
(Ooh-ooh) I know you know you notice me
(Yeah, yeah) can’t help but notice me

Got the most expensive jeans, I know that you notice me
Young  up in Louis V don’t you notice me
Throw away a lot of cake, so for you to notice me
Black Amigo Gang, Young Future, yeah you notice me
Royalty, royalty, lets go to the pharmacy, purple lean
Collard greens, strong pack, ten stacks, I know that you notice me
Personally I doubt its, certainly I murk a track two follies and a mac
You gone know when I attack living like a rockstar
So many fucking tags, you gone notice me
Officially, seriously, keep my bitches differently
Know Versace notice me, running through the pair of C’s

Wear the most expensive clothes, just so you can notice me
Fucking with the baddest hoes, I know that you notice me
Dropping 80 bands on a piece, so you can notice me
The space coupe a beast, can’t help but to notice me
(Ooh-ooh) I know you know you notice me
(Yeah, yeah) can’t help but notice me
(Ooh-ooh) I know you know you notice me
(Yeah, yeah) can’t help but notice me

Spent a quarter million on some diamonds so you notice me
Bring the whole hood to the club so you notice me

Don’t I got the hood on my face so you notice me
Switching up my hustle burning money, so you notice me
Big bank all hundreds boy I know you notice me
