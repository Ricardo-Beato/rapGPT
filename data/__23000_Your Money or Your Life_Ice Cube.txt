This world, so trife
Your money or your life (yeah)
Keep yo' kids, keep yo' wife
Money or your life (give it up)
This world, so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life (West Coast)
Keep yo' kids, keep yo' wife
Money or your life

I got that gangbang mentality, movie after movie
Cain't get it out of me, who wanna battle me?
Mouth is a Uzi, I thumbtack your ass
To the concrete, treat you like a floozy
The pyroclastic flow, that I lay
Will turn this fuckin booth to Pompeii
Now what will I do in broad day?
I turn Broadway, into a hallway
Motherfuckers want to know the herbs and spices
They come to me and want to know what my advice is
I'm spiritual nigga, like Jesus Christ is
And lyrical bitch, I'm 'bout the nicest
Content, longevity, plus I spit shit
That sit on your brain nigga heavily
I can do this shit 'til I'm seventy
On the Vegas Strip, yeah there I'll be
You might also like
This world (this world) so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life
Keep yo' kids, keep yo' wife
Money or your life (give it up)
This world, so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life (you know~!)
Keep yo' kids, keep yo' wife
Money or your life

Now I get that money, make that cheddar
Play a double header, we can do better
You can get wetter, blown out your sweater
So much game need Dick Bavetta
Now Helen Keller, can read this letter
Twenty-third space if you read alphabeta
I'm a go getter, youse a pointsetta
Pointin at me like you got a vendetta
Boy you know better! They used to call me
Cube the Impaler, ask Jerry Heller
You the kind of fella that look for Cinderella
I'm the kind of fella that steal her umbrella
Now this ain't a diss, don't tell Roc-a-Fella
And don't exercise the ghost of Makaveli
But I just got to be the best storyteller
I tuck Slick Rick in with this acapella
Ask Yella
This world, so trife
Your money or your life (grand wizard)
Keep yo' kids, keep yo' wife
Money or your life
This world (this world) so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life (gotta have it)
Keep yo' kids (uhh) keep yo' wife (c'mon!)
Money or your life
