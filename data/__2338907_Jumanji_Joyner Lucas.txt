Stompin all up in the rain
Hop up all up in the way
Elephants a couple lions and a zebra
Put the heater’s in your face
And leave you with the monkeys
A banana clip, it’s funny
Watch em pull apart your little face
And I've been in the jungle with the fucking apes
Tell em what i slay
Beast in a cage
Nigga this is what you call Jumanji
Ain't no new Bugatti's
Just a deuce deuce shotty
Big enough to make Bruce Bruce potty
Turnin' Bruce Jenner to a new hobby
I ain't cool with nobody
I don't trust a motherfucking soul nigga
Even let the grim reaper know nigga
Put it on my tombstone when I die here
Take a step inside of my world
27 years still ain't comfortable enough to call a bitch my girl
You are now looking at a monster
85 teeth, 39 deep, 26 piece
Run and light a fucking military with a M-16
Influenced by George Bush
Burn your whole city with a blowtorch
Then I ride out in a tour bus
And I hop out in a Porsche truck
Like blah
Black tie swagger
Black pride nigga
Black lives matter
Black eye shadow
Black nine barrel
Bang bang move back my nigga
Why lie?
Every night I pray to my god
I don't gotta wait to blah blah
And I never gave two caca's
I'm a heavyweight new prime time
In an MMA fight
With a Kimbo Slice for your neck
Then I put my fucking life in the script
It's a movie put my life in the shit
Pack a mag and we could get it crackalackin
Back when I was tryna make it happen-happen
Nothin' happened, nothin' ever shot at rapping
And if that doesn't happen I'ma stack it
Till I turn a pack into another pack
‘Til I sack it up to cap a captain
Big enough to put a fucking bomb inside it
And blow flames on a fire
Be the dragon
Bin Laden ain't got shit on me
I don't think you understand
You are really looking at the devil, nigga
I don't think you wanna dance
Meet me in the clouds and the smoke nigga
I hope nigga you ain't never stood a chance
You ain't never, you ain't never
Could've been should've been would've been
Look at him Joyner Lucas
Stompin' all up in your face
Poppin all up in the bass
Elephants, a couples lions, and a cheetah
But the heaters in ya face
And leave you with the monkeys
A banana clip, its funny
Watch 'em pull apart your little face
And I been in the jungle with the fucking apes
Hunters wanna slay beasts in a cave
Nigga, this is what you call Jumanji
You might also like
Jumanji

Me and my bitch against y'all
So fuck you and your in-laws
Never grew up on Crenshaw
But I grew up on menthols
And I smoke till my fucking lungs squeeze
And I choke till my fucking tongue bleed
In the carpet of yo mom's crib
Till your tubs leaks on them love seats
And this must be what it feels like
When you full force and I'm dead right
And you dead wrong and I'm here like
With my hands wrapped around his like
Goddamn
Black tie swagger
Black pride nigga
Black lives matter
Black eye shadow
Black nine barrel
Bang bang move back my nigga
This is more than a board game
What's Jumanji with a little morphane
The gorillas talking like a torpedo finna knock up on your fucking door frame
Not a problem you was just a floor stain
At the bottom of the ground i'm walking on
I betcha momma teach you not to talk a lot
I betcha ya dog'll teach you not to bark a lot
A lot niggas gotta get it
I've been tryna get it
I'ma tell you bout it, if you gotta minute
Got a minute?
Ayo you gotta minute my nigga?...
...Yo...
Ayo you got a minute?...
Aight...
Back when Iverson was in his prime
I was writing
I ain't wanna get a job
I was dream chasing
I was gettin mine
You was sleeping
I was tryna get a line
Nigga woo
Ayo Joyner...
Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling when you rolling that dice on that Jumanji game, my nigga
Get em!

If you try stopping us
I'll turn into a fucking rhinoceros
And put a dick inside of your esophagus
And poppin shit
And mopping up a nigga
Cock another glocka
Blocka blocka
Blocka!
We the bunch of niggas down in Opa-locka
Put the biggest cock up all up in your momma
Hahaha
When I fall
I'll beat you like a father
Like it's no tomorrow
Bitch you wanna swallow
Holler, holler, holler, holler
Get em!
If you try stopping us
I'll turn into a fucking rhinoceros
And put a dick inside of your esophagus
And poppin shit
And mopping up a nigga
Cock another glocka
Blocka blocka
Blocka!
We the bunch of niggas down in Opa-locka
Put the biggest cock up all up in your momma
I'mma I'mma I'm a nigga
Got a lot of dollar
Make a nigga disappear like voila voila voila
Fuck around if you want!
