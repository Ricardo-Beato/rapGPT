If I say so, know they gon' ride
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'ma want it, but I get by
Tell the devil I can't have him inside (Woah)
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright

I smoked myself to sleep, I'm sad, I think I'm feelin' lonely
Took one too many shots last night and I spent all my money
Started thinkin', "Am I stupid to be funny
Over things that's been hauntin' me all my life?"
And I'm fuckin' living proof that if you want it
You can have anything right before your eyes

And the award goes to, Lil Nas X
Lil Nas X (Lil Nas X)
Lil Nas X (Lil Nas X)
The number one song on the Billboard Hot 100, "Call Me By Your Name" by Lil Nas X

I wanted fame and I wanted riches
Wanted happiness, wanted forgiveness
Started focusin' on all these wishes
Crazy how this shit come to fruition
I've done things in my past I'm sorry for, so, please, don't hold me (Hold me)
Old people in my life should know that I am not the old me (The old me)

If I say so, know they gon' ride (Gon' ride)
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'ma want it, but I get by (Get by)
Tell the devil I can't have him inside
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright

Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh
