7 ContributorsIt Ainâ€™t Funny Lyrics
They murked your homeboy that was cold blooded
& Last I heard they killed him over drug money
He died on a Friday at 11:30
Said he left his girl like
I'm double cupped Shawty my cup so dirty (Pouring)
Never seen a nigga drink so muddy (pouring)
Never seen a nigga make this much money

Gucci Mane I want my piece of the pie
I sold dope, I didn't goto DeVry
My mama look me dead square in my eye
And told me you ain't got to lie boy your high (TRUU)
I was a stick up kid I had a .45
I make a nigga put his hands in the sky
They said ill never make it to 25
I was selling nickle bags in junior high
One day every man goto die
I got a gangsta homie come from the chi
Said he been gang banging ever since he was 5
And everyday he thank the lord he alive

They murked your homeboy that was cold blooded
& Last I heard they killed him over drug money
He died on a Friday at 11:30
Said he left his girl like 11 birdies
I'm double cupped Shawty my cup so dirty (Pouring)
Never seen a nigga drink so muddy (pouring)
Never seen a nigga make this much money

Ghost Thang on the feet Quarter key for the shoes
Ten bands for your life, Five hundred on the tool
That's a throw away, Bitch I'm bout to take these hoes to school
That's a murder weapon throw it in the river when you through
On my young nigga shit, in my old school reppin'
With my hat to the back, with my fully loaded weapon
Tried to re-up in my hood, I'mma teach yo ass a lesson
Fresh off a million dollar run, that's what I call a blessing
Bitch I'm cool with the bank owner fucking on the bank teller
Ten figure nigga hood rich, I can buy whatever
But I remember them days when I was starvin'
Like you remember them days when I was robbin'
Hands Up, Face Down, Lemme' get ya sack
Kick the door down nigga tell me where its at
Beat a nigga head with a baseball bat till his eyes turn blue and his head turn black
HA, you dont know the half bout that
Break you loose you yo ass bout that
Ain't no fuck round with them goonies where im from, Cuz they not having that

They murked your homeboy that was cold blooded
& Last I heard they killed him over drug money
He died on a Friday at 11:30
Said he left his girl like
I'm double cupped Shawty my cup so dirty (Pouring)
Never seen a nigga drink so muddy (pouring)
Never seen a nigga make this much money1Embed
