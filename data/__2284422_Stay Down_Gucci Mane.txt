7 ContributorsStay Down Lyrics
Ay ay ay, I don't wanna leave, I just wanna stay
Make a couple play count that money all day
I don't wanna go it's hard for me to leave
Fuck it ima stay this money all I need
I'm doing good  i'm staying put 
It's all I know, I don't wanna go
I'm getting paid everyday  why would I leave bitch ima stay

Bitch I stay on 24/7 my trap house go bezerk
She can't stay away from pimping baby wanna work
And I stay up on that fashion I got cheetah print on ma jacket
Cheetah print on ma khakis and it all came from trapping
I spend a hundred in a day in New York that's how I play
I told P I wanna stay told me ain't no fucking way
My money taller than the Dikembe, yeah
Your money smaller than a crack baby, yeah
Its a spill in Zone 6, cause i'm steady spilling sauce
Quadruple hoes quadruple exhaust catch me pulling off
Whipping soft like it's chicken broth chilling in the lob 
And I might stay up for 2 days I popped the molly i'm taking off

Ay ay ay, I don't wanna leave, I just wanna stay
Make a couple play count that money all day
I, I, I don't wanna go it's hard for me to leave
Fuck it ima stay this money all I need
I'm doing good  i'm staying put 
It's all I know , I don't wanna go 
I'm getting paid everyday  why would I leave bitch ima stay

Ay I don't ever wanna leave, all I wanna do is stay
But I know I probably should leave
 for I fuck around and spend a hundred k
Bal Harbour, YSL, Hermes, Versace 
Neiman Marcus dropped a sack, going crazy
Leader top floor panoramic view
Top floor, it's hard for me to go, it's hard for me to leave I just wanna stay
Thumbing through that cash look at the ocean all day
It's time to play I gotta show at play, leave ya go and live a little

Ay ay ay, I don't wanna leave, I just wanna stay
Make a couple play count that money all day
I, I, I don't wanna go it's hard for me to leave
Fuck it ima stay this money all I need
I'm doing good  i'm staying put 
It's all I know , I don't wanna go 
I'm getting paid everyday  why would I leave bitch ima stayEmbed
