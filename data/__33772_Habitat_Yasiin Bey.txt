We all got to have, some place that we come from (Home: a place where someone lives, a residence)
This place that we come from is called home (The physical structure within which one lives, such as a house)
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can (A dwelling place with the social unit that occupies it, a household)
We travel this big earth as we roam (An environment offering security and happiness. A valued place. A native habitat)
We all got to have, some place where we come from (A place where something is discovered, founded, developed, or promoted)
This place that we come from is called home (A source, a headquarters, a home base)
And even though we may love, this place on the map (All correlating to a teams place of origin on or into the point of which something is directed to the center or the heart. ?)
Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at

I come up in the street around some real wild brothers
With more than one name and more than one baby mother
More than one case, been on more than one run
Got more than one enemy and more than one gun
Partner, all that is left to want is more
While them cats whose less privileged is just more raw
Less space cause the projects laced with more flaws
Less sleep cause the nights ain't peace, it's more war
The can is raw like thirsty, rainy season thunder claps
On the block with your old pop pleading number act
To the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at
To the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped
With the jungle cats, lions and tigers, leopards and cheetahs
For gazelle you get chased like a zebra, they blaze cheeba-cheeba
And dominate the weaker on the street
Hungry bellies only love what they eat and it's hard to compete
When they smilin with your heart in they teeth
And the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath
Son I been plenty places in my life and time
And regardless where home is, son home is mine

We all got to have (in this world) some place where we come from (travellin travellin travellin travellin)
This place that we come from is called home (so many places I go)
We set out on our travels, (in this world) we do the best we can  (travellin travellin)
We travel this big earth as we roam (roam roam roam)
We all got to have, some place that we come from (people all over the world)
This place that we come from is called home (got to have some place to call home)
And even though we may love, this place on the map (place on the map)
Said it ain't where ya from, (ain't where you from) it's where ya at

Some people live out in-New York City
Some people live out in-Atlanta
Some people got to live-Chicago
Some people do live-Miami
All my people at-California
And other people got to live-London
And everybody got to live in the whole big world
Together just you and me

When I think of home, my remembrance of my beginning
Laundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen
Chillin in front my building with my brother and them
Spending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them
Wise town and Beat Street, federal relief
Slowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat
Sticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep
With every flavor Now & Later only a dime apiece
Old timers on the bench playing cards and thangs
Telling tales about they used to be involved in things
Start to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out
On the phone, call the cops, pick'em up, move'em out
And it's all too common to start wildin
I'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence
And it's hard to find
Block parties in dark lobbies
Funeral homes packed but only dark bodies
I can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley
Marley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall
Son I been to many places in my space and time
And whatever my home is, son home is mine
We all got to have, (been all over this world) some place where we come from (travellin travellin travellin travellin)
This place that we come from is called home (so many places I go)
We set out on our travels, (set out on the travels) we do the best we can (and do the best I can)
We travel this big earth as we roam (? best I know)
We all got to have, (we all got to have) some place where we come from (some place you call home)
This place that we come from is called home (some place your heart can be close to)
And even though we may love, (we may love) this place on the map (this place on the map)
Said it ain't where ya from, (no no) it's where ya at (it ain't where ya at)
I said it ain't where ya from, (hey hey) it's where ya at
I said it ain't where ya from, (no no) it's where ya at
(I said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at)
(I said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at)
(I said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at)
It's where ya at5Embed
