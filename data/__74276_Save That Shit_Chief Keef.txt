Young Chop on the beat
She say she love me, whatever that is (I don't know)
BandKamp
Do me a favor, save that shit (Bitch)

She say she love me, whatever that is (I don't know)
Do me a favor, save that shit (Bitch)
Like bad kids, bitch, we reckless (Yeah)
Ball hard, stunt like Texas (Bang, bang)
He say he know Sosa, he be lacking (Nah)
Do me a favor, save that shit (Bitch)
You fuck niggas better stay packing (Bang, bang)
A lot of extended clips, no acting (Bang, bang)

She say she know Sosa, he be flexing
Pull up, windows down, smell refreshing
Good loud pack, smell like cat piss
Hanging out the roof, young and reckless
Rocking in my Rock jeans
Campaign Sosa, every nigga following
I ain't with the arguing
My niggas come, click clack, no arguing
She say she love me, whatever that is
We see a opp, shit get hectic
A lot of extended clips, no acting
No sex, bitch, I only want the neck, bitch
You might also like
She say she love me, whatever that is (I don't know)
Do me a favor, save that shit (Bitch)
Like bad kids, bitch, we reckless (Yeah)
Ball hard, stunt like Texas (Bang, bang)
He say he know Sosa, he be lacking (Nah)
Do me a favor, save that shit (Bitch)
You fuck niggas better stay packing (Bang, bang)
A lot of extended clips, no acting (Bang, bang)

She say she love me, whatever that is (I don't know)
Do me a favor, save that shit (Bitch)21Embed
