7 ContributorsProblem Lyrics
The streets told me there was a problem
If there's a problem you got to say my name nigga
You know where I be at
I'm all over the place like dog shit
Matter umma help you out
Umma get young to help about it
Umma hit him up on twitter @therealestalive
You wanna get that cannon the go ahead and do that

You niggas thought I was gone , just gonna go away
Want me gone like the wind and just blow away
Want me to hang up my mic and put the blow away
Well I refuse to let them treat me like a throw a way
Remember times nigga I was doing four a day
Same nigga four times made me 80k
Now I'm feeling like the shit, took me two showers
Now I got to count this shit took me 2 hours
4 12s" in the back that my favorite drum
Black Chevelle, white stripes looking like a skunk
Black soles white stripes that's my favorite dunks
40 cal stainless steel match my favorite pump

You got a problem on your hands
Roley with the big bezel I got a problem on my hands
Is there a problem on the set ?
Don't know that boy problem ? he got a problem on his neck
You got a problem with me bitches, I see how you looking you got a problem with my clique ?
Is there a problem in this bitch ?
Long as you niggas know there be some problems in this bitch
You might also like
You niggas planning my funeral and I ain't dead yet
Want me to pick out my cell and I ain't fed yet
Heard its over for the boy, I even read that
It ain't over till I say and it ain't say that
What the fuck is a hustle if you don't sweat
Whats good is da workout if you don't stretch
Whats the sense of having muscle if you don't flex
And everyday its something new imï»¿ thinking whats next
And when it rains it pours ya niggas get wet
And when he shoots, he scores got niggas upset
Niggas want me to lose I think the cards fixed
Tryna make it rough on your dawg I think the yard fixed

You got a problem on your hands
Roley with the big bezel i got a problem on my hands
Is there a problem on the set ?
Don't know that boy problem ? he got a problem on his neck
You got a problem with me bitches, I see how you looking you got a problem with my clique ?
Is there a problem in this bitch ?
Long as you niggas know there be some problems in this bitch

Ya got a problem in the booth , fuck around with young I leave a problem in the booth
You damn right got no problem getting loose, don't know you niggas problem
You got a problem with the truth, cuz I'm a problem in the coupe
Gotta call tech support I'm having problems with my roof
Roger that, that your problem wheres your roof
And plus I think the white got a problem with my tooth
All day back forth Bruce Whiter, all day black K's al-Qaeda
These want me to bail, I ain't bail yet
These niggas want me to fail, I ain't fail yet
You got a problem on your hands
Roley with the big bezel i got a problem on my hands
Is there a problem on the set ?
Don't know that boy problem ? he got a problem on his neck
You got a problem with me bitches, I see how you looking you got a problem with my clique ?
Is there a problem in this bitch ?
Long as you niggas know there be some problems in this bitchEmbed
