You know who this is?
GotItAll
It's Pauly, close the door (Close that door)
(Huh)
Yeah this  at alls
Yeah we seen your Instagrams
(We know who you like and who you don't like)
You think I wasn't gonna see you post those pictures?
(Soon as you signed up we followed you)
We followed you in and then we followed you right back
(Huh, huh, liking bitches pictures from 70 weeks ago)
You think we can't get in computers?
(Get the duct tape Pauly)
We got to drop on you
You've left your location on, you bastard
Ey, Tony, Tony
(Fuck him)
Hey Tony
(Fuck him)
Wait a minute here goes the door
(Breathing)

(Hang the fucking phone up, clear the lines)
