35 ContributorsDouble It Lyrics
Traphouse Mob
This is a Melo beat
Hmm-mm-mm-mm, oh
I get it, then- (Hmm-mm-mm)
I get it, then flip it, then double it
I get it, then flip it, then double it
I get it, then flip it, then double it
I get it, then flip it, then double it
I get it, then flip it, then double it
I get it

It's big papi locsta
Big racks only, when niggas step on the scene
Ain't nobody told ya'?
Off the bracelet so I'm back to wildin' in these streets
Mr. Spin-in-Rovers
Balmains and Gucci sweaters, hopin' out the V's
Mr. Run-You-Over
On A$AP, I up it ASAP an' took yo' bih
I'm a trappin' fanatic (Trappin' fanatic)
I walk in the spot like I want it all
Amiri jeans for the denim, 100 clip, he get him
Don't call it who wanna ball
Double G for the swag, you can check the tag
Flossy nigga droppin' G's
Big Benty for the V's, double G the T
Benji's bussin' out the jeans
You might also like
I get it, then flip it, then double it
Big slips, we gon' walk 'em in
I pull up, a milli', got Ninas attached
535, I got treesh in the back
Say that's your mans, he is a rat
Can't fuck with these niggas, niggas is whack
Come to your block, give him a smack
Pull up, TD, leave where he's at
Shorty

Forty (Forty)
Yeah, I've been wildin' since fourteen
Shootin' like Korver
Finesse like Corey, spin it, I'm on 'em, spinnin', we shootin' down Hawthorne
Look, be on my tail, like peanut butter
Windows is tinted, can't see nothin'
I'm strapped with a laser if he want it
Put a bullet in your head and your femur (Gang, gang gang)

Drillin' shit now (Drill)
Grippin' them shells, hope these niggas don't tell (Sshh)
I am not seein' no cell (No cell)
'Cause Pop Smoke got my bail (He do)
I get it, then flip it, then double it
9 to the Floss when we comin' in (9 to the Floss)
We where them hunnids say
No, we ain't run with it
9 to his Bloods, now he tumblin' (Bow bow)
Put that lil' bitch on the shelf (On the shelf)
LV on my belt (We done)
Drippin' designer myself (I do)
I am not needin' no help (I don't)
Saucin' (Saucin')
I'm on the Molly, I'm nauseous (Molly)
Don't play with the gang, precaution (Gang)
Where is my mind? I lost it (I lost it)
Woo, saucin' (Saucin')
Spin on these niggas regardless (Gang)
Hop out and aim for the target (Bow)
I used to play up in Target (In Sweden)
Woo (Woo woo)
I used to trap out the garbage (The garbage)
I used to trap in the darkness (The darkness)
It's a Wraith, not a Charger (Skrrt)
It's a Wraith, not a Charger (Gang)
I get it, then flip it, then double it (Double it)
Big slips, we gon' walk 'em in (Big slips)
I pull up, a milli', got Ninas attached (Skrrt)
535, I got treesh in the back
Say that's your mans
He is a rat
Can't fuck with these niggas
Niggas is whack
Come to your block, give him a smack
Pull up, TD
Leave where he's at
