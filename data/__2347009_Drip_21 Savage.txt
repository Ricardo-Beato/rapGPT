20 ContributorsDrip Lyrics
21 Savage
Metro Boomin
Savage Boomin or Metro Savage
Whatever you wanna call it or ball it
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
On a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
On a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip

Aquafina drip, when she dancing, all the rich niggas gonna tip
I got the same kinda guns like TIP
Plus I'm hood rich like rip
I ain't never seen an ass so fat
She want a young nigga selling crack
I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping all over this track
If he is not dripping, then we gonna run off with his pack
VVS dripping, these ain't crystals
Your jeweler disappoint, he selling crystals
I hear your baby daddy work at Krystal's
I hope you brush your teeth before you kiss him (21)

Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
On a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
On a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip

I'm whipping work, I done spilled baking soda on my shirt
I'm smoking OG, you smoking purp'
Real street nigga, don't get hurt
I'm in the kitchen cooking crack like it's bacon
These pussy-ass rappers, they be faking
I'm 21 Savage, ain't no faking, AK-47 get the shaking
Don't wanna be your man, can I fuck your friend?
I wanna fuck your friend, can I fuck your twin? (808 Mafia)
Choppas on the couch, choppa bring the power
Thought he had a brick (Metro), but I sold him flour

Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
On a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
On a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip8Embed
