45 ContributorsTurn on Me Lyrics
Freeband Gang
I seen a so-called good girl turn on me
I smoke this dope to burn, burn, burn on it
I gave her new waves and I watched her turn on me
Yeah

With this dope in my system, I know you gon' turn on me
With this dope in my system, I know you gon' turn on me
I been away too much, I know you gon' turn on me
We smoked so much, the ashes startin' to burn on me
I smoke so much, the ashes startin' to burn on me
I told you from the start you was gon' turn on me
I seen so-called good girls turn on me
I seen a so-called good girl turn on me

I smoke this dope to burn, burn, burn on it
I hit her once and then she tried to shine on me
I passed her off like a blunt to the homies
I passed her off like a blunt to the homies
We up the boulevard, it's way too real
They took away Morris Brown, shit was way too real
Grew up three minutes from downtown, shit get way too real
I got them Texas boppers on call, shit get way too trill
I got your ex tryna call, shit gettin' way too real
You know I'm with the shits, shit get way too real
Cartier frames on me, know I got them thangs on me
Panamera brain on me, you know I'm switchin' lanes in it
After I give you this game, you should never let a lame hit it
After I give you this game, you should never let a lame hit it
I'm the one, put all the rings on you
I'm the one took all the blame for it
I had to look at this lame have you
Try to figure out then why I ain't have you
I'ma give you everything, I ain't crabbin'
Give you everything you want, shit, I ain't crabby
You never had a nigga that's lame, trappin'
You turned on Daddy, that's lame & crappy
Hit that shit, now your name droppin'
Now I hit that shit, that's your name droppin'
Come over later, I mash in it
I lay her with it, I crashed in it
Lay in your bed, get grass in it
Let's smoke this blunt, got ashes in it
Lookin' at a young rich nigga like
"Damn you mothafuckin' ol', lil' nasty nigga"

With this dope in my system, I know you gon' turn on me
With this dope in my system, I know you gon' turn on me
I been away too much, I know you gon' turn on me
We smoked so much, the ashes startin' to burn on me
I smoked so much, the ashes startin' to burn on me
I told you from the start you was gon' turn on me
I seen so-called good girls turn on me
I seen a so-called good girl turn on me

Nowadays, I deal with lawsuits
You tellin' me that's what it came to
Hookin' your panties and bras off
That's how a nigga remember you
After I hit it and splashed in it
You should never ever ever let a square get it
I'm the one put all the flames on you
I had you, tatted my name on you
You know them streets, they was callin' me back
I ain't gonna front like they ain't want ya
Money over bitches, that's the first lesson
That's money over bitches, that's the first lesson
Sleepin' on minks, that's no flexin'
Had you whippin' up a foreign, that's no question
Had you whippin' up a foreign, that's no question
I'm the one, give all this game to you
Had wheat Timbs on when I came to you
I don't want play with this lame business
I curled up in it and came in it
I gotta play with these cards given
Ain't never gonna have my heart in it
I got a gift and I'm God given
That's why I'm gon' live like Godzilla
With this dope in my system, I know you gon' turn on me
With this dope in my system, I know you gon' turn on me
I been away too much, I know you gon' turn on me
We smoked so much, the ashes startin' to burn on me
I smoked so much, the ashes startin' to burn on me
I told you from the start you was gon' turn on me
I seen so-called good girls turn on me
I seen a so-called good girl turn on me

I seen a so-called good girl turn on me
After I give you this game, you should never let a lame hit it4Embed
