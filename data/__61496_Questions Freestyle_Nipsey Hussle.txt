10 ContributorsQuestions Freestyle Lyrics
(The Empire)
Uh, mh
It's the blind leadin' the blind
DJ Green Lantern, cinematic
Slauson Boy, Hussle
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Hussle, Hussle

Listen, look, look, now ask yourself a question is you real or is you fake?
Do you sell a nigga dreams or do you stand on what you say?
When they ask you where you from you bite your lip and hesitate?
Or do you step back and chunk your hood up in they face
Is you bangin' is you poppin' is you turnt up
And dope money keep the kush wrapped and burnt up
Ya hot boy bullets bustin' out your granny's shit
You gang-bangin' even though it got your family sick
Now what your life about does money motivate your actions
Is you stackin' or you lost the self satisfaction
Now ask is that your nigga or a snake in disguise
If that nigga give advice that'll lead to your demise
Just some questions
It's just some thoughts for the mind, it's just some questions

Now ask yourself another question is you happy with your life?
House behind a picket fence couple kids and a wife
Or do you see yourself standin' in a different light
Your ambitions of a hustler got you pumpin' all night
Do you know where your goin' or what you come from
I was a slanger then a banger never a dumb, dumb
So what is you when u shoot without a set aim
A body part takin' orders from the set brain, listen what the set sayin'
I will kill without a cause death before dishonor for your niggas go hard
Now ask is that your nigga or a snake in disguise?
If that nigga give advice that'll lead to your demise
Just some questions
It's just some thoughts for the mind, it's just some questions
