DJ Chose

Ayy, first of all, I'm from Houston
Picky bitch, I'm choosy

New-new with the new shit (Mwah)

Bitch, don't like me all you want, run up, bet you won't (Uh)
(Houston, we have a problem) (Hey, yeah)
Bitch, don't like me all you want, run up, bet you don't (Uh)
(Five, four, three, two, one) Ayy, ayy, yeah
I do what I want and you do what you can
That's why I'm breaking your man (Huh)

Today, I woke up in my act (Huh)
Look at these bitches, they whack (Ugh)
Now look at Megan, she bad (Ayy)
Niggas in love with this ass (Ayy)
Ride you, ride you like a beat (Beat)
Want me next to you like I'm B (Huh)
College girl like Moesha (Uh)
With titties like Mia Khalifa (Woo)
I need to run up a bag quick
I need to hit me a new lick
I told these hoes, "Quit fucking these tricks" (Ugh)
I get that money, not givin' up shit
Gettin' my muhfuckin' money on (Yeah)
And I ain't comin' if the money wrong (Nope)
Bitches hate me like I done 'em wrong (What?)
Talkin' shit but they ain't comin' wrong
Do we have a problem, bitch? (Do we?)
Wit' yo' nigga, prolly, bitch (Maybe)

Bitch, don't like me all you want, run up, bet you won't
(Bet you won't)
Man, I'm on these bitches necks like a fucking charm (Fucking charm)
Make a nigga come quick like I fucking owe him

I look like I belong in a pageant
Most of these bitches look like they done had it
I know I'm pretty but shit could get ratchet
Pull up with niggas that's full of that action (Huh)
He think my hustle attractive (Uh)
Thumbin' through money, romantic (Ayy)
Ride on the dick how I dance (Uh)
Your bitch only fuck on her back (Ew)
I be talkin' to him reckless when I'm super faded
I told that nigga, "Eat this pussy like your mama made it," uh (Yeah)
Sitting on your bae face, I'm the babysitter (Uh)
If you knew the bitch was lame, why you fuckin' with her? (Uh)
I want that face like a book (Uh)
Get in your mouth like I cook (Uh)
Butt naked, serving him looks (Uh)
I got the girls and they shook (Uh)
I really go harder than hoes (Uh)
Harder than some of your bro's (Uh)
She wanna be me, I know it (Uh)
He let this pussy control him (Uh)
Ayy, ayy, yeah
Young Tina Snow goin' hard on a ho, ah
