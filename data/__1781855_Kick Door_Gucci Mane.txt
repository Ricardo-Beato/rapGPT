18 ContributorsKick Door Lyrics
Trapping next to the bando
My .40 cal holds an extendo
Watch these niggas cause they pretendo
Played a hoe like we play Nintendo
Only rock with nigga that my kin folk
These other niggas out here been slow
Real Zone 6 nigga know how to get dough
Have six young niggas doing kick doors
Trapping next to the bando
My .40 cal holds an extendo
Watch these niggas cause they pretendo
Played a hoe like we play Nintendo
Only rock with nigga that my kin folk
These other niggas out here been slow
Real Zone 6 nigga know how to get dough
Have six young niggas doing kick doors

We put lean in anything, Alka Seltzer, Dr. Pepper
20 rings you see me bling, it's Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyll
I'm on the scene but seldom seen, sixteen Mac-11's at Krispy Kreme
Clean codeine I'm drinking lean
Like daddy or uncle I got some lean
In a Enzo just popped a zesto now he on fours and slurring by the Esso
Got a big bank roll, nigga no pressure
Got a bad bitch, that I bought a Krompresser
Cocaina whipping the nina
Walking out the bando and jumping in the beamer
FN, no retreat or surrender
Niggas befriend you, niggas pretending
Hot as a candle I grew up on Candler
Having a scandal I think I've been slandered
Big Guwop from the east of Atlanta
Colombian dope like I'm Tony Montana
D boys sit in bando in Savannah
Smoking on Cuban cigars like Havannah
Riding four deep in a Panamera
You might also like
Trapping next to the bando
My .40 cal holds an extendo
Watch these niggas cause they pretendo
Played a hoe like we play Nintendo
Only rock with nigga that my kin folk
These other niggas out here been slow
Real Zone 6 nigga know how to get dough
Have six young niggas doing kick doors
Trapping next to the bando
My .40 cal holds an extendo
Watch these niggas cause they pretendo
Played a hoe like we play Nintendo
Only rock with nigga that my kin folk
These other niggas out here been slow
Real Zone 6 nigga know how to get dough
Have six young niggas doing kick doors

Have six young niggas do a kick door
All about my motherfuckin cash flow
Put hits on a nigga like I'm Castro
Smoking all the gas up in my castle
Me and my 2 young girls wrastle
No pressure, ain't no hassle
These the same niggas that fuck with foot draggers
Later at the bando
Bomb and a blammer
Watch em for the pigs
On the roof they got some scanners
I just made a million
These niggas change like they chameleon
All bout the bag baby I just want the millions
Ran that check up out that public housing building
Still whipping babies, so I guess I'm selling children
Brand new coupe, call it Tunechi no ceilings
750 Asanti's at the store hurt they feelings
Trapping next to the bando
My .40 cal holds an extendo
Watch these niggas cause they pretendo
Played a hoe like we play Nintendo
Only rock with nigga that my kin folk
These other niggas out here been slow
Real Zone 6 nigga know how to get dough
Have six young niggas doing kick doors
Trapping next to the bando
My .40 cal holds an extendo
Watch these niggas cause they pretendo
Played a hoe like we play Nintendo
Only rock with nigga that my kin folk
These other niggas out here been slow
Real Zone 6 nigga know how to get dough
Have six young niggas doing kick doorsEmbed
