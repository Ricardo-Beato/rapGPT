10 ContributorsBands Lyrics
Ain't nothin' good, ayy
DP on the beat

Ain't nothin' good but finger licking bands
Lick off my thumb then I begin
One count, two count, money counting
I left my money counter at home, I'm here to count it
Fuck that nigga, he ain't talkin' money
Call that nigga, he talkin' 'bout money
I be on that money shit
Nigga, you be on that funny shit

Ring ring, what's on my phone? It's money
Ding ding, who's at my home? It's the motherfucking police, fuck 'em, ayy
Riding in that foreign right now, ayy
Counting on these hundreds right now, ayy
I told that fuck nigga, pipe down
'Fore we up these pipes and you get piped down
Glo up, think I see the light now
Niggas snakes, I don't fuck with thy now, ayy
I'm a rich nigga right now
Finna go get some money right now, ayy

Ain't nothin' good but finger licking bands
Lick off my thumb then I begin
One count, two count, money counting
I left my money counter at home, I'm here to count it
Fuck that nigga, he ain't talkin' money
Call that nigga, he talkin' 'bout money
I be on that money shit
Nigga, you be on that funny shit

I'm runnin' through this money quick
How could I forget not havin' shit?
Now I just be buyin' shit
I'm a money-making nigga, you lil' son of bitch
Walk in the stores, I be tryin' shit
I try it then I buy the bitch
No, I don't buy a bitch
She suck me up for free, I can't deny the shit
Ayy, smokin' Tooka pack
Ruger on me, where your Ruger at?
Finger lickin' bands, finger lickin' bands up in my pants, nigga
I'm a walkin' lick, talkin' brick, talkin' shit
You lil' son of bitch get hit with this banana clip
I be poppin' shit, kickin' shit, droppin' shit
Pull up on your block, straight choppin' shit
Pull up on my block and I'm choppin' quick
Swervin', here the coppers is
They behind a nigga, tryna find a nigga (DP on the beat)
But I'm running, nigga, they can't grab a nigga1Embed
