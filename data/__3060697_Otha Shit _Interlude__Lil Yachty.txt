29 ContributorsOtha Shit (Interlude) Lyrics
Ayy, ooh, ayy (gang)
I'm on some other shit
Ooh, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm on some other shit (gang)
Ayy, ooh, ayy
I'm on some other shit
Ayy, ooh
I'm on some other shit
Ayy
Keep the lights on when I fuck the bitch
Ayy, ooh, ayy
Fuck on top of the covers shit
Ayy, I might have to fuck on my other bitch
I'm on some other shit
I'm on some other shit
Ayy, 330 plays, fuck that other shit (gang)
And that's not your money, that's ya brother's shit
And my brother locked up for the dirty stick
He on some other shit
That's on some other shit
I just bought a new watch for my other wrist
And I just bought a new purse for my buttered bitch
Flexin' so hard, I'm on some other shit (gang)
I'm on some other shit (Lil' Boat)
I'm on some other shitYou might also like1Embed
