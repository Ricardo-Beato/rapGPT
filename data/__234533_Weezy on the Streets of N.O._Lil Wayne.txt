Right now, man, the streets of New Orleans is real fucked up, man. But don't look at it like that, 'cause—I ain't gon' even gon' lie. It— It's so back— It's not back to normal, 'cause it'll never be, but, I mean— It— It's— It's back to a way that— that— that you probably didn't think it would be back to, so—you know what I mean? People are living, people are breathing. But—you know what I mean? That shit still was fucked up, and it's gon' always be fucked up. And people are still fucked up about it, and people are still fucked up over it. And people died, and that's what's real about it, so—you know what I mean? The streets is gon' always be fucked upYou might also likeEmbed
