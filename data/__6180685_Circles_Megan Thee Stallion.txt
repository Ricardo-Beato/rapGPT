Yeah
Hey
Real hot girl shit
Ah
(Fuck that nigga)
Hey, hey
Baow, baow

Look, why you wanna do the bad bitch wrong? (Huh?)
'Bout to make this every bad bitch song (Ayy)
Don't you hate when you hold a nigga down
Then he switch up on you, turn out to be a clown? (Ayy)
Look (Hey), I ain't in my feelings with it (In my feelings)
Turn around, poke it out, bitch, get it, get it (Get it, get it)
Turn up on 'em, make 'em kill the noise
We ain't goin' back and forth with the lil' boys

Shh, cut the noise
I ain't goin' back and forth with these lil' boys (Lil' boys)
I'm a February baby, I'm a big flirt (Big flirt)
I gotta give a nigga space when his feelings hurt (Hey, hey)
Ayy, look, cut the shit
I ain't goin' back and forth with a broke bitch (Broke bitch)
Jawbreaker, I ain't fuckin' with thе sucker shit (Yeah)
If I cut her off, thеn I mean it and it's fuck a bitch
The more I ignore you, the more you adore me (Yeah)
Crazy-ass niggas need to come with a warnin' (Come with a warnin')
Is he crazy 'bout me or he just crazy? You been trippin' lately (Yeah, yeah)
Nigga too attached, got him actin' like a titty baby (Yeah)
Bullet wounds, backstabs, mama died, still sad
At war with myself, in my head, bitch, it's Baghdad (Yeah)
New nigga tryna come around and play clean (Hmm)
And my clothes fit tight, but my heart need a seamstress (Ah)

One, never let a nigga see you sweat (Never)
Two, never let these niggas come between a check (Yeah)
Three, never let a nigga turn you 'gainst me (Hey)
'Cause the dick come and go, but I'm ridin' past E (Ayy)
Keep that shit player, I don't like gettin' personal
Treat 'em like a job, when I get 'em, I'm workin' 'em (Workin')
Niggas love usin' Instagram like a journal (Yeah)
Just like my ass, niggas talkin' in a circle (Baow-baow-baow)
Why niggas love to talk down? I don't know (I don't know)
Like I ain't keepin' all the facts in my phone
Like I ain't got the pictures of you beggin' for forgiveness (Yeah)
I ain't gotta do the most, I know what the real is (I know what the real is)
Ain't the jealous type, please don't believe the hype (Please)
You can't make me mad with some shit that I'ma like (That I'ma like)
Don't mean to be intrusive, but you thinkin' you exclusive
When a party ain't a party if my bitches ain't included (Ah, ah)
