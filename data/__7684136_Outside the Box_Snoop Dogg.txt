18 ContributorsOutside the Box Lyrics
Yeah, this is dedicated to the niggas that was down from day one
Welcome back

Every time I turn around, every time they hear my sound
They get me all up underground, still inside the box
Fuck what they say, just be, the Black folk like it, it's a hit
How can this true gangster shit be still outside the box?

We came from a place where our hearts are pure
People wanna know what we're marchin' for
Grouped up, scooped up all my pals
Flavor for days, so much style
They can't even put it in a box now (Wow)
Stepped out, gator smile, wait a while
"Excuse me, Snoopy, can we get a flick?"
I ain't really trippin', go on, take that shit

What? It's really gon' be 'bout gettin' love
And that's only 'cause I give love
I stand up for it, I manned up for it like a brother 'posed to
Went through, go through, goin' through, knowin' you
Showin' you, flowin' to and the mental to grow into
Let bygones be bygones
So you can be an icon like I've done
You might also like
Every time I turn around, every time they hear my sound
They get me all up underground, still inside the box
Fuck what they say, just be, the Black folk like it, it's a hit
How can this true gangster shit be still outside the box?

Own it like I want it, that's 24/7
Me and my dawgs on the highway to Heaven
Just put a Funko in 7-Eleven
It's a trifecta, me, Jasmine, and Kevin
Built a massive team that's passion themed
Do it for the love, on top there's the cream
I do it 'til I did that, get enough
Run it up, rake enough, make enough to give back

What? It's really gon' be 'bout gettin' love
And that's only 'cause I give love
I stand up for it, I manned up for it like a brother 'posed to
Went through, go through, goin' through, knowin' you
Showin' you, flowin' to and the mental to grow into
Let bygones be bygones
So you can be an icon like I've done

Every time I turn around, every time they hear my sound
They get me all up underground, still inside the box
Fuck what they say, just be, the Black folk like it, it's a hit
How can this true gangster shit be still outside the box?Embed
