12 ContributorsNo No No Lyrics
She know a nigga' street, vacation for a week
We sexing on the beach and I ain’t taking ‘bout the drink
Open doors for her when I take her out to eat
I’m rolling up a sweet while she massage a nigga’ feet
Lil’ shawty so fine, I got her sipping wine
I tell her I don’t cheat but she be knowing a nigga lyin’
Feds can’t stand me, they don’t understand me
While they hoe hopping, I got her shopping in Miami
Everything’s G, her friend's cuz bought a Jeep
Her bag a couple grand and they compliments from me
See, I can be the king and she can be my queen
And we can be a team and fulfill each other’s dreams
Love the way she talk, love the way she walk
I’m always on her mind and she always in my thoughts
I got her at the house, we blowin’ on an ounce
I’m cooking dinner for her tonight, we ain’t going out

I meet a lot of hoes, traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I be like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches, this is for my bad bitches
I meet a lot of hoes, traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I be like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches, this is for my bad bitches

No Wonderbra, she got monster jaw
Like a porn star, nice ass, nice job
A well-known star
So I’m bringing my entourage
Bust a gun and put it in the air
If you down with Gucci Gucci, turn yo’ boy on to La Flare
Girl so fine, just look at her and stare
Millions worth of ice on, no need to compare
Your jeweler is a loser, I think I might need a cooler
Or change that ring to ruler, for breakfast go to Sicily
Wake up, eat lunch in Italy
Buy you all types of iced out ornaments
The trap boys do that normally
I’m like "No no no"
"If you ain’t a bad bitch, you can go go go”

I meet a lot of hoes, traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I be like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches, this is for my bad bitches
I meet a lot of hoes, traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I be like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches, this is for my bad bitches
Started off as friends, but now we got a plan
I call her on her cellular, she’s calling me her man
Let's go to Japan, maybe even France
Spend a hundred grand overseas, we holding hands
Gucci, Louis, Prada, it doesn’t even matter
I spoil her like my daughter so she love me like her father
Cruising the Atlantic, isn’t it romantic?
Spaghetti strap dress, she ain’t wearing panties
Sex her on the couch, freak her on the sink
I think tomorrow I might go buy her a mink
Sex her on the couch, freak her on the sink
I think tomorrow I might go buy her a mink

I meet a lot of hoes, traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I be like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches, this is for my bad bitches
I meet a lot of hoes, traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I be like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches, this is for my bad bitches1Embed
