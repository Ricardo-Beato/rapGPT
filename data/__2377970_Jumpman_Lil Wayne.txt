T!
Where Hoody at?
No Ceilings

Woo, one xan, one xan, one xan, lord, I'm tryna cut back
Hold up, hold up, where my cup at? My bitch got that comeback
Woo, real one from the jump, man, I'm killing the Jumpman
I ain't got no ceilings, no need to look up, man (uh-uh)
AK, AK, AK, street-sweeper, no dustpan (bap-bap)
Been a stuntman since a young man, extra gun if one jam (bap-bap)
Stuntman since a young man, extra gun if one jam
On my Carter 5 shit, this one for the thumb, man
Yeah, this one for the duff-bag
Yeah, this for where I'm from at
Yeah, my goons break in your house like BruhMan
Yeah; click-clack
Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam
Shh... silence on the gun, I go Silence of the Lamb
Ooh I'm up man, up man, them Viagras got me up, man
And we pull up, man up and dump and dump and dump then scrrram
Screech! The harder I fall, the farther I reach
The water might fall, but life is a beach
When my number’s called, I get out my seat
When my niggas ball, I give em my speech
You might hit a wall, or end up like me
You might have to crawl, but get up like me
And you bite before bark, never I before we
And you pray before eating and you lay with your heat
And you stay with your heat and you lay on your mink
Bitches lay at your feet and you play with your kids
You don’t play with these niggas, don’t play on these streets
I don’t play on these beats, I don’t play bout my money
You heard what I say, no replay, no repeat
Don’t be playing with me, don’t be playing with we
I don’t play with no Wii, I’m OK, I’m OG
I’m O.J. on these beats, I OD on these beats
I'm M-O-B-B-B-B on these streets
Say what you say, you don’t be on these streets
Cause if we see you, it’s on S-I-G-H-T
Belie'e that, Tunechi

One xan, one xan, one xan, all I need is one xan
Knock me out like punch bag, got me slump like humpback (gone)
Muddy-muddy-muddy, I just drunk a mud bath
Muddy-muddy-muddy, I need me some mud flaps (sippin)
Real one from the jump, man, real one from the jump, man (real one)
On my Carter 5 shit, this one for the thumb, man (ayy)
Money long, I got that money tall like Kazam (Shaq)
I just popped a combo, ain’t talkin' McDonald’s (medicine)
I just popped a bottle, ain’t talkin' no liquor (medicine)
I’m talking Actavis, I’m talking to the sippers (pour up)
I’m talkin to a stripper, she gon let me pimp her
You talkin to the police, so that’s who you tippin'?
Ohhh, that’s a no-no, that’s a no-no, ohhh
Had coke since Polo and Girbauds (yeah!)
Had coke since Arsenio
White girl, Marilyn Monroes, Demi Moore
I’m in LA with my skinny hoes
But their faces look like centerfolds
I've been taking all these chemicals, damn
Now they faces aren’t identical, damn
Watch these niggas turning into hoes, bop-bop
Watch me turn a nigga into smoke, bop-bop
Watch me turn a million into four, voilà
Watch me turn Miami to N.O., uh-huh
Watch me turn the sand to some snow, uh-huh
In a Phantom with Chinchilla floors, drop-top
Hit Atlanta like Gorilla Zoe
Holla at my baby mamas, I love them the most
Shout out Lauren on the West, she playin' her role (Boogie!)
Literally, on the set, she playin' a role (Boogie!)
Niggas really rep the set, we stay in our mode (turned up)
Spiritually I’m just blessed, I pray for my hoes (amen)
Tunechi hoppin off the jet, G open my door (thank you)
Spittin since Das EFX, my flow in control (skibbidy)
Pimpin since Das EFX, my ho in control (pimpin)
And I just popped a combo, ain’t talkin McDonald’s
Niggas hear that click-clack, ooh-ooh
I know I'mma get my shit back, ooh-ooh
We aiming this thing at your body
We aiming this thing at your nose
Hollow tip bullets, blue tip bullets
Well, you’re gonna get shot with them both21Embed
