12 ContributorsNew Gun Lyrics
Niggas ain't gon' do nothin'
Screamin they gon' do somethin'
Gucci Mane do somethin', I'm gon' make your crew run
I still got my old gun, I just bought a new one
I just want to use it, I'll show you how to use one
Niggas ain't gon' do nothin'
Screamin they gon' do somethin'
Gucci Mane do somethin', I'm gon' make your crew run
I still got my old gun, I just bought a new one
I just want to use it, I'll show you how to use one

Just bought 3 new choppas but I still love my old one
Got a bust down day date and a solid gold one
Beat em like ya stole something, since 16 I been road runnin'
Pull up at yo spot, 6 deep ran in and let the motor run
Lets grow a hunnid pack and wrap em one by one just like a mummy
I love my bitch but I don't love nothing the way I love my money
Ten thousand rounds of ammo at the spot, man I wish they would
The freaks come out at night and the killas in my neck of the woods
Let my boy murk em and give em a apartment in baton rouge
We could play it however you want to play it, niggas ain't nothing to it
Niggas ain't gon' do nothing, discriminate gon' do somethin'
I got all my jewelry on, nigga that bout 2 somethin'

Niggas ain't gon' do nothin'
Screamin' they gon' do somethin'
Gucci Mane do somethin', I'm gon' make your crew run
I still got my old gun, I just bought a new one
I just want to use it, I'll show ya how to use one
Niggas ain't gon' do nothin'
Screamin' they gon' do somethin'
Gucci Mane do somethin', I'm gon' make your crew run
I still got my old gun, I just bought a new one
I just want to use it, I'll show ya how to use one

I just wanna use it, I'll show ya how to use one
I still got my old gun, but I love my new gun
Niggas ain't gon' do nothin', states right he gon' turn up
Then nigga whats the hold up, .45 slow up
Niggas wanna act tough but niggas better not act up
They gon' need some back up, paramedics and firetrucks
All for just acting tough, he stressed out, help him up
And if my brother down and I got it I'ma help him up
I know niggas ain't gon' do nothin'
Niggas ain't gon' shoot nothin'
You the same nigga that got robbed, and that nigga ain't do nothin'
Same nigga with no heart, that nigga won't shoot nothin'
Same nigga he so fraud, that nigga ain't shoot nothin'
Niggas ain't gon' do nothin'
Screamin' they gon' do somethin'
Gucci Mane do somethin', I'm gon' make your crew run
I still got my old gun, I just bought a new one
I just want to use it, I'll show ya how to use one
Niggas ain't gon' do nothin'
Screamin' they gon' do somethin'
Gucci Mane do somethin', I'm gon' make your crew run
I still got my old gun, I just bought a new one
I just want to use it, I'll show ya how to use one2Embed
