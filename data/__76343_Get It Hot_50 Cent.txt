I get down, I get down, I get down (yeah, yeah)
I get down, I get down (I like the way that sounds)
I get down, I get down, I get down (yeah, yeah)
I get down, I get down

Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it hot

Oh, I think she like me, hell yeah, she like me
My watch game crazy, Audemar's so icy
She like it when I stunt, me I'm what she want
I'm in that rich nigga fraternity, we only talk bread
Got money out the asshole, the money on my head
Don't mean nothing, I said don't mean nothing
The Ros√© in the Rover, I'm drinking and I'm driving
That nigga try and get at me I'm pulling out and firing
To see if I'm stunting, the piece it ain't nothing
Royal fees ain't nothing, I just blow a little something
Now shorty got a thing for me, she feel like I'm the shit
My guess is I'm the kind of nigga she wanna be with

Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

Get it, get it, get it hot
She want me, yeah yeah, she want me
She want me, why you think she on me?
Get it, get it, get it

I'm a substitute teacher, welcome to Sex Ed
She'll be an A student time she get out my bed
I'm flashy, I'm rolling with the stones
Get at me, I'm moving with the chrome
A made man, a Don Corleone
No matter where I'm at I'm doing what the fuck I want
I'm shining, my wrists all canary
Now try me, I keep a shooter near me
I'm grinding like I ain't made my first mil'
Like I ain't signed a first deal, like I ain't at the first meal
I'm hungry, I really want it all
Now watch me, I'll show you how to ball
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it hot
She want me, yeah yeah, she want me
She want me, why you think she on me?
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it hot
She want me, yeah yeah, she want me
She want me, why you think she on me?
Get it, get it, get it

Life in the fast lane, fast car, fast cash
Freak bitch, fast ass
I'm where the money at, mane, fast on the draw
Fast running from the law
She like the bad boys, the bad boys, the bad boys
She like the bad boys, the bad boys, the bad boys

Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it hot
She want me, yeah yeah, she want me
She want me, why you think she on me?
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it hot
She want me, yeah yeah, she want me
She want me, why you think she on me?
Get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it1Embed
