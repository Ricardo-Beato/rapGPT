7 ContributorsObsessed Lyrics
I've been obsessed with your face
Thinking 'bout you and a dress and a date
Let me get some cash with this check at the bank
And we can make the best of the rest of the day
I like it when it's sunny outside and I pull up at your crib 'round twenty past five
And I'm staring at your walk when you coming outside
Ain't seen you in a minute, girl, it's fucking 'bout time that we get it
Tank top with the skin showin'
Light brown with the skin tone
Dime piece with the white teeth
She got her hair down like the windows
And you know that you're beautiful
The type of girl that got me really hoping I'm suitable
You been doing you and I don't really know what to do with you in the moment
So I'm driving a little slower than usual
I can tell you not a fuckin' dummy
When I'm with you I might try a little harder to be funny
For the time being I'll assume you honestly just want me
But these women gon' change when you got a bunch of money
So, I savor these moments
I'll take your ass shopping and pay for the clothing
Honestly what you do is magical to me
And really I just want a taste of the potion

Everything from your smile to your hair and your eyes
From your step to your dress and I'm set
Everything from your smile to your hair and your eyes
From your step to your dress and I'm set

I've been obsessed with ya sex
Move so good, you should move to success
I can see you stripping naked, make the money stretch
Said she do it in the motel for the kid
Take you to a city, to a place you never been
God damn, dressing like 
You next to me looking like Yoko
Fuck TV, you workin' with an Apple
Let me control that fatty like Roku
We can bounce to the mall with your homegirls
Or we can bounce in the mall like pogo
Keep our vibes on the low like no-shows
In 2000 you probably wore Manolos
I can tell 'cause you living up in Soho
But you ghetto 'cause your ass like 
Kardashian, no promo
We never watching, we be busy with our photos
Front cam with the fam, all gang signs in it
You laugh cause' you glad 'cause the gangs all in it
Never feel safer, guns on the table
My brother gon' keep us, the Canon is aimin'
Right back to the room, nip slip, badaboom
Light that Marley, sniff that Heidy Klum
Invite only, sip that billion
Everything from your smile to your hair and your eyes
From your step to your dress and I'm set
Everything from your smile to your hair and your eyes
From your step to your dress and I'm set1Embed
