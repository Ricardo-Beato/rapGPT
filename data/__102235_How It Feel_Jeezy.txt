11 ContributorsHow It Feel Lyrics
Lody, Turn Up Nigga
Oh you know what's gone happen when this shit drop in the club
You see the look on niggas faces right now nigga

They got me fucked up yeah that's on the real
That's why I stay hustling like a treadmill
Rap niggas move real niggas lean
How the fuck you think I weigh ya girl then
Dropped the whole thang on the crib nigga
I'm turnt up look at how I live nigga
Trappin' ain't a hobby it's a skill nigga
Bad bitches on me what it is nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga (x4)

Woke up this morning up the 26th floor
Parlez vous francais to my French ho
Got that yoppa by the bed nigga french toast
Black Phantom out front nigga space ghost
Word on the street you looking for 4 and a heezy
Just pull up in the projects and ask em' for Jeezy
Hatin' ass niggas them the ones I hate the most
Feds tried to get him but they never came close
Got the heads up nigga I never came home
Straight to boost mobile yeah you know I change phones
Ever seen him do his thing, he amazing
Young a beast in the kitchen they need to cage him
You might also like
Dropped the whole thang on the crib nigga
I'm turnt up look at how I live nigga
Trappin' ain't a hobby it's a skill nigga
Bad bitches on me what it is nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga (x4)

Two lambs the same color I just call em' twins
Back at home I'm gone buy that boy a Benz
Got the water in the yola now I'm in the mist
Gon do what it do and them some dirty bricks
It's a dirty world, but my car clean
Pull up in them matching Chargers, we the car team
Now it's shrimp and lobster, like we in the mall
Last suit I had, gave that boy a job
30 niggas with me looking like they finna' rob
Don't make me grab that black steel, my black card
And it's mine too nigga, it got my name on it
Knowing that niggas probably got some cain on em
What that hood nigga doing with them white folks
Tell block blow they think I'm telling white jokes
They was pocket watching on the front porch bitch
And you know they watching know I made the Forbes list

Dropped the whole thang on the crib nigga
I'm turnt up look at how I live nigga
Trappin' ain't a hobby it's a skill nigga
Bad bitches on me what it is nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga (x4)
Verse 3: Jeezy
Real nigga made it out, how you feel nigga
Knowing damn well these niggas want you killed nigga
See the hating niggas, they just want to see you dead
And all the bad bitches they just want to give you head
Keep ya head bitch, cause right now I'm chasing bread
Cuzzo did a dime for same thing since I was chasing fed
I done took this trapping shit all across the globe
Same nigga shopped at South Dekalb on Candler Road
Mad cause you still free to act in Niketown
Pot called the kettle black, now ain't these niggas cold
And I'm still here so what the deal nigga
Five albums in and I'm still a real nigga

Dropped the whole thang on the crib nigga
I'm turnt up look at how I live nigga
Trappin' ain't a hobby it's a skill nigga
Bad bitches on me what it is nigga
How it feel to be a real nigga (x4)

Aye Snow, What they gone do wit us
Huh, Turn Up! (x2)3Embed
