17 ContributorsDon’t Know Me Lyrics
Thank you, Ralph (Thank you, Ralph)

I just started rappin'
Niggas acting like we cool
You a fool, think I fuck with you
Just 'cause we went to school
Pockets blue, and I'm rocking trues
I could never lose
Rock with blue and them reds too
I don't fuck with you

Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't even crack a smile
Don't come around me saying
You ain't seen me in a while
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't DM on the 'Gram
I am not your bro, I'm not your moe, I'm not ya fam
Pussy nigga, you don't know me

Let me say it loud
Only time I wanna see you's when I see you in the crowd
Tell that bitch, "Look at me now", it ain't no Chris Brown
But I'm fuckin' poppin' and I fuckin' put it down
What other nigga got my sound? Point me to his ass
I'm sick of y'all ass calling mid niggas gas
They comin' in last, yeah, in school, they didn't pass
Thinking they was cool, 'cause they never went to class
Old peon-lame-ass, nigga, get your check up
Treat you like a ho, you better go get your respec' up
I am on the road doin' shows, see me next up
My neck to my toe, I am froze, need a check-up
I think I'm the shit, I'm rich, I'm at the Ritz
I'ma take your bitch if you don't get up off of my dick
You might also like
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't even crack a smile
Don't come around me saying
You ain't seen me in a while
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't DM on the 'Gram
I am not your bro, I'm not your moe, I'm not ya fam
Pussy nigga, you don't know me

"My weekend like ya weekday"
I'ma play my mixtape for Drake, see what he say
I am on my way, like a nigga on the freeway
I'ma need my money now, I don't do no free pay
I don't hear no "He say," I don't care what bums say
I'm tryna be up there with them Jiggas and Beyoncés
My hitters pull triggers, go gorilla on a dummy
I'm your father-figure, little nigga, you my sonny
All I do is win, might commit some sins
Patience runnin' thin, finna bust a nigga chin
I don't understand how these niggas make amends
With niggas that done switched up on them, said they was they friends
All they do is follow trends, tryin' to fit in
That AK give you headache, you can't use no Aspirin
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't even crack a smile
Don't come around me saying
You ain't seen me in a while
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't DM on the 'Gram
I am not your bro, I'm not your moe, I'm not ya fam
Pussy nigga, you don't know meEmbed
