K-k-k-kato on the track bitch

I go so hard, and that's OK
She's so dope, and what's your name?
I need that, and that's on me
I'm that nigga, and that won't change
Talk your shit, but don't be shy
Fix your lips, you know you fly
Sip that lean, it's only right
Smoke that weed, we both get high
Feels so good, where's your man?
Where's your car, and where's your friends?
Where they went, where you from
I ain't never seen you around here befo'
Damn you so

Marilyn Monroe

Got a nigga feelin' like Kanye now, I'm Kanye now, I can't let go
(rightneeditneeditright)
Need it right now wanna hit it right now wanna feel you all on me
And I know you wanna see me right now wanna see me right now yeah I know you get lonely
Yeah I bet you wanna turn the lights down wanna do it right now on the late-night creep on the low
Wake up in the morning and you know
You might also like
She don't need me no mo'
She dont need me no mo
She dont need me no mo'
I done hit it like 50 11 times
She dont need me no mo'
Said she dont need me no mo'
She dont need me no mo'
She get hers and I get mine
She dont need me no mo'

Let's keep it real, cause I'm not cold
Young fly nigga, but I got hoes
I got swag, and that's OK
Call me Joyner, and that won't change
Talk your shit, but don't be rude
Fix your lips, you know its true
(You want me, I know you do
Yeah shawty I know you do, I know you do)
Just be you
You dont like niggas? Shit me too
Stacks on deck, racks on racks, shawty getting money, I like that
Ass so fat

She dont need me no mo'

She told me lose my number now
(she don't need me no mo')
She always gives me that run around
(she don't need me no mo' x3)
I use to beat it down in my mama's house
(she don't need me no mo')
(muffled mix of Pre-Hook & chorus in background)

She don't need me no mo'
She dont need me no mo
She dont need me no mo'
I done hit it like 50 11 times
She dont need me no mo'
Said she dont need me no mo'
She dont need me no mo'
She get hers and I get mine
She dont need me no mo'1Embed
