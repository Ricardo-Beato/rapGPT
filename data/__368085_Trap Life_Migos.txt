Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out
Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out

Man I'm tired of selling bricks
Gotta know how I'm tired of hittin' licks
Can't wait 'til I sign that deal
The trap life, I'll give it up quick
Listen up, nigga speaking real shit
Cause it ain't all what it seems
You can have it all at one time, then end up losing everything
And I put that shit on my mom
Imma make it out of the slums
Imma get her in a mansion, in a penthouse, living lavish
We at the top floor of the condo
We ain't never got to worry about the popo
We eating on shrimp and gumbo
We smoking on blunts, they jumbo
I got J's at the front door
I serve them up with that combo
Got birds flying like Dumbo, but I keep a 9 like Rondo
I locked the game, I got the code
Cash coming fast that pronto
Making plays, Tony Romo
Two bad bitches, they homo
You might also like
Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out
Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out

Trap game risky but its so easy to flip them fishes
Popeyes, the ones who make the chicken with them biscuits
Fuck an iPhone, trapping off a Tracfone
Give the Feds , they can't even track the phone
Ride through the city in a coupe 
Overseas with Muhammad 
Got a date with the money and the kush is my cologne
Sippin' on lean out two Styrofoam
I finesse a nigga for that cash in the red zone
You ain't never ever live the trap life nigga
You don't know nothing bout the rap life nigga
Hell nah I don't want to swap it out with you
Cause you don't even know what you taking bout nigga
I don't know you but I know you're not my crew
But a nigga never ever got gwap with you nigga
You ain't got cash, you ain't never ever sold drugs
You ain't never chop it up with the plug
You ain't never roll down 85 with a hundred birds in a Lamborghini truck
When I'm filthy rich thats when I'll give this trap shit up
Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out
Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out1Embed
