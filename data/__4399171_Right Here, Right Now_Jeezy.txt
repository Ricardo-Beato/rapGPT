5 ContributorsRight Here, Right Now Lyrics
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Man I'm getting bucked right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Man I'm getting bucked right here right now

 right here right now
I can't even see clear right now
I'm counting too much here right now
 right here right now
But I hear  right now
Talking jokes right here right now
You can get stomped right here right now
Say that shit right here right now
 right here right now
 right here right now
And I bust right here right now
 right here right now
And your bitch in my ear right now
 right now
Eh trick listen here right now
Quit asking me for shit right here right now
You might also like
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Man I'm getting bucked right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Man I'm getting bucked right here right now

I'm off the chain right now
They hating  right now
It's all in the game right now
They cop them things 
 in the dirty south  right here right now
 cause you know we gotta ball out
 right now

 lights out


I don't think they understand

Run the streets with juugs
Niggas found the juugs
In the streets with thugs
Niggas claming Crips and Bloods
Right here you know 
 spill your blood
Take rings off, take chains off
Take Glocks off, knock brains off
Hit the block, make the Glock rain off
I don't give a fuck, the bricks in the truck
 blow the smoke
You can get stomped right here right now
Bitch you know right now
 thiat shit  that shit, come on the spot and rob your shit
Run in your house and rob that bitch
Niggas tryna survive with this
From the north to the east to the west 
We got this shit

 haters can kiss my ass
Right here right now we off the chain
Right here rright now you can cop the shit
 get you a brick
Right here right now we outta control
 triple beams or the keys
Chevy dawg, a hundered spokes
This ain't regular 
Hustler baby, bout them dollars
Do it myself 
Got a VVS on me
Run them G's, chickenhead
Right here right now 

Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Man I'm getting bucked right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Get 'em up right here right now
Man I'm getting bucked right here right nowEmbed
