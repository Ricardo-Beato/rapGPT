If your eyes are the window to your soul
Open eyes bring the cold
If your dreams keep you warm in night
Baby just keep 'em closed
If your eyes are the window
I can sneak in at night
In your eyes I can see your soul
Staring back into mine

She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men, we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she sparkles
You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose
I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close, there grows a new one
I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok, sometimes from commitment, we do run
Rocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian
I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision
But not to be married with kids she was wishing
Shhh, 'til your soul just listen
You might also like
If your eyes are the window to your soul
Open eyes bring the cold
If your dreams keep you warm in night
Baby just keep 'em closed
If your eyes are the window
I can sneak in at night
In your eyes I can see your soul
Staring back into mine

She said daddy take me ice-skating
Looking at the rear-view, life's waiting for her
Gotta be there to support her
Can't really wait for a court order
She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant
A lot of love inside, got to help guide it
Daddy will protect it, God will provide it
We all will be there so your soul ain't divided
Man, how quick she grows
Looking like her momma but she got my toes
I suppose it's the age that she really really need me
A lot of girls without, they become needy
"Come on, Dad, I'm too old for the back seat
Can you come and get me, are you coming to my track meet?"
As she begins the race of life and love I told her
"I can't run it for ya, but God know's I'ma coach ya"
