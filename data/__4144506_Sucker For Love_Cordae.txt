5 ContributorsSucker For Love Lyrics
When I first met her in seventh period
Body was something serious
Told her that I was curious
Could I get your number, digits and address
And maybe later I could get inside your mattress
Forgive me but that's just suck on my mental
Plus you is who I'm really into
Touching bodies so gentile
But you don't know what I've been through
More than just meets the eye
But I'm trying to look deep inside
Plus I wanted to be that guy
So I'll never just cheat or lie
Cuz you special to me
She remind me of rose petals, and the meadow in spring
But she attracted to the devil in me
She said, "Her life was bad for me"
Thinking irrationally
On her back, she ride so attractively
I love growing so rapidly
Then we start sharing our thoughts and getting personal
She starts to talk about the other guys that hurt her soul
She said that your no different
You learn it then you live it
She start touching my pendant
Then we start touching and kissing
You might also like
Why don't you love me?
Why do you hate me?
Cuz you that soul that's on mind, I'm going crazy
Why I am I such a sucker for love
Damn, I'm such a sucker for love
Why don't you love me?
Why do you hate me?
Cuz you that soul that's on mind, I'm going crazy
Why I am I such a sucker for love
Damn, I'm such a sucker for love

And I can see all the hurt and pain that is in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy, tryna get in her thighs
Sometimes she say she mess with other girls to improvise
Saying that niggas ain't shit and just start to minimize
Couple months later, finally go to her house
She starts the kissing on my neck, and so I open her blouse
I ask her, "Can I penetrate?"
She said she never been afraid
Going through this renegade
As our thoughts just interchange

Why don't you love me?
Why do you hate me?
Cuz you that soul that's on mind, I'm going crazy
Why I am I such a sucker for love
Damn, I'm such a sucker for love
Why don't you love me?
Why do you hate me?
Cuz you that soul that's on mind, I'm going crazy
Why I am I such a sucker for love
Damn, I'm such a sucker for love1Embed
