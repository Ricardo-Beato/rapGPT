15 ContributorsTomorrow Lyrics
(â€‹ItssMoneyy, bitch, you dun know)
Tomorrow, stu' tomorrow (Same thing)
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow, I'ma hit the stu', tomorrow, I won't say a thing
'Cause there's too many niggas waitin' on tomorrow to tell on me

Tomorrow, I'ma hit the stu', tomorrow, I won't say a thing
'Cause there's too many niggas waitin' on tomorrow to tell on me
Tomorrow, I'ma fuck your bitch, tomorrow, I'ma buy a chain
Depends on if you live, you can do a lot of things
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Niggas got any problems, we will solve 'em
I bought some guns today to shoot tomorrow
Life is all about who tomorrow, tomorrow

I got a bitch named Tamara
Baby, I'ma get some kicks made tomorrow
Niggas be like, "I ain't bitch-made," yesterday
To show you that they bitch-made tomorrow
I can turn a model to a thot
And I can turn a thot into a model
I can have niggas runnin' down your block
I ain't say today, they'll wait until tomorrow
I got a clip full of hollows
And it's long, I be shootin' 'til tomorrow
Today is not yours, it's tomorrow's
'Cause I might fuck your bitch tomorrow
You might also like
Tomorrow, I'ma hit the stu', tomorrow, I won't say a thing
'Cause there's too many niggas waitin' on tomorrow to tell on me
Tomorrow, I'ma fuck your bitch, tomorrow, I'ma buy a chain
Depends on if you live, you can do a lot of things
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Niggas got any problems, we will solve 'em
I bought some guns today to shoot tomorrow
Life is all about who tomorrow, tomorrow2Embed
