2 ContributorsLast Night Episode Lyrics* phone is dialed, rings, and is picked up *

Aiyyo what happened last night, did you forget?
You said that you was pushin through my way with some Moet
Nahhh, see I was witcha man Devon from Calloway
He came over with Bell and Fay and a bottle of Alize
The honies wanted to watch me in _Posse_
But the picture was sloppy
Oh that bootleg copy?
Yeah
We tried to beep you before we went to the motel
Word?  Damn, my battery was on low cell -- oh well
We took em to this down low spot
Man skip the part about the journey; did you hit the skins or not?
Oh no question -- when have you ever seen my game go nervous?
Was y'all trickin?
Nahhhh, not less you're countin room service, huh
Besides player, what's a couple of bucks?
Was it lobster?
Fuck no, cheeseburger deluxe
