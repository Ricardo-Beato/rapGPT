24 ContributorsDrawn Lyrics
Shadow you're drawn, why don't you go?
In the corner babe watching the snow
Moving afar, rolling away
You weren't the one believe, now won't you stay?
Won't you stay, babe?
Won't you stay, babe?

Oh, I never know what come around
I never looked ahead
I'm wreckin' rules and it's pulling us down
The words I wished I'd said
Shadow you're drawn and you got your ways
Shadow you're painted red, red

Moving afar, moving away
You weren't the one believe, now won't you stay?
Won't you stay, babe?
Won't you stay, babe?

It's drawn
It's drawn
It's drawn (Three little thoughts come swirling out)
It's drawn (Time to move on, to move on, to time)
It's drawn (Three little thoughts come swirling out)
It's drawn (Time to move on, to move on, to time)
It's drawn (Three little thoughts come swirling out)
It's drawn (Time to move on, to move on, to time)
It's drawn (Three little thoughts come swirling out)
It's drawn (Time to move on, to move on, to time)
It's drawn (Three little thoughts come swirling out)
(Time to move on, to move on, to time)

Yo, I’m what the paper plate couldn’t hold
Too many dreams, a paperweight took a toll
Food on the floor, not to be wasted
Or doing what’s being pasted and know that it’s not a copy
Eye on the prize, instead of gas prices
Lyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest
Born of a generation that don't generate patience
And travel too fast for you to clock me
Not always a good thing
You can lose the love of your life through a lifetime of love on tour
I didn't mean to be a whore but my hormones
Had me like a fiend screamin' "What you got for me?"
Two words (I'm mortal)
But the fans slid 'em both together and removed the apostrophe
"Hip hop lords"? Maybe, but my ways needs laundering
Time's a-ticking, stop squandering!5Embed
