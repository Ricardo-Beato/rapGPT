50 ContributorsNaked Lyrics
I just wanna spread my wings
Life ain't what it seems
So hard in this cruel world
Escaping through the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world (Uh)

Tears dripping on my pillow, thoughts is in my head
See my dreams jump out my window, if I follow I'll be dead
And I been waiting all week to talk this shit but instead
Gon' have to burn this roof down for these niggas to understand
And what we fucking for? For the lights in the night
The way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight
Damn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols
I survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner
You can't blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga
I mean like every time a nigga blink I'm throwing on the mink
And she don't want to dance unless she drink
Will this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?
Bookmarked a lot haters, I added more links
Rolling with the same niggas who was rolling with niggas that was on E
Wonder why I seened the stars in the afternoon
Floating at night when you can catch me right under the moonYou might also like17Embed
