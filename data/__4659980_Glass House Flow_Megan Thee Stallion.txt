6 ContributorsGlass House Flow Lyrics
Aw! Getcha money, man
Ain't shit out here for free my nig-
Better go out and get it, come back with it
Straight like that

Butt naked in the house blowing O's with my nigga
Sippin' on the Henn, getting throwed with my nigga
Wearing all this ice getting cold with my nigga
I've been hustling all day, puttin' on for my nigga
So, don't you wanna come and fuck with a real bitch?
You could be my nigga, we could kick it on some chill shit
Drop them other hoes, I bet they switch up on you real quick
Dip up on you real quick, if the money don't flip
All you gotta do is put it on me when I ask you to
And better not tell me no unless you ready for my attitude
I hop up on big daddy, then I start doing gymnastics
Turn around and slow it down, and tell him he can have this
Neck like a yo-yo
Catch a bitch talking to my nigga, I go loco
His ex bitch mad 'cause I look good in every photo
If the bitch get the trip and bring it straight to her front door
Wipe her up like Fabuloso
Bitch you out here playing
See come get up on this money team
You broke 'cause you acting great
You out here sucking dick for free
You can't be in your feelings when you out here getting this money
Everybody treat you different when your pockets looking funny
So, don't you wanna risk that ass in this glass house
Bitches throwing stones, they ain't knowin' what this cash 'bout
I ain't ever slippin', I ain't ever broke, I ain't assed out
If I ever need it, I run straight to my stash house
I pull up wit' yo daddy, looking like a baddie
Bad bitches in the backseat, rolling fatties
I pull up wit' yo Pusha and I push up with my foot up
Everybody fucking with me 'cause they know I got the hookahYou might also likeEmbed
