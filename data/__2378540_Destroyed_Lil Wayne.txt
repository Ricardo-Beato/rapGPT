44 ContributorsDestroyed Lyrics
I think I’m seeing things
When I don’t see a thing
I woke up and realized
All the nightmares that dreaming brings
Let my people go
I know y’all hear 'em screaming things
Now load up choppers
Point it at the coppers
Let-let freedom ring
I like the sweeter things
So what bitch, no needle strings
I wake up, stretch my feet and wings
My life has no deleted scenes
I pop-pop-pop and leave the scene
Leave the scene Noxzema clean
Sippin on that lean cuisine
Incredible Hulk on creatine
My nigga
Fuck the world
And may I mention, fuck the world again
But I wanna go around the world
Tune, you down to go around the world again?
I am
And you can trust in a nigga like fam
I’m hitting these licks with my niggas like stamps
Giving these hoes headaches like rams
Yes ma’am
And I
I just might call your girl a friend
But fuck her like she my girlfriend
Talk to her like she my girl
Like, oops you look like my girl’s twin
I sin, I'm bad, I meant "My bad"
I’m lost in future, present, past
All those drinks I had
I speed, I'm fast, I blink, I crash
They say it’s my time
I’m racing time, I think I’m last
And if Tune mentions lean again
Then I might drink his stash
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks
New school, but all I listen to is older raps
Bitch I still
I still been drinking on the low
I never think because I know
And pimpin haven't died and money getting old
And now the wrinkles starting to show
My rims twinkle like a toe
I’m tippy toeing wit' your ho
One thing led to another, and then the pencil broke
I got that; handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Police in disguises, I don’t like surprises
I don’t like tomatoes, I don’t like tamales
Shoutout to my plugs, I pray the rats don’t chew the wires
Straight ballin, you niggas just bald spots
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out
And you pussy niggas get hauled off
No cough drops
I’m tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop
I’m off topic
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill
I’m no role model
I’m rollin' with models, rollin' off pills
I’m rollin' over
Whoever's not rollin' with us, then road kill
Tryna get Uncle Phil cake
In case I die tryin' I wrote Wills
I’m chillin', for the moment
'Til I can’t figure out the code
To get the motherfucking safe open
Who the fuck left the cage open
Stage of rage
I’m liable to blow your fucking face open
Every bone you could break, broken
If I go broke, every home I could break in, broke in
Pussy look like a steak smokin'
Niggas slippin' like the lake frozen
And I hate rodents
And I stay chokin'
Off the straight potent
'Til it make no sense
Niggas talking shit
Nigga I can get you wacked
Nigga you can picture that
'Til you break your lens
Nigga take your ends
Nigga fuck your ho
While you cutting your grass
Nigga cut your throat
Taking out your trash
Pull up on you slow
Going nowhere fast
When you got nowhere to go
Nigga hung 'em by a rope
Dump 'em by the boats
Fuck 'em, adios
Fuck 'em, I don't care
Got a bad bitch naked
And she just asked
“What you gonna do to me that I ain't done to myself?”
I say “Ooh talk dirty, but don’t talk long"
You leave Wayne’s world it’s a long walk home
My pockets on that growth hormone
I call them shots, can I get a dialtone
Yeah
Mula, can I get a million
'Til the heads or tails
'Til I get a full coin
Full fledge, full house
When your friend gon' join?
Got a friend in the cut with a gun by the groin
And what are friends for
I’m still the boss, don’t get sent for
Roger that, 10-4
Nigga send me, point 'em out
Where he at, I got 'em
We don't wanna see you back in court
The weed so loud bitches get ignored
Cause I ain't got time to go back and forth
I told that bitch don't question me
Bitch, if you do you asking for it
I’m spaced out like asteroids
Feeling like A-rod after ‘roids
I'm from Prov city
And I’m from New Orleans
