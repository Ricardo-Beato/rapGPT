10 ContributorsThank God Lyrics
I do gangsta rap
They wanna blame the world problems on gangsta rap
It's our fault 'cause motherfuckers is dying in Iraq
It's our fault 'cause motherfuckers is starving in Africa
It's gangsta rap fault that people are poor, can't get enough to fucking eat or live their life
That's rap music fault
It's rap music fault that we got all these goddamn laws and restrictions and shit we can't do
They blame it all on us
I'm blamin' them motherfuckers for gangsta rap
Because if they didn't create these kind of conditions, I wouldn't have shit to rap about. You know what I mean?
A'right, a'right, everybody back up, star status comin' through
The man is in the building
Don't touch him, don't look at him, and don't ask to take a picture
{Verse 1}
I walks in, with that California swagger
With the attitude that it ain't nothin' badder
Now, you can call me rapper, or you can call me mister
Big money trapper, fuckin' with your sister
I'mma do it my way, from here to Zimbabwe
It's too hot today
Fuck what you got to say
Fuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery
Ain't gon' take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery
Ah, he's a show off, a hot head go off (Yeah)
Don't make him mad, he might tear the fucking door off
Take all his calls, and don't try to blow off
'Cause one of his people, might cut your fucking toe off
Ice Cube, baby, make you take him serious
Everything I say, ends with a period
Everything I do, ends with you curious
Stop lookin' for the best rapper—goddamn, here he is
You might also like{Chorus}
(Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
(Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back

And we ain't gotta put up with this brainless rap

Comin' live from Los Angeles
I know you hate to see me comin'
(I know, I know)
I know you sayin' a little something
(I know, I know)
I know your mouth is still runnin'
(I know, I know)
All smiles when I come in
{Verse 2}
When I step up in the spot, "Is he a thug or not?"
"Is he a juggernaut?" No, I'm an astronaut
Nose all in the clouds, y'all think I'm too proud
Got to stay above the crowd—How you fuckers like me now?
Some of y'all start to smile, some of y'all start to frown
Some of y'all back up, 'fore a nigga start to clown
Now I gotta act up, kinda like Bobby Brown
Better call for back up, when I shut this lobby down
When will you realize the cycle will continue
Do commercials for Haterade—Boy, is it in you?
Hate to see me comin', rich as Phillip Drummond
Me and my lady, Superman and Wonder Woman
He think he the shit, the shit think he me
So come smell mine, I bet it don't stink
I am the link, the food and the drink
The color in the Kool-Aid, the nigga in the mink
(Don't trip)
{Chorus}
(Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
(Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
(You better) (Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
And we ain't gotta put up with this brainless rap
(So thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
(You better) (Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
(Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
And we ain't gotta put up with this brainless rap

(I know, I know)
I know you hate to see me comin'
(I know, I know)
I know you sayin' a little something
(I know, I know)
I know your mouth is still runnin'
(I know, I know)
All smiles when I come in
Thank God that The Gangsta's back (Scratched)
{Verse 3}
Now when will they realize, they'll never stop me
They call me arrogant, they call me cocky
Just because, I won't let 'em jock me
They wanna whoop my ass, but this ain't Rocky
I'm hot as a hibachi, Star Child cometh
And I promise y'all I'mma keep it one hun'ed
Y'all promise me you won't T-R-I-P (Don't trip)
Or I'mma have to hit your ass with a 2 piece
Hit you with some fries and two more sides
Don't you know my niggas turn haters in the mash potatoes
I'm the macaroni with the cheese, nigga please
When you see me on the red carpet, down on your knees
{Chorus}
(Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
(Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
(You better) (Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
And we ain't gotta put up with this brainless rap
(So thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
(Thank God) (Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
(You better) (Thank God) Thank God The Gangsta's back
And we ain't gotta put up with this brainless rap

I know you hate to see me comin'
(I know, I know)

(I know, I know)
All smiles when I come in1Embed
