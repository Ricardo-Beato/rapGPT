Took the R.I.C.O. with his guys
Took the R.I.C.O. with his crew
Took the R.I.C.O. with his pride
Took the R.I.C.O. with his set
Took the R.I.C.O., man, goddamn
Took the R.I.C.O., posting them guns
Took the R.I.C.O., free my mans
He took the R.I.C.O., flyin' 'round to Puerto Rico, eatin' a burrito (huh)

Said your car a week old, meet me on Pico
