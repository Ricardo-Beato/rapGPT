15 ContributorsGotta Keep Pushing Lyrics
(Blackberry molasses)
(One of the things that never change)
(You gotta keep pushing on)
(The sun don't rain all the time)
(There's gonna be some heartache and pain)
You gotta keep pushing on
Just sitting here reminiscing, man
Pushing on
Gotta keep pushing on
Mm
You gotta keep push—

Who remember growing up eating Corn Flakes?
Spend the night at granny house 'cause momma on a date
So you ate what you ate and you ate it quick
'Cause you knew your grandma, she ain't play that shit
Paw Paw, he stayed in another house
With another woman, she a brick house
Growing up fast was a shit show
It's a fеw things I learned from the gеt go
A few folks in my fam fell down
Then they got they feet back on solid ground
And came back around and showed me how to fail
See there's a lesson every time a nigga take a L
Dead or in jail, that's the fairytale
What I know about it? I know it very well
That's why I don't stop, won't stop, can't quit
Keep pushing making that dope shit
You might also like
You gotta keep push—
Through the good and the bad
Whether happy or sad
Tryna stand as a man
You gotta keep pushing on
We will see what they do
Keep your head up and move
Love will always come through (Yeah, a'ight Snoop)
You gotta keep push—

Through hell or high water, keep my confidence on the level
Let my family support me, it could be me against whoever
Say I'm cancelled, I say even better
Man, who gon' tell 'em?
Your opinion doesn't validate me, I been the shit
In my hood, can't get no better, could never intimidate me
Trap music say we geniuses, politics say we crazy (Shit)
Man, I was selling Ye when Brenda had a baby
When nothing but hip-hop could come and save me
And I just sat there on the pavement
Tryna find a way to make some payment
Had first dibs when they came in
Selling pounds of reefer was strange then (What?)
For eight thousand they gave me ten of 'em
Drove to make it make twenty off the same ten
All our lives we were taught to just hold the pain in (For real)
Imitate Neanderthals and copy cavemen
Can't teach a man how to make it with a handout
Fuck fitting in, keep pushing until you standout
You gotta keep push—
Through the good and the bad
Whether happy or sad
Tryna stand as a man
You gotta keep pushing on
We will see what they do
Keep your head up and move
Love will always come through
You gotta keep pushing on
Through the good and the bad
Whether happy or sad
Tryna stand as a man
You gotta keep pushing on
We will see what they do
Keep your head up and move
Love will always come through
You gotta keep pushing on

Blackberry molasses
One of the things that never change
You gotta keep pushing onEmbed
