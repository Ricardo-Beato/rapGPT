5 ContributorsAfter Tears Lyrics
This kind of a heartbreak is threatening to escalate to chasms
Rain seasons lead to monsoons when my tear ducts start to spasm
Contemplating the bitter end that's a gravity y'all can't fathom
But all that hate and toxic bickering, epic battles, y'all can have 'em
And on this Eve I'm pondering splitting from the Adam
I wonder if the fallout will be a Big Bang or a quiet release from the patterns
You say you respect me vow to protect me then turn right around and deplete me
My еnergy worth too much to allow our cycles to keep on repеating
This is over, well maybe, it took too long to heal from
It took you long enough to see my pain before you feel something
So maybe I need space, so I can face that which I fear
That me without you might be a vast improvement in my atmosphere
So choose your fateYou might also likeEmbed
