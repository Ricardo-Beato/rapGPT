14 ContributorsPit Stop Lyrics
I just get the money then I run with that
Run with that shit like a running back
When I catch a thot, boy I'm fuckin' that
I'm hittin it from the back and from the side
Bitch I get top and I get guap
My Brietling's better than yo watch that don't tick tock
Pants saggin' cause in 'em is big knots
I'll pull up and pull off like a pit stop

Roll around town with my big Glock
Catch a opp, he gon' get his shit broken
In that red thang, they like "Who is that?"
Yeah bitch, I went and got my shit done
Pull up in that fire truck
In that fire truck that light ya up, wet ya up
I'm upsettin' ya
I'm irregular, machete stuff
Money flyin' everywhere, confetti stuff
All I eat is green, bitch, veggie stuff
And I don't do that lessie stuff
I pull up in Beamer trucks

I just get the money then I run with that
Run with that shit like a running back
When I catch a thot, boy I'm fuckin' that
I'm hittin it from the back and from the side
Bitch I get top and I get guap
My Brietling's better than yo watch that don't tick tock
Pants saggin' cause in 'em is big knots
I'll pull up and pull off like a pit stop

Watch out, I'm 18 and I'm drivin' fast
Hop up in my car and then I dot a dash
I killed the dash, I drilled the dash
Bitch, whatchu mean? I whipped the dash
I whip it like I'm whippin' work
My wrist look like I whip the work
Bitch you know I whip the work
I will show you how my pistol work
I flip the work and send the work
Heavy nigga, show you how a center work
If it's 'bout that guap, you know I'll get to work
They should've never gave a young nigga work

I just get the money then I run with that
Run with that shit like a running back
When I catch a thot, boy I'm fuckin' that
I'm hittin it from the back and from the side
Bitch I get top and I get guap
My Brietling's better than yo watch that don't tick tock
Pants saggin' cause in 'em is big knots
I'll pull up and pull off like a pit stop3Embed
