5 ContributorsEdge Of Da Night LyricsThe best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from going under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, something I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends
Caps I fucked with are real, but hey
Those are your friends
Its just what you got coming sometimes you don't know
What you asking for, did you ask for more?
Should the casket door swing here, it is done
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin up or down what have you been provin'?
Jus that you were fuckin' ground
Bitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it
An I know that deep down you really don't want it
I woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on!
You might also likeThere's a lotta shit that I let slide, cuz its outta my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but its not in my plans
An a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckload, fleein' them to the morgue
Full moon, arooooo, the howlin', grrrrrrr
An growlin', shhhhhh, an prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is
What's gonna is what's gonna let niggas know
Why you bad in your house, an they lie up to your spouse
Told her it was suicide, but you an I
Both knew the truth, for we'd never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
Cuz you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here
Can you feel it? Tell me yeahEmbed
