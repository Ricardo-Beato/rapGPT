30 ContributorsDon’t Forget Lyrics
30, you a motherfucking fool, nigga

I'm starting to feel like I don't need love, that shit for the damn birds (Brr)
All this arguing get on my damn nerves (On God)
You forgot I put your mama in the suburbs (Don't forget)
You forgot I put your wrist on a blizzard (Don't forget)
You the reason I be moving like the wizard (Pluto)
Oh, so now you selling pussy, you a vendor (Oh, wow)
Tell your friends get out my DM 'fore I bend her (Yes)
Oh, your brother want a verse? I need a ten first (Yes)
Times ten more (Yes)
Bitch, we be on and off since I was a sophomore (Yes)
Waiting for your move, Dr. Hawthorne
And I started touring (Uh-huh)

So you ain't fell in love with my money?
Bitch, I ain't a dummy (Uh-huh)
You always seem to leave when it ain't sunny
Back and forth 'bout forty times, you swear you love me
Now you need a round of applause, bravo like Johnny
You acting so damn much, you so phony (Uh-huh)
I don't need that energy around me
But don't forget who put you on, you was bummy (Uh-huh)
You might also like
Don't you dare forget who had bossed you up (Bossed you up)
Had you running 'round in a Bentley truck (Big Bs)
Paparazzi, snap, flash, middle fingers up (Fingers up)
Baby said I tried to fuck her then ring her up (Ring her up)
Call her up (Call her up), bring her here (Bring her here)
Bitches be so cap, they are not sincere (Not sincere)
I keep forty straps, gotta play it by ear (Play it by ear)
Won't fall into your traps, I'm no longer near (Uh-huh)

So you ain't fell in love with my money?
Bitch, I ain't a dummy (Uh-huh)
You always seem to leave when it ain't sunny
Back and forth 'bout forty times, you swear you love me
Now you need a round of applause, bravo like Johnny
You acting so damn much, you so phony (Oh)
I don't need that energy around me
But don't forget who put you on, you was bummy
