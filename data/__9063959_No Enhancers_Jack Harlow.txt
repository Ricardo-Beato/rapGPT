29 ContributorsNo Enhancers Lyrics
Mm-mm
Uh

My homeboy just beat cancer
I call my ex "No Answer"
As in that's my nickname for her ’cause when I call, no answer
She know I'm a romancer
You know I make you laugh like no one else, you love my banter
I like my girl natural
She don't need no enhancers (Ayy)
She don’t need no enhancers (Ayy)
She don't need no enhancers
And my baby, she a natural
She don't need no enhancers (Ayy)
She don't need no enhancers (Ayy)
She don't need no enhancers

She don't even know hеr daddy
She walk 'round this cold world without no safety net or padding
Tough as nails, nеw acrylics once the old ones get too stale
Coffin shaped, nude pink, aside from that, the rest is real
Morning body, check the mirror, hit the scale, how we feel?
Birth control inside a pill
Just to leave the crib these days has become such a skill
All the cards stacked against her, but she learning how to deal, uh (Ooh)
You might also like
And my, my homeboy just beat cancer
I call my ex "No Answer"
As in that's my nickname for her ’cause when I call, no answer (Ayy)
She know I’m a romancer (Uh-huh)
You know I make you laugh like no one else, you love my banter
I like my girl natural
She don't need no enhancers (Uh-uh)
She don’t need no enhancers (Uh-uh)
She don't need no enhancers
And my baby, she a natural
She don't need no enhancers (Uh-uh)
She don't need no enhancers (Uh-uh)
She don’t need no enhancers1Embed
