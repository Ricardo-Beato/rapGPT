8 ContributorsDrummer Lyrics
Uh-uh, bumboclaat
Uh-uh, It's Gucci  (They got the boss)
Big boss, yeah (Big boss)
Ooh, yeah
Okay
Watch 'em

Don't try me, boy, I'll send you to your maker (I'll send ya)
Then I go spend Christmas in Jamaica (In Jamaica)
Big badger gun, I brought it for my haters (Big badger gun)
I left the barrel smokin' like a Garcia y Vega (Smoke)
Gucci Mane, ah, wicked, he a cold don (A Gucci)
Fuck the police man, 'cause they can't stop none (The police)
Your partner, he a bitch, that boy won't kill none (A former)
Pretty boy, a lover man, a real puss (A lover boy)
I don't fear your shooters, think they all sus (They all sus)
Bag on his head like a wave brush (A wave brush)
If copying is flattery, I feel touched (I feel touched)
But this ain't flag football, I get your head bust (I get ya all touched)

Never fear dem, better warn dem (Ooh, boy)
Boy dey gwaan like seh day want war, war (Blah, blah, blah)
Never hold back, we haffi rise up
Man ready for all dem, yeah (Ooh, boy)

Chillin' on the beach, smokin' on a phantom leaf
Backseat there to figure, thinkin' my life is fantasy (Trip)
Niggas, they be dissin' me (Diss), knowin' they be diggin' be me (Puss)
Misery love company, I take you out your misery (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Like a shot at enemies, my gun does not shoot Hennessy (No)
Niggas be too timid then they end up dead like Timothy (Dead)
Why you actin' pussy, boy? Like I'ma show you sympathy? (Rude boy)
Suck your motha pussy, boy, you should know not romp with me (Boom, boom, boom, boom)

Never fear dem, better warn dem
Boy dey gwaan like sey dey want war, war (Blah, blah, blah)
Never hold back, we haffi rise up
Man ready for all dem, yeah
Never fear dem, better warn dem (Oh)
Boy dey gwaan like seh day waan war, war
Never hold back, we haffi rise up (Yeah)
Man ready for all dem, yeahEmbed
