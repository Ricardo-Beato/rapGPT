It's Doja
I don't know how else to tell you this, but
I got one way, maybe this will work
You just gotta listen closely to me
I need you, me, us
Addicted, uh

I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction

I got such a pretty body
Feels prettier when I'm a mess
And I just like to call him daddy
'Cause the first one had up and left
And you can relate to broken girls
I've been a day without it, I'm proud of myself
Baby, can you break the curse?
I'm so gone, I believe in magic
You can relate to broken girls
I've been a day without it, I'm proud of myself
Baby, can you break the curse?
I'm so gone, I believe in magic
You might also like
I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction

Look
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (Oh na na na, na, na, na na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (Oh na na na, na, na, na na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (Oh na na na, na, na, na na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (Oh na na na, na, na, na na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit

Yeah, roll another hunnid
We could get the white girl lit like Madonna
Bitch, I ain't Gwen, but this shit is bananas
Sweating, make ya whole body drip like a sauna
Swim like your piranha, put M's in my water
I can't feel my lips, my limbs feel like rubber
Yeah, I came down, but I still need another
One under the tongue and then a little marijuana
They on the trees like koala
I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction

Look
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (Oh na na na, na, na, na na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (Oh na na na, na, na, na na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (Oh na na na, na, na, na na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit (Oh na na na, na, na, na na)
More, just a little bit more, just a little bit13Embed
