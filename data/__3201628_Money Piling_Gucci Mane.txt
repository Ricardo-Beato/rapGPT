20 ContributorsMoney Piling Lyrics
This is what eight figures look like
Kids wanna be like Gucci, give a fuck about Mike
Hmm, this is what your bitch look like
When you make two hundred thousand dollars cash one night
This is what your wrist look like
When you sold so many bricks that your fit turn white
That shit that you can step on twice
If you've never been a snitch this what your rep look like
And this is what your house look like
When you built it from the ground, paid that ten mil price, ayy
And this is what a king look like
Got a queen on your team, this what the ring look like (brrr, brrr)
This is what a dream look like
If you're hating tell me what your self esteem look like
Ex-dealer but I left that life
I can't even remember what a triple-beam look like

Guwop how much you pay for that Patek Phillipe? (hundred thousand)
Pretty please get them broke niggas way from me (hundred thousand)
I don't want no bitch to fuck with me for free (what's a thousand?)
You know a rich nigga can't fuck no hoe for free (what's a thousand?)
I just made five hundred thousand in my sleep (five hundred thousand)
Money comin', I think it's in love with me (five hundred thousand)
I'm in the club throwin' money on the freaks (money piling)
It ain't 'bout money then no need for us to speak (money piling)

Long pipes, big rims, baby that's my life
When I pull up to the club better stash your wife
Hear a lot of haters talkin', they ain't 'bout that life
2017, nigga I done boost the price
Two shows one day, I done switched the ice
Gettin' head on a PJ, it's an all night flight
Call Forbes, tell them niggas what that list look like
'Cause if Guwop ain't on that bitch, then that list not right
I dropped the top so I could show her what the sky look like
Besides the nigga drivin' there's not a star in sight
I just might pull up, pop a wheelie on an all-chrome bike
Bought a diamond grill from my dog, told him to bark, don't bite

Guwop how much you pay for that Patek Phillipe? (hundred thousand)
Pretty please get them broke niggas way from me (hundred thousand)
I don't want no bitch to fuck with me for free (what's a thousand?)
You know a rich nigga can't fuck no hoe for free (what's a thousand?)
I just made five hundred thousand in my sleep (five hundred thousand)
Money comin', I think it's in love with me (five hundred thousand)
I'm in the club throwin' money on the freaks (money piling)
It ain't 'bout money then no need for us to speak (money piling)2Embed
