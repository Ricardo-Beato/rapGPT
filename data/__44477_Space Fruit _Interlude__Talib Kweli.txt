3 ContributorsSpace Fruit (Interlude) Lyrics{*instrumental for the first 20 seconds*}

I just wanna say
Let me, taste, the, fruit, of, your, space
Oh what a, oh what a day
I just wanna play
Ma-gick-al vi-sions, what, we, lay
I wanna, I wanna stay
{*instrumental for the next 26 seconds*}

I just wanna say
Let me, taste, the, fruit, of, your, space
Oh what a, oh what a day
I just wanna play
Ma-gick-al vi-sions, what, we, lay
I wanna, I wanna stay
