23 ContributorsFallinâ€™ Lyrics
Confront the day, I want a way
To make sense of it, yeah, it's amaze-ment
The tint of the world and how they see you
'Ye already said they see us as black Beatles
Black people, open Hebrews, let it speak to
The savior inside, you'll see why the world needs you
Cathedral, black bodies fallen
In the hands and the clutches of descendants of the Dutchman
Anglo motherfuckers, that don't love us
Wranglers, it's in their genes to cuff us
We the tribe of Levi, cut them jeans knee-high
I think that it would be wise to read the book of Eli-jah Mohammad
And see why we prominent
Life's precious, all blessings upon it
Our mother's grandmothers should be called iconic
Life's precious, all blessings upon it

I don't know what we should call it
Some say it's love, some call it lust
They say that we free but we falling
So what should we call it?
Blood on the leaves, it ain't autumn
The weight is so heavy, it hurts underneath
Don't it seem like we got it the hardest?
And we keep on falling
You might also like
They say racism and it don't stop
They talk sexism, yeah, it don't stop
Americanism, yeah, it don't stop
You gotta get that wisdom and get your Glock
Before they hit your block with the National Guard
Yeah, you protected by a compassionate God
We hunting for jobs, being hunted by squads
It's a small world, we wanted at large
America's most neglected and arrested
That's why your vaccine, I gotta second guess it
We don't know what you shooting in Black kings and Black queens
Plus your health record ain't really that clean
We don't forget like Nat King, what happened in Tuskegee
We getting over high blood pressure and diabetes
Like trees, we fall in the wilderness of America
Is it you don't hear us or don't care for us?

I don't know what we should call it
Some say it's love, some call it lust
They say that we free but we falling
So what should we call it?
Blood on the leaves, it ain't autumn
The weight is so heavy, it hurts underneath
Don't it seem like we got it the hardest?
And we keep on falling
Once upon a time, there was a Black man
They loved him when he shot ball, they loved him when he ran
They loved him when he rapped, they loved him when he danced
But really didn't love him when he was out with his fam
Couldn't love him in the hood or selling CD's
And couldn't love her when she was in her house sleep
I'm wondering if it's love if it's really love at all
'Cause in that type of love, we fall

I don't know what we should call it
Some say it's love, some call it lust
They say that we free but we falling
So what should we call it?
Blood on the leaves, it ain't autumn
The weight is so heavy, it hurts underneath
Don't it seem like we got it the hardest?
And we keep on falling

Ooh, we keep falling
Ooh, we keep falling
Ooh, we keep falling
Ooh, we keep fallingEmbed
