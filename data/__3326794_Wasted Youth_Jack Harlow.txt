Ayy, you got me fucked up if you think I'ma fuck up this time, alright
It's the kid, come on, ayy

I rock the tan cargos with the velcro seams
I can't feel the vibration when my cell phone ring
I like to watch them split the swisher, make the 'rillo bleed
I know that Sunny keep a pound inside the L.L. Bean
And this that wasted youth, killing time
Say the truth, feel the vibe
Baby let me bring you 'round my friends, yeah, they the purest
I might act a little different that's just 'cause they give me courage
When I need it
I mean I'm joking but I'm not
Yeah the story of my life, said I play too fucking much
And I say that way too much, guess that still don't justify it
But I been that way forever, I don't feel like even trying to change
She the one I'm tryna' be real with
But this that tick-tock, she ain't got no time for my feelings
I need a pit stop every time I ride with my villains
They up in Big Rock blowing smoke inside the pavilion, you know

Wasted youth, killing time
Say the truth, feel the vibe
Wasted youth
Wasted youth
Wasted youth
Wasted youth
You might also like
Wasted youth, wasted time
Wish that I could press rewind
Don't fuck with sunshine, stuck in my confines
Yeah, I'm worried 'bout real shit, you worried 'bout punchlines
And I was coolin' with my niggas
Talking 'bout stacking them figures
Wasting my time with them bitches
Chilling, kicking, she gon' stuff them swishers
And I don't even smoke for real but I'ma puff it with her
And we gon' fuck and I ain't gon' see her for a couple weekends
'Cause I been drinking, I been smoking, going off the deep end
She said that she gon' be my baby well I guess it depends
Catch me faded maybe we can see then, maybe we can be friends
If we don't hit it off, I'm sorry
Lately, I been distant, you can cut this shit off
I just been lost in my thoughts
Wasted money, chasing truth
Wasted time, wasted youth

Wasted youth, killing time
Say the truth, feel the vibe
Wasted youth
Wasted youth
Wasted youth
