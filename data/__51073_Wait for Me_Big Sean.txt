63 ContributorsWait for Me Lyrics
It's too—it's too late

I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while?
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late, oh

I hope it's not too late (Too late)
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
Riding in a Chevy that shoulda been a Mercedes
Tryna keep my head above water, so I stayed out the Navy, I, I
I made a promise to my girl (Girl)
Said "I'ma leave town and bring back the whole world" (World)
So I bought a ticket (Boy), took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace and the first thing she said was
"It's too late"
Like, "Nigga, I got needs, too
I found a man who gave me what I need, now I don't need you
I barely got a text, a call back, you old lying ass nigga (Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
You a dog, out here chasing paper, fucking bitches, nah (The hell you talking about now?)
Nah, nigga, you too late (Fuck you, get out)
Live with it, now you got a roommate"
My homie served ten years; it's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Riding around doing my thing (Thing)
Is it too late to be tryna live dreams (Dreams)
And turn them all real? Reality is just a technicality
So is being fake, so don't tell me that I'm—that I'm too late
You might also like
I hope it's not too late for me (No)
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while?
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late, oh

Too late, yeah
Uh, alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak, I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long
And don't look too strong, well, how long would you take?
Waiting's got me here in the first place
'Nother second, I been second, maybe third in the worst case
Now on display are my word plays
Moving weight, eh, it's such a trap
Move and wait; you can't do that
I know I'm dope, man, but I can't move crack
And it's such a fractured way of thinking 'bout your plans
But I try and bring it back before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit, Lupe from Chicago-land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers designed both of the sedans
Ride with Mr Right-On-Time or stay Ms Another Chance
Man; redirected at the girls
Not an ultimatum just an option in this world
Where things come and go when the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot, huh
I hope it's not too late for me (Yeah)
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while?
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late, oh

I hope it's not too late
I hope it's not too late
The last thing I wanna hear is too late
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, is it too late for me to try and change the world?
Is it too late to say I wanna change girls?
Is it too late even though I'm the shit?
Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick? Bitch

I do it, too late for what
If I want it I need it if I need it I got it
Finally Famous in this, G.O.O.D
Is this how Finally Famous niggas do?16Embed
