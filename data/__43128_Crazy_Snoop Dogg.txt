10 ContributorsCrazy Lyrics
*Gunshots*
Black folks can't never have no fun!

These streets be-
Walking down the avenue
Crazy!
From Hollywood to South Central
These streets be-
Crazy!
Long Beach to Compton
Always up to no good
Craaaa-Crazy! (Crazy)
Always up to no good
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
Crazy!

Have a look outside and take a stroll with me
California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?
I could take you in and out and where it's gonna be
Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong to me
I'ma stay down, you see me on the corners, G
At your local liquor store, gettin' some Optimos
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats
On the real know the streets'll have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see you gradually grow
And when you walkin on my side I think you all need to know...
You might also like
These streets be-
Walking down the avenue
Crazy!
From Hollywood to South Central
These streets be-
Crazy!
Long Beach to Compton
Always up to no good
Craaa-Crazy! (Crazy)
Always up to no good
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
Crazy!

On the 110 freeway flow, back to the block
In the seven deuce Coupe, hoppin' hippin' the hop
Sippin on some Hen' with my nephew Infrared
Young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young
Seesaw we raw like ooh-la-la
Fuck the law, we don't get caught, we just do-da-da
Yeah nigga we shakin' the cops
You niggas out there just be makin' it hot
But don't trip if you fakin' a lot
I'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot
'Cause if you think that you gon' slip through California
Without gettin banged on.. brother you're wrong
(Always up to no good!)
I really love my dawg, grew up together and all but he
(Always up to no good!)
Hell yeah I love, knew y'all
That's why I married the broad, but she's...
(Always up to no good!)
We can't hang no more 'cause I'm a balla y'all and he
(Always up to no good!)
Let me tell you about these streeeets
(Always up to no good!)

These streets be...
Walking down the avenue
(Always up to no good!)
Crazy!
(Always up to no good!)
From Hollywood to South Central
These streets be...
(Always up to no good!)
Crazy!
Long Beach to Compton
(Always up to no good!)
Craaa-
(Always up to no good!)
Crazy! (Crazy)
Always up to no good
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
(Always up to no good!)
Crazy!
Fredwreck you a fool for that beat, man
Check it out y'all it's Julio G, Westside radio
You got your ears tuned to Tha Blue Carpet Treatment
A todos los latinos los voy a llevar a la Playa Larga
Y voy a deja' que Snoop les diga lo que le pas√≥
Ayy Snoop, tell 'em what's up, vato2Embed
