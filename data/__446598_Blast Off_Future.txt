11 ContributorsBlast Off Lyrics
I can damn near touch the sky when I walk outside on my balcony
I'm falcon flyer pelican as high as you will ever be
And I can see the stars from one of me
You stuck that kush inside them sickles lot we got dat cattle roll yeah
Blast off, blast off, blast off, blast off
We blowin up to da moon
Shout out to da goons
Salute me wen u see me
Filled wit money in da room
Blast off

Full of nitro thats that hydro
Get drunk everyday cinco de mayo
Money power drinkin on mud
Take it how u want it
You can dip it in da bud
We quickin it unda wood
Prolly take you 1 sludge
We smashin these bitches
Only takin 1 hug
Flyer than a sky above
One side of da car washing drugs
Pelican wit presidents
I'm a fly rich nigga that's evident
Take a look at me now, evidence
Go harder than u eva went
I'm mixin up my medicine with Sprite & ice on top of ice
Ima lifetime sacrafice damn right
Ima stuff this cash to the perfect height
Persistent and me be precise
Pimpin, Prada, place space, hustle 
Nigga we don't take vacation
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
Blast off to da moon
Anytime you see da kid
Movies all I do
You might also like
I can damn near touch the sky when I walk outside on my balcony
I'm falcon flyer pelican as high as you will ever be
And I can see the stars from one of me
You stuck that kush inside them sickles lot we got dat cattle roll yeah
Blast off, blast off, blast off, blast off
We blowin up to da moon
Shout out to da goons
Salute me wen u see me
Filled wit money in da room
Blast off

On top of da roof of da penthouse levi got ha feenin

I can damn near touch the sky when I walk outside on my balcony
I'm falcon flyer pelican as high as you will ever be
And I can see the stars from one of me
You stuck that kush inside them sickles lot we got dat cattle roll yeah
Blast off, blast off, blast off, blast off
