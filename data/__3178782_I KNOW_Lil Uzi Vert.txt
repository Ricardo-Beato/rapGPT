I know what you really like (I know, I know, I know, I know, Lil Uzi Vert)
I know what you really like

I know, what you want, I know (What you want)
Well, not for long, I know (Long)
Girl, this your song, I know
Turn up all night long, I know (Ayy, ayy)
I know, I know
Ain't shit changed, I know (Oh)
That money ain't a thang, I know (I know what you really like)
Stay switching four lanes, I know
That this don't mean a thing, I know (I know what you really like)
Not blind from the fame, I know
Look straight through the hate, I know (I know what you really like)
Run straight to the cake, I know (Woah)

I know something that you don't know
Go straight to the money, oh-oh-oh (Yeah)
I don't want that twenty
Bitch, stack that big Frank' hundred, uh-huh-uh (Ayy)
That bitch that you wifin'
I knew that she fucking for money (Money), oh-oh-oh (For money, for money)
I know I was nothing, I turned into something
Lil' nigga, I know, I know (I know)
I know that they're out to get me
Sleep with one eye closed (I know)
Saint Laurent on my clothes, double C my toes (Woah)
Ooh, neck on froze (Huh, huh), South Pole (Gang)
Got a girl in the North Pole (Pole), I know, cash rules (Pew)
Made that girl drop it on the floor (Floor)
In the days with my cash grow (Grow)
Pick it up oh-so slow (Slow)
Made her eat my tadpole ('Pole)
I am never comfortable ('Ble)
'Cause I never reached my goal (Goal)
One thing that I know (I know what you really like)
I'm gon' get that— (Ah, ah)
