Picture me
Put a frame on me, nigga
Cookin' plenty deep
I got them bails, and don't call unless you want more than three
Said I got free bricks, but right now, ain't nothin' for free
Ain't scared of shit, nigga, you can buy this shit from me

Have you seen pics of me recently?
Bad bitch in reach of me
Takin' pictures indecently
Photo shoot in my Bentley G
Better yet, Bentley SUV
I'm straightforward, Ima straight 8
Wanna suck this dick? Bitch go for it
I'mma dog this nigga my hoe loyal
Got bands on me, I play, bruh
All my cars, they paid for
That pussy good, I pay for
She so fine, that I stay for
Crazy nigga I wanna rape her
And
My dick she say she got a taste for
And this paper add to my flavor
You broke, man, you ugly
You up, nigga, you handsome
Picture this — a little jail cell — then went and jumped in my V12
Money so old, it get senile
Got yo baby momma on redial
Get ten bricks for seventeen, that's why the bird is my decal
(Wop)
You might also like
Picture me
Put a frame on me, nigga
Cookin' plenty deep
I got them bails, and don't call unless you want more than three
Said I got free bricks, but right now, ain't nothin' for free
Ain't scared of shit, nigga, you can buy this shit from me

Sayin' somethin', I'mma lay someone
I'mma send some for my income
I don't even know the outcome
But I'mma ride around with my drum
You can send some, but I'mma send some
But the ones I'mma send gon' hit somethin'
If you hit one,  you might get some
If you don't hit none, you don't get shit
Picture me as a Watcher, nigga
Picture me as a Mocker, nigga
Picture me as a Green Bay Packer stackin' up this paper, nigga
Save that "it get greater later", but I hate a motherfuckin' hater, nigga
It's dinner at this restaurant, but I split yo fuckin' potato, nigga
If he wants it, then I'm comin'
The police can't even save you, nigga
Goin' 100 miles and runnin', like Eazy-E in Compton, nigga
You suckas sayin' you gonna do somethin'
You bitches ain't gonna do nothin', nigga
I'mma tell Waka to trap him, and I'mma cut his ass like a pumpkin, nigga
(Wop)

Picture me
Put a frame on me, nigga
Cookin' plenty deep
I got them bails, and don't call unless you want more than three
Said I got free bricks, but right now, ain't nothin' for free
Ain't scared of shit, nigga, you can buy this shit from meEmbed
