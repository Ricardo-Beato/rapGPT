25 ContributorsAttention Span Lyrics 3x
Every little step we take breaks the dreams
Of a war pig itching to re-stitch the seams

Namsayin, when I walk, I wanna break concrete!
Ox will spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror
My light beams are mad bright, they stay clever
Yo, challenge an Ox member, get a valve severed
Found your body in the desert (Scavenger's dessert)
Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran
Plus enter battles talkin shit like "Look mom, no hands"
I'm tired of cats tryin to sum me
You can't add that far yet, that counting is far fetched
I treat MC like K-9s
Throwin words at they face to see if they bite when they catch
I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette
Now you standing there wit razors in your head like barrettes
Man, if the mic had ass cheeks
The sticker in my hand would say priority seating
And man, I don't know if it was me or you
But your girl was on my dick like she was teethin'
You play the role, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you
The godspeed is actual, that doesn't mean I act usual
One of the first MC's to give the crowd full attention
Cuz you need love and affection
You might also like 2x
If we could absorb every star in the sky
We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why
It's the simple things in life that turn the peasants into leaders
And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers

I boogie with picketer vision, carbon based stickler
City piss aroma, therapy coma, clone sitter
Itching to pigeonhole villain soul magnet
Feelers activate
Passion ate the germ, and the book met the worm
I hold a book of matches captive to flash if
The sunbeams flatline
Via thick fatigue episodes, brewed in batches
The flirt of cursed perks nursed broken skeleton patches
One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center
Housing style pageants
My little limbs lasso katydid wings
While mankind's babysteps break dirt and demon
I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of
Mass times weight times tamed semantics
Encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage
To hell with plastic, we edit splendid
Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, apprehend it
Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again
It still never renders suspended 'bove finicky picket fences
Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts
Start with cadaver parts and a blueprint
He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear
Let the tears braid
And skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade
Gold-plated tomb or spittoon
I couldn't see
I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree
The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance
Was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance
