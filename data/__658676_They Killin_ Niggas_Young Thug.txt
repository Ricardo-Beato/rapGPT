Young Thug, you gotta appreciate the love, my nigga
I Came From Nothing part two
Throw up on the fuckboys
Swamp Izzo

They killin' little niggas, it ain't no love in these streets
Even bitches can get it, that's why I thug with my heat
I'm a real thug nigga, stand ten toes flat on my feet
They killin' lil' niggas, they killin' lil' niggas
They killin' little niggas, it ain't no love in these streets
Even bitches can get it, that's why I thug with my heat
I'm a real thug nigga, stand ten toes flat on my feet (And we ridin')
They killin' lil' niggas, they killin' lil' niggas (Hoodrich)

Yeah, and if you play Duey, we'll kill you, bitch nigga
And I'll be on your ho like clothes (Come here, ho)
And I swear if you play with any one of my crew (What?)
I'll be in your mouth like golds (Hahaha)
But I have a goal (And it) and it is to get rich and die old (And what?)
And I have a sick wrist, it got a cold (I swear)
And my ears are Atlantic, which means froze (Froze)
And I swear I ain't ever, ever gone play with ya'll niggas (Play with y'all)
I swear I will go and get the K for y'all niggas (K for y'all fuckboys)
And walk up on ya and say hey to y'all niggas
Then cock that motherfucker back and spray on y'all niggas (Hahaha)

They killin' lil' niggas, they killin' lil' niggas
They killin' little niggas, it ain't no love in these streets

Yeah, and Moonk Tune'll kill you if you play, bitch nigga (What up Moonk?)
And Big'll come and get his ass outta there (Haha)
And we'll tie you up to the top floor
And let the young crips come and move you like a rockin' chair
Cleveland Ave, we rockin' now (Yeah)
Four Seasons can't stop it now (Uh, uh)
What you mean I fuck with them? (Yes, I do)
I said I fuck with them (Yes, I do)
Okay, I slept with him (Woah, dawg)
Which means I fuck with him (What's up, bro?)
I fuck with him (Okay)
No homo though (Haha)
And if you have no cash (What?) no show dough
Last night I went by myself, solo do'
Duey talkin' 'bout give him somethin', I'm like oh no
Buc talkin' 'bout give him somethin', double oh no
They killin' little niggas, it ain't no love in these streets (And what?)
Even bitches can get it, that's why I thug with my heat (And what?)
I'm a real thug nigga, stand ten toes flat on my feet
They killin' lil' niggas, they killin' lil' niggas
They killin' little niggas, it ain't no love in these streets
Even bitches can get it, that's why I thug with my heat
I'm a real thug nigga, stand ten toes flat on my feet
They killin' lil' niggas, they killin' lil' niggas

Okay, and the outro of this motherfucker is.... the end!Embed
