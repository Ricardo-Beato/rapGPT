3 ContributorsWorld Tour Sessions Lyrics
(Explosion, scratching)
"The new world order, because the new world doesn't appear that orderly..."
(In this world today...)

Aight, I'ma let you know how trips 'round the world go
That's right, world tour sessions
We're gonna warm it up just like this
Come on, check it out

Behold, the whole planet upside down
I put it down, shuttin' down disco clowns
I get around, this rap game's like a sport
Been through two passports, ass stay up in airports
Black man still gettin' no support
Compensation we ain't seein', split by Europeans
Damn treated less than human beings, no matter
Africa, Brazil, East St. Louis or the Caribbean
Traveled the seven seas, rocked many races
Spread the cash cleaned trash in a lotta low places
Seen the look of love on many mad faces
When I rhymed about the time and not the paper chases
People all over the world givin' mad respect
When I identified who the government wrecked
What's the sound scan? Ask the company rep
They don't care, they just about keepin' their checks
You might also like
Round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knows
Round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knows
Round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knows
Round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knows

Hear the crime rhyme created a lotta robots
Can the real lyric fix the shit that the time forgot?
Loops gotcha brain gettin' locked loaded up with words
That never meant a lot, and you can't call the cops
And y'all don't really know, and y'all don't hear me through
Takes a nation of big brains to break up that flow
And the game ain't changed but the heads be rearranged
In danger, my language is rappin' in anger
I be bangin' so I point my finger
While we sleep, racists set us up like sheep
Every time I go someplace, slaves in my face
Black people in a plantation state
No control of our soul and wouldn't know our fate
Now am I wrong to hate hate?
38 countries, 51 states, now you tell me
Who in the world gonna compensate?
100 million lost, make a nigga wait
Gotta beg the queen to get food on the plate
Round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knows
Round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knows
Round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knows
Round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knowsEmbed
