20 ContributorsThe Saga Continues Intro Lyrics
He's taking the test
Do you know the consequences if you should fail the test?
And not get to Death Alley
My advice is not to try it
I've made up my mind, I won't fail
Don't you know, the men in there, will be fighting to kill?
I know, they're all my brothers there, but they all have their orders though: fight to kill, and show no mercy to anyone. That's why they call it, "Death Alley"
What do you prove, if you're killed?
It simply proves, that I'm not good
Wu-Tang Clan rocks the world

You guys ready?
Yo, y'all mother-motherfuckin' there?
This shit on? Yo
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no, no
Check it out, Zig-Zag, 2017, another Wu saga
Continue like Buck Rogers in the 21st century and we still gotta duck the fucking coppers?
Take it back to this top of the beat that I'ma fuck with now
It's already happening? This shit is happening already?You might also like1Embed
