2 ContributorsCrowd In Rage Lyrics
Bet your baby daddy ain't icy like the kid be
Like the kid be, icy like the kid be
Bet your baby daddy ain't icy like the kid be
Like the kid be, icy like the kid be
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Like the kid be, icy like the kid be
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Like the kid be, icy like the kid be

I wild, and I rage, Gucci gettin' paid
Icy made your girl throw her thong on the stage
Crumb Gucci Mane, the hottest rapper in the A
Sellin' plenty yay, movin' twenty bricks a day
I used to have my '86 Cutlas with the T-Top
Now I'm in an SL-5 with the top dropped
Too hot to handle, ridin' down 
Baby, its a Kodak moment, get your camera
Gucci Mane, La Flare, shorty, damn, what they say
Girls goin' crazy 'bout the shorty with the ways
Iced out chain and the fresh Cartier
Voted best dressed ever since eighth grade
You don't really know us, Lamb with the doors up
Its so froze up, it'll make you throw up
Mama I'ma be like Gucci when I grow up
Move big cakes, so I got money to throw up
Pimp tight, player dead fresh with the mink coat
Lookin' for a big booty broad with a deep throat
You might also like
Uh, pimp tight with a mink coat
Lookin' for a big booty broad with a deep throat

I got a nine on the seat, shotgun in the trunk
Came to the club, I was already drunk
Laid back, young player, tryna get krunk
But if you find, might trick a little some
Same self or kill yourself, you would think I'm UPS
I'ma knock on your door, like I got your address
Dead fresh everyday, player, that's me
Trashcan bras can't smoke my trees
Gucci M-D-M, peep on me
My family need me to bring groceries
I proceed to smoke my weed
Mic check, mic check
I ain't seen nobody out-flow me yet
A vet and a vet, ride through your set
Two out of state broads and a case of MoÃ«t
A blonde, a brunette, what we gon' do next?
Good sex, good neck, they say I'm a good catch
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I don't mess with hood rats
Hit the blunt twice, girl, and pass the blunt back
I got a hundred dollar haircut
In the club with a hundred dollar haircut
Everybody say it-
