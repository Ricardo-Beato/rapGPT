6 ContributorsWhat It’s All About Lyrics
От героев былых времён...

Life can get all up in your ass
Baby, you better work it out
Now let me tell you what it's all about
Now let me tell you what it's all about

It's like every day's hotter than the previous one
I swear to God, the Earth spun a little closer to the Sun
It's a lot less jobs and a lot more guns
It's a lot more bills, but a lot less funds
And it's not as much fun as when I was a little one
When you could run without the air putting shit in your lungs
I'm disgusted with the music, I'm a slave to my phone
My homie works 60 hours, but he can't afford a home
The kids are so arrogant, I'm proud to be American
But what these motherfuckers glorify is real embarrassin'
My brother died from a bad batch of heroin
My man was pulled over driving ki's out of Maryland
There's more mass murders, and the shooter gets rewarded
'Cause the mainstream media's so eager to report it
My blood's full of Xanax, reality's distorted
So I write down the stress to sort it, and then record it
You might also like
Life can get all up in your ass
Baby, you better work it out
Now let me tell you what it's all about
Now let me tell you what it's all about
Life can get all up in your ass
Baby, you better work it out
Now let me tell you what it's all about
Now let me tell you what it's all about

Yo, I'm on a road to redemption, lightin' up incense
The world of bad karma form around me
It's all about family, God, good health
And no limits, only things I pursue in this lifetime
The power lies deep in my core, it means much more
To have a peace of mind instead of confrontation or war
This is grown man talk, what Celph and Ap saw is a vision
But why is O.C. not livin'?
The Benz lopsided, I'm open to goddess
'Cause you never stop learnin', the situation I'm in
Is what you allow, married the game way-back-when
It's time to renew my vow
Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom
Just to see who's there, to help you sort out the problem
Test the time, don't stop tickin' into hour
Nor a minute, for a second, take it as a blessin', 'cause
Life can get all up in your ass
Baby, you better work it out
Now let me tell you what it's all about
Now let me tell you what it's all about
Life can get all up in your ass
Baby, you better work it out
Now let me tell you what it's all about
Now let me tell you what it's all about
