13 ContributorsDonâ€™t Make No Sense Lyrics
I'm in a rush, I'm rollin' kush, I'm cookin' dope, don't interrupt
Fifty bricks came in a bus, I intercept, I finish up
Gucci Man, I'm sinister, politic like a senator
Better yet prime minister, eat rappers for dinner, bruh
From sellin' dope to sellin' big houses like a realtor
I pull up in a black on black Maybach like I'm the governor
Some critics say they can't understand me, I'm a southerner
Bad bitch, she rockin' Chanel but she a foreigner
Pull up in them twin Maseratis, yeah they identical
And I bought a new Kawasaki, I'm poppin' wheelies, bruh
Miami Beach police pulled me over, eh what's the ticket for?
He mad cause the bitch on the back ain't from America

Now this shit really don't make no goddamn sense
Police chase me, jumped a goddamn fence
Ain't no room in the house for all these goddamn bricks
So many bales at the spot, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense

Don't make no goddamn sense, man it's a goddamn shame
They talkin' shit from the bench, get in the goddamn game
I mean you boys need to chill, them niggas hot champagne
Nigga I do that shit, you don't do a goddamn thang
And I'm really sorry, I just got that Cali Rari
Smokin' Northern Cal Safari while I'm eatin' calamari
And these suckas can't stomach that, guess they can't digest
That I'm makin' major moves and they ain't makin' progress
Say "Hi" Just, y'all meet pretty Jessica
Know she got that good brain, I just keep on testin' her
Don't come with my package, I'mma have to kill the messenger
Smell that funny shit and I'mma spray that air freshener
You might also like
Now this shit really don't make no goddamn sense
Police chase me, jumped a goddamn fence
Ain't no room in the house for all these goddamn bricks
So many bails at the spot, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense

No off-brand niggas run with my click
Choppas so big, don't make no goddamn sense
Spend a whole lot of racks on a whole lot of packs
Spit a whole lot of crack on a whole lot of classics
Got a bitch in every city with a whole lot of back
Smoke a whole lot of weed, ate a whole lot of snacks
Had twenty-eight grams when I fell up in this bitch
Smoked it all 'fore I left, don't make no goddamn sense
I'm on kush, she on pills in a short-short dress
Bitch ass so big, don't make no goddamn sense
Gucci Mane was like "Ball, where you get that bitch?"
Bitch ass so big, don't make no goddamn sense

Now this shit really don't make no goddamn sense
Police chase me, jumped a goddamn fence
Ain't no room in the house for all these goddamn bricks
So many bails at the spot, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense
Don't make no goddamn sense, don't make no goddamn sense4Embed
