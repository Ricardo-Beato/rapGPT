7 ContributorsMr. Clean, the Middle Man (Intro) Lyrics
I'm thinkin' back when a nigga got his first car
"How you get that? You ain't even have a job"
Fight about that, and don't worry 'bout that
It's the same way that a nigga got his first charge
Thinkin' way back so I'm thinkin' real hard
Sellin' hard hard at Econo Lodge
Bought my first pistol and I knocked my first broad
First nigga run up, head get knocked off
Bought a .38 just in case shit pop off
Like a 'vert', I'ma take your top off
Brick Squad CEO, bitch I'm a mob boss
.44 bulldog, million dollar drop off
If I ever get this drop I'ma start lickin' shots
Tell the cops I'm just another nigga from the block
You can gamble with your life like a lady at the slots
You can plot 'til you pop and your clock get stopped
You were flexin' what you got, now your head got a dot
You're the nigga in the paper that they're readin' about
Police still ain't connected the dots
Drug  cause I left a nina at the house
Take me to the safe cause I'm cleanin' it out
Hundred bricks what I've been dreamin' about
Slap you with the , see the blood and the snot
Laced up 'til your hands tied in a knotYou might also like1Embed
