11 ContributorsGrown Man Lyrics
Now that I'm finally free
I'm bouta throw it today
I take my life in my hands
Cause I'm a grown-ass man
(I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free

I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Super high, can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
Streets taught me everything, I trained myself
Dead wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else
They wanna lock my crew up like ???
Think every man ??? and amuse himself
Glad as well, but I'm mad as hell
Because my best friend probably gon' die in jail
Ain't no lie to tell, probably cry like hell
If I dwell on it, cause he got 80 years
I'm going hard, you see I might as well
Cause I got a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy's dead
I bet my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag
So I stand today, then get down to pray
The second is now and my mind is made
I got a point to prove, and a son to raise
Can't let him make mistakes that his daddy made
You might also like
Now that I'm finally free
I'm bouta throw it today
I take my life in my hands
Cause I'm a grown-ass man
(I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free

Squash the beef I'm free of that
This crazy song, they ain't feelin' that
I guess they wanna see us kill each other
If I'm dead, who the fuck gonna help my mother
I done struggled and hustled too hard for this
I done rob stealed killed, ain't proud of that
Smoke weed, took pills and sold powder packs
I'm a soldier but you stand, where the cowards at?
Man your homeboy gone where the flowers at
All the money in the world can't bring that back
If I had one wish, wish mom and dad could
Come down now and see me rap
But she see me now, and I believe in that
On the strength of that I ain't goin' back
So I put my whole family on my back
Lost so much time, can't pay that back
I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Super high, can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
It's Gucci
Now that I'm finally free
I'm bouta throw it today
I take my life in my hands
Cause I'm a grown-ass man
(I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free

I was lost, but now I'm found
Don't you ?? then keep me down
See my life go round and round
I say I straightened up my act
And I ain't never goin' back
Now that I' m finally free (finally free)
You'll never take me away (you'll never take me away)
Took everything that I have (everything that I)
???????????
Now that I'm finally free (oh finally free)
I'm bouta throw it today (throw it today)
I take my life in my hands (I take my life in my hands)
Cause I'm a grown-ass man (I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free
I'm a grown-ass manEmbed
