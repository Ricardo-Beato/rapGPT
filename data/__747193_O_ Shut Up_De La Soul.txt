4 ContributorsO’ Shut Up Lyrics
You got oodles and oodles of O's, you know
You get 'em from my sister, you get 'em from my bro
All I is is man, and once an embryo
Am I solid gold? I don't cast a glow
Yes, I guess it's reflex some have no control
I'd rather let a laughter, tally, off I go
Canoeing up the river or out into the O
You just know me not so not play the role
Some are lovey-Dovey, ah you crazies know
Some shake your hand but this is called a show
I was John Doe, now I'm David Jolicoeur
Pissed with the witness, so now I adore
O's got the world cause O's was on tour
Girls gave the O's, and all ny niggas, for sure
Where they arose, well nobody knows
And what do they mean, well here's how it goes
Well oh shoot's got the O's when you hold the dough
You know who you are but they didn't know
And now with respect they flex like a pro
You're first another nigga but now...

Oodles and oodles of O's you know
We go oodles and oodles of O's you know
We go oodles and oodles of O's you know
We go oodles and oodles of O's you know
Shut up

Last of the fast Plug pipers at the dō
In your eyes burning like rubbing alcohō
Native is the Tongue that speaks the Guacomō
Kinfolk will play this in stere-ereō
Chanters play the part of a herd of a show
Pos prints the peace on his jeans or Girbauds
But let the herd know, beef you wanna throw
Lunches of punches is what we'll bestow
Oodles of O's enhance my ho's at mic checks
O's take the shape of medallions and specs
Don't forget the O's that let the air in my nose
Breathe in the fresh, stale hit the roads
Girls ask for flicks and I plot the pose
Eat the Al Greens
Yo, my nigga Mase got something to say and it go
Scratches: oh shit, oh shit
Oh, oh-o-o-oh shit
What a minute, why the fuck am I whispering?Embed
