Trippin'
Wildin' on television
You could
Still see a nigga tell the vision
Pimpin' (Pimpin')
Boy, these boys, pimpin'
Different, huh
These boys, boys—

Pop was here last week
He was talkin' about Brooklyn and the place Brooklyn was at
How they were really like, thrivin' right now
He was, you know, he was tryna, pull people up with him
He wasn't even into where he was about to be
He just was trying to; he was trying to get there
I mean, he was on his, he was well on his way
Um, it's just tragic, twenty years old, rеst in peace
God bless Pop Smokе
Look, nigga, we made it (Grrt, woo, bah)
Nigga, we made it, we made it (Woo)
Nigga, we made it (Woo)
Thank God that I made it (Grrt, bah)
Nigga, we made it, we made it (Woo)
Look, momma, I made it (Grrt)

Look, I remember the days, same fit for a week straight
I used to eat fifty-cent cake
Now, it's Philippe's, it's Philippe's for the steak
And hella thots up in the Wraith
I can't wife that thot, tell that bitch, "Get out of my face"
We killed your big brother, we killed your little brother
Now, it's Philippe's, it's Philippe's for the steak
And hella thots up in the Wraith
Said I hop in a Lamb' and skrrt off, I spent fifty up in Bergdorf
I got shit you never heard of, buy it, I don't care what it cost, no
And I always keep a pole
Rain, snow, I did a hundred on a pro
If you droppin' a woo, we come where you live, Glock 9, infrared
Pull up, and empty the clip, woo
Dread had the strap all summer in the Floss movin' reckless
Please, do not play wit' me, nigga, I keep a K wit' me

Look, nigga, we made it (Grrt, woo, bah)
Nigga, we made it, we made it (Woo)
Nigga, we made it (Woo)
Thank God that I made it (Grrt, bah)
Nigga, we made it, we made it (Woo)
Look, momma, I made it (Grrt)
Nigga, we made it
Uh? We come from the trenches, nigga (Woo)
Trap, trap, same fit for a week straight (Grrt)
You know what I'm sayin'?
Fifty-cent cake, now, we eatin' Philippe's steak (Hahaha)

Look, Tyler got the album of the year, for now
But Pop about to drop, I see the platinum in the clouds
Now Push about to drop, so real trappers stick around
The crown is only for the king, they tryna place it on a clown
I declare war, nickname, 'He Sell Raw'
Different city, same ghetto, bring the Woos on tour
Push start, drop top, 812, two-door
Baby Rover, Benz, coupe, bitch, you gotta choose yours
How can I not? Woo, how can I not?
When a brick is thirty-six, bitch, how could I stop?
These Richard Milles are one-of-one, shit, how could I watch?
We made it, we made it, whether you like it or not

Look, nigga, we made it (Grrt, woo, bah)
Nigga, we made it, we made it (Woo)
Nigga, we made it (Woo)
Thank God that I made it (Grrt, bah)
Nigga, we made it, we made it (Woo)
Look, momma, I made it (Grrt)28Embed
