3 ContributorsLast Days Lyrics
Yeah.. uhh.. yeah..
You know.. it's easy for us...
Harder for them..
Easy for us, ha.. yeah..

I'm lookin' for that next meal ticket
Somethin' solid, bread, steady prosper
I'm in the kitchen, yeah, you see me on my Betty Crocker
Dance baby, get that money, I would never knock her
'Cause she reliable, and let a nigga stash the choppers
I'll have a town lookin' like Japan
Flooded, tsunami
(?), my true hoobies
I'm tired of this Range, I need the new Bugatti
You niggas too punani
This ain't for the kind hearted
Already told you what it was when the rhyme started
My hunger's like a high, and this is what it got to offer
Got a taste for steak and lobster, 'bout bread, Hoffa
Life's a bitch, won't stop, until I pop up
Til I pop her 'til the cash proper
We the realest, check ya facts, partna...

Ayo, it's hard out here for a hustler
No matter which game you playin', it's gettin' rougher
They puttin' the squeeze on us
Times is gettin' tougher, gettin' this muh'fucker
Money like it's the last days
You might also likeAyo, it's hard out here for a hustler
No matter which game you playin', it's gettin' rougher
They puttin' the squeeze on us
Times is gettin' tougher, gettin' this muh'fucker
Money like it's the last days

Look, my mouth dry, stomach all hurt and I need this
Y'all bellies got fat, while I was jailin', I need this
Rap music is my her-on, my bogey
My sex, fuck that bitch, come here, I'm horny
Long strokes of my pen, I get it in
Without this, I would be bummy and stinkin'
Niggas wanna shoot me down, while I'm flyin' high
I cry a little PÃ©rignon tear for you guys
'Cause I understand ya pain, yeah I was once there
Pockets all broke'll make a nigga not care
I swear, I'm just on that next level of problems
Millionaire problems, the Royce or the Martin
I'm tryin' to figure this out, there gotta be a way
To have it all, still show my niggas in the cage
That there's one life, one love, one Mobb Deep gang
Times hard, I go harder in the paint...

Ayo, it's hard out here for a hustler
No matter which game you playin', it's gettin' rougher
They puttin' the squeeze on us
Times is gettin' tougher, gettin' this muh'fucker
Money like it's the last days
Ayo, it's hard out here for a hustler
No matter which game you playin', it's gettin' rougher
They puttin' the squeeze on us
Times is gettin' tougher, gettin' this muh'fucker
Money like it's the last daysEmbed
