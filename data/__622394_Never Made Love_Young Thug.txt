Umm (Never made love, never made love)
I'm sorry, you know that
I can't even explain it 'cause I'm wrong (Never made love, never made love, ayy)
So, ahem

She caught me creepin' with my old ho
She ran up like "yeah, yeah," I was like "no, no"
My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong, though
Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch
And it was her, she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent
She had the same exact face as my brother's nurse
And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it's worth

So I never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love (Never made)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never ever ever ever made love
Never made love, never made love
I ain't never made love (Ayy)

Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
When she open up, I'ma taste her (Try)
X out everyone and then erase her (Ayy)
I'm sorry for lyin' to your face, yeah (Sorry)
I'ma marry her and I bouquet her (Ayy)
Leavin' out the house drunk and she stumbles (Woah)
Be all on her mind, she can't even think of (Drunk)
She walkin' off, I look at her like cable (Ayy)
Boolin' with your partners at a party, ayy (Fuckin' round)
They don't even know what the fuck love means, ayy (They gon' fuck with me)
She say she never waste time on me (Ahh)
Yeah that came out of your jaws, baby (I heard it)
I heard it, even though I suck it 'til she lockin' up (Ayy)
Lockin' up like handcuffs
Give me all your time, every day (Woo)
Girl how come we never made love at your spot? (Why?)
Cause you ain't want your other rich homie be findin' out (Ayy)
She want it so I spent twelve thousand on a lil' rug (Racks)
I'm just tryna tell you, ain't tryna make you look low
You might also like
Even though you've never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love, never made love (Ayy)
She never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never ever ever (Never made love, ayy)
She never made love, never made love
Never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made
Never felt love, never felt love
Never made love, never made love, never made love

Well I'ma change that there
I just might wake up and buy you everything rare (Woo)
I'm not cheatin' on you no more, I don't care (Swear to God)
You wanna be with me, I'ma roll the dice now (Roll it)
Roll it, I buy a Rollie, I'ma buy that bitch a Rollie (Roll it)
That pack keep rollin', I'ma buy that bitch some more shit
'Cause I fucked her sister then I fucked on all her cousins
Bitch, I'm a Blood, you know I fucked on your bousins
She smiling in your face, but tellin' me she love it (Ayy)
She like the way my pants don't sag even though they're stuffy (Racks)
She won't T.I. on me, she don't care 'bout no money (Sorry)
Hey, hey (Swear to God)
Wait, wait, don't leave (Ayy)
Hey, hey (Swear to God, baby)
Ayy, ayy, hey (I love you like , baby)
They trip out all the time, tellin' you I'm on some bullshit
Parallel parkin' that pussy, they like my motion (Skrrt)
Put that on my mama, now Stunna know that I'm loaded (Loaded)
When my partner see it he stand up like he on Folgers (Woo)
I ain't like that shit so I hit him right in his shit
Then I told him, "Don't ever do that shit there again" (What?)
How you feel if I see your ho and fuck on the kid? (What?)
I'ma catch a body if she leave me, I'm not playin'
Yes, I said I'm the best and I put that on the red
When you make me mad I tried to get back and get some head
And I know that's wrong, but my dumbass still did it instead
Then I put the strap to my own head like boy I'm on one, woah
Then I told her don't ever do it again (Uh huh)
Every guy you look at, I'll turn him to wind (Ayy)
Yeah, then I looked up at God like yeah

Then I realized I'd never made love, never made love (Woo)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never ever made love
I swear to God I never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Hey, never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
