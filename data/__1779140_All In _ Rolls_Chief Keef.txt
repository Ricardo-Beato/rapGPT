Skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
All in, all in, all in (DP on the beat)
Skrrt

All in, all in
If you tossing money, I am all in (Gang)
Heard you want a line, nigga, fall in (Gang, gang)
I just left your bitch and I got all in (Bang, bang)
All in (Bang, bang), all in (Bang, bang)
Your bitch on me 'cause I keep balling
And I swear that this money keep calling
But long as it keep coming, I am all in (I'm in)
All in

Just got some guns and some pounds in (Yeah, yeah)
Never wanna hear all in (Yeah, yeah)
That MAC and TEC be cousins
They be busting, they cussing
Toolie out, I'm like fuck it (Fuck it)
Unless the police come, I won't tuck it for nothing (For nothing)
Heard niggas on that fuck shit (That fuck shit)
Click-clack, this nina ready to fuck shit (Fuck shit)
Catch up, no DJ Mustard (Mustard)
I wouldn't get no money if I ain't love it (Love it)
Money my discussion (My discussion)
You ain't discussing money, I ain't talkin' (I ain't talkin')
You might also like
All in, all in (All in)
If you tossing money, I am all in (All in)
Heard you want a line, nigga, fall in (Gang, gang)
I just left your bitch and I got all in (All in)
All in (All in), all in (All in)
Your bitch on me 'cause I keep balling (I keep balling)
And I swear that this money keep calling (Keep calling)
But long as it keep coming, I am all in (I am all in)
All in

Met your bitch and I was all in that thang (All in that motherfuckin' thang)
When I pull up, I went all in the bank (All in the motherfuckin' bank)
Traphouse, flats all in that thang (Two-piece all up in that thang)
Naw, boy, you can't hang (Nigga, you can't hang)
You ain't with the Glo Gang ('Cause you ain't with the gang gang)
I be spitting propane (I be spitting dope, nigga)
It's something you already know, man (It's something you already know, nigga)
I be ballin', I be wildin', VIP and fuck a line in
I be all up in the club, standing all over the couches
And I do this shit for Blood, Henny all over the couches (Blood Money)
If you talking 'bout that money, I swear I am 'bout you (For money)

All in, all in (All in)
If you tossing money, I am all in (I am all in)
Heard you want a line, nigga, fall in (Gang, gang)
I just left your bitch and I got all in (I was all in)
All in, all in (Ayy)
Your bitch on me 'cause I keep balling (Swish, swish)
And I swear that this money keep calling (Ring, ring, ring, DP on the beat)
But long as it keep coming, I am all in (Bang, bang)
All in
That's it


DP Beats
Ayy (Ayy, DP), ayy
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I'm 'bout motherfuckin' rolls

I'm 'bout my motherfucking rolls
Since 2010 (Glo Gang shit, Glo Gang)
I was sellin' dope (I got all the hoes)
Out my grandma front door, nigga (I got all the hoes)
Country knockin' (All the hoes, all the hoes)
Contact, climb through the back of the burglar bars (Bang, bang)
I ran out the crib on they ass, nigga (DP on the beat)
And I got indicted, I don't give no fuck, ayy (Bee)

I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes (All the hoes)
I got all the rolls, I be on the road (On the road)
I can count this money with my eyes closed (My eyes closed)
Ride by you, bye-bye, ho (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
'Cause I'm 'bout my rolls, bitch, I'm 'bout my rolls
You ain't talking rolls, then I gotta go (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
I thought you know (I thought you motherfuckin' know)
Baby, I am 'bout my rolls (Bitch)
I'm 'bout my pesos, my rolls
You ain't talking pesos, I shoot you in your nose and your mouth
'Cause you wasn't talking right
Better bring that money to the light, bitch nigga
'Cause I'm a rich nigga, ayy
For a show, I need six figures
You talking thirty bands, I'ma take it
But your show, I might not make it, ayy
Hoes think I am Jamaican
Rastafari dreads, they be shaking
Pull up on they block, nigga, shake it
Click-clack, bitch, ning ding finna get baking, ayy
Bitch, I eat bacon
But I don't fuck with pigs, see them, then I shake it
They gon' try to strip me naked
Take me to the cell, I can take it
It ain't nothing, ayy
Nigga try me, then it's bustin', 10-10
Call up 10-10, code ten
'Cause that ning ding be my twin, twin
That's the only friend I got, other than guap
My mama told me trust no one
Snakes in the grass, one of 'em gon' bite, ayy, ayy

I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes (All the hoes, hoes)
I got all the rolls, I be on the road (On the road, bee)
I can count this money with my eyes closed (My eyes closed, bee)
Ride by you, bye-bye, ho (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
'Cause I'm 'bout my rolls, bitch, I'm 'bout my rolls ('Bout my rolls)
You ain't talking rolls, then I gotta go (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
I thought you know (I thought you motherfuckin' know)
Baby, I am 'bout my rolls (Bitch)

I thought you motherfuckin' know
Pull up, bitch, I'm 'bout my rolls
You ain't talking rolls, then we 'bout to blow
At your motherfuckin' skull and your fuckin' nose
And your teeth, nigga
We gon' make your dumb ass bleed, nigga, ayy, ayy
Thirty in this ning ding, nigga, ayy
It's a drill, bitch, ding ding, nigga6Embed
