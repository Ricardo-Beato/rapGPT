49 ContributorsScottie Lyrics
Cool N Dre, this is

It's so simple that it's complicated (Complicated), uh
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em (When you made 'em), yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin' (I ain't chasin')
'Cause only in still water we can see our faces (See our faces)
Real shit, I told my nigga

"Boy, you better watch them hoes when you sleepin'
Nigga, them dog-ass hoes be creepin'"
I got a few Ms put up for safe keepin'
Long hair, don't care like I was raised in a teepee
Nigga, gun hurt, Nina said she 'bout to go streakin'
Niggas 'bout to go to missin', niggas 'bout to go to deacons
Niggas 'bout to get high as airmen from Tuskegee
Niggas blind to the fact 'cause they don't wan' see me
Niggas don't want talk, niggas don't want reason
Niggas don't want peace, niggas don't know the meanin'
Nigga said, "You're a bitch, nigga," bitch European
Nigga, we Herculean, nigga, skate, surf, or skiin'
Nigga really overseeing, y'all niggas sight seein'
Tomorrow is what a nigga ain't guaranteein'
New Orleans had a sheriff by the name of Harry Lee
And when he died, niggas shouted out, "Tha-thank you, Jesus"
Cruising down the street and I ain't Caribbean
Ain't terrified and I ain't never been
Sippin' H-Town, lookin' like Jeremy Lin
I'm movin' slower than a fuckin' Maryland terrapin
I ain't got time, patience very thin
I will fuck a nigga bride on the day she marry him
I'm a bad Samaritan, I'm a black American
Got white like a fuckin' Aryan, and
You might also like
I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no

Now beam me up Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With "Stop snitchin'" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the '90s, my dope ain't consignment
My coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
These hoes be relying, these niggas be lying
These niggas who snitchin' we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifyin', you know desert's quiet
So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizin'
You cuddle too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie, "I know where to find him"
He said, "You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor"
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a Chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
Call me the greatest or call me retired
It's up in the air like carbon monoxide
Bitch, we in the buildin', we started from outside
My dick is my third eye and she call it cockeyed
My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360
She get so wet, it can be sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F you, with a sick dick
Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick
Playin' my role, even with a thick script
Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip
Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift
Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip
Anything can happen, put the whats with the ifs
But what's with the ifs?
Just pass that weed like flyin' colors
Light green, teal, turquoise, purple
When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk
I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal
Papa was a rolling stone, worthless
Mama said I wasn't on purpose
That's why I got a ice box where
My heart used to be in this cold world
I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster
I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, GRAMMYs, Oscars
Knock you off your fuckin' high horse
Like a cold-blooded jouster, fightin' for my life
Praying to the ringside announcer
It's so simple that it's complicated (Complicated), yeah
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em (When you made 'em), yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin' (I ain't chasin')
'Cause only in still water's when we see our faces (See our faces)
Real shit, tell 'em

I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need that chopper with me
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper with me
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
Now beam me up Scotty (Now beam me up Scotty)12Embed
