19 ContributorsQueens, NY Lyrics
I string em along on some acoustic guitar shit
Tell 'em park it in front of Neiman Marcus
I need that, I need that
Said we gon chill, where the weed at, the weed at?
Said you got a Spider, where them keys at? Them keys at?
Living on 'em, shitted on 'em, taunt ya
I'm hotter than the sauna,  is under
Calm yourself before you get dealt with
Had the medics working on your pelvis
DOA there's nothing left to say
Went down like an hourglass
Paris 1st class regardless
Fake bitches, not responsive
Me, I'm in the streets rocking a piece, that's retarded
In the diamond district with Jacob
Making you, you little clones wanna save up

We come from Queens where we are taught to handle
Beef on our own
You call up cops, we get it poppin'
We be out with the chrome

Where Brooklyn at? Where Bronx at? Where Harlem at?
Where Statan at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Bronx at? Where Harlem at?
Where Yonkers at?

All my men is caped up, stingy with the snatch
'Cause niggas get too attached (Word)
Sleep with the ratchet under the mattress
Natural: my cat got a 5 o'clock shadow
It don't matter 'cause niggas is still badder
You chicks is getting fucked
I'm on top, that's how I bop
Luxury every stop
Eat it or beat it, you should already know my friend
You're not needed: next nigga, remix
Word to everything with on G shit
Fuck with me, give me a reason
Feel something hot, change the whole season
For the greater good, make you face your demons
It's the loca, caramel mocha
Bitches is on their sofa, I'm taking over
You now rocking with the best mama
Bombshell hood hottie in the egg-shell Bughatti, oh!

We come from Queens where we are taught to handle
Beef on our own
You call up cops, we get it poppin'
We be out with the chrome
Where Brooklyn at? Where Bronx at? Where Harlem at?
Where Statan at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Bronx at? Where Harlem at?
Where Yonkers at?

Queens will ease on 'em, squeeze on 'em
We'll dump the .223's on 'em
Breeze on 'em, lit the trees on 'em
In the bandanna, make em think it's gang-related
We on that gritty shit, the city shit
New York New York
You come through on some pretty shit
Get outlined in chalk
I get busy, I get busy, I'm strapped now
I'm tryna say I want you motherfuckers to act out
I had that ass sprint towards the door when I back out
Don't do it, don't you do it, don't you do it
Don't make me step to you
Holy moly, rolly icy oyster perpetual
Diamonds blinking like hey, just take a look at it
I'm a regular bad man, they say I'm a mad man
Fuck a mask and gloves, I lay it on bare hands
We come from a war zone, them South side streets
Where anything and everything gets gunned to eat
We come from Queens where we are taught to handle
Beef on our own
You call up cops, we get it poppin'
We be out with the chrome

Where Brooklyn at? Where Bronx at? Where Harlem at?
Where Statan at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Bronx at? Where Harlem at?
Where Yonkers at?

We come from Queens where we are taught to handle
Beef on our own5Embed
