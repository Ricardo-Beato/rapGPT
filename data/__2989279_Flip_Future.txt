31 ContributorsFlip Lyrics
If you gang, gang, gang, that's what's up with me
Freebandz
Fire Marshall

Drove it too long, time to swap it out
We got papers, flip my stones, it ain't no clouds
Snatch a brand new Range Rover with the captain seats
And I keep a MAC on me like I'm Master P
Captain seats in my Maybach, in my Range Rover
Then I flip, flip, flip, flip, game over (Game over)
Captain seats in the Maybach, in the Range Rover
Then I flip, flip, flip, flip, game over (Game over)

2017 with the captains (Flip)
The price too high, you must be cappin' (Flip)
All these Franklins got me trappin' (Flip, flip)
Sippin' on Screw, I'm very active (Flip, flip)
A half a milli', got matted
Your main bitch got batted
Got a clear view, no static
Got some VVS on my fabrics
Chanel drapes one of one
I pay the rates to the Lord
Bitch nigga, I'm a boss
Had the mayor with me, I'm a star
You might also like
Drove it too long, time to swap it out
We got papers, flip my stones, it ain't no clouds
Snatch a brand new Range Rover with the captain seats
And I keep a MAC on me like I'm Master P
Captain seats in my Maybach, in my Range Rover
Then I flip, flip, flip, flip, game over (Game over)
Captain seats in the Maybach, in the Range Rover
Then I flip, flip, flip, flip, game over (Game over)

I'm gone past the moon, what you tellin' me?
That nigga's a goon, what you tellin' me?
The bitch in the room, what you tellin' me?
I'm hotter than the sun, what you tellin' me?
These niggas my sons, what you tellin' me?
They eat up my crumbs, what you tellin' me?
Your brother a bum, what you tellin' me?
Straight out the slums, what you tellin' me?
I came out the mud, I'm stashin' the drugs
Gotta bring out the tub of Ace
I was never in love with the Wraith
Got a new Panamera on the way
Went to Pluto, beyond with my cape
Can't run when the drum in your face
I'm the mothafuckin' don, why you hatin'?
Drove it too long, time to swap it out
We got papers, flip my stones, it ain't no clouds
Snatch a brand new Range Rover with the captain seats
And I keep a MAC on me like I'm Master P
Captain seats in my Maybach, in my Range Rover
Then I flip, flip, flip, flip, game over (Game over)
Captain seats in the Maybach, in the Range Rover
Then I flip, flip, flip, flip, game over (Game over)

Flip, flip, flip, flip
Flip, flip, flip, flip
Flip, flip, flip, flip
Flip, flip, flip, flip
