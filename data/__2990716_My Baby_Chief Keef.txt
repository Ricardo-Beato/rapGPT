I'm a dog and it's true, baby
Can we call this here a truce, baby?
And you know I got the juice, baby
And you see me in this coupe, baby
You say you off at 2, baby
What you gon' let me do baby?
I'm smokin' on this took, baby
There is no one like you, baby
My baby is the dope

I bet you ain't smoking on the strongest shit right now (My baby is the dope)
I bet you smoking blow can't tell me what you feel right now (My baby is the dope)
I bet you smoking reggie acting like it's kill right now (My baby is the dope)
I just flamed up the loud so I can't even hear right now (My baby is the dope)
My shorties come through sparking out the cut right here right now (My baby is the dope)
We see you holding on the loud weed like it's some fire (My baby is the dope)
You trying to smoke what I smoke, you take a hit and die (My baby is the dope)
I love this shit so much I might just take a hit then cry (My baby is the dope)
I'll be done with this blunt in 4, take your bitch in 5 (My baby is the dope)
Truck on 26's, make me skip to 9 (My baby is the dope)
My motherfuckin' riches, make me skip the line (My baby is the dope)
I swear that the dope the only thing that get me high (My baby is the dope)

I'm a dog and that's true, baby
Can we call this here a truce, baby?
And you know I got the juice, baby
And you see me in this coupe, baby
You say you off at 2, baby
What you gon' let me do baby?
I'm smokin' on this took, baby
There is no one like you, baby
My baby is the dope

I got pints on pints, blunts on blunts (My baby is the dope)
I got swag on swag, stunts on stunts (My baby is the dope)
Troopers pulled us over, we smelled like blunts (My baby is the dope)
I was full off dope, that's my lunch (My baby is the dope)
You need to see this big ass blunt that I'm smokin' on (My baby is the dope)
This all for me partner (My baby is the dope)
You should see this big ass blunt that I'm chokin' on (My baby is the dope)
I'ma need a doctor (My baby is the dope)
I just flamed it up, ain't no changing up (My baby is the dope)
You see how high I am, then why you bring it up? (My baby is the dope)
You know what's in my cup, my cup filled with mud (My baby is the dope)
To those who I influence, just say no to drugs (My baby is the dope)

I'm a dog and that's true, baby
Can we call this here a truce, baby?
And you know I got the juice, baby
And you see me in this coupe, baby
You say you off at 2, baby
What you gon' let me do baby?
I'm smokin' on this took, baby
There is no one like you, baby
My baby is the dope8Embed
