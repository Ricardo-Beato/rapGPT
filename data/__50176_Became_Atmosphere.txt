39 ContributorsBecame Lyrics
It's no surprise I overslept
Put my boots on and climbed out my tent
I didn't see you, assumed you were sleeping
Immediately start a fire cause it's freezing
I can't believe we went camping in the cold
I'm in the wilderness standing in some snow
A late start, but we can still catch up
You need to wake up, we should eat and then pack up

That's when I noticed your foot prints
The snow's fresh and those have been put since
What, you're already up making the rounds?
So where you at now, you laid back down?
The breeze came and it stalled out the flame
While I went to your tent and called out your name
You didn't answer, so I opened up the flap
It's just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack

I'm looking at your tracks and You took a couple laps
Around the campground and hoofed down the path
I figure you'll return, no concern
I'mma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn
The wind is blowing strong, minutes rolling on
It's going on at least a half an hour you've been gone
You might also like
It ain't right, start the paranoia
I left the camp site to go and search for ya
I read the trail your feet made
Each step was deliberately placed
It looks like you know where it leads
But I see nothing but leafless frozen trees
About a quarter mile into the course
Another set of tracks appeared next to yours
From the north it came out of the thick woods
And those footprints belong to a big wolf

Trying to find service on my cellphone
I felt aight with my knife on my belt, though
I hope the wolf is intimidated by you
I wondered if you even knew what was behind you
Stalking ya, maybe watching ya
Waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya
Salivating', wanna take ya to the stomach
In the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick

And it gets about as bad it goes
Cause I notice there's a new set of tracks in the snow
I understood, it doesn't look good
Your fan club doubled, now you've got another wolf
And the odds are in favor of the home team
Why'd you walk off all alone, where you going?
It ain't the right time to complain, but
It feels like I'm trying to find your remains
Your foot prints grew further apart
I knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart
It means you started to run, so I did the same
Now my breaths looking like a steam engine train
Suddenly your tracks dip off of the path
And so did theirs, so my knife I grabbed
Into the forest, expect the worst
Adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves

50 yards into the woods and brush
It got so thick that it looked like dusk
The air stood serene, sober
It seemed like a good 15 degrees colder
And I'll admit: Hell yeah, I felt fear
The sound of my heart beat was all I could hear
Looking at the snow it was plain and clear
There was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared

I can't process, I don't follow
It would be easier to believe that you were swallowed
With no sign of death, no sign of struggle
No signs of blood, no signs of trouble
And the wolves never stopped
The tracks kept going and I took off
So I don't know how your story ends
But I know I'll never go into those woods again
It's not that tragic, it's not a shame
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game
I forgot to worry about what you became
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game
I forgot to worry about what you became7Embed
