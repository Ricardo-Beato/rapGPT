Holiday season
Ha ha
Huh?
Ok G
Put your motherfucking hands in the air you ghetto nigga
Oh it's holiday season nigga

Wanna see me you can find me on the block where them boys don't play
I'll be ghetto
Put your put your put your hood up in the sky like a rap way stay
I'll be ghetto

My ride is a Chariot
My bitch is a Princess
Though I live in the ghetto
Feel like it's a mansion
They throw us  in prison
Diminish our chances
I'm on a mission of madness
There's a  ghetto in Kansas
Ghetto, Nebraska
Ghetto, Alaska
Ghetto, East Africa
Ghetto, Australia
Lock up my mayor, salute my failures
It's Gucci I'm from the Ghetto
So i'm a tell ya
You might also like
Ghetto
Wanna see me you can find me on the block where them boys don't play
I'll be ghetto
Put your put your put your hood up in the sky like a rap way stay
I'll be ghetto
Yea I'll be ghetto
Yea I'll be ghetto
Yea I'll be ghetto
Yea I'm from the ghetto
I'm from the ghetto
Nigga I'm so ghetto
I'll be the ghetto
Ghetto

Remove my family
They move my Granny
My iz my Auntie
No food in pantry
Sometimes we antsy
Like antsy pantsy
No dancing fancy
Just have them wham it
I know this damage
Is hard to manage
But I need a sandwich
So I'm handing Grammy's
I was hand to handin
This ain't what's happenin
But you can't imagine
So let me take you to the
Ghetto
Wanna see me you can find me on the block where them boys don't play
I'll be ghetto
Put your put your put your hood up in the sky like a rap way stay
I'll be ghetto
Yea I'll be ghetto
Yea I'll be ghetto
Yea I'll be ghetto
Yea I'm from the ghetto
I'm from the ghetto
Nigga I'm so ghetto
I'll be the ghetto
Ghetto

Just look at me, little me
A-line, I'm on the grind
Valentine doing double time
Ask my mama, I ain't lying
Dad and I and I go for crime
Ask my brother I ain't crying
In the slammer doing double time
People think I lost my mind
2009 I double mine
? waste of time
Toeing nines they sell nines
You drop me yours I'll mail you mine
Step it up
I stack it up
I get it out
I get it up
Gucci in the ghetto
Everyday is I can't get enough
I'm Ghetto
Ghetto
Wanna see me you can find me on the block where them boys don't play
I'll be ghetto
Put your put your put your hood up in the sky like a rap way stay
I'll be ghetto
Yea I'll be ghetto
Yea I'll be ghetto
Yea I'll be ghetto
Yea I'm from the ghetto
I'm from the ghetto
Nigga I'm so ghetto
I'll be the ghetto
Ghetto

What's cracking?
This the boss of all bosses
? checking in
With the homie Coochie
Got to know the BMF really selling that street shit he dropping right nowEmbed
