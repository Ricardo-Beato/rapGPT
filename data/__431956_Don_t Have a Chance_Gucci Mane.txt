7 ContributorsDonâ€™t Have a Chance Lyrics
I killed off all the competition
Didn't get no recognition
Im steady shippin', flippin', whippin'
Cookin' caine in the kitchen
I got a couple pistol charges
But gone keep me a ratchet
I smoke two ounces everyday
I got a real bad habbit
I got to keep a teller with me
Just to count all the cabbage
Dope houses in Sunvally
Grow houses in Cali
And they say life is a bitch
But your bitch just met me
Went to sleep rich
But I woke up wealthy
I can't hang with broke niggas
Naw, thats my pet peeve
I make her go to work late
I make her get off early
I never snooze, keep a tool
Thats just how I move
On Instagram with your bitch
Damn, ain't life cruel
You might also like
Yall niggas pull up to the club
But I land on it
She got a ass so big
I dropped a band on it
She got a friend real fine
I put my mans on it
She only fuck with ballers
You don't have a chance homie
Got damn homie
Got damn homie
She only fuck with ballers
You dont have a chance homie
I got them fans on me
Hundred grand on me
She only fuck with ballers
You don't have a chance homie
Got damn homie

1017 razine, thats what I ride for
Bricksquad, I swear to gawd
Thats what I'd die for
Get money, keepin' it pushin'
Thats what I strive for
Hercules purp so strong
I paid the high for it
Fugazy stories you tellin'
Man why you lie for
If he ain't runnin' out with the work
They why you high for
Playin' games with Gucci Mane
Dun' got you tied up
Five dollars of kerosene
And now you fried up
You Took that dick with no vasaline
Why the hell you sign that
I know that you regret that decision
But can't rewind that
You gave the money, didn't get the work
You took a blind plee
East Atlanta Zone 6 Morland
That's where you find me

Yall niggas pull up to the club
But I land on it
She got a ass so big
I dropped a band on it
She got a friend real fine
I put my mans on it
She only fuck with ballers
You don't have a chance homie
Got damn homie
Got damn homie
She only fuck with ballers
You dont have a chance homie
I got them fans on me
Hundred grand on me
She only fuck with ballers
You don't have a chance homie
Got damn homie

Homegirl came with you
Damn she thirsty
Spend twenty grand so fast
It didn't hurt me
Have you countin' so many ones
Your hands hurtin'
Say she never had so much fun with one person
(But shit)
Im that nigga
She already know
So should we blame it on the pills
Or blame it on the dro
She call me poppy
Make me think I got a poppy feel
All this fuckin'
How she think I got a hocky deal

Yall niggas pull up to the club
But I land on it
She got a ass so big
I dropped a band on it
She got a friend real fine
I put my mans on it
She only fuck with ballers
You don't have a chance homie
Got damn homie
Got damn homie
She only fuck with ballers
You dont have a chance homie
I got them fans on me
Hundred grand on me
She only fuck with ballers
You don't have a chance homie
Got damn homieEmbed
