Pull up if you really with it
Pull up if you really with it
Pull up if you really with the shits
Pull up if you really with the shits
Uzi, Uzi
Wake up (If you really with the shits)
Haha, Uzi, not again
You're never gonna change
Yeah

First of all, I fuck eight bitches a day (Yeah)
How could you ever say Lil Uzi gay? (How?)
Fuck four of 'em raw, fuck four of 'em safe
Think I'm splittin' the offer for you to debate
Don't want no pussy, want oral today
Pull out your tongue and just twirl it, baby
She lick on my backwood and pearl it, baby
Diamonds so wet, like a swirly, baby
Got more than a .40, if I pulled out a TEC with my borin' shit
If I'm pourin', then you pourin' and we pourin' shit
I fuck your bitch on cam like a porno flick
I put diamonds everywhere, that more than wrist
Out late brokе, now I'm mornin' rich
Brand new foreign, now I'm floorin' it (Yeah)
Dopе head broke, no ignorin' it
You might also like
Yeah
I'ma let you know
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause I'ma keep gettin' this guap
Mula, bands, money, whatever you call it, fetti
I tell you got time to worry about me
Not only is you a fan, but you ain't gettin' no money

Flooded the face, matted the Wraith (Woo, woo)
Got a new house, unlimited space (Woo, woo)
It was just hard, now my life great (Woo, woo)
Now that lil' girl gonna do what I say
Diamond like lake, water like sink
Pocket on Brinks, pull up in tank
Pull up in coupe, who wanna race? (Skrrt)
Smokin' that gas, don't hit the brakes
Flooded the face, matted the Wraith (Woo, woo)
Got a new house, unlimited space (Woo, woo)
It was just hard, now my life great (Woo, woo)
Now that lil' girl gonna do what I say
Diamond like lake, water like sink
Pocket on Brinks, pull up in tank
Pull up in coupe, who wanna race? (Skrrt)
Smokin' that gas, don't hit the brakes
Diamond my Rollie, diamond my Patek
This an AP and the hand automatic
Whippin' that white in the kitchen, Bob Saget
Whippin' it slow, need to whip it lil' faster
I got the swag, one fashionable bastard
Rock out my jean, they tight leather, Mick Jagger
You think you fly, but your swag attract maggots
They want my sauce, because I'm a chick magnet
Hide the work in my hat and I pull out a rabbit
Romaine the lettuce, I trap out the cabbage
All of my weapons, them bitches automatic
I do not fuck with no semi-automatic
Girl, don't call my name, you know you call me daddy
I was off a Xanny, woke up like "What happened?"
All these niggas, they be lyin' and be cappin'
I just pulled up to the bank and started laughin'

Started laughin'
And stayed laughin', stayed at it
I paved at it, was brave at it
Stayed stackin', new Aston (Yeah)

Flooded the face, matted the Wraith (Woo, woo)
Got a new house, unlimited space (Woo, woo)
It was just hard, now my life great (Woo, woo)
Now that lil' girl gonna do what I say
Diamond like lake, water like sink
Pocket on Brinks, pull up in tank
Pull up in coupe, who wanna race? (Skrrt)
Smokin' that gas, don't hit the brakes
Flooded the face, matted the Wraith (Woo, woo)
Got a new house, unlimited space (Woo, woo)
It was just hard, now my life great (Woo, woo)
Now that lil' girl gonna do what I say
Diamond like lake, water like sink
Pocket on Brinks, pull up in tank
Pull up in coupe, who wanna race? (Skrrt)
Smokin' that gas, don't hit the brakes
Skrrt off, skrrt off
Skrrt off, skrrt off (Skrrt)
Skrrt off, skrrt off
Skrrt off, skrrt off
