10 ContributorsGone Lyrics
Wished I had told ooh was only one
But it's too late
Aww, it's never too late
It's too late,  never

Need this song to blow up and get plays fast
Just look at where my grandmama stay at
Graduating school, see the debt I gotta pay backing
My money looking rocky, I need some more of it ASAP
So here's the tape all a nigga fucking working on
That's why all my verses long 'cause the hurt is strong
I told 'em I was the greatest and not a word was wrong
I'm was searching for my purpose and I murdered songs
What's the verdict? Minds lurking, that's the herb I'm on
Everybody call my line with alerted tones
Rappers don't want beef, eat that sirloin
What's at stake is my fate and my verbal thrown
No pun intended, a nigga I was born a run this business
Account balance is always saying my funds are suspended
I'm tryna buy a beach invited tons of women
Dive in the water slide, ain't no fun in swimming
You should know they from exotic places
Black and white girls, man, I'm not a racist
The house so big couldn't find the basement
We tryna move up but we climb adjacent
Now presently these goals is just manifested
'Cause right now pockets looking anorexic
People hating on the grind and I can't respect it
Gotta vision for the future, damn my plans is hectic, nigga

We striving home
We striving home
We striving home

Yeah, I bring heat to winter, roll my sleeve when I enter
Blow trees eat dinner, beg, plead to a winner
Not needing a damn thang, y'all popping champagne
I start a campaign, can't stop a rampage
I go off, fasho boss, y'all so soft
I underrated and undefeated, got no loss
I'm colder than February and snow with 11 flurries
But my life's in a golden state like I'm Stephen Curry
Told momma I'm blowing up so she never worry
And to the haters that's plotting on me, be dead and buried
My second tape, I elevate, see better days
Forever paid, I'm here now y'all never stay
A real nigga, no Hilfiger, my bills bigger
The same people that chill with you will kill quicker
I seen it happen, hurricanes and FEMA laughing
A leader passing, say nothing a just feed the madness
A bleeding passion metaphors for me with rapping
Hip-hop is so dead, just clean the ashes
The sweetest fashion, man, I'm flyer than three Aladdin's
On the carpet with a Jasmine, she the baddest1Embed
