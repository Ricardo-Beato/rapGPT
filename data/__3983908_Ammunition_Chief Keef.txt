8 ContributorsAmmunition Lyrics
We did too much shit in that alley
Say she love me, whatever that mean (stop it)
The only colors I like is blue, pink and green
Think I play guitar how I'm pulling these strings
Think I play Fifa How I'm kicking with your bitch
She steady talking 'bout knocking you of the pick
"His lifestyle really ain't expensive"
Put a drum on, it be giving that ammunition

O-K, I'm re-loaded
Going down begin, call these, explosives
My gas tank over, I didn't even know it
This bitch got no miles, I didn't drove it
I don't even like them all, I don't even go there
This bitch got nothing in there, I don't blow them
Got new thots named Codie and Sonia, both got long hair
Pull the mic up outta my pants and let 'em perform there
Pull out bag of cash out the baggy bag
Whatever you know as a two, bitch, don't ask me that
Talking that military code with the gang, 10-4 copy that
Anything but late for dinner, I be that

We did too much shit in that alley
Say she love me, whatever that mean (stop it)
The only colors I like is blue, pink and green
Think I play guitar how I'm pulling these strings
Think I play Fifa How I'm kicking with your bitch
She steady talking 'bout knocking you of the pick
"His lifestyle really ain't expensive"
Put a drum on, it be giving that ammunition

Giving ammunition
Told her I love her, I gas the bitch up
Hit the duh-duh-duh that's the hiccups
Ion give three two or one fucks
Free T-slick outta the Joint
Even though folks got only one eye
Don't keep him from being on point
This hoe tinted, you don't see us in it
Gotta stay low-key gotta stay blended
Granny ain't cared if we ain't finish our spinach
The only thing she taught me was to handle my business
Big mouth don't open up, let me finish my sentences
My fucked up ways I'm tryna get rid of it
Ain't trynna get cuffed, ain't trynna get sentenced
She ain't tryna get fucked, I ain't tryna be near her
That shit that you talking I ain't trynna hear it

We did too much shit in that alley
Say she love me, whatever that mean (stop it)
The only colors I like is blue, pink and green
Think I play guitar how I'm pulling these strings
Think I play Fifa How I'm kicking with your bitch
She steady talking 'bout knocking you of the pick
"His lifestyle really ain't expensive"
Put a drum on, it be giving that ammunitionEmbed
