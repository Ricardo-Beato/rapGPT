60 ContributorsKill Her Lyrics
Tell em all what I came to do
KILL!
One word that explains the truth
REAL!
Bang out 'til your brain is loose
All your little fun filled days are through
Remember that I’m like this thanks to you

First off I’m a little bit psycho, I know
Dumb like a mentally retarded kid
I ain't got no friends, no ends to my stress
So I chill in the dark and shit
With a rifle and bomb, knife in my palm
Thinking 'bout the motherfucking lives I'mma harm
Swing at me then I'm slicing your arm
Then make you videotape me piping your mom
Ruthless!
Deceitful lies, listen up, you don’t want beef to rise
I really wanna murder Tomica Wright
I’m thinking of taking her out for a pizza slice
Then tie her ass up and then beat the life
Out her god damn skull 'til she bleeds and cries
The whole fucking time she was screaming "Why?"
Fuck you bitch, don’t be surprised!
Time after time you told me that my album would drop
It was all bullshit, then the day that it finally did
Bitch how come it flopped?
It’s Ruthless baby for sho'
 I’m tryna make me some dough
Get up off your ass to make a motherfucking marketing plan
And then maybe I'll blow
But no!
You wanna be a little bitch about it
Thought that I would never do shit about it
You made a contract with a twist around it
So I could never, ever, ever get up out it
No outlet so I'm pissed about it
I'd be really dumb if I just allowed it
Watch your back, you might get surrounded!
Bang, bang, bang you hit the ground!
Then
You might also like
ILL!
Tell 'em all what I came to do
KILL!
One word that explains the truth
REAL!
Bang out 'til your brain is loose
All your little fun filled days are through
Remember that I’m like this thanks to you

Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Kill her, kill her!
Kill her, kill her!

Listen up, don’t you ever hate me
'Cause I’ma blow up like a bomb when I’m detonated
See, you be tripping like a nigga
That's walking with his shoes untied
Best believe I’ma set it straight
Tie a rope around both of your legs, then hook 'em to 2 cars
And drive 'til they separate
Now your soul's in the sky, try to levitate
Bitch you gon' live life in a better place
You done fucked me once, you done fucked me twice!
Having me begging to drop must be nice!
Look at Eazy-E's lovely wife
Maybe the reason is my ugly eyes
I be the illest when I crush these mics
But it never occurred that I must be right
You’re the reason I say "fuck my life"
I hate you bitch, it's a must we fight!
Everybody keep on running around and asking
What do Tomica be doing with her time
I don’t really know though
I just keep it low-pro, 'cause I'm mad with the contract I signed
I was so happy at first, then it turned to a curse
How'd it happen to me?
That’s the question
I could not get the answer
So now I’m building a casket for  to rest in
Bitch you ain't nothing but a big phony
Lying to niggas, saying you signed with Sony, bitch
None of the staff up there knows me
How come my rap career's moving so slowly, bitch?
Now I got big enough buzz to destroy you and Ruthless
You can’t hold me, bitch!
I’ma fuck around and put some steel toes on
Wanna kick your ass in the ovaries, bitch!
ILL!
Tell 'em all what I came to do
KILL!
One word that explains the truth
REAL!
Bang out 'til your brain is loose
All your little fun filled days are through
Remember that I’m like this thanks to you

Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Kill her, kill her!
Kill her, kill her!18Embed
