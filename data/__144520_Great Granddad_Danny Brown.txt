13 ContributorsGreat Granddad Lyrics
Kush got a nigga brain doing somersaults
Yesterday, clothes on smelling like a boss
Dick up in her mouth so she can't talk
Pop a pill and fuck a bitch 'til she can't walk
Now I'm standing in the shower bumping drum and bass
Stepped out put some Noxzema on my face
Hit a blunt twice and sped up my heart
Nigga my loft looking like a fucking skate park
But the only thing I'm griding is the boss nigga
Going nuts in the D, coast nigga
And that's a K not a C
Nigga, Brown chief like Kansas City
American Apparel Jockey Briefs
Staring in the window thinking "Ha, I run the city!"
Renaissance like a sculpture in my backyard
Same nigga used to get F's on his report card

And I put that on great granddaddy's soul
Told me I'mma fuck bitches and always have hoes
So let me call another bitch up
A nigga tryna get his dick suck
Make my toes curl up when you licking my nuts
So when I call bitch, you better pick up
So let me call another bitch up
A nigga tryna get his dick sucked

Nah, what you think this is
I ain't paying for your cab bitch you ain't getting shit
Nah, but a mouth full of kids
Told the bitch take the bus, guess what, she did it
Blew a nigga down like the wolf did the straw house
'til I huffed and puffed and shot it in her mouth
Now I got the skinnies sagging with the dirty chucks
Thrift store tee cost a nigga four bucks
Now hipster bitches bomb a nigga like Pearl Harbor
Swear to God, I treat a ho like I ain't got a daughter
Might as well do the same to my baby momma
While all my new hoes look like Jane Fonda
Bump techno and drive little-ass Honda
Give me brain and they say they learnt from they momma
Say she bi and make out with her best friend
Love it to death, but she ain't lesbian
