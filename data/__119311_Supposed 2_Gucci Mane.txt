It’s the East Atlanta summer so y'all don’t trip
I can wrap a brick up like a Christmas gift
Me and that white girl got a relationship
I got 50 mil zanny, you can take this piff
I know you see me over there with the black four fifth
And every year I’m at least good for 4, 5 mil
Can’t buy no drink from me, you ain’t got no seal
Can’t drink no pints with you cuz you pour unreal
You pour the lean so light you gotta take 4 pills
I pour the lean so dark they still sleep still
I’m not Boosie not Webbie but I’m too damn trill
R.I.P. to Lil Phat and my homeboy Slim
I made a million dollars on the same street my boy got killed
Shotgun'll make you say Big Sean ad libs
I spent 35k, man I just left Fifth's
You want stop a duck from quackin' then cut off his bill

Man I’m still trappin' hard like I’m supposed to
Still chargin' bitches like I’m supposed to
You niggas still snitchin' like y'all supposed to
You niggas still hatin' like y'all supposed to
Trap house rollin' like I’m supposed to
Still gettin' money like I’m supposed to
You niggas still hatin' like y'all supposed to
You bitches still wait like y'all supposed to
I’m still chargin' bitches like I’m supposed to
I’m still testin' niggas like I’m supposed to
You niggas keep watchin' me like y'all supposed to
Keep on blockin' me like y'all supposed to
You might also like
Well it was told to you and it was told to me
Got a bad rich bitch whippin' post to me
And I can’t marry her cuz money married to me
And if I die right now my son inherit the cheese
Got money in my pocket like I’m supposed to
My jeans saggin' low like I’m supposed to
Your girl chose me, man damn it’s over
You keep on textin' her, you want some closure
Big Guwap, I run you over
Your bitch so fine, she’s a hell of a soldier
I thought she chose up cuz I’m extra froze up
I got so much guap, I can stick my nose up

Man I’m still trappin' hard like I’m supposed to
Still chargin' bitches like I’m supposed to
You niggas still snitchin' like y'all supposed to
You niggas still hatin' like y'all supposed to
Trap house rollin' like I’m supposed to
Still gettin' money like I’m supposed to
You niggas still hatin' like y'all supposed to
You bitches still wait like y'all supposed to
I’m still chargin' bitches like I’m supposed to
I’m still testin' niggas like I’m supposed to
You niggas keep watchin' me like y'all supposed to
Keep on blockin' me like y'all supposed toEmbed
