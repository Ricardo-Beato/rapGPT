4 ContributorsHigher Ground (Prelude) Lyrics
See, I had to make a record that
Give thanks to my Lord Savior in Jesus Christ
A lot of people are quick to criticize me
For the kind of music I sing but
See they don't change the belief
Hat I have an God, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Cause when my friends forsake me
Who's there to listen to me without complaining?
Nobody but Him, uhhh

Please don't judge me
Cause I'm not perfect (I'm not perfect)
And please don't judge me if I'm not in church on Sunday
I'm movin' (I'm movin' on)
And I'm pressin' (I'm pressin' on)
To the other way (To the other way)
Ohhhh (to, higher, ground)
I'm pressin' (I'm movin' on)
I'm movin' (I'm pressin' on, yea)
Tooooo (to the other way)
(to, higher, ground)You might also likeEmbed
