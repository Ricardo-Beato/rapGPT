21 ContributorsSeismic Waves Lyrics
Armageddon started, I guess it wasn't that hard to miss
It didn't trip the alarm on your hybrid
Carbon footprint, the darts are rigged
And I'm a big fan of carbs and the artist Prince
There's a marginal risk that your cards won't hit
It's like tryna borrow a barbecue rib from a starving kid
Be thankful if your stars are lit
Or you might get caught between the Charmin and shit
The armor fits to stay outta harm's grip
But Karma's a bitch so when your heartbeat quits
Consider all the death you've invested with
The shoes, the booze, the phone that you textin' with
Disrespecting gets Second Amendment-ed
But the species still seem to be trendin'
From the friend zone all the way to the Kremlin
The devil give a fuck about a flag or an emblem
Things ain't been the same since Trayvon, shit
Things ain't been the same since Reagan, wait
Ain't a single thing change from the days
When the gods went crazy and broke the languages
You might also likeWe trying to make these payments
Ain't got the privilege to exhibit the patience
Gone next week, so tonight we lie with no lives to save
Seismic waves

I should jump back and kiss myself
But I've been working on learning to resist myself
I used to think criticism was the definition
Fish swimmin' up a river full of pessimism
I wanna catch one bare-handed
Clean it, cook it, and feed it to Lazarus
All around the planet's the same as Minneapolis
Everybody looking for a little love and happiness
I don't romanticize the rain
And those drugs only hide the pain
Turn up the temperature, high as a plane with non-sequiturs
The tired be trained
And you keep Christoper Walken with the shit that you're talkin'
You can't take it with if it don't fit in your coffin
As a kid, I didn't give it much thought then
Just wanted a mouth full of nipple and a Zippo in my zipper pocket
I remember when the whole world stank like an ashtray; yeah
The good ol' days
I wanna laugh when somebody say 'The Good Ol' Days'
But they was good 'cause we did learn to look both ways
Across a road way like everything'll be okay
Before we go the fuck away like a snowflake
Gone next week but tonight I'm tryna reach those seismic
Climb those seismic waves

I don't need another reason
'Cause I'm leaving with you, with you
I don't need another reason
'Cause I'm sleeping with you, with you
I don't need another reason
'Cause I'm leaving with you, with you
I don't need another reason
'Cause I'm sleeping with you, with you
I don't need another reason
'Cause I'm leaving with you, with you
(I don't need another reason)3Embed
