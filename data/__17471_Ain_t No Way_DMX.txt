27 ContributorsAinâ€™t No Way Lyrics
Come on, huh, it's almost over
Uh
Swizz Beatz (Uh, uh)
Nigga, Ride or Die (Uh, uh, uh)
DMX, what, what? (Uh, uh, uh)

Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas just don't know
Where niggas is about to go, oh-no, oh-no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way ya niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo' mind
I don't know why

Now, what the fuck is you niggas pressin' me for? (Uh)
I saw more ass than a ho and you stressin' the raw
If I was testin' your jaw, maybe then you would respect me
But you can't respect me 'cause you don't even know me nigga, check me (Come on)
I'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin'
Red dot from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin' (Uh-uh)
But bad decisions lead to last decisions (What?)
Fast collision, now yo' ass is missin' (What?)
Take it over there, now you bring it back to the streets (Uh-huh)
Have you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?
Let me break it down for you, he's about to attack you
Still standin' here, faggot? You must want me to smack you
You ain't been there or done that, (What?)
Fuck is y'all niggas tellin' me?
The only nigga, walkin' the streets with four felonies (Come on)
But peep this, I see shit is hard, niggas is strugglin' (Uh-huh)
So leave rap alone for a little while, go back to hustlin' (Woo)
You might also like
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas just don't know
Where niggas is about to go, oh-no, oh-no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way ya niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo' mind
I don't know why

Give it to niggas just how they give it to, me (Uh)
Hit 'em in a rhyme because I'm an MC (Uh)
Been a lot of places, most niggas won't, see (Uh)
That's why I'm at a level that y'all niggas won't, be (Uh)
Let your man hold somethin' now he want, more (Uh)
You ain't no fuckin killer, what was the front, for?
It was a time when the world was at your front, door (Uh)
Now they change places (Why?), niggas want, raw
Niggas laughed at me and was mad at me (Uh-huh)
'Cause the way life was goin', had to be a, tragedy (Come on)
After me, it's over, I'ma take the whole verse
I try'd to keep it real, that's why I let y'all niggas go first (True, true)
But you looked a gift horse right in the mouth (Uh-huh)
Didn't appreciate what you got, when you got it (Come on)
So if I see it, I'ma dot it (What?), where to hide it?
You gotta car, better drive it
The fuck up outta here
And hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it (Come on)
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas just don't know
Where niggas is about to go, oh-no, oh-no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way ya niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo' mind
I don't know why

Niggas don't know, so I gotta flip
It seems they've forgotten how dark it could get
Bark like a Pit (Uh-huh), scratch when I hit  (Uh-huh)
We both know you pussy but you stay talkin' shit (Woo)
What I'ma have to do dawg? Run up in your mess (Uh-huh)
Catch you while you comfortable, put one up in your chest  (Uh-huh)
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, just lost tomorrow (Come on)
I'ma go platinum (Nah), you gots to be kiddin', why? (What?)
Make it double platinum (Uh), no bullshittin' (Come on)
And I'ma stay flippin' flows, rippin' shows (Uh)
Strippin' hoes, gettin' dough, lettin' go (What?)
And niggas know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is, the rest is or might as well be helpless (Uh)
I'm reckless, 'cause when I wreck shit
I might snatch a nigga's necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast (Come on!)
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas just don't know
Where niggas is about to go, oh-no, oh-no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way ya niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo' mind
I don't know why
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas just don't know
Where niggas is about to go, oh-no, oh-no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
(Ayo)
Ain't no way ya niggas wanna stop mine
(Ya boy D is back to support my shit with this one, dawg)
Ya niggas must be out yo' mind
(For real)
I don't know why

Real mechanical, baby

Shit is hot

Hot to def, Swizz Beatz, Ruff Ryders
