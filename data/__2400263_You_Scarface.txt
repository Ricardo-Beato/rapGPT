3 ContributorsYou Lyrics
I been there, done that, grew from my fuck ups
A hard head make a nigga soft ass tougher
My momma used to say that one day I'd suffer
If I ain't tighten up and get my shit right, trust her
I'm seventeen out here living the life
And I ain't never coming back home, you giving advice
To a nigga don't need it, I want my freedom
To hang on the corners running from the policemen
If I knew then what I know right now, I would have sat my stupid ass back down
I wouldn't listen
Cuz what she told me in the end came true
What you do to me your kids gon' do, times two
Forgive me momma I ain't mean no harm
But let her tell it, I ain't seen no storm. It's just beginning
But in a minute I'll be waving the flag cuz I don't think that I can take all that

Me and my mother are like sister and brother
She said "Son I've done things I'm ashamed of, but I had to do"
I've lived longer and secrets made me stronger
And you wonder how I already knew
It's cause I'm already you

I remember walking home from a party we had shut down fighting
They came from another neighorhood so we ain't liking it
The beatdown started from the inside, wiped them
From one side to the other side like Tyson
We heard gun shots and ran like lightning
Heart beat way too fast, I'm frightened
That's when I realized that niggas pack guns too
And not afraid to shoot a motherfucker if he had to
We was some young dudes, living life wreckless
Drinking MD, vandalizing shit, restless
We went from stealing hotshots getting sessted
To kick those burglaries, Warren got arrested
That's when them dip had us thinking we was bad man
When Eric B. said to "clap your hands''
I'm just imagining the shit I did
If what I've done is goin' affect my kids
Shit
You might also like
Me and my mother are like sister and brother
She said "Son I've done things I'm ashamed of, but I had to do"
I've lived longer and secrets made me stronger
And you wonder how I already knew
It's cuz I'm already you

I seen myself where my mom was
My mom like my grandmom, my kids like I am
Every day is like a standoff
Don't fuck up like I fucked up
You may not be as lucky, I'm a rare case
Coulda went the other way, trust me
Just do your best and I ain't mad if you miss it
You are gifted, it's up to you to make the best decision
Cause one day I'll be leaving this game and y'all have to carry on my name
