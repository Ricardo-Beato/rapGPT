Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah
No reason to stop, ah
That shit just flowin' like water
Let it float
Bruce Lee said, "Be like water, flow like water"
Just coast
Don't even think about that
Hip-Hop's back

Esco, they know over 808's or fatal over samples
I go yayo, crack music like the Ye song plugged in
Jumper cables, trap bumpin' like prenatal
'70s I played with Play-Doh, all I see a bunch of Fredos

Godfather, they on payroll, they on go, when I say so
Not to kill, not  a halo
They gon' build, plant tomatoes in the field
Not O.J., white truck negotiator on the phone
Talkin' paper, office hours all day though
I'm from thе hood that started the YERRR (YERRR)
Go and check and do your rеsearch, I started the surge
That big necklace shit
After the '80s, after Rakim, I resurrected it
Chest is lit, freezin', I'm polar vortexin' it
Got it, quiz me, am I gonna step from the business? (Uh-huh)
A lot of fillings in this game like I just left the dentist (Sheesh)
Without a numbin' needle
I feed the people 'cause I love the people
Two series at once, yeah, let's run the sequel
You might also like
If I really gotta dumb it down for some of y'all
That's that Magic and KD at the same time
Not Dumber or Dumber
This ain't a Dumb or Dumber sequel
Jeff Daniels, Jim Carrey's my mans (Yeah)
But here's the plan

Multitasker
I don't need an OG pass
See my trajectory is everlastin' like Curtis Jackson
Hit 105 and did a crazy tirade
I'm surprised that I acted that way
A baby MAC-10, on my yak shit
Carhartt in the cold
Don't get confused or used or let them bother your soul
Rap what I live, I sleep good, I have no vendettas
We the reason you spell "NY" with capital letters, listen
And for those who want my position
You gotta step inside a time machine, come back with a vengeance
You should go study my analytics
I shouted people on verses that ain't deserve it
When it's turf shit, I stand on business
Shout to the ones at home, I gave passes
Could've been a lot of graves full of caskets
Damn, I'm a good guy
For that I think I'm blessed more
All these Fredos could've been added to the death score
There'll be second line dancin' on St. Charles Street
New Orleans band was jammin', playin' a raw beat
They gon' miss him, sad, they say they stopped his heartbeat
Like his arteries clogged from feastin' on some hog meat (Haha)
Innocent victim
Stick 'em, get 'em, book 'em
Good you got 'em, glad you took 'em
Black and wasn't lookin', headshot
Drill shit up the pole, peel shit, .40 Glock
Kill switch, run, bitch, you still hit
Ratpack 'em, jump 'em, gun butt 'em, lump 'em
He fight back, slump him
This shit ain't 'bout nothin'
You saw it but you ain't seen shit
This is Queens shit
No ifs, ands or buts in between shit

It's 50, nigga
You already know how I get when I get on my bullshit (Ha, haha)
Niggas tweakin' and geekin' (Huh, huh)
Southside, nigga, QB nigga, yeah
Son, what we gon' do? Where Jungle at?
What we gon' do?
We stayin' in here or we goin' out?
Shit, we should go out, we rich as a motherfucka

Esco, they know over 808's or fatal over samples
I go yayo, crack music like the Ye song plugged in (Let's go)
Jumper cables, trap bumpin' like prenatal
'70s I played with Play-Doh, all I see a bunch of Fredos
All I see a bunch of Fredos
All I see a bunch of Fredos, all I—
All I see is a bunch of Fredos, ha (G, G, G, G)
Ha, ayo Fif', I might put my next album out on G-Unit
You let 'em slap you around out here?
You can't let 'em slap you around out here, it's bad for the family
They put a hand on you, you put two on them
Honor
Fuckin' Fredos
One thing I hate is a fuckin' Fredo
It's bad for the family4Embed
