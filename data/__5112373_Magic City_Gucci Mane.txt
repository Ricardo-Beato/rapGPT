10 ContributorsMagic City Lyrics
Uh
Guap

They say Magic City super lit, so I pulled up in front of it
Bitches on my summer drip and I just brought out some of it
When they see all these racks I'm orderin', they get so disorderly (Ching, ching)
My new AP so watery, it make her pussy watery (Wow)
I told her, "Pick a chick, pretty and thick"
She wanna see in front of me (Oh, yeah)
Exotic whips, designer drip, I think the feds recordin' me
When they see all them racks I'm orderin', they get so disorderly
When they see all these racks we orderin', pussy start gettin' watery (Wop)

I'm like, "Nah, nah, nah, nah," I got so much money now
Couple 'round me 'fore the fucker came out (Swear, wop)
I used to pull up to Club M, smokin' on a half an ounce
Rockin' Jordans 'fore the fuckers came out (Yeah)
First I took over the South, took the golds out my mouth
I woke up with a motherfuckin' ghost in my house (Damn)
I'm a gold mouth idiot, I'm not with that silly shit (Nah)
Fuck all that articulate, my jawbone's illiterate
Money unlimited, cash, I'ma spend that shit (Woo, racks)
My diamonds be hittin' shit (Brr), bezin' out the Elliott
Multi-million dollar nigga, they know I'm a predicate
I don't think you ready yet (No), new watch, it ain't ready yet (Brr, brr)
You might also like
They say Magic City super lit (Huh?), so I pulled up in front of it (Yeah)
Bitches on my summer drip and I just brought out some of it
When they see all these racks I'm orderin', they get so disorderly (Uh)
My new AP so watery, it make her pussy watery (It's Gucci)
I told her, "Pick a chick, pretty and thick"
She wanna see in front of me (Oh, yeah)
Exotic whips, designer drip (Uh), I think the feds recordin' me
When they see all the racks I'm orderin', they get so disorderly (Okay)
I'm on the stage, she in the audience
Money keep her company

Ice froze like a blizzard (Ice)
Finesse a nigga like a mothafuckin' wizard (Uh)
"Lean Back", Fat Joe, outta sizzurp (Lean)
Choppa hit 'em both, they're together, it's a his-hers (Brrah)
Lil' ho, what's good? What's the bizz-word? (Word)
No cap when I said, "I'ma hit first" (Hit, hit)
My time, broke nigga don't deserve (Uh)
Any bitch wanted beef, ate dessert (Real)
Shoppin' and spendin', I don't got no limit (Damn)
Fuckin' him good, throw it back, I be killin' the money
He called it one hell of a feelin' (Brr)
Ayy, bruh, tell these niggas I'm grindin' like Diddy (Diddy)
Broke bitch need a payroll (Uh)
800 dollar shoes, Valentino (Damn)
Bitches be lost so they fuckin' for the cheat code (Cheat code)
Summertime drop, I'ma pop out with a peacoat (1017, brr, brr)
Freak ho got no mileage, bitch
You're my hatin' addict, bitch (Brr)
Keyshia just the baddest chick
And Asian, I'm a savage, bitch (Asian Doll)
Who said I'm not rappin' shit?
I'm harder than your daddy dick (Brrah, brrah)
Took off, I'm not average, I'm solid, Moleskin fabric
They say Magic City super lit, so I pulled up in front of it
Bitches on my summer drip and I just brought out some of it
When they see all these racks I'm orderin', they get so disorderly
My new AP so watery, it make her pussy watery
I told her, "Pick a chick, pretty and thick"
She wanna see in front of me
Exotic whips, designer drip, I think the feds recordin' me
When they see all them racks I'm orderin', they get so disorderly
I'm on the stage, she in the audience
Money keep her company (Brr)Embed
