Bert, is that you?
Ahh, an empty place, oh I love it
A perfect place to practice the exciting art of humming!
Bert?

Hum along, if you can't sing along, hum along
Hum along, if you can't sing along you hum along
Hum along, if you can't sing along, hum along
Yeah, hum along with Zev Love X

Hmm, hmm! Very interesting this thing
Coming and drumming there's hummingbirds with wings (Yeah)
And feathers of the same, so we flock much
Plus rock, so on and so such, I clutch this mic
To touch like an entire stadium
With my boys to aid me so we'll play if you pay me some
Beats sound fickle, rented Jeep sounds sickenin
To those with no soul, as I roll with my bickerin'
Bugle boy, bugle boy, toot your own horn
Frugal won't endure, as the talents was born
Minus, the John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt
His name ain't my name, cause X ain't permittin shit
I's no hypocrite, so yo, zip your lip
Z.L. be rippin, out we'll rip
No no no, shake your hip, or your rump
Forget about what I'm sayin, pump your fist to the drum and
You might also like
Hum along, if you can't sing along, hum along
Hum along, if you can't sing along, hum along
Hum along, if you can't sing along, hum along
Hum with the Birthstone Kid

You could have sworn I was a what? A Penn Station penny-begger?
I gots more songs than your neighborhood bootlegger
Swingin hard like a forty-deuce corner hooker
Cuter than Booker, a real good looker
Yeah, a brown man is gettin down and
To this funky sound and you'll check it out, Subroc's the sound man
I'm just the R&B's beats kickers kickin lingo
Til comes, my payday, if rap was soccer I'd be Pele
Scorin hard I eat no porkchops or lard
So trust in me because you, trust in God
The Lord, bet I proves, just began for this man
Cause the bills stay paid from this mic within' my hand
I'm not your average everyday cotton-pickin' or bailin' hay
Ho' trickin' brother who likes to eat chicken
Anyway, just hum along, as the drummer drums along
This I bring along, not to sing along, but just to

Hum along, if you can't sing along, hum along
Hum along, if you can't sing along, hum along
Ya hum along, if you can't sing along ya hum along
Hum with the one Subroc
Hurry hurry hurry step right up and I'll sing it
So, bring it back and forth, just to swing it
I swing it, a ring to a hum can get smooth
So I choose to rock slow to amuse
To the apex, I strides from L.I. Strong
To the car new age, to rip raw
Need no rehearse, I bust fat styles galore
Self Universal Born Ruler Cypher Cee no more, hear no more
Can no more, huh, I fear less or I guess
I toss or throw it up and when it drop I'm forced to blow it up
Give a little, take a little, grunt, or fake a little
Pause you wanna counterfeit the Kause ain't havin it
All your hopes cease, so listen closely hush
I wrote boastin' note, you can't stop the Humrush

Bow, blowin up! One nine eight, X plus
And this is how we kicks it, for eighty deca
This is for the Gods, the Gods, you don't stop, heh!1Embed
