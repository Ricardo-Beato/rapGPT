8 ContributorsWalk These Dogs Lyrics
On and off the leash, I'm a beast
Feast, on whatever I come across in the streets
The least, of my worries is if I'm gon' eat because
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS
Yeah nigga, live it how I spit it
Talk it how I walk it
Y'all niggas could get it
However it's gon' go down
X is wit' it because
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS
You guys are living FAT while everyone starve
Well imma' bring it BACK cause I'mma go hard
Fuck it, tell a nigga play the yard
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS
Gettin' down has never been an issue
I'ma bust my gun and not gon' miss you
Hate the smell of the slug burnin' the tissue
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS

Nigga bustas fueled by drugs
And it's about to get real out of hand dog
Better get your man dog
Hit 'em and leave him where niggas can't stand dog
It's you man dog!
Nigga bust up all the thugs
It's about to get real out of hand dog
Better get your man dog
Hit 'em and leave him where niggas can't stand dog
It's you man dog!
You might also like
You better come in and get him now
Better grab his arm and sit him down
Nigga leave him in his house, I'm a put him down
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!
We don't give a fuck about you
You talk real slick Homie, But we doubt you
Got slugs that a put a nigga right back out you Cause
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!
I'm right here now nigga what up
Always talkin' about how you could of, would of
But never doin' shit, cause you sweeter then sugar
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!
Go on now, I'm not the one
Kashmir 7:30 about to pop the gun
Have your mom's on the news sreamin' "Not My Son"
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!

Nigga bust up all the thugs
It's about to get real out of hand dog
Better get your man dog
Hit 'em and leave him where niggas can't stand dog
It's you man dog!
Nigga bust up all the thugs
It's about to get real out of hand dog
Better get your man dog
Hit 'em and leave him where niggas can't stand dog
It's you man dog!
Don't fuck wit' things you don't know about
I'll have a Smith & Wesson TO show him out
Take him to the desert and blow him out Cause!
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!
Right to the streets, with the heat
Until I find something to eat, so don't sleep
Fuck around, thinkin' it's sweet, til' a nigga creep cause
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!
Don't cry now, it's too late
I'ma empty ya' stomach of that shit you ate
One time in the park, make a nigga lose weight, because
WE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!
Bigga, Betta, stronga, fasta
Fuck a bitch longa if I have at to
And then I will cap her directly after

Nigga bust up all the thugs
It's about to get real out of hand dog
Better get your man dog
Hit 'em and leave him where niggas can't stand dog
It's you man dog!
Nigga bust up all the thugs
It's about to get real out of hand dog
Better get your man dog
Hit 'em and leave him where niggas can't stand dog
It's you man dog!3Embed
