Right now, sucker
Sour Hour
DJ Shef, Shef
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh, , what up?
East End Empire all day, you know
Uh, uh, uh

Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
See, I'm one of a kind
There's a brain behind all these different wonderful rhymes
And peoples livin' in the past 'cause they runnin' from time (Uh)
Seems like so long since Big Punisher died
Hope he see me when I'm lookin' up from under the sky (Yup)
I'ma tell you how it is 'cause I got nothin' to hide
And Soul Theory makes the beats that'll bump in the ride (Uh-huh)
This criminal lifestyle that I'm jumpin' inside
A mastermind, superb with both sides of his brain
Roll me up into a Swisher, start flyin' away
But ash my soul, rub the L on the side of the tray
'Cause it's hard lookin' up, like the sky when it rains (Uh-huh)
Smokin' strains that levitate me like David Blaine
I'm a player and you hatin' on my game
Say my name, 'cause this here's my destiny, child
Now all this stress is off of my chest, I can rest for a while
You might also like
Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin' so high
Got me feelin' so, feelin' so, with this blunt of my mind

And I shall not (Uh-huh), hold thy tongue
So I'ma speak 'til I fold my gums
I was told to run (Run), 'cause every day is a colder one
I wake up not knowin' if I'm old or young
I can't (Can't), find my place so I lay upon these beats (Beats)
Coverin' my pain with layers of melodic sheets (Uh-huh)
Mother Earth's a bitch, so when kingdom come
We gon' bring 'em some 'til thy will be done
And still to come is when I'm finally driven to insanity
By my family, who never seemed to be a fan of me
My knees are shakin', see, I'm not able to stand
'Cause they label a man by his paper in hand
Sittin' in a dark alley with some paper and pens
Writin', just thinkin' when this day's gon' end
What can you say to a man who can't look at himself
When the image in the mirror keeps on yellin' for help? (Uh-huh)
Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin' so high
Got me feelin' so, feelin' so (Uh), with this blunt of my mind (Yeah, I'm)

Hip-hop's child, you feel me do the touchin'
Spittin' got me smitten, no excuses for the lovin' (Uh)
I'm tryna get it written but I'm comin' up with nothin'
A couple words in each line filled with somethin', somethin', somethings (Uh-huh)
And to me, hip-hop ain't got a criminal past
It's just explosions of sounds as these syllables clash
Brain on critical mass (Yup), fuck political trash (Yup)
These politicians speakin', but it's comin' out they ass
Talkin' bout "School is cool" and "Drugs is for thugs"
Tryna push me down a path, but I shall not budge
'Cause I've been thinkin' and I think I have a hunch
Who hand the mic to get enough
While me and music makin' love
And my community ain't all about who I choose to be
This life and what it do to me, the ruined opportunities
This figurative language that I'm speakin' so fluently
Look back like a photo album, seein' who I used to be (Chyeah)
Playin' piano and I'm strummin' guitar
Can't buy myself a spaceship so I'm runnin' to Mars
Stare at death in the face, like I'm under a car (Uh-huh)
It ain't everybody hatin', but enough of you are
Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin' so high
Got me feelin' so, feelin' so, with this blunt of my mind
