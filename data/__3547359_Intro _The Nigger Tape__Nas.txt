2 ContributorsIntro (The Nigger Tape) Lyrics
INVASION!

“Watch closely. You are about to experience a ‘nigga moment.’ Webster defines the ‘nigga moment’ as a moment when ignorance overwhelms the mind of an otherwise logical Negro man.”
“What did you say, bitch nigga?”
“Die, nigga! *gunshot*”
“Brothers and sisters using the word nigga…”
“Nigga, nigga, nigga…”
“HE’S A NIGGER! HE’S A NIGGER!”
“I ain’t no nigga!”
“What kind of message are you hoping to send with— with that new album?”
“FUCK THE NIGGERS! (Oh, my God!)”
“A NIGGER, LOOK! IT’S A NIGGER!”
“How you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?”
