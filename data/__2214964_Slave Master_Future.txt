Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour up two zips, nigga, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour up two zips, nigga, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better

Brooklyn ridin' with us, got my jeweler ridin' with me
Watch us drift off this good dodie
I can't provoke, all these killers on go though (Woo)
Put it at twelve o'clock, smash up the stript
Bitch you so ashy yo' bitch use a rip
She gave me face off a pill I'm for real
Do it for niggas who here, do it for niggas who gone
Do it for Double he gone, do it for Double he gone
Do it the way that we want, do it the way that we want
Do it the way that you want
Stayin' true to this culture (Culture)
Don't get caught tryna be a vulture (Vulture)
Put a pinky ring on my pinky finger
Got some VVS's on my middle finger
Fuck you pussy niggas, all you niggas get the middle finger
I'm just kickin Trilogy

Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour up two zips, nigga, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour up two zips, nigga, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better

Got a bale on ya, tryna smoke one
Got a clean watch with no diamonds in it
Got a fish spot with that Molly in it
Got a two door coupe, four choppas in it
With a pound of Mary, I'm busy
I'm drinkin' the codeine, I feel it, I'm rollin' the dope when I feel it
I fuck with your hoe, she can get it
I stack up some chickens and get it
Gon' sell a bell in the trap
We gon' put your hood on the map
Show all them bitches you care, show all them bitches you real
I see how they watch and they imitate me
This gold AP got 'em fascinated
Ain't no fabrication, I'm on medication
Cough syrup, I'm infatuated
Got your old girl she infatuated
Call me right now if you need me
I'ma try to be there if you need me
Try my best to be there if you need me
I'm keepin' my word on everythin'
Put some Aquafina on another ring
I disguise pain when I make it rain
When I hit the club and I make it rain
When I pulled up, you know how I came
Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour up two zips, nigga, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better

Brooklyn ridin' with us, got my jeweler ridin' with me
Do it for Double he gone, do it for Double he gone
Long live A$AP Yams, long live A$AP Yams
Long live A$AP Yams, I'm on that codeine right now
Long live A$AP Yams, long live A$AP Yams
Long live A$AP Yams, I'm on that codeine right now38Embed
