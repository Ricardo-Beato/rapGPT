3 ContributorsOne Time (The World is Yours) Lyrics
He’s doing okay, I’ll go in here and check on him…
(Police radio)
Right there, right there, to your left…
Coming right back to you…
There he is…
Down down, get down, down…
Get down, get down—he’s down, he’s down…
There’s another guy in the weeds…
Next to his garage…
There he is, come on…
Come on…
