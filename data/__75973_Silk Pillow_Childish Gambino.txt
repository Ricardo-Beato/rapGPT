Centrifugal force pulling me off-course, in a horse race
Changing horses midstream, fourteenth place
On videotape surveillance playback
Sigh you lose face, disgraced, God forbid you
Fall off of the face of the Earth to chase
The black hole of what you thought it was worth today
"Don't shoot the piano player" I heard them say
It was your fault, centrifugal force, you got caught
Convict monotonous, a verdict thoughtless
As you read it out loud, at least I was being relatively honest
Standing in your office trying to speak to some anacondas
Eking solace out of the sawdust
While your doppelganger stands topless
No one notices, they got their own dramas
Drama-rama's melodramas
You draw commas on the eyes of madonnas
And wonder why you can't turn traumas into nirvanas

Don't mess your head up, still run with these young bucks
Still runnin' on jet fuel, still pimpin' on what-what
What was I thinkin'? I wasn't; What am I drinkin'? I'm buzzin'
Speakin' of weekends I used to fuck with your cousin
I used to rap about nothin', now I rap about nothin'
But that nothin' was somethin' that ain't nobody was bumpin'
See I still got it boo-boo, just a dad'll do you
Wonders if you don't wanna be under some gross dude
But most girls will do it just for a corner seat at Nobu
I bet your daughter's perfect, he say it like he know you
My daughter isn't living yet, Atwater Village idiot
Their flow's dumb, but that royalty's the silliest, now

Someone tell these niggas I ain't fuckin' 'round
Fly them all to Vegas man we hold it down
Livin' for the present, nigga we fuck futures
Sippin' on some whiskey, these bitches drinkin' Kombucha
Recession means more oppression, these niggas will shoot ya
Rio de Janeiro, these bitches lookin' like Xuxa
Talk with anacondas, at least I'm bein' honest
I'm tryin' to turn these Keke Palmers into baby mamas
Baby mama, I'm your baby, mama
Man, let your boy drown, they ain't save me, mama
They ain't save me, mama
They ain't save me, mama
Silk pillow for that new weave
Silk pillow for that new weave18Embed
