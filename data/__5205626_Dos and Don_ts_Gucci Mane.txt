3 ContributorsDos and Don’ts Lyrics
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts

It's Gucci!
There's some shit you do, and just some you don't
I'm glad I don't gotta kiss ass for anything I want
She said her ex man window shop, but that I can't
I'm in a new school 
I like my trunk in the front, that's my stunt
I drink Lean, yeah bitch I spike my own fruit punch
I bought  high jump
They call me Godzilla fingers when I roll my blunt
You in the nosebleed section, that's a don't
You  jewelry, that's a won't
These niggas grupies, they act worser than these hoes do
It's Gucci!

Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts

Hustle, that's all I do
That's all I do
Get money everyday, that's all I do
Rake it in, that's all I do
Don't fuck with pussy niggas, man I don't do it
Different city everyday, do the maI just stack it up and go, I don't keep score
I won't stop, cause I don't quit
Number 1 independent 
I made a million last month, I got paper cuts
I walked through , don't take shortcuts
How could a big man be so short?
Paper tall, it make up for

Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts

They say Gucci real rude, but his wrist cool
I'm smoking fuel on a jet, that's a 
And I got rockstar statis, how the croud move
 that's if I want to
 jewelry that's a don't do
They took your jewelry, what you gon do?
Guwop don't need insurance, he his own goon
Your house ain't bigger than my sun room
 on the mazzy with the sunroof
They say Guwop in a Bugatti, that's a must do
 spend 50 K 
They told me make your next move, be your best move
I signed Scooter and Chief Keef, now that's a chess move
It's Gucci!
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'ts
Dos and don'tsEmbed
