Uh, let me get a turkey sandwich, uh (Woo), lettuce, tomato (Bitch)

My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you?
Well, my crew too live, but I ain't Uncle Luke
And I ain't no hipster, but girl, I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome (Woo,) to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Lookin' out my monocle
I'm dodgin' obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I'm heroin 'cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fuckin' shiny, word to Mop & Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion, ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gon' be green, I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day, these losers always goin' with what's trendy
My pen game is somethin' these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion, everybody is second-string
No need to testify (Testify,) for the best is I (Best is I)
And anybody in my way gon' be left to die

I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
You might also like
I got my own stickers now, so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes, still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool, you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market, where we kickin' out the garbage
Sick bars, I’ve been a boss, so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chillin', writin' on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just 'bout who the hardest
On my own, too, fuck who's sayin' different
Every time I rhyme, I get that Punxsutawney feelin'
I’m the starter, you a fill-in
You a martyr, I’m just killin'
Gettin' harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely, girl, I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say? I suggest you hold it in, bitch

I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don't hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Yeah
