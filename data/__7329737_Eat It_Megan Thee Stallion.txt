Bitch, it's Young Tina Snow, the nastiest freak you know
(Murda on the beat so it's not nice)

Bust through the walls, break in and enter
How many licks 'til you get to the center?
How many times have I heard that a nigga a dog but scared when he play with the kitten?
How many times have I heard that somebody last long?
These niggas ain't lastin' a minute
How many times have I heard that a nigga was big but dick as small as an egg-shaker?
Legs shaking, hit it 'til the bed breakin' ('Til the bed breakin')
Best friend it, talk to it (Yeah)
What you wanna tell Megan? (What you wanna tell me?)
He say he finna keep me up (Huh?)
Yeah, nigga, we'll see (Nigga, we'll see)
I don't want just one nut (Hmm)
Daddy, I'ma need the whole tree (Ah)

Yeah, yeah
Eat it, eat it, eat it 'til I faint (Ah)
Kick you out, here's a towel, nigga, wipe your face (Your face)
Eat it, eat it 'til you break a sweat
Lick it all, give your all 'til you outta breath (Ah)
Eat it, eat it, eat it 'til I cum
Gimme some, gimme some 'til I'm goin' dumb
Gimme some, gimme some 'til I'm goin' (Uh)
Gimme some, gimme some 'til I'm goin' (Uh)
(Ah)

"Megan so this and that," whatever I do, they ain't missin' that
She doin' too much, tell her, "Ooh, relax" (Ooh, relax)
He done and you gotta be cool with that
I probably had somethin' to do with that

He hate my fuckin' guts, but he lovin' my pimpin', ah (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Eat it, eat it, eat it 'til I faint (Ah)

Eat it, eat it 'til you break a sweat
Lick it all, give your all 'til you outta breath (Ah)
Eat it, eat it, eat it 'til I cum
Gimme some, gimme some 'til I'm goin' dumb
Gimme some, gimme some 'til I'm goin' (Uh)
Gimme some, gimme some 'til I'm goin' (Uh)

Legs on the headboard, pussy in his mouth
Legs on the headboard, pussy in his mouth
Legs on the headboard, pussy in his mouth
Legs on the headboard, pussy in his mouth
