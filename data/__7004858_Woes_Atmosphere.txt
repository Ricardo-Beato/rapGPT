5 ContributorsWoes Lyrics
She said that I'm a textbook narcissist
I told her that she's toxic like carcinogens
She kicked me out the house, I said, "Karma is a bitch"
And then we made love under the stars and the wind
I must be dumb, she had a pocket full of horseshoes
Smile like orange juice, shining off my fangs
I'm trying to ascertain why everybody has to complain
Even the sunshine'll dance in the rain
You can produce and direct your critique
My skin's thick with three C's, it seem to get thicker every week
Feel free to express your speech
We squeeze diamonds from the pressure as a stress release
If you can flex that strength, then you know how it goes
We show up for each other and try to hold each other close
Both of us supposed to keep it under control
You can't love another life without a couple of woes

I know you got a couple of those
I know you got a couple of woes
Yeah, I know you got a couple of those
I'm like woah

Somebody better call an ambulance
I'd have to be sick to think we'd ever need another jam like this
And at the least, please reach out to my management
Tell them I forgot to leave the seat down in the can again
I'm sorry, I know I'm so unoriginal
Plus I'm overly critical, I'm a condescending contradiction
Slip into the victim role if it remotely fits
A shoulder full of chips, pulling luggage on my ego trip
Apparently, I'm inherently chewing on my foot
Put a judge on the cover of my book
Dad shorts in the streets, dad snores in the sheets
With an orchestra of noise from the core of my sleep
Please baby, keep me in your thoughts
I know it's gotta be almost impossible for you to water
All the flowers in my pot, I put the sour in the sauce
And act like it's not my fault, it's just a product of my flaws
If you ever had a pulse, then you know how it goes
We show up for each other and try to hold each other close
I ain't above it, it's a struggle to grow
You can't love another life without a couple of woes
You might also like
I know you got a couple of those
I know you got a couple of woes
Yeah, I know you got a couple of woesEmbed
