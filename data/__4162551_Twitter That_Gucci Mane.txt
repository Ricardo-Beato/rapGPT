Brick Squad, Brick Squad, Dirt Gang mafia
Pull up on your block, on your block, like Dracula
Brick Squad, Brick Squad, everything is Brick Squad
Verified hit squad, everything Brick Squad
Black man, black car
Black everything (Huh)
Black wife, black house
Black diamond rings (Huh)
We pull up in ten limousines, Twitter that
I lead with 1017, Twitter that (Gucci!)

Gangsters don't Twitter
Bitch I'm in the hood, nigga (Twitter that)
Plug! Twitter that, Twitter-what? (Twitter that)
Counting cars, (Twitter that)
Twitter that
Twitter this, Twitter that
Catch his ass in the hood, bet he don't Twitter that

Did you know you don't fuck around?
Did you know you don't fuck around?
Did you know you don't fuck around?
Did you know you don't fuck around?
Twitter that
Twitter this, Twitter that
Catch his ass in the hood, bet he don't Twitter that

Bitch I'm fresh as fuck, shoes match the new era
Pockets on fat, your old squad tearing
Don't you never, never ever, never ever
Act hard when you ride dick, Ciara
 on Twitter, that's y'all niggas
Get your ass chopped by a saw nigga
Bitch I am that tall nigga
Imma show you how to ball, nigga
Gangsta, where your pistol at?
Soldier, where your missels at?
Real niggas don't do subliminal, Twitter that
Lil boy, stop it, Dirt Gang my clique
Brick Squad! We the trending topic
Oh, that's your bitch? I'm busting her (Bow!)
How she learn to ride dick? 'Cause I'm fuckin' her now

Gangsters don't Twitter
Bitch I'm in the hood, nigga (Twitter that)
Plug! Twitter that, Twitter-what? (Twitter that)
Counting cars, (Twitter that)

Catch his ass in the hood, bet he don't Twitter that
Did you know you don't fuck around?
Did you know you don't fuck around?
Did you know you don't fuck around?

Twitter this, Twitter that
Catch his ass in the hood, bet he don't Twitter that

He an internet gangsta, see him can't tell 
I ain't seen a tweet since Misdemeanor Elliott
Poppin on the internet, talking this and talking that
Early in the morning, wrist game working
Tweeting ass nigga, I hear them birds chirping
Duckin' on my PO
Give you niggas songs
Turn off the radio

Gangsters don't Twitter
Bitch I'm in the hood, nigga (Twitter that)
Plug! Twitter that, Twitter-what? (Twitter that)
Counting cars, (Twitter that)

Catch his ass in the hood, bet he don't Twitter that
Did you know you don't fuck around?

Catch his ass in the hood, bet he don't Twitter thatEmbed
