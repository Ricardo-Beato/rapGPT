Girl you’ve got to know that you’ll always be my only one
The only one, the only one, the only one
‘Cause baby you’re the one
Tonight I’m taking off so I can make time
For the one, ’cause you’re the one, the only one
Baby you’re the one

Floor seats row five at the Barclays
My girl's physical she wanna see Beyoncé
Lipstick from hugging me close, it's on the collar
Tomorrow night dear, we gonna crash the Oscars
Shout-out to my L.A. jeweler for the chandelier 'round her neck
Yeah, my baby's the best
Her credit line is like RZA and 'Vines combined
She can ride off the lot at the drop of a dime
Rozay minks, matching Diors
I cop that shit overseas on tours
No makeup, when she wake up
Sweatpants and the fat ass
Boxed braids, watch where she laced up
She be in the kitchen like Patti LaBelle
With a bunch of jokes all day like Dave Chappelle
A checkbook queen who had a manager well
In the bedroom, she be doin' it and doin' it well
You might also like
Girl you’ve got to know that you’ll always be my only one
The only one, the only one, the only one
‘Cause baby you’re the one
Tonight I’m taking off so I can make time
For the one, ’cause you’re the one, the only one
Baby you’re the one

Look me in my eye and lie to me again
Tell me I'm your only lover, your best friend
Tell me that this moment we have would never end
Look me in my eye and lie to me again
She had a couch in the library
And a bed that led to a cemetery
Yeah, shorty had money to call an Audi
I was hard as a brick as she iPhone record me
Put on iCloud, let TMZ report me
Oh, what a girl, what a world she bought me
When our lips touch, she likes it rough
Bustin' like a rocket to the moon or bust
This is past fascination, it's past infatuation
This just like she was my soul aspiration
She's the type who likes sex over masturbation
And tonight, I'm gearing up full ejaculation
Like...
Girl you’ve got to know that you’ll always be my only one
The only one, the only one, the only one
‘Cause baby you’re the one
Tonight I’m taking off so I can make time
For the one, ’cause you’re the one, the only one
Baby you’re the one

You're like the early-in-the-morning spring flower that blossomed To a rich, delicate, high-pitched colorful skin tone
Acrylic—let me gorilla it
You think I'm feeling shit
But if you just shit and listen to the way that I spit
Stimulated off the way that you switch
Illustrious wisdom
Queen of the Seven Seas
Why you makin' me appear to be mean?
I speak from the root of our self-esteem
Let me embrace that
Holding you captive, you're so attractive
So let me taste that
And beat it up real good until you say cat
You're not a hood rat
You're from a good batch
Your intellect reflects light that make the people unite
You got flavor like Michelle Barack
You're high maintenance
And your shell is black you speak languages
Girl you’ve got to know that you’ll always be my only one
The only one, the only one, the only one
‘Cause baby you’re the one
Tonight I’m taking off so I can make time
For the one, ’cause you’re the one, the only one
Baby you’re the one1Embed
