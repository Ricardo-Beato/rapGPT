52 ContributorsEmmitt Smith Lyrics
50, 40, there he go...
30, down sideline, uh!
20, there he go!
Touchdown, touchdown!
Go! Go! Go!

Running with that sack, Emmitt Smith
Deuce-deuce pocket rocket, Emmitt Smith
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt Smith
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
I just touched down on a pussy nigga

Finessing the plug, I run with that sack and I make a touchdown
Ran up the money, hall of fame of finesse, ain't no Jim Brown
I know my momma she proud of me
Young rich nigga, we the new trend now
Came a long way, from kicking the doors
Now people they pay me in PayPal
Want me to fuck with you 'cause I came up nigga?
My momma she told me she love me, go get money nigga!
I came a long way
From trapping in trenches to rockin' the mic and I did it, we did it
My pockets on Pinky and I'm taking a pic
From flying from city to city
You might also like
Running with that sack, Emmitt Smith
Deuce-deuce pocket rocket, Emmitt Smith
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt Smith
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
I just touched down on a pussy nigga

Run with the sack like I'm Emmitt and I keep the Emmitt for niggas who envy
Versace, Versace, Givenchy, Givenchy
With double F's on me, no Fendi
My niggas ain't feelin' their bitches
They put on their ski-masks, they leavin' no witness
My wrist it be spinnin' I'm doin' my fitness
Hall of fame trappin', young niggas I'm feedin'
My wrist game real sick so I need soup by Mrs Campbells
I'm baking and dodging the camera
Young nigga running with the work, Earl Campbell
Trapping in bandos and shelters
Young Takeoff and I'm finna buy Delta
Pourin' that 2 plus 2 in my Fanta
Your pockets look like they got cancer
I just bought a brand new Mercedes from Haiti and set it on some Walter Paytons
My 'migo he asked me to front him a kilo, I threw it to him like I was Peyton
I told momma we gon' make it
Now I'm on trips to Macon
Making a trip to go get the narcotics
I-75 with the pocket rocket
Running with that sack, Emmitt Smith
Deuce-deuce pocket rocket, Emmitt Smith
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt Smith
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
I just touched down on a pussy nigga

Emmitt, Emmitt, touchdown
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew!
Glaw, bow!
That's a hundred rounds
Glaw, glaw!
Nigga lay it down (fuck nigga)
None of my plugs from America (nope), Africa (where?), Australia (where?)
Chopper gon' bite like Bull Terriers (glaw)
None of my niggas they scared of yah!
Hang a fuck nigga like ornament (fuck nigga)
Broke ass nigga unfortunate (broke nigga)
I keep the babies like orphanage babies
Go to the moon like astrologist
We not acceptin' apologies
Sellin' the dope to economies
Young rich nigga ridin' 'round in the Bentley
Throwin' money out the ceiling momma told me I'm ignant!
I'm two steps ahead of ya, never been regular
Hit a nigga with the antidope and we burry him
Hop in the Jag', I'm droppin' the top back
Smoking on gas like a nigga got cataracts
Duck ass nigga I'm calling you Aflac
Alley oop dunking them bricks it's a Shaq attack
Only one bird can bring the whole corner back
Mike Offset Vick, throw it like a quarterback
Running with that sack, Emmitt Smith
Deuce-deuce pocket rocket, Emmitt Smith
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt Smith
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
I just touched down on a pussy nigga48Embed
