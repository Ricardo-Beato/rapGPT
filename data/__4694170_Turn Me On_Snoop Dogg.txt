17 ContributorsTurn Me On Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen (Hey)
You are now tuned in (Woo)
Phinzel (Snoop Dogg)
Butters, Jonah (Hey)
You are now tuned in (Woo)
Phinzel (CB, wow!)

Baby, do you even know
That I got my eyes on you? Oh-oh (Baby)
Oh, baby (Yeah), ain't a thing, oh-woah
The things I do (I do) for you, oh (Woo)
But I'ma have you work for free tonight
Come and spend some time with me
I never wanted love, but now I'm open to it (Open, open, ah)
Miss Independent, hope you're open to it (Ooh, open, hope you're open)
I never wanted love, but now I'm (Woo, ooh-wee)

Hey, girl, you know you're I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T, you know what that means?
You need to let S-N-double-O-P D-O-double-G knee-deep in them jeans
Let a nigga blaze up (Blaze up)
Touch down on the West and soak the sun rays up
Blow smoke out the six deuce
And pour another cup of that gin and juice (Woo)
Now you and your girlfriend sippin' too
We gon' crash out on Slauson, that Nipsey blue
You never actin' funny style (Never)
Them veneers in your mouth, girl, you got a money smile (Ching)
Hold on like a tight grip (Tight grip)
Shakin' that ass, you turn me on like a light switch (Woo, oh, no)
You might also like
Let them tell it, you be actin' funny, babe (Oh-oh)
Do good for yourself and get your money, baby (Ooh, oh)
Gon' and put it down (Down, down, hey, hey)
What you do is (Ladies)
It really turns me on (On)
Turns me on, ooh (Ow! Ow! Yeah)
It really turns me on (Oh-oh, turns me on)
Turns me on (Woo), oh (Woo, come here)

Hand over your heart if you in love, baby
Kissin' on your body 'til you can't take it
Silencer on the gun, I'm locked and loaded
Pedal to the metal, foot down and floor it
I won't say shit 'cause you hard-headed
As long as we together, whippin' it, aw yeah
Girl, ain't nobody doin' it like papi chulo (Oh-woah)
This a fiesta, pull your dress up when we're together (Oh, na, na, hey)

Psycho-disco, Snoop-adellic
With the crypto-cash on me, you could smell it (Smell it)
Now breathe it in, wait to exhale, now breathe again
You smell like money, dressed to kill
Wave my wand, we can disappear
In a Cadillac spaceship
Over the hills and palm trees to the Matrix (CB)
Let them tell it, you be actin' funny, babe (Oh-oh)
Do good for yourself and get your money, baby (Ooh, oh)
Gon' and put it down (Down, down)
What you do is
It really turns me on (On)
Turns me on, ooh (Ow! Ow! Yeah)
It really turns me on (Oh-oh, turns me on)
Turns me on, oh

Yeah, Snoop Dogg, CB
Haha, yeah
Another Jazze Fizzle productshizzle
Do it to 'em, CB
Chris Brown, Snoop Dogg, oh, ooh
Ah-dah-dat-dat-dat, dah-dah-dat-dat
Dah-dah-dat-dat-dah2Embed
