54 ContributorsJuice Lyrics
"Hmmm, yeah!"
Sinatra

Aight, yeah, yeah, homie I'm comin'
I'm coming and I'm never gonna give up
My mentality is making rappers feel like
They can never even live up to Logic
You bust I dodge it
Think you seein' me, nah, you just miragin'
I'm gunnin, I'm gunnin like a semi-automatic
Thatâ€™s fully equipped with lyricism, I'll let 'em have it
I blast it, any style that you comin' at me with
I master it, I son mothafuckas that I'm out on you bastards
Syke, I'm just playin' with y'all

Yeah, you know I had to keep it going
Kid rhymes that blow minds and C4in
Real recognize real and you lookin' foreign
I was spittin' flows before I was even born in the womb
And I'ma keep it up until the tomb
And as for the fame, yeah I know it's coming soon
Cause I'm goin' in raw, finna bust up in your room
I hit a beat and it's ergence to emerge in the game
Pukin Hodukens I'm too sick to spit that Yoga flame
The way I see it, this is rap second renassaince
Spittin' dirty sentences, so ill they affecting medicine
Ha, I'm heaven sent and spittin' fire like a demon
As the internet I let my flow to get to streamin', I'm beamin'
Flawlessly listen in that women in yo head while you dreamin'
Leo Dicaprio flow all up in that bitch schemin'
Tryna' get you to buy that album, tryna get you feenin'
See my vision as I commentate it
You wanna see naked rerun of the bait but the hater ate it
Success is truly overrated
I've seen caster with a blow up to pop and get deflated
See yeah, you made it but all your fans hate it
And it's kinda lookin' like you and Satan negotiated
When it comes down to the rap game you see I'm integrated
Half-white, half-black I had it incorporated
Get the money
(Whoever did this is a real pro)
You might also like
Yeah, I'm just a youngin' with a dream
Who spittin' 'til sixteen
Quite the microphone fiend
Other rappers nah'mean
When I step up on the scene
All they gon' see is my skin
'Til I open up my mouth and they find out my lyrics mean
Had a meeting with Raheem
Dre and the whole team
But before I execute a perfect plan I gotta scheme
Cause right now I'm on the dolo
Everything about this tape I did it on the solo
Yeah, I said it's hurricane Logic
Maryland can't dodge it
They gon' be bumpin' me from the burbs to the projects
I get on the mic and excite anybody around me
You're probably wondering why a label has not found me
It's not that easy, I gotta work from the ground
Be the center of attention, look at the people around me
Black on the inside, my outside Ritz
What's a cracker without the cheese?
I gotta stack chips

"Would you care for a glass of grape juice?"
"Nigga, what the fuck is juice?"
"You have interfered with our affairs for the last time."8Embed
