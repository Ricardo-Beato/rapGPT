45 ContributorsDonâ€™t Mind If I Do Lyrics
Haha
Mhm, don't mind if I do
Ahem
Hey

It seems like every day, I got a filled-up phone
Ladies tryna text me, sayin' that they home for the summer
And they heard that I'm livin' on my own
So they wanna come to the crib, maybe cook me some supper
But I'm busy, so I'm ignorin' her
Yeah, I just touched down in California
Now I'm headed to the beach
Go and swim in the water like I'm tryna sneak in across the border
I do all different types of crazy shit
I'm the youngin hoes tryna make a baby with
'Cause it'll make 'em rich
Know I'm headed to the money, so these funny little girls wanna take a trip
But no, only the M-O-S-T Dope with me
Other fools homo, Roy and Siegfried
No disrespect, though
I got addictive cigarette flow for the green pesto, presto

I'd like to make myself believe (Haha)
That planet Earth turns slowly (This is what I was talkin' about when I said K.I.D.S. was gonna be some life-changing shit, bitches)
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep (But shoutout Pittsburgh, man, Most Dope)
'Cause everything is never as it seems (Big Jerm makin' me sound crispy and shit, hey)
You might also like
Yeah, I'm highly underestimated
So educated and getting paid quick
If you ever hated, anticipate that I'm famous
Got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with
Celebrate that we seein' another day
Life good, never wanna end this
Me and mary jane got a really nice friendship
Yeah, they give me money, but I gotta go and spend it
Man, I been a bad little Jew
But I gotta pay the bills now, so I gotta chill out
I ain't walkin' 'round like I'm splurging with a mil' now
Feel like the kid working at the mill now
Used to just chill and smoke joints up at Bill's house
Now I got a schedule, things I gotta do
Doing interviews, see it up on YouTube
I say it feels just like a dream
'Bout to wake up from a nap, how fucked up was that? Like

I'd like to make myself believe (Yeah)
That planet Earth turns slowly (Haha, this shit just feels good, I'm not gonna lie)
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause everything is never as it seems

Just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kids10Embed
