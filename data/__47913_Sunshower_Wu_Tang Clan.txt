Yo... this song is...
Aiyyo Dunn this song is called Sunshower
Cause we approachin the final hour
You know I ahh all I can say to my brothers and sisters right now
Is stay close to your families, and all your loved ones
Cause this globe is about to explode with hatred
They killin for pennies, knahmsayin?
Peace to the Gods, we got a heavy job... yo, yo

Trouble follows behind a wicked mind, 20/20 vision
Of the prism of light but still blind
Because you lack the inner, every sinner
Will end up in the everlastin winter of hellfire
Throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
You cry out your words fly out, and sounds die out
You remain unheard, sufferin eternally, internal external
Along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
Releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
And permanently upon this journey
Through the journal of the book of life
Those who took a life without justice
Will become just ice ice ice
It's been taught that your worst enemy couldn't harm you
As much as your own wicked thoughts
What devils fought we wrought, and let's annoint
Now you're bein persecuted by that universal court court court
Iron hell with the strong blend of rape and blend of sandal
With rose petals and jasmine, as men use talismans
Burn some incense, chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions
I'm convinced, Allah is God always has been always will be
You could travel every square inch of the planet Earth and still be
Ninety-three million miles away from the sun
Til you realize you and the sun is one, like the knowledge
Know the ledge to where your heart is
Or fall off into the internal hell that's uncharted
Light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second
Through time and space, until it reach a target
And once we're freed of darkness, and show em where the path
From which the Red Sea was parted, into these straight
At the narrow gate, but wide is the road to destruction and hate
What you thought life was a sport? A game?
One hundred years short, know the soul is immortal
Walk through many portals, and those who go astray
Will pay a judgment day, and these few years of wicked bullshit
Ain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
With dragons and snakes, and any pain you can imaginate
Instead, I chose to become a newlywed to the true bread
Of life and fed God Degree of light to my head
It's been said, the fool who sleep is already dead, so I stay awake
And take care of my brother, and uncover reveal the skin
So we can see each other, cause every color
That makes the light appear duller, who's the colored man?
Who's the original, who's the biochemical
Who's the grafted digital, digital, digital, digital
Digital.. yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Two hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
While niggas minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
The sea of reality, they can't inhale deep, devils have em
Stagnant, a trapping, the .45 magnum
And shatter bone fragments
Cops love the block you gettin backed up by Dragnet
Thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
Liftin weights readin ancient tablets, back on the block nobody's havin it
Those who haven't learnt get returned
You freaky ass niggas get burned
Some walk around like they ain't concerned
With the hell goin on inside the world
Why do grown men molest little girls?
Is it because the girl's breast has swelled
To the size of a woman, although she's twelve
The whole world is sick, sick, sick
Trapped up in six, six, six
I started off as a pawn in this marathon of life
Tryin to carry on, wishin I had a bomb to blow up Babylon
A vagabond, tryin to steal sportswear from Paragon
Goin in circles, like a ferris wheel
Undernourished meals I cherish hope, drown inside the sea of life
Use my third eye for a periscope, and take flight to the edge of night
To far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
You couldn't see a spark of light
While others play ball, I recall, me and GZA, Dirty
Hangin in halls, bangin on walls
Kickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause
Boostin from Freeport sunrise to Amityville morgue
Kept razorblade between the jaws, breakin all laws
Started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
To wearin long cables that hung down to the navel
So pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk
To funnel the P-Funk, smokin woolie blunts
Dust cocktails and primos, shot more dice than casinos
Back when Wu-Gambinos were called F.O.I. MC's
All and Together Now Crew B.C.C
REC Posse, G.P., D.M.D
Ol' Dirty stalked East New York, GZA maintained Franklin Lane
I was going to Thomas the Jeff, where students got slain
Old Earth got nervous walked me to Shaolin sent me to Curtis
Took share time in Marquis, U-God general contractin service
While Meth Chef and Deck was off the New Dorp
For white boys who took steroids
Buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
Back when our girlfriends was virgins
Cuttin class with Ghost tryin to bag hoes in Murry Bergtraum
A Maybeldine beacon night school Washington Irving
These young Gods was seekin
Hoes in Westinghouse and Clara Barton and Medina
Girls who sung like Sarafina
On the corner of Belmont and Picket Avenue I seen her
As if I dreamed her
I was dead broke, now I will use key notes to make G-notes
So it's always hope
See subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
To the heart of Medina, but Shaolin is the brain
So take heed to these words
And feel the power of the Sunshower
Approachin the final hour
Power equality, Allah Cees everything
Let's come together under the wings
And take flight, Wu-Tang, the saga, Rzarecta
In your sector5Embed
