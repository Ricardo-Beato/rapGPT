6 ContributorsAbu Astronaut Status (Outro) Lyrics
Where's Future, where’s the Freeband gang (God man)
I haven't even seen you guys around
Used to come in my store
Now I don't see anybody
The streets are dry
We can’t be in your store all day
Goddamn it, smellin' like incense and hummus (Hmm)
Yo, we been on the road Abu
Where you been?
Man, we been gettin' to it, man, road to riches man
You been to pluto? (Hmm?)
Pluto? Man, I'm talkin' bout astronaut status Abu
Astronaut status? (Hmm?)
What did you say? Astronaut status? (Hmm?)You might also likeEmbed
