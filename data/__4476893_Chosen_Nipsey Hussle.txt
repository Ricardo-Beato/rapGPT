5 ContributorsChosen LyricsVerse 1
Look so many n*ggas doin time
Who are you and I
To play wit it
It's a blessing
So reach for the sky
Pick up Shady off
The block and we gun
Smoke and drive
Politicing on a plot
To make it multiply
Keep some bitches on the team
From the other side
Keep at least a pound of green
Muthafucking right
30 hours in the spot
Going over time
Then we pull up to the fox
And don’t hold a dime
You know this life got a co-design
How you go from eating lobster tail
To the ocean prime?
The chain to a smoker
It throw it on the line
& when them gates close keep
A open mind
It ain't no force in this world
Like a focused drive
You gotta focus on yaself
Like a only child
You make ya dream realer
Then you make ya team better
You make yo game up
Then you make ya scheme better

Yeahh
Since when do real niggas come second?
So I kick the door down
Get more down
N*gga need atleast like 30 fo the show now
Woah now
Realest outta So Cal
Baby wanna f*ck, I'm like slow down
I’m eating cheese eggs in my hotel
Hussle sold out
N*gga retail and whole sale

Verse 2 - Dave East
Projects to the Condo
Thinking bout should I decorate
Only motivation I eva needed
Was section 8
Pissy stair cases
Rats and roaches
Wasn't resting late (i'm up)
Coke and Dope we separate
Ain't bagged it yet
They better wait
That 600 Black
Mercedes Benz
I love tha features
Free my cousin Addiz
They caught em wit 100 pieces
Foreign visas, smoking in Japan
I'm from the cement
One of da homies start telling
I ain't wanna believe it
(Fuck)
Backwoods still burning out
Maserati merkin
This that shit that they ain't heard about
Certified in person
Real n*ggas serve a purpose
Write my life out
In these verses
Clarity in this Rollie
My bitch into Fendi purses
On Slauson wit no license
Nippsey told me bring a 2 liter
20,000 on me
I just made that shit
Off two features
Cuzzo just came home
& All he asking for is new sneakers
Sun up to Sun down
I use to trap
I was like who need it?
Outro - Nippsey
I'm like fuck it though
Cuz when you flat broke
You ain’t nothin bro
I seen a gang
Of rich n*ggas get comfortable
Then lookin at they watch
Like where tf it go
Through my eyes I learn lessons
Like time is of the essence
& my grind got obsessive
Then my mind got restless
Put myself in the game
No batteries sold separate
