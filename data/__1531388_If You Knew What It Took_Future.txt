You have no idea what it take
Hard work

If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
If you knew what it took
[Verse 1: Future
All them nights in platinum, throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I get it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits

If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
I lost a baby mama and a good girl behind that
You might also like
I'm standing in the middle of the rain
Trying to wash off this pain
And when them drops stopped
That's when I come to my senses and I finally realized
I'm scarred for life, and fuck the hype I go hard for life
Ain't it precious, I'm thankful
For every second I'm in the leather room
My phone up, actin like a piston
You so caught in the present
You donâ€™t wanna stay down for your prison
You bout that drama, drama, I want that llama, llama
Behind these raps behind that trap I ask my baby mama
Go see my vision, my dreams maybe too big for you
You better thank god everyday I had a kid by you

All them nights in platinum
Throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I hit it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits

If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
I lost a baby mama and a good girl behind that
I'm standing in the middle of the rain
Trying to hide the tears running down my face
And when them drops stopped
I come to my senses and I go hard for my block
Kirkwood for life, Lil Mexico I got so many stripes
I coulda went to war twice andcame back nice
With a few scratches all I need is some green plastic
And I go morherfuckin get that cash
I'm a survivor, with plenty fashion
And a whole lotta soul with my voice raspy
I'm gonna try to spit my lung up
When the sun down till it come up, find a way to come up

All them nights in platinum
Throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I hit it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits

If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
I lost a baby mama and a good girl behind thatEmbed
