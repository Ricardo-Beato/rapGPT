1 Contributor48 Crusades LyricsMy flow so sharp I tear my mouth, I be the masochist
My word my bond, u niggas word about as strong as plastic is
I shoulda never smoked that sweet n sour widow
Got me power napping with my eyes open staring out the window
And from me u gets no sympathy
I lost my feelings cuz a nigga stay so incoherent
I lost my bitch just for buying another bitch some earrings
I lost some weight and had to leave the state for goodness sake
Snuck back in my mamas crib and fixed myself a healthy plate
I'm bout my green soon as I wake up like healthy shakes
She lookin at me like boy u funny but don't think you bout to penetrate
And i dont hesitate
I kill that pussy
Bring it back like a seance
Water be the fragrance
New doc on the block, u see I got no patients
My pockets real colorful lined up wit lots of crayons
Squeeze racks out these chickens
Lil mama do it for the D they call her Big Sean
But this is Big Christian, ur server
This game full of chips and its looking like its crunch time, lunch time
If u think it's ur time then u staring at the wrong time
Better check ur wrist watch
I'm just tryna upgrade to an AP from a G-Shock, that's what I call a flip flop
No joke, got fiends yelling out ayo Chris Rock
I lift my shirt up like I'm 2Pac minus the sit-ups
I be the big one at the bando wit a bad ho playing instrumentals
My pockets keep some fat Wallace, ain't that Big
I think I'm too high if I'm being honest
I be a comet
I got that yak mixed wit that chronic
Boy keep me on it

Damn near burned off my fingertips from smoking all those clips
Copped my first Coogi sweater back in '06
Then I found out my flow immaculate
So spectacular
I only liked two things back then, it’s still the same two
Writing poetry n beating pussy walls until they turn blue
She need some spackle on
A thick accent jawn
Skin buttery in camisoles
U a shoulda woulda coulda ass nigga
Ask niggas
It's Big Chri
I'll have your bitch eating my kids like the creatures from the Stranger Things
I just wanna live in harmony
Tried to stay back, but that pussy it keep calling me
Calling me a problem and she stay problem solving me
Talk to me nice in all white like a orderly
I take a pill I give her 1, 2 like George Forman b
N she attracted to Balenciaga
Heron Preston in my closet
Fast money, quick deposits
I dont know girl, something bout u make my dick the hardest
Yea, my weed smell like a nigga farted
Tell me what u into give you retail, Neiman Marcus
Smoking on some spices from the Far East
My weed bomb like i got ISIS on the blunt leaf
