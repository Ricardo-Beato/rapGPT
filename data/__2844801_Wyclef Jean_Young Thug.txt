This Actavis by the way, I promise, on God

Okay, my money way longer than a NASCAR race (Yeah)
I told her keep going on the gas, fuck the brakes
Only here for one night, let me put it on your face
Let a nigga nut, only way I'll go to sleep (Woo)
Boolin', rockin' all the Franck Muller (Franck Muller)
I know some hoes with good head, fuck a tutor (Good head)
So many hundreds, how the hell I'm going to lose 'em? (Gonna lose 'em)
Put me in the Jaggy or the Wraith and now I'm coolin' (Skrrt, skrrt)

Play with my money, I'ma let them niggas do you (Hey, hey)
(I do lie, yeah, I do)
Play with my money, I'ma let them niggas do you (Oh yeah, hey)
(I do lie, yeah, I do)
Play with my money, I'ma let these niggas do you (Hey, hey)
(I do lie, yeah, I do)
Play with my money

Play around with my cash (Yeah)
End up in a body bag (Ah)

Pull up, hoppin' out a cab (Skrrt)
She know she got a nigga bad (She know it)
She know she gotta keep a bag (Gotta)
She know I gotta keep me some cash (Keep)
She know she gotta hop on top of the dick (Woo)
She know she gotta ride that motherfucker (Don't you)
Her mama done walked in but it's too big
She can't hide that motherfucker (No, she)
Even if she divided the motherfucker (Whoa)
Man, even if she minused the motherfucker (Whoa)
Join in, get demolished, motherfucker (Whoa)
I ain't gon' disguise it, motherfucker (Whoa), nah
Shop at Saks Fifth, flow on DatPiff (Woo)
Yeah, I'm that swift, ask her and him (Woo)
Yeah, ask 'em, put a bone in them
Put a choker on 'em, let 'em choke and all
All my children spoiled, yeah, they got it all (Yeah)
Daughter sexy and my son got the broads (Woo)
Spent racks on my son and his squad (Racks)
Daddy boy, never play with toys (On God)
Better not play with 'em boys (Play with 'em boys)
New AK with them boys (AK with them boys)
New feng shui with the boys (Shui with the boys)
Drippin' all day for the boys (Day with the boys)
Bitch, you ain't ready for the boys (You ain't ready for the boys)
I'm in that Wraith, homeboy (Skrrt)
If you ever play with the boy (Play with the boy)
