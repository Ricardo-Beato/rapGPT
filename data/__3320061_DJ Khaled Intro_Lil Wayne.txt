Secret Weapon

Your stupidity might be your one saving grace
Uh?
Don't uh me greek boy
How is it your fucking stupid, soon to be dead friends
Thought that they might be able to steal my cannabis
And then sell it back to me?
This is a declaration of war
Is this some white cunts job that black cunts don't get?
'Cause I'm not fucking laughing, Nicholas
 position, 'cause you're not that stupid
That if you did, you wouldn't have turned up here, scratching your ass
With that, "What's going on here?" look slapped all over your Chevy Chase
But, what you do know, is where these people live
If you hold back anything, I'll kill you
If you're bending the truth, or I think you're bending the truth, I'll kill you
If you forget anything, I'll kill you
In fact, you're going to have to work very hard to stay alive Nick
Now, do you understand everything I've said?
Because, if you don't, I'll kill you!
Now, Mr. Bubble and squeak
You may enlighten meYou might also likeEmbed
