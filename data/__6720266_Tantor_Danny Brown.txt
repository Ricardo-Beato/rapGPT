Reach one, teach one (Style)
Can sell you to the water, how ya eat son? (Yeah)
We docking in the low tide (Huh)
So strap up, my nigga, it's time to rhyme (Go)

Go in like scuffed Timbs, nigga, this Above the Rim (Uh-huh)
When Birdy whipped the blade out, nigga, time to fade out (Yeah)
Mr. Playground, get down to lay down (Yeah)
Nigga better stay down, greyhound my playground (Go)
Got a Mexican homie named Chinese Mike
In an all-black Cutty and he got that white (White)
If you ain't got that green then he might see red
Put a knot on your head then we might see dreads
Straight hair white ho with them pinky toes (Hahaha)
Eating on noodles like Piscopo (Yeah)
You ain't talk to my lawyer then I don't know (Nah)
If you ain't watering the seeds then how we grow? (Go)

Reach one, teach one (Yah)
Can sell you to the water, how ya eat son?
Docking in the low tide (Yah)
Shut the fuck up, it's time to ride (Go)

Jumping in like Greg Louganis
Scraped his head against a diving board (Style)
A cyborg with vocal chords, deeper than an ocean floor (Style)
None of these rappers ain't eating like me (Nah)
So if you pass the toll then you gotta pay your fee (Hahaha)
Got your tickets for that murder show, RSVP (Uh-huh)
Got problems at the door, then ask for me (Uh-huh)
Got problems where Parker didn't ask for T
Got a problem with voting, you a absentee
This that Black Lives Matter, still sniff cocaine
Paid for a therapist but I still ain't change
This that Black Lives Matter, still sniff cocaine (Style)
Paid for a therapist but I still ain't change (Go)

Can sell you to the water, how ya eat son? (Yah)
We docking in the low tide (Huh)
So strap up my nigga, it's time to ride (Hahahahahaha)
