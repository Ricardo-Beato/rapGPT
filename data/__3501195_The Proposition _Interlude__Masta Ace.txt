2 ContributorsThe Proposition (Interlude) Lyrics
Ayo Fats man, I just met this crazy shorty at the store
Very serious man it was-
What's wrong with you?

Yo I came running and I, I heard the shots
And I came running out, I thought you got caught up
In some shit over there

Nah man, I don't fuck with poppies yo
Little young cats always in the front of that store
Shootin' and acting up, ya'know what I mean
I go up the hill to habeeb's
It's a little longer walk but it ain't no problem

Yo here's the deal, Ace
I know you got this little tour coming up, right?
I was thinking since ya'll ain't doing the
Road management thing for you on this trip
Ya'know you might need somebody to hold shit down
For you out there, you know
Kinda' like family
I don't take no shit, but I think I could do a good job
You might also like
Hold up, hold up all of a sudden you wanna'
Go on the road now?
You ain't slick, Fats what's popping?

Well, I've been speaking to some connections outta' state

Yeah

And I'm gonna' be making a few moves on the side
Nothing that's gonna' like step on your toes or anything
But, being out with you it sorta' makes my thing
Look a little bit more legit, you know kinda' like
Under the radar

Yeah, old man, we ain't gonna' be in New York
And outta' state cops don't play that shit, man

I know, I know but listen I'll tell you what
I'll throw in a couple of cards
Gold Amex's, never been touched
You know that you've been wanting one of those plasma joints
For the living room
So that was it, it was a wrap
I mean for a plasma flatscreen he coulda' been
Road Manager and DJ and hypeman on the tour
So we hit the road, did shows every night
And he would do his hustle thing on the side
He was loving the road too
The parties, the limelight, especially the chicksEmbed
