50 ContributorsYouforia Lyrics
I been waiting so long (Been waiting)
To have you by my side (Tell you, "I love you")
I, I can't do no wrong (No, you are an angel)
With you by my side, you are myâ€”

Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)

And when you look in my eyes
The pain goes a-way
Euphoria (Euphoria)

You feel so damn good (I want you to know that)
Just come take my hand (Closer) (So hear me out)
And we could go to the moon
Look in my eyes as we land (We're here now)

Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You might also like
And when you lay in my arms
The pain goes a-way

Euphoria (Euphoria), euphoria
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Euphoria (Euphoria), euphoria
Euphoria
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Euphoria, euphoria
And when you're mine, I won't let you go
The pain, it can't stay
Euphoria
