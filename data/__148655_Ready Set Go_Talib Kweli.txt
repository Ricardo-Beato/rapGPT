23 ContributorsReady Set Go Lyrics(Verse)
I switch lanes; it's still blurry, then switch frames
Clowning these lames -- you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Braggin' about the ride that you're whipping, your soul is missing
Racing to your death or the holiest celebration
God bless our lady of holy acceleration
Cuz we speeding while we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I’m staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, cause we got the same brain
We in the same chains, work in the same fields
Now we’re independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I'm blowing past the procrastinators
So fast, it's like they going backwards
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go

They hate when I give 'em some straight they need chase
Half these little boys coming faster than speed racer
Pulling capers with my team best believe I’ll be seeing paper
With extraordinary gentlemen, trust me the league major
On the highway of life I’m faster than cop cars
Quicker than the tongues of the rappers that got bars
Never rattled cause we been through the battles, we got scars
This the international half of the Black Star
This is the sound that you’re missing I’m here when your ears listen
Play it loud in your whip when you're dippin your gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick.
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain’t screaming
Just whisper in their ear and we're leavin
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
(Bridge)
When it’s gone to the wire
I gotta win to the fire
You can’t stop it. No, you can’t stop it
Because I’m destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it’s happening
At the time, get ready, set, go
(Verse)
On your mark, get set, when I start the jet
Look how far I get, I’m not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don’t exist, it’s a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market’s flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It’s so ironic, it’s beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don’t get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you’re tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That’s why I’m leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it’s all about the winning, it’s never about the wait
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, goEmbed
