30 ContributorsWorth It Lyrics
Mmm-mm, oh-oh
Oh-oh, Lil Boat
Javar said, "pick up that bag", right?

She don't think she worth it
In the mirror, she don't think she perfect
Late night on the net, she be surfin'
Looking for a surgery to purchase
Mmm, shit I think you fine though
If that's what you wanna do, it's fine though
You gon' be a 10 either way
I wouldn't have you any other way

Ooh, you sophisticated (Ooh), educated
Held up for herself, it's perpetuated
But she look in the mirror and get devastated, why?
She said I won't understand 'cause I am a man
Baby, that's alright, let's take a trip out to the sand
I don't give a fuck if your titties don't stand
I won't give a fuck if your lips kinda thin
You is still a 10, let me come in
Get rid of your friends
Let me come in tonight
Let me come in tonight
Let me phone in tonight

Oh-oh-oh-woah
She don't think she worth it
In the mirror, she don't think she perfect (She is)
Late night on the net, she be surfin' (She be searchin')
Looking for a surgery to purchase (Woah-oh)
Mmm, shit I think you fine though (So fine)
If that's what you want to do, it's fine though (All mine)
You gon' be a 10 either way (A 10)
I wouldn't have you any other way

True story, that's my little baby
New Mercedes, go pick up your ladies
She a city girl, she be talkin' crazy
She know it's Yachty's world, diamonds not fugazi (Not fugazi)
I love you for who you are
God don't mess up at all
Even when he make us with flaws

She don't think she worth it (La, la-la, la-la, la!)
In the mirror, she don't think she perfect (La, la-la, la-la, la!)
Late night on the net, she be surfing (La, la, la, la-la, la!)
Looking for a surgery to purchase
(La, la, la, la, la-la, la!)
Mmm, shit I think you fine though
If that's what you want to do, it's fine though (La, la-la, la-la, la!)
You gon' be a 10 either way (La, la-la, la-la, la!)
I wouldn't have you any other way (La, la!)
La, la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la4Embed
