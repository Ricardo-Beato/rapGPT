26 ContributorsPrayer (Exodus) Lyrics
In the name of Jesus, let us pray
Father, please walk with us through the bad times, as well as the good
May we be heard and understood, from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get our breakthrough, however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls and lay our fears to rest
For there's no way we could live for Jesus, when we're living in the flesh
So I pray that you will allow our spirits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, chapter two, versе fifteen
"Do not love the world or anything in the world," and wе know what that means
But listen
We know that distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin'
But that doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord, you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men to respect their ladies
But lately, so many of us have gone astray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please, bring us back home
And instill in us the Word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to
Yet, we receive so little
Because this time in our spiritual warfare
We're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the anointing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise, our prayers sincere
Our heads to the sky, you will diminish our fears
In Jesus' mighty name, we are brave, amenYou might also like3Embed
