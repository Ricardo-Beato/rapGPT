10 ContributorsSet It Off Lyrics
Let's go Maaly
Frrt-beep, nigga, K-preme, nigga, Big Boat, nigga, frrt-beep-beep

I put them packs in the U-Haul (Hee)
Livin' my best life like I'm Duval
Step on my guap, bitch, I'm too tall (Hee)
These niggas be buying drip in the middle of the mall
(Broke nigga, what?)
Reach for my chain, we gon' get his ass knocked off (Bow)
Slide in the Bentley Coupe, Boat dropped the top off (Skrt, skrt)
The stick having rings like I took her to top golf (Grr, grr)
Wolfin' on Twitter, in person, don't pop off

Go through her legs, just like I'm hot sauce
Bro sound the same but he not, he a knockoff (Uh!)
Uh, yeah, he need to knock it off (Go)
Louis V Kanye's used to walk it off (Slatt)
FN on me, I might let it off (Beep)
With the cool ones, I might have to set if off (Set, set)

Set it off, set it off (Set, set)
Set it off, set it off (Set, set)
Set it off, set it off (Set, set)
Set it off, set it off (Set, set)
Set it off, set it off (Set, set)

Sundress, BOA (Set)
Magic, BOA (Beep, set)
I know how to work as a TSA (Set)
Somebody touch me they gon' die today (Mhm, set)
My bitch titties look like they anime (What?)
She best friends will my balls, like Castaway (What else? Said what else?)
And she look like Anne Hathaway (What else?)
And she glorify all my accolades (What else?)
And she love me cuz' I love my escapades (What else?)
Wanna fuck me in both of my Escalades (Skrt)
Damn, I didn't even decorate (Beep)

I used to be broke now I count up like several ways
New Glock, let it off
Let it off (Let it off)
Let it off (Let it off)
Let it off
Press on that gas you gon' hear all that engine talk (Skrt)
She get on my nerves I'ma kick her up out the whip (Bitch)
Make her walk, sippin' that drank 'til my soda dark (Lean)
Takin' them Percs, she gon' ride in with narcs (Skrt)
Be with the slimes and I be with the sharks (Slime)
My young nigga paint 'em all black like he good at art
And I was born under Noah's Ark (Boat)
I'm still in the streets trynna get on the charts
Set it off, set it off (Set, set)
Set it off (Oh my God), set it off (Set, set)
Set it off, set it off (Set, set)Embed
