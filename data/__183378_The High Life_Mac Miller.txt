12 ContributorsThe High Life Lyrics
I'm so high (So high)
Find me somewhere in the sky (High in the sky)
And I know, I know, I know
These days just flow by (Flow by)
When you're so high (So high)
Headed somewhere in the sky (High in the sky)
And you know, you know, you know
These days just flow by (Flow by)
When you're so high (So high)

Yeah
My name is Mac Miller
And you are now livin'
The High Life
Most Dope
Big Jerm, I see ya!
