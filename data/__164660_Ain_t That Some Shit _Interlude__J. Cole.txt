63 ContributorsAin’t That Some Shit (Interlude) Lyrics
Okay, I lied
Uh-huh

Motherfuckers tryna say I can't come to the hood—true lie
See, I would, but I'm out in Dubai
When I get back I'ma roll through that
Snatch yo' bitch, give yo' niggas dap
The hood gon' ballistic
Cole was here and you missed it
That nigga walk like Obama man
Shook yo momma hand and then kissed it
This pimp shit, this pimp shit
Cole hard, you limp dick
My flow hard, no wimp shit
Put in that work, no temp shit
Ya bitch wearin' that lipstick
Gave this dick a french kiss
That nigga so wack when the bitch came back
He kissed her hoping that it get him sick, ha
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rapping shit
Ville made it to the map and shit
Niggas move 'caine like Kappa shit
Can't map this shit
From no bed springs in my mattresses
To fuckin' these bad little actresses
I'm bad as shit, ha
You might also like
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said

Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit, bitch

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow tight, put a nigga in a headlock
Fuck hoes out of wedlock, make her bed rock
Red hot, so they got red dots
Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit
So if you send shots then you bet not miss
For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Met Lock shit (testify)
I gotta testify
Came through humble so it's best if I
Explain the newer shit, rockin' jewel shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull shit
Stop the bullshit watch the flow
How you gon' stop the unstoppable?
Keep niggas on they toes, no Dr. Scholls
It's the Roc bitch, rock and roll

I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit, bitch

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce
