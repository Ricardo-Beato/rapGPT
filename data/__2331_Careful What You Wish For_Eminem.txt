"Breaking news: Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction to sleep medication
We'll have more on this story as it develops"
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting...
....Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be..."
"...The on and off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's entâ€”"
"Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours club, we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot..."
"...Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"...Long-time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12..."
"D12, back in the news again today..."
"Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem
He insists he's just taking a break, but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask, 'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"

So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewin' machine
But I was losin' my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD, critics gave it a three, then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
And call The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleepin' pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk
You might also like
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said, "Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold"

I got a letter from a fan that said
He's been prayin' for me
Every day and for some reason, it's been weighin'
On my mind heavy, 'cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but somethin' told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
It's just like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said, "Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold"67Embed
