Sittin' on blades
Countin' my plays
Roll a few J's
So won't you just pass my way? (Pass my way)
Sittin' on blades
Countin' my plays
Roll a few J's (So baby, won't you, so baby, won't you)
So won't you just pass my way? (Pass my way)

Even though I know that
You and your homegirl are so inseparable
I know that you'd rather ride with me
So ride with me, 'cause I be

Sittin' on blades (Sittin' on blades)
Countin' my plays (Plays)
Roll a few J's (Roll a few J's)

Sittin' on blades
Countin' my plays (My plays)
Roll a few J's (So baby, won't you, so baby, won't you)
So won't you just pass my way? (Pass my way)

Now you know damn well you don't wanna be walking this time of night
You know you wanna get up in this beautiful car of mines
