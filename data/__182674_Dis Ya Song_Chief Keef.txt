Glory Road, DJ Kenn, Chief Keef. We do this shit man, y'all knew this shit, new to this shit bitch. L's, L's, L's, L's!

We in the hood everybody got it bad
Man what I never had, still tryn' get a bag
Chi Town; We all about that cash
We got a lot of swag, servin' bitches they be bad

Put ya hands in the air if you know that this ya song, yeah

Put ya hands in the air if you know that this ya song

Got some bitches my swag on full
Shawty think that I'm cool but I ask Ima' do
On the block Chi Town South side
Wic City Lamron front street we outside and
That's all I know now I'm back to getting dough
And I gotta get on right after this song
Need money get a loan put your hands in the sky
I ain't never feelin' down I'm Chief Keef I be high
Now I'm finna batter up and hit it out the park
And the crowd goes nuts when I hit it out the park
Ain't no finish when you start straight down to go to war
For whoever ain't know this is how the story goes like
