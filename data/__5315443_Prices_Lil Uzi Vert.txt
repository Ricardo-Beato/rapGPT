Gangster, but my jeans too tight (Tight, yeah)
I see my opps through the sight (Sight)
Hit that bitch once and then tell her good night (Bye-bye)
All white on my ice, look like rice (Rice)
Stacked up, then get right out the sight (Sight, uh)

That lil' bitch still could go and pop (Go pop)
You keep flexin' with that drop (That drop)
Best believe you gon get dropped (Skrrt)
I get my looks from my mom (My mom, uh)

So you start talkin' to the cops (Hello?)
I skipped in that pussy, then hop (Yeah)
I heard that bitch, she was hot
Hickory, dickory, dock (Uh)
VVS all in my clock (My Rollie)
Get money like Anthony Hop
Silence the lamb and your ass'll get chopped (Dropped)
Clean up, his brain on aisle five
Somebody, please can they go get the mop? (The mop)
And I'm with my boys
So you know that the gang shit will not stop
You know that little bitch gon' look around
So if she let me fuck, then the shit is co-op
Yeah, I take more pills and she takin' more shots
Man, watch the way I had to drip on the block
Overseas on the jet, I had to slide
I went all way to Germany, back to Gera (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)
Uh, you is a lie
Uh, you is not cut from this side, uh
You cannot come to this side, yeah
Gangster, but my jeans too tight (Yeah)
