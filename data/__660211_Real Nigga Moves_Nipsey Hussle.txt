7 ContributorsReal Nigga Moves Lyrics
Smoke marijuana, watch cost a Honda and the crib got remarkable views
Eatin' downtown, look like it's China, I been makin' these real nigga moves

Uh, look
Swervin', I'm feelin' this shit
Brown liquor on my liver and shit
Fast life, still livin' and shit
Black leather suede ceilings and shit
Top floor, tall buildings and shit
Live by the model, lets get killed or get rich
Fly to islands just to chill with a bitch
I'm just a nigga that was real and that's it
With no regards to how you feel about shit, them German plates on my 6
I sleep light, but I dream big
I tend to talk less 'cause I seen shit
Stick to the script until the scene switch
I wrote this movie, 'get this money' is what the theme is
I'm smoking weed like a weed head
Mimosas by the oceans with the cheese eggs
Flickin ashes out my sunroof, victory 'cause real niggas in the lead here

Smoke marijuana, watch cost a Honda and the crib got remarkable views
Eatin' downtown, look like its China, I be makin' these real nigga moves
A steak every week, I keep it too street, you know I'ma do what I do
Wallet so plush, you know my stock's up, I be makin' these real nigga moves

I'm workin' 'til like 3:00 a.m., the most beloved nigga from the C.A., unh
We hit Mitchell & Ness in the P-A-D, it's back to L.A., let the V.A. speak
We at sachi bowl, saw B-H-E, that Perrier water, that's for me right there
No soda drinkin', french fries at the roller rink
It's just the playa' president, what you hoes be thinkin'? Shit
Lettin' niggas gas you all crazy
Last time I seen him he was actin' all shady
C.L.S. taillights pass you all crazy, O-P-M the army, yeah, exactly like Baby
Except we ain't got no fundin' from Universal
And still gettin' cameos in the big commercials
Gimme somethin' to mix with this lil' purp
Light that up, keep it in the circle, you know

Smoke marijuana, watch cost a Honda and the crib got remarkable views
Eatin' downtown, look like its China, I be makin' these real nigga moves
A steak every week, I keep it too street, you know I'ma do what I do
Wallet so plush, you know my stock's up, I be makin' these real nigga moves
