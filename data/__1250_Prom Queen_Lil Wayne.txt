40 ContributorsProm Queen Lyrics
Yeah!

I loved her fancy underwear
I sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get to tell her
I'm the one she should be with, oh
She's popular with all the guys
So innocent in my eyes
I can see her in my life
She would'a had the world if she were mine
But see, she had other plans, I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See, you never know how
How everything can turn around
You might also like
Uh, they loved her fancy underwear
Every boyfriend, every year
She tried to keep them entertained
When they can hardly remember her name, ah
She did everything she could
Just to make them laugh and treat her good
She finds herself alone
Askin' herself, where did she go wrong
She didn't realize she chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties, tryin' to apologize
Never forget the day she left and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See, you never know how
How everything can turn around

Yeah
Yeah
Oh
Uh
Uh
She had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See, you never know how
How everything can turn around14Embed
