I'm seeing double (I'm faded), seeing double (I'm faded)
Seeing double (I swear I'm faded)
I'm seeing double (I'm faded)
Seeing double (I was drinkin'), seeing double (I was drinkin')
Seeing double (I was drinkin')

I'm seeing double (I'm drinkin'), seeing double (I can't thank)
Seeing double (Vision's ringin'), seeing double (Ocean's rain)
I'm seeing double (Pop a pill), seeing double (Pop a pill)
Seeing double (How you feel?), seeing double (How I feel?)
I'm seeing double (I'm drunk), seeing double (I can't thank)
Seeing double (I can't walk), seeing double (I can't talk)
I'm seeing double (My vision's blurred), seeing double (I can't drive)
Seeing double (Seeing double), seeing double (Seeing double)

I'm seeing double (I'm seeing double)
I'm from the gutter (I'm from the gutter)
My cup muddy (My cup muddy)
I'm drinking muddy (I'm drinking muddy)
I got some niggas lost they life, I know they love me (R.I.P.)
Just 'cause they say they love you, they don't love you (They don't need you)
I pour the four and then I drink it with my buddy (With my buddy)
We got some bitches at the pad getting slutty (Slaughter your daughter)
These niggas hatin' but I know these bitches love me (These bitches love me)
These niggas hatin' but I know these bitches love me (21, 21, 21)
My cup (My cup), filled up (Filled up)
My blunt (My blunt), it's stuffed (It's stuffed)
Need to let that lil' bitch go, you trying to cuff her (You trying to cuff her)
I fucked her for a perc' inside the club (And that was nothing)
My Glock .40 on me, hold a dub (Hold a dub, boaw)
Walking 'round without out, that's a thug (Hey, that's a thug, baow)
I'm trying to run off on the plug (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Trying to run off on the plug (21, 21, 21)
