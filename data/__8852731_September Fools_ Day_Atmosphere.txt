5 ContributorsSeptember Foolsâ€™ Day LyricsDon't go, I hear you and I feel new
Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
Don't go, I need you and I feel the fool
You know that you're alive when you can see your own breath
Surrounded by the sounds of silence must've froze to deaf
Plus the firewood is wet, the smoke'll make you choke
Wondering how many summers are left (right?)
Took a couple steps then stumbled to the floor like
I don't know what the hell we struggling for like
I wanna offer you some comfort or support now
I'm just a little worn out let me catch a couple snores now
There's no way that I'm alone when I say that
It's likely that I mighta let my life bleed on a tape back in the day
And maybe I should take a stab at trying to locate
And give it a showcase in case it shows a way to open up some okay
If you can relate, that's dope I guess
Obviously also gotta offer my condolences
I wouldn't wish this on my least favorite opponents
This performance is more than just production and showmanship
Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
You might also likeI don't believe the protagonist really wants to die
But I imagine that they probably need a nap and some pain relief
Breathe deep and let the brain release
Underneath the poison apple tree to catch up on your beauty sleep
I hope you got somebody you can talk to
Anytime everything's heavy like it's falling down upon you
I think I'm trying to hide from everybody but I'm lonely
I wanna be invited to your party like you know me
Maybe in a previous life
I might've crawled out of an ocean of evolution and took flight
How am I supposed to keep my faith
So easily replaced when the sun starts screaming at my face
And people still wishing for a peaceful transition
Especially for those required to keep living
It's connected whenever I reflect and remember
As long as you're alive I'm gonna live forever
Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
Don't go, I need you and I feel the fool
Don't go, I hear you and I feel new
Don't go, I need you and I feel the fool
And all I can do is believe in the truth
Find me in the valley where the sheep run loose
Everything is real but nothing really matters
Can't go up the ladder if you're holding what you gathered
I'll meet you where the memories are buried
Love was the only material we could carry
Look you in the eye before we took to the sky
Climbing and climbing and climbing, don't ever dieEmbed
