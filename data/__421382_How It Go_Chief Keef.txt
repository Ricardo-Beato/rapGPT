You know how it go
(BassKids on the beat)
You know how it go
You know how it go

You know how it go, ayy
Baby, you know how it go, ayy, ayy
I'm doin' shows on the road, ayy
Gettin' dough, girl, you know how it go, ayy
Fuckin' hoes, girl, you know how it go, ayy
Countin' rolls, girl, you know how it go
I got my pole, girl, you know how it go
I can't trust a soul, girl, you know how it go

Ayy, I be countin' stacks, smokin' Thrax on the road
After she give me neck, break the back on your ho
I ain't with that cappin', put a cap in your skull
I know it's usually Tray Savage, but I got this MAC to your skull, ayy
Give my thirty to Tadoe
Bullets fly like birdies, so lay low
Like Friends, niggas actin', so it's me and bankroll
I am pistol packin' and I know it, I don't need to say so
Smoking' loud pack for my problems
But I got a MAC that'll solve them
I tote thirties, no revolver
Aim at your medulla like, "Now what?"
Kush got me brain damaged, smokin' all this sour
And I got my cowboys for all these cowards
He say he a clout boy, then fuckin' cloud them
Fuckin' with my racks, boy, buckshots gon' find him
He say he a clout boy, then fuckin' cloud them
Fuckin' with my racks, boy, buckshots gon' find him

You know how it go, ayy
Baby, you know how it go, ayy, ayy
I'm doin' shows on the road, ayy
Gettin' dough, girl, you know how it go, ayy
Fuckin' hoes, girl, you know how it go, ayy
Countin' rolls, girl, you know how it go
I got my pole, girl, you know how it go
I can't trust a soul, girl, you know how it go

I ain't with the actin', but I got 'xtended clips
Flexin' like you 'bout it, but your chest can get ripped, ayy
He think he titanic, put a gat to your ship
Pistol got me vibrating, fuck a nigga in here
Only thing I know, I ain't scared of lions or big bears
Only thing I know, better stop worrying 'bout mines and get theirs
But that's how it go when you at the top looking at the
Bottom of the world like, "Damn I used to be there"
I ain't with that opp shit or that cop shit
But I am with the Glo Gang, we get the guap quick
All these niggas up in they feelings
Smokin' loud pack, I can't hear my feelings
All a nigga want is some billions
But I'm smokin' loud pack while I spend my millions
No MC Hammer, bitch, I'm Sosa Jigga
No, I don't know nothin', no, I didn't did it
No MC Hammer, bitch, I'm Sosa Jigga
No, I don't know nothin', no, I didn't did it65Embed
