Skrrt

Homicide with malice, a lot of niggas jealous (Yeah)
I wrote the streets a ballad, I woke up on a pallet (Mm)
Gucci my suspenders, I used to get suspended (Guwop)
Stay far away from snitches, I highly recommend it (Racks)

I'm 'bout them racks like Venus (Racks), but I don't play no tennis (Venus)
My smile done brought me millions (Smile), so shoutout to my dentist (Shoutout)
You lightweight, get your weight up (Light), and stay out Gucci business (Guc')
There's sharks out here, don't get ate up (Gr), I'm not really friendly (Nah)
You haters get your hate up (Hater), you ants couldn't even pinch me (Mm)
I own the team I play for (Uh), so you could never bench me (No)
I spend cash like it's playful (Racks), feel like that's what it's made for (Yeah)
'Dem broke days made me grateful (Ooh), 'dem court dates made me hateful (Fuck)
I'm not talkin' the weekend, but I'm talkin' 'bout Abel (Huh?)
You see this shit that Cain did, and they weren't even strangers (Damn)
My daddy dead, my momma dead (Mom), so God sent me some angels (Pa)
I'm from East Atlanta, catch a thief, cut off his finger (Woo)
Cocaína off the airplane (Guc'), own private hanger
The chopper in the trunk make you do the Macarena (True)
Money in container, shippin' it to Califina (Woo)
Running circles 'round these squares with these rectangles (Skrrt)
Mountain Park apartments next to Triangle (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, true)
Heard they fucked him with a broom stick and left it in his anal
If you dwell on it, think too long, you go insane-ah (Whoa, damn)
Dash your own heroin, they searchin' for a vein-oh (Yeah)
Dope so good, it clog the pipe line, need Drano (Hoo)
Had to bring the chopsticks and cut that boy up like Maino (Cha-cha)
Twin extended .40, yeah, that's bangers on bangers (Twin)
Niggas sayin' that they trappin', but they R&B singers (Hm)
You might also like
Homicide with malice, a lot of niggas jealous (Yeah)
I wrote the streets a ballad, I woke up on a pallet (Mm)
Gucci my suspenders, I used to get suspended (Guwop)
Stay far away from snitches, I highly recommend it (Racks)1Embed
