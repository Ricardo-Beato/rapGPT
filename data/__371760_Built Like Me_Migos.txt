34 ContributorsBuilt Like Me Lyrics
Migo!
Sup Zay' ?
They can't fuck with QC

Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (No way!)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (Not at all!)
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga
Fucked up the profit get it back, they ain't built like me

These niggas ain't built like me
I can turn a whole nick' into a mother fucking key
Look at you nigga you ain't never been an OG
Nigga I ain't choose to trap, nigga trap chose me
"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"
That's the late great words of Muhammad Ali
Gotta move real smooth, if the feds watch me
Gotta hit him real hard if a nigga try me
"Boom! Boom! Boom!"
Can we fix it, like Bob the Builder?
Break in my trap and I kill ya (Phew!)
These nigga ain't built like my nigga
Down in Rose West side and Williams (Free Willie Mack!)
That is the moral of the story
You niggas can't built like that with no courage
You niggas out here really hurting
Locking the block down like Richard Sherman
Gone!
You might also like
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (No way!)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (Not at all!)
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga
Fucked up the profit get it back, they ain't built like me

You ain't never seen a nigga like me
Hit the club, diamonds glowing in the back of VIP
Straight through the line, nigga don't serve me
Give the wine to the bitches , cause I'm pouring up lean
Smoking OG like it's nicotine
I got the molly, the Percocet, and methamphetamine
We kicked the Versace went to the Giuseppe store
Grab that shit straight off the mannequin (Giuseppe me!)
You fuck niggas ain't in my weight class
I'm heavyweight, you niggas lightweight
When it comes up to this rap shit
You Sonny Liston and I'm Cassius Clay
"Paw! Paw! Paw!"
Hundred chickens on a Tonka toy
Beating the pot  like I'm Pretty Boy Floyd
Independent just like Macklemore
Hitting these hoes like McIlroy
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (No way!)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (Not at all!)
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga
Fucked up the profit get it back, they ain't built like me

Niggas ain't built like Offset
Sipping on Actavis like it was Moët
What you think you doing with your little bitty Rolex
Little bitty nigga but I'm built like Bow-flex
Wanna come back hit a nigga like jack
MCM bag that's a money book bag
Don't get it twisted, I get on yo' ass
Don't let the rap fool you, I've been sellin' bags
Run to the money got energy like I'm a generator
Maison Margiela my shoes is an alligator
When we got beef I'm the one who's the instigator
When I perform they say I look intimidating
I run off a ticket like I was a scientist
You rappers is fake, you an animation
And I'm a G but I'm not a Mason
I'm playing with money like recreation
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (No way!)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (Not at all!)
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga
Fucked up the profit get it back, they ain't built like me10Embed
