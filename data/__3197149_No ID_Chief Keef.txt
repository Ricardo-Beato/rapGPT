Zaytoven
That Boy Cassius

I'm addicted to money
Drank got me moving like a zombie
Me & my young niggas catchin' hommies
There's a lot of places you can find me
I pour a 4 in a fuckin' Fanta
Fresh as fuck look like I've been tailored
Many niggas sneak dissing yeah I see it
When we walk in the club it's no I.D

Doowop got the 60
These niggas lookin' fishy
Stupid bitch tryna kiss me
Get the fuck out the spot miss me
Runnin up on me is risky
You can catch a couple out this 50
We don't do the rap bitch don't diss me
See me noddin' off the drug, kick me

I'm addicted to money
Drank got me moving like a zombie
Me & my young niggas catchin' hommies
There's a lot of places you can find me
I pour a 4 in a fuckin' Fanta
Fresh as fuck look like I've been tailored
Many niggas sneak dissing yeah I see it
When we walk in the club it's no I.D
You might also like
First I face the 10
Then I pour the 4
Marble floors, double doors
And I answer in the Fendi robe
I like swirly staircases
And I like them big faces
My lawyer fighting big cases
And I like to be in big places
I fucked her in the Balmains
She gone think about me all day
In Rodeo, balling
Like I'm about to go golfing
Let down the window on your hoe like, hi
She seen the coupe fly by
I told her I fuck with her, and I lied
She know I got that chicken pot pies

I'm addicted to money
Drank got me moving like a zombie
Me & my young niggas catchin' hommies
There's a lot of places you can find me
I pour a 4 in a fuckin' Fanta
Fresh as fuck look like I've been tailored
Many niggas sneak dissing yeah I see it
When we walk in the club it's no I.DEmbed
