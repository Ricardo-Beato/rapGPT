17 ContributorsWith My Pistol Lyrics
I'm smokin' gas in my Mulsanne, I got a B on the ashtray
Gucci Mane La Flare and I get money the fast way
I used to have a plug but I robbed him
If he a country boy, you know I overcharge them
I'm on my 6th cup of lean, ain't even 12 o'clock
Katrina water diamonds, I flooded my Rollie watch
Your broad, yeah she seen me and said, "Oh my God"
They know my house, it look like Heaven with the trap god
I'm so ambitious, had a vision at Econo Lodge
Your diamonds  chain never robbed
I think I'm Pablo playin' forty, transprotin' forty blocks
I'm in the Bay like 2 Chainz, play me, I'ma off the Glock

I sleep with my pistol, eat with my pistol
Wake up in the morning, brush my teeth with my pistol
I know you're jealous cause I fucked your freak with my pistol
Got  all the time, nigga don't reach for that pistol

Keep a pistol on person, call up Brick Squad when you greet me
And when you leave me, stop reachin' cause if you reach then I'm teachin'
I'm tryna hit you everywhere, bitch, but under your sneakers
It's 20K for a feature, pull up your spot with street sweepers
Give me a reason to kill you, I'll kill you, all of your people
They think I'm Steven Seagal cause I come back with the sequel
Man this two nights in a row I got a 10 millimeter
I tote this strap like illegal, make you strip like 
You might also like
I sleep with my pistol, eat with my pistol
Wake up in the morning, brush my teeth with my pistol
I know you're jealous cause I fucked your freak with my pistol
Got  all the time, nigga don't reach for that pistol1Embed
