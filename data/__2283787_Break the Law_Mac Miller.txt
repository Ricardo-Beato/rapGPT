75 ContributorsBreak the Law Lyrics
Get high, breakin' laws
Get high, breakin' laws

Yeah
Okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is bangin' like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like
Dracula
It's The Young Miraculous Mister Love-to-Grab-His-Nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with 40 courses, bunch of horny whores who fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses, I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon (A-a-a-and?)
I bring this to you la-la-la-la-la-la-live, man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell 'em, "Shhh, this middle finger sign for silence"
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keepin' quiet

Yeah
I been ridin' through the city, blowin' smoke out the window (Yeah)
Cops is on patrol, they lookin' out for all the crim'nals (Woo)
I been a lot of things, I ain't never been a bitch though (No)
Rules to the game (Yeah,) you know how this shit go (Let go)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Hell yeah)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Oh no (Break-break, break-break the law)
La, la, la (Let's go)
You might also like
So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit, but now I walk
Around with money and my hand on my dick, I think I'm special
I'm drinkin' whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit, I'm losin' track now
(Yeah) Comin' to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound (Wow,) turned that to a house (Wow)
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here? (Woo)
Spendin' all your time just gettin' high will drive you crazy
(Crazy) I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the '80s
Speedin' down the freeway gettin' head in my Mercedes
Givin' me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better, no pressure
Dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola
Have you ever been? Shit, I pro'bly could've been the president

Yeah
I been ridin' through the city, blowin' smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they lookin' out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, but I ain't never been a bitch though
Rules to the game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Hell yeah)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Oh no (Break-break, break-break the law)
La, la, la, la
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law) (La, la, la, la, la)
Break the law, break-break, break-break the law (La-la-la-la)
Break the law (La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la)
Break the law (La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la)
Break the law (La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la)
