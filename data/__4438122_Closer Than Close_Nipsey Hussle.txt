4 ContributorsCloser Than Close Lyrics
(Mixed Trap DotCom)
You know a nigga like me tend to keep 'em at arms distance length (Closer than most)
I'll give you that, you got a lil' bit closer, but, you know (I just see so much in you)
Yeah (And I want a better view)
Finna take you back around, like, '98, '99, you know (I want to look deeper into you, yeah)
Slauson Boy

Yeah, let's take it back then, when it was crackin'
We probably took your 10-speed and jacked your mags then
One on the handlebars and one on the pegs
Obituary pictures, I miss 'em, them niggas dead now (Let's get—)
We used to fail tests, we used to steal chirps
We used to smoke stress, we used to sell work
Nigga, you're too cool for school, you ain't no fuckin' fool (Let's get—)
You ain't gon' stay broke for long like them suckers do
That's when my moms trip, she told me, "Kick rocks"
My granny told me I could stay, that's when the shit popped
Rarely I came home, mostly I'm in the streets (Let's get—)
Livin' with bitches I'm fuckin', bouncin' between the sheets (Let's get—)
I hit a house lick, I got a lil' change
I bought a gold chain, a lil' cocaine
Focused my mind now, got on the grind now (Let's get—)
I bought a bucket, a Cutlass, fuck it, it's mine now (Let's get—)
You might also like
(Let's get closer) That motherfucker rolled though, on hood
You know, nigga ain't have no license (Closer than closer)
Nigga be like four, five deep in that motherfucker (Let's get closer than close)
(Let's get closer) Shit, you know, nigga was just livin' fast, you know
I got my first taste of money and I was turned out (Closer than close)
I was on the grind after that, you heard me
Look (Let's get—)

That's when the cash came, life in the fast lane
Goodbye 211, hello champagne
Goodbye hood rat bitches, hello dime pieces (Let's get—)
They say money and women is known to divide people (Let's get—)
I couldn't see it then (Nope), but now I see it's true (Yup)
Your bitch was feelin' me (Yup), my bitch was feelin' you (I know)
We both was gettin' money, you know how these bitches do (Let's get—)
Show no emotions to these hoes, don't let it get to you (Let's get—)
Now when we meet, I'm seein' jealousy behind your face (Yeah)
Like crooked looks on top of phony smiles and fake shakes
You used to front me quarters (Uh), you used to have the bricks (Yup, let's get—)
You let me try your shit, how did it come to this? (Let's get)
Your young homie done growed up on his own
Same nigga you taught to cook and how to blow up a zone
Remember, same nigga you sent the pounds to when I went out of town (Let's get—)
Same nigga when I was down you let me sleep in your house (Let's get—)
What's happenin'?
(Let's get closer) You know, them times when a nigga got, you know, sick of just being in the hood every goddamn day (Closer than closer)
I got me a lil' ticket on JetBlue, got me a few pounds and I shook, you know (Let's get closer)
I was in ATL tryin' to do it big, my nigga, Stone Mountain, westside, Decatur (Closer than close)
Peachtree, all that, tryin' to get my money out in the zone, you feel me (Let's get—)

I guess you never know a nigga, 'til you catch a case with him
And it hurt me in my heart when they told me that you was snitchin'
If I wasn't up out of town, I'da been right with you (Let's get—)
Takin' that bank down with you, would you have still turned witness? (Let's get—)
And I remember them other niggas, they had you cornered
You chirped me early morning, I hit that corner with burners
No license in my Regal, on my lap was the heat (Let's get—)
I'm taking risks within this 'cause you would do it for me (Let's get—)
Wasn't that the code? Stay down and never fold?
Through 25 to life or through the casket close
And now I put some space between us 'cause the path you chose (Let's get—)
You got another nigga life for that lil' cash you stole (Let's get—)
And mama told you this a long time ago
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time, and oh
At first I brushed it off and second guessed it (Let's get—)
'Til the homie showed me all that paperwork with your confessions (Let's get—)Embed
