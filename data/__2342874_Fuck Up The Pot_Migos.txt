Aye! fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Aye! fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork

Fuck up the pot with the fork
Ain't a boss if you taking a loss
With my niggas, we shopping, don't care 'bout the cost
Came a long way from buying Lacoste
Back to back Maybach, I feel like Rick Ross
Take a trip to meet with the plug, I'ma knock him off
Rubber band Benjamin's stashed in my vault
Thinkin' I'm Chris Tucker the way that my money talk
I'ma take that fork and that pot
Scrapin' it, tryna make me a knot
Nigga woke up trapping on the block
Fuck it I'm looking out for the cops
Puttin' my wrist in my pot until my heart stop
Free my niggas that be locked up in the cell block
Junkies hit my dope and they feelin' like Hancock
In the bando, I'm Shaquille O'Neal with the blocks
She gone make you fall in love when you meet her
24 karat gold eggbeater
El Chapo, Griselda told me how to treat her
Now that I got her, I will never leave her
Need cash, swap it out for a feature
Whatever you do, I'ma have my nina
Teach you a lesson like I'm a teacher
Die for my respect like I'm Aretha
You might also like
Aye! fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Aye! fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork

Fuck up the pot, I gotta go get me a knot
Walk in the bando, you know that it's smellin' like twat
Cookie bag look like snot, got a green house thousand watts
Screamin' out thug life, Quavo Pac, WCW Hulk Hogan the pot
You mad cause I'm on, I put myself on
Now I got a Asian plug, he in Hong Kong
I talk to Offset every day on the phone
He told me go hard leave these fuck nigga 'lone
Pull out the chopper, they scared of the chrome
Underground tunnel right under the dome
If you ain't talking money then hang up the phone
I beat up the pot while I'm in Rolling Stone
Young nigga came from the nawf
My nigga doin' the most
Fuck up the pot with the fork
Still gettin' 50 a show
I can't wait to go turn on the stove
My niggas told me you old
Hang a nigga like a coat
Aye! fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Aye! fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fork
Fuck up the pot with the fork, fuck up the pot with the fo rk4Embed
