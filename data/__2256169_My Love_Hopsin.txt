Baby, I know we goin' through shit and you feel like there ain't no solution
You say I'm a nuisance and think I be playin' these games with your heart and not purposely bruise it
That's when I lose it and flip, put the blame all on you like it's all your fault
Now I'm goin' through your phone, you goin' through mine, and we wrestlin', I'm hopin' you don't call no cops
Baby, I love you, don't be jealous of females I know that I've met down the way
You mention they name on a regular basis and you just be givin' the space in my brain
You'll look me straight in the face, swear that I'm stickin' my penis up in every girl that I'm friends with
And that's the moment I say, "I don't even know why I'm in a relationship, I want to end it"
Let's just chill the fuck out, girl, we livin' in the same damn house
Everywhere I go, you go, and you go, I go, so what we naggin' about?
Shit, not a goddamn thing, maybe we just like to hear ourselves talkin'
We do it way too often, I think we both lost it
Our love just might be in the coffin, oh shit

I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love

I feel like your parents don't like me, I hate that you tell 'em our problems
See, when I first met 'em I knew that they fell in love with me, but then I fell straight to the bottom
Now your daddy textin' me sayin' to fly you home and he bein' so passive aggressive
Then I'm like "Sure you gon' pay for her ticket?" That is the question, dammit I'm stressin'
I've been sufferin' from manic depression, baby it takes a real man to confess it
I don't care if you confront me with issues you got, just be careful with how you address it
'Cause sometimes you attackin' me the wrong way, and then my mind think the wrong way
Then all of a sudden I be actin' like I got no brain, and I'm doin' foul shit like it's okay
But don't say I ain't ever tryna make things better, you been the only focus since the day we met up
Every time we get into it, you got me wishin' that I never broke up with my girlfriend back in Maryada
You say I don't love you then I don't know what else to do
'Cause I don't want nobody else but you
I know that I've been hurtin' you and you've been hurtin' me
So baby let's get it right because fightin' doesn't help the bruise, we both lose
You might also like
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love

Why do we fight so often?
These games are oh so ridiculous though we cannot let this shit get to us
We just need to focus on the brighter side so we can make it
And if you ain't doin' somethin' I like, then I promise you that I'ma be a little more patient

'Cause these bad vibes are contagious and our relationship is now breakin'
And I know, I know, I know your heart is constantly achin'
It's like I snatched it out of your chest and tore it up, just tore it up
And I, I played the bad guy towards you more than once, yes, more than once
Man, this shit be frustratin' me
If you ain't the one then who may it be?
We tried to make love, but we made a beast
Now we just stuck 'cause we can't agree
This is my heart, please take a piece
And put it in a safe place to remind you
There's a million other guys in the world to choose
But none of 'em will ever love you like I do, baby
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love11Embed
