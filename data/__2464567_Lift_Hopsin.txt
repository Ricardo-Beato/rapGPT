Damn, nigga, what you waitin' for? (Get down, nigga!)

People say my level is devilish when I rhyme (Yeah)
Sick of these niggas flowin', you'll never get sick of mine (Nope!)
You could tell that I be ahead of these niggas dimes (Man!)
Fuck listenin' to 'em, I'd rather be sick and die (If I)
Put it into it then he better be sick as I (Because I'm)
Very selective when it come to the shit I buy (Because)
Half the shit that's out now, man, I wouldn't spend a dime (I'd rather)
Spend the last of my money on burgers and some fries
But I ain't got no problem with kickin' it how you want it
I'm wicked, I rip it, hit to the sickest if I'm up on it
To this rap game, I'm like icing on the cake, psyche
 your life's on the way
Wack niggas on the mic they throwing fake, I done had enough of it
Now I'ma give 'em all the microphone you take
'Cause I can only take about as much as I can hold
Now I'm overflowing with rage, it's gushing out my soul

The hype will lift your mind
Now follow me we gon' make it to the top (To the top)
The hype will lift your mind
Oh no, nigga, I would never stop (Never stop)
The hype will lift your mind
Now follow me we gon' make it to the top (To the top)
The hype will lift your mind
"Ayy yo Hopsin, what you waitin' for?" Get down, nigga!

Now, I ain't the best at this shit, I just know how to do it right
I ain't seekin' a regular D, I wanna super size
Better beware me, 'cause I'm coming for you tonight
In a minute these loco rappers gon' commit suicide
You saying I ain't the genius, then, homie, you a liar
Keep it live whenever niggas'll catch me moving by
"Oh my, this nigga's adrenaline's feeling too much hype"
Spittin' and spittin', the ceiling is spinnin', because I'm
Perfect the perfect, I'm hurting your verses
I murk when you lurk it
From person to person, I'm certain you're nervous
 how to rip you is not an issue, I got it down
I seem a little foolish and loony, but I'm not a clown
The hottest round this motherfucker, now how that sound?
I'm taking ya downtown, no goin' out of bounds
No stoppin', I'm droppin' this hot shit until I got the crown
Thought you was gon' keep it locked? Homie, I brought it now

The hype will lift your mind
Now follow me we gon' make it to the top (To the top)
The hype will lift your mind
Oh no, nigga, I would never stop (Never stop)
The hype will lift your mind
Now follow me we gon' make it to the top (To the top)
The hype will lift your mind
"Ayy yo Hopsin, what you waitin' for?" Get down, nigga!
I keep it wicked as this shit'll get steady flippin' the script on rappers who act like they hit it to just sick
It's hideous shit, man  spit is legit, they ain't no hittin' the bricks
And after I take the game then I'm strippin' your chick
That goes for all y'all people, only one who can stop me is my alter ego
But he don't come out because his style they fall in lethal
Like a teenager who's feeling down I guess it fall with needles
Guess he had no heroes, though he adjust his styles to fall with Weeble
Niggas is feeling me 'cause my ability as a real MC
Allows me to create some hyperactivity
You silly g if you thinking that you can fuck with this
You ain't up with this ruggedness, ugliness, sucka suck a dick
I say whatever, I want the cleverness and chumps to ever step up
And finally here I'm revving it up
Whatever you had gone for yourself, I'm messing it up
I'm sick of all this wack bullshit, oh yes it's enough! (Yes it's enough!)

The hype will lift your mind
Now follow me we gon' make it to the top (To the top)
The hype will lift your mind
Oh no, nigga, I would never stop (Never stop)
The hype will lift your mind
Now follow me we gon' make it to the top (To the top)
The hype will lift your mind
"Ayy yo Hopsin, what you waitin' for?" Get down, nigga!Embed
