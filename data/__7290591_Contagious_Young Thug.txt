I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious

I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
'Cause I be showing love, always met with fake shit
But that's what's in my heart, I could never change it
I just wish that things were reciprocated

I told my lawyer, "Change the situation"
Told the judge that I was always fakin'
But I know it's in my heart and I feel it breakin'
Told him, "Let go of my boys, that would be amazing"
Try to blink out every time, I'm hidden in different spaces
Bought the same LaFerrari and told 'em keep it basic
Put up on them same lil' boys, told them, "Let's get to racing"
She don't even know what it is, now, boy, my money weighin'
Yeah, keep on dodgin' years, my young nigga waitin'
I done gave away my Porsche, I throw up
I don't pass the torch, I pour up
Syrup, when I'm forced, I ho up
Out and in, I wreck her core
I took my finger and I remade the sore

I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
'Cause I be showing love, always met with fake shit
But that's what's in my heart, I could never change it
I just wish that things were reciprocated
You might also like
They always told me I'd be going places
Now I'm just surrounded by these different faces
But all of this applause, yeah, it came with hatred
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious

Yeah, uh
Yesterday my daughter told me, "Daddy, you the best"
I told her, "I'm makin' it back tonight, baby, pass me that vest"
I know I'm livin' the fast life, but I sign niggas and I sign checks
I put a quarter mill' on my fingers just like Lil Baby and they all baguettes
Every week I made four thousand servin' bags for my big homie
I know I wasn't doin' it forever, but it had moved me up from lonely
Sometimes you gotta take baby steps, but now you grown and gotta want it
Everything you doin'
Wonder every ho you screwin'
I ball like Harden, Jordan
I try to keep my mouth closed, but I told 'em all the stories
I had five bitches with me lit like Robert Horry
I told my bitch from every strugglin' day we buyin' the store

I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
'Cause I be showing love, always met with fake shit
But that's what's in my heart, I could never change it
I just wish that things were reciprocated
They always told me I'd be going places
Now I'm just surrounded by these different faces
But all of this applause, yeah, it come with hatred
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious5Embed
