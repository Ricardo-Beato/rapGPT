I'm trying to tell you, but you won't hear me, son
The nigga be right there in front of them buildings
Yeah, nigga, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah, nigga, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, nigga, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah, nigga, yeah

I line niggas
I do my homework, I'll find niggas
The niggas that did that they my niggas
You bring that bullshit 'round my niggas
You die, die, nigga, die

I'm right 'bout where your man'll stay, my man blew your man away
Did him dirty and ran away, who's the next candidate?
To get hit with the cannon, ayy, you little niggas wanna play
We can go back and forth in broad day
Let it off, hop in the rental car, pull away smooth
Put that twerk in that work and we at you with the tools
Nigga, we ain't selling packs no more so we ain't on the strip
Got that llama in the 'Llac strapped leaning in the whip

I line niggas
I do my homework, I'll find niggas
The niggas that did that they my niggas
You bring that bullshit 'round my niggas
You die, die, nigga, die

First, I find your bitch creep then we found a nail shop
Now would you looky here, we done found your mama's spot
It's so easy, damn, I'm greasy
Goons don't use Auto-Tune, just Yeezy
Yeah, summer now, good time to hunt you down
Keep the pump around, we catch him we gon' slump him now
Timing is everything, I plot it out perfect
Drop a bag off to my nigga just to make it worth it

I line niggas
I do my homework, I'll find niggas
The niggas that did that they my niggas
You bring that bullshit 'round my niggas
You die, die, nigga, die

Nigga, what up?
These niggas think I'm playing with 'em, yeah
Niggas smiling and shit, go 'head, nigga
Keep thinking I'm careful
I'll shoot the shit out of these niggas, man
I let my niggas go, watch (I line niggas)
Oh my God, y'all niggas know me (I line niggas)
Y'all wasn't supposed to let me get this money
Now what? (I line niggas)3Embed
