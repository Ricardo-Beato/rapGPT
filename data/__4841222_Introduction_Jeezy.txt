Hey, Young. When you first started this shit, it was for your hood. It was for your block. Now, the world is your hood, my nigga. We got more shit to straighten out; more people to motivate; more people to talk to; more people that's gon' listen. Damn, my nigga, you still here? They-a thought you'd've fell off by now. Guess it's true what they say, huh? They hate you when you smarter. But this is Trap Or Die 2. Don Cannon! The return of the Snowman! Come on, my nigga, what's better than that? I'm asking you (Let's go!)

Fell off? I'm bout to pick up where I left off
Like when cuz' used to front up that whip, got it the hell off
Took that bullshit to the block and went the hell off
It even left a scent in my jeans—can't get the smell off
And to move this, you got to be quick 'cause it'll melt off
And you stuck with eggnog in the bag, and it won't sell off
Sell off? Yeah, I doubt that it will sell off
Every nigga you sell it to will call you 'til you turn your cell off
And every day I'm stuck in this hell, can't get the hell off
Back then, they wasn't wishing me well, wanted me well off
Niggas trying steal all my clients, turn my till off
Won't be happy til I put up my bags and turn my scale off
So I'm grinding til your battery's low and your scale off
So I guess I'm stuck flipping these words until I'm well-off
That money's like a movie, just something you gotta see
You just can't say you're real, it's something you gotta be

103, nigga!
Yeah
103, nigga!
Yeah

Young, they talking 'bout you fell off. Ain't no horses around here, nigga! Come on, man—"fell off." Horses? Oh, I must've got it confused with "Porsches." Hey Young—what, you fell out your Porsche? Crazy-ass niggas, "fell off". Well, if you ain't got it by now, it ain't meant for you to get. Trap Or Die 2! The man, the myth, the legend—Don Cannon! Snowman!Embed
