Yo, Nas, whattup?
Yeah, whattup, kid?
What goin' on, Ill?
I'm just tryna tell these brothers where I'm comin' from
You know what I'm sayin'?
Alright, kick it

I'm the nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Gimme a Smith-N-Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
I'm rollin' with a mob and run from the cops
Drive stolen cars and shoot many Glocks
A marijuana addict, if niggas want static, they had it
'Cause I flip just like a acrobatic
I'm always on the corners rollin' up Sess
When I dress, it's never nothin' less than Guess
So I walk with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committin' sins and my friends sell crack
I got it goin' on, my knuckle game is strong
Sip Dom Pérignon and then carry on
Army certifieds, keep a Rent-A-Ride
Strippin' mad hoes and kick 'em to the side
See, I'm the type of brother who keeps a four-pounder
Start a lot of shit and shoot at out-of-towners
At every block party, I try to catch a body
All for props, tell your pops call the cops
See, now I'm on the run, but still havin' fun
Livin' by the MAC, my gear is all black
I keep killin' because I'm ready and I'm willin' and I'm a villain
You might also like
What?
What?
Wha-a-a-t?

I got beef with the President and still lovin' it
Tryin' to make plans to overthrow the government
It won't work 'cause niggas don't believe enough
They'd rather stand on the corners and receive a cuff
Around they wrist, you don't like the sound of this rebel
But my country doesn't want me
They'd rather hunt me, but you'll never catch us all
While you fuckin' with the dealers, we'll be stickin' up the malls
Full of anger, all about danger
Pullin' out my banger, stabbin' up a stranger
I hear Walkie-Talkies in my sleep
And use a whole lot of slang when I speak
Walkin' with a vest, the projects is where I rest
And the streets keep me stressed
Starin' at your face, wait for you to make a sound
That's when I take you down, shoot you up and suit you up
All in black and put you in a box
A hard rock with a .25 in my socks
Aimin' at your temple, so take the diamonds off your hands
I'm buckwild like Billy Bear and Ganz
Prince of pistoleers, words are crystal clear
And this you should fear
The maniac keeps killin'
I'm known as a outlaw 'cause I'm a villain
What?
What?
Wha-a-a-t?

I keep bullets racin' out the barrels of a Magnum
Put 'em to sleep and leave the doctors to tag 'em
A outlaw, although I never wear a holster
In every town, you see my face is on a poster
Hear so many gunshots, my eardrums should pop
Eyesight should stop from seein' mad niggas drop
To the concrete, I got police puttin' chalk on the street
And this is done once a week
I'm out to kill like Navy Seals
I'm crazy ill, and what I can't do, my .380 will
I never play with a AK
Because I'm fine with a .9 and if caught, I'll do lesser time
Sometimes, you gotta plan shit and understand it
See, I'm a bandit whose hand'll itch
Without a gun in it, Nas is runnin' it
I stay blunted, I'm the project's most wanted
My voice is like magic
My cassette is the clip and your radio's the Automatic
So when I'm in your town, duck down
Or take fire, whatever you desire
But I'm on point, you might miss
Never fight this, you'll be sightless when I strike this
So roll the dice, I'm stoppin' the bank
It's ill how I got the pen droppin' the ink
No one can stop this apocalypse on your record player
A method layer, so run and tell your Mayor
Nas the parlayer, you better say your prayer
I'm the New York City slayer
I play high-post and then lay low
Parlé slow and wear horns, not a halo
And keep killin' 'cause I'm a villain9Embed
