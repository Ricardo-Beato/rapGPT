14 ContributorsNever Be the Same Again Lyrics
Yeah, damn mom
It's gone be aight, don't worry about it
Know what I'm saying, I'ma just go
I'ma just pack my shit
Peace out, aight
Don't worry about it
I still love you though

I'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)
I'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)
The things you put me through (Ooooohhhh)
I tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)
But you'll never understand, noooooo
Now it's time that I move on (Move on!)

Ey yo I gave you everything and you still fucked my head up
Children (I'm sorry Ghost) Not now, shut up
Got back off the road, heard you sleepin' with fam
The whole hood ran up on me, I was like "Damn!"
So I stepped back, sized the whole situation patiently
Arguments, face up in the air like you hatin' me
Ask you one question, was it good?
He have you on the wall like me, was it hood?
You probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top
Grabbing the sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot
I came home on Friday, Saturday I found out
That night I cried with the kids, I was out
And my man, I'ma do him in
And the Lord knows best what I'ma do to him
And you can keep the crib - all I'm sayin' is
Let me find out you got men around my kids
You might also like
I'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)
I'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)
The things you put me through (Ooooohhhh)
I tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)
But you'll never understand, noooooo
Now it's time that I move on (Move on!)

It was the beauty that caught me and held my soul hostage
'Member those days had you smellin' my boxers
Old Gold up in the hood and bigged up
We could push through the grimiest streets
Then throw it up, like "That's my nigga!"
Anybody got something bad to say
Son'll come through and deliver
Brushin' off his 88 Clarks, y'all can't touch him
I bet a wad on it, y'all can't fuck with him
Semi-shy, and I'm laid back, crystal hats
Heard ya water broke I was like "Phewww" and ran back
I ran back fast, broke my arm in the mix
To find out that bird nigga tappin' my shit
It's alright 'do, maybe he came up with the right dough
Bigger dick, I don't know, must have been the best flow
This thing here, ever man in the world goes through
But fuck that, I put a lot of money up, I'm hatin'!
I'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)
I'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)
The things you put me through (Ooooohhhh)
I tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)
But you'll never understand, noooooo
Now it's time that I move on (Move on!)

It was like ecstasy girl
Found out it was Disney World
Had us living in a fantasy world
I wish we never broke up, girl
It was like ecstasy girl
Found out it was Disney World
Had us living in a fantasy world
I wish we never broke up, girl

Ey yo, you killed me with that, "who bought this?" I bought that
Knowin' damn well in all reality you bought jack
You ain't lift one finger, but you claimin' what's yours
Runnin' all through the house, bugged out, slammin' doors
We used to dress like twins - sweats, baby blue Timbs
You even scratched my Benz, let the pigs in
You think that I'm the biggest bird in America?
Catch me on TV, I'm come back, never the...
I'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)
I'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)
The things you put me through (Ooooohhhh)
I tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)
But you'll never understand, noooooo
Now it's time that I move on (Move on!)Embed
