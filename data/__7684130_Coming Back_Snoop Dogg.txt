Big Snoop D-O-Double G
Ayo Battlecat
You know what time it is, it's time to do this shit we usually do
Let's go
Hah
What's my name?
Say what?

When times get tough, I want to give it up
And I just can't let go like that
And girl, how long it took to build it up
There must be some reason why he callin' back (I'm back)

I'm back in this bitch ready to do it again
Light that  Chronic, where my Gin?
They lettin' real niggas up out of the pen
Roller skate, now roll again
I hit my sweet spot, streets got back on lead
Beatbox, heat rocks, talk that shit
Plottin', plan it, bakin' inhale
Shakin' no shakin, while makin' demands
A lil' tension in the hood, but I'm loved by my fans
Same Dog stance and I get it from my hands
Really don't talk when its' time to do advance
Take a chance on yourself like I did on me
I was amazed like a kid on me
No smut, no shit on me
So far up, that I can't look now
But every once in a while I find my way back down
You might also like
When times get tough, I want to give it up
And I just can't let go like that (Man)
And girl, how long it took to build it up
There must be some reason why he callin' back (Can all the people say)

Woah (Yeah, c'mon)
Hah, yeah
And all the ladies in the back, lemme hear you say
Woah (Yeah, c'mon now)
Yeah, feel good to ya
Yeah, 'cause it's good for ya, c'mon
Yeah, get ya groove on
A-get ya skate on, roll on

Hey Doggy (Yeah)
What's that mean?
That means I'm back on the floor, get ya dough
Every player that I know give a fuck about a ho
Hey Doggy (Yeah)
What's that mean?
That means I'm back on the roll, gettin' more dough
And tell 'em Snoop Dogg said so
When times get tough, I want to give it up
And I just can't let go like that
And girl, how long it took to build it up
There must be some reason why he callin' back

(Yeah, so uh, heard you back on Death Row; That's right?)
Yeah, fasho1Embed
