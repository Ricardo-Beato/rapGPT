86 ContributorsSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzik Lyrics
Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter comin' around the South
Rollin' straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothin' but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bendin' corners in my 'Lac, boy
'Cause that's how we be rollin' here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kickin' the khakis and Adidas
Packin' yo' heaters 'cause you s'posed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rollin' steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginnin'
Now I'm just a player sippin' sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothin' to see

My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast
Many a niggas fallin' fast and I continue blastin', swiftly
They ain't gon' get me, got somethin' fo' em
The devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know 'em
Show 'em who's the okay
Like collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul
That's somethin' that you ain't got
That's why your style is rotâ€“ten
Stop in the land of ATL
Where nothin' but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen got my pockets, business boomin' like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get ya high (Southernplayalistic)
High (Southernplayalistic)

Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell "ho," and knock 'em up off they feet
Like a Southern hustler 'posed to do
I's in the house like... (House like...) a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Takin' 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
My crew be thick as two fat hoes sittin' off in a Brougham
I'm packin' my tag backwards if you wanna be actin' wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest boomin' Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruisin' 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't friendly, gettin' in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gafflin' me
'Cause sleep and you'll get served with some Southern hospitality
It's that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get ya high (Southernplayalistic)
High (Southernplayalistic)

Well, Southernplayalisticadillacmusik has been laid
I may wait for all day and day, be rollin' like that today, hoe
So back up off it, get up on it if you want it, y'all
Lookin' for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

Step up in my shoes, you crews sittin' on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rollin' through
Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beamin' it's seemin'
That I'm glistenin', rather gleamin'
20/20 got me leanin' to the side, full of pride
Now ain't that somethin'?
I'm dippin' into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumpin'
Thumpin' out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, P.A., OutKast, Southernplayalistic
It's that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get ya high (Southernplayalistic)
High (Southernplayalistic)
It's that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get ya high (Southernplayalistic)
High (Southernplayalistic)
It's that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get ya high (Southernplayalistic)
High (Southernplayalistic)20Embed
