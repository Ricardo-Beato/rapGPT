15 ContributorsUnder Arm Kush Lyrics
Yeah (Yeah), yeah
Yeah (Yeah), yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Uh, Burn One, LaFlare (Burn One), Gucci Mane LaFlare
Huh, street entertainment, So Icey Entertainment (Street entertainment)
Yeah, rich nigga, Bouldercrest affiliate, nigga, ha, ha
(Burn One, Burn One)

Chicken on my Jacobs, baby, meet me 'bout eleven-ish
Cut my bitch off, I went and got a better bitch (Better bitch)
Yellow 'Vette, red old school with the chrome wheels
Yellow rims on the 'Vette, same color Paul Wall's grills
I'ma start trippin' if I pop a couple X pills (Huh, huh?)
Twenty thousand self promotion cause I got no record deal (Yeah)
Ridin' 'round the town, six twelves beatin' the block down (Huh?)
Zone 6 is my stomping ground, sun valley don’t play around (Yeah)
Pitching cocaine like Greg Maddux on the mound (Damn)
Your partner hit a foul cause he shorted me a pound

Under arm kush so you know it smell musty (Yeah)
Sold a couple ounces just to buy some red monkeys (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
‘74 old school set it on Ashanti’s (Yeah)
Still rather get my car washed by a junkie (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Under arm kush so you know it smell musty (Yeah)
Sold a couple grams just to buy some red monkeys (Yeah, yeah)
Moved to Atlanta, set it on Ashanti’s (Yeah)
Took it to the hood and got it washed by the zombies
You might also like
And I'm Arizona bound (Bound), is you down to take a no-doze? (No-doze)
With a big booty broad freaky with the dope clothes
Light green mid same colour as my shell toes
Made your girl my girl 'cause she fronted me some elbows (Huh?)
Chopper with the cooler, dawg, I'ma have to show 'em
Matte with the muffler case I have to blow 'em
Twenty-six donk riding twenty-six inches (Inches)
Twenty-six lawyers, nigga, twenty-six bitches
I give it to a nigga if I catch the nigga slippin'
Hit the East side, gotta ask my permission, uh

Under arm kush so you know it smell musty (Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah)
Sold a couple ounces just to buy some red monkeys (Yeah, yeah ,yeah)
‘74 old school set it on Ashanti’s (Yeah)
Still rather get my car washed by a junkie (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Under arm kush so you know it smell musty (Yeah)
Sold a couple grams just to buy some red monkeys (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Moved to Atlanta, set it on Ashanti’s (Yeah)
Took it to the hood and got it washed by the zombies

I was in the seventh grade with a half an ounce of ready made (Ready made)
Money rules everything the hard broke my razor blade
J’s at my door, I got money on the floor
I’m a million dollar nigga on the motherfucking low
I be working twerkin', powder pills, crack and that syrup (Syrup)
I’m in my foreign car, dawg, it’s from western Europe (Europe)
Thousand dollar ounce same price as my insurance (Insurance)
South style my plates, so let's trap it in the furnace (See)
Shawty talking to me, man, but I ain’t even hear her (Yeah, yeah)
Seen her dash last week and I ain’t even see her
I'm a fitted man, silly man
Gucci, what’s the dinner, dawg? (Dawg)
Shawty low told me “Units in the city, dawg”
Under arm kush so you know it smell musty (Yeah)
Sold a couple ounces just to buy some red monkeys (Yeah, yeah ,yeah)
‘74 old school, set it on Ashanti’s (Yeah)
Still rather get my car washed by a junkie (Yeah)Embed
