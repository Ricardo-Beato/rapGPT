I'm from the city in the Midwest
Best city in the whole wide-wide world, say now
I'm from the city in the Midwest
Best city in the whole wide-wide world, say now
I'm from the city in the Midwest
Best city in the whole wide-wide world, hey
City in the whole wide world, hey
City in the whole wide world, hey

I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow

I'm back, I'm back, I'm cool, I'm cool, Westside representative
All me, no ghost, no 16-bit like Sega Genesis
All G-ball on the board, Soundtrakk
On the track, Gemini, on the job, Shayla G
On the G, Sarah Green, for the green, free Chilly
And I'm back on my thing for the listeners' ears
What you are about to-to witness is

From the M-A-D-I-to-the-S-to-the-O-N
Potent, to get you open
Movin' like a nigga supposed to
Get the dough on the go with the flow that I'm holding

I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow

Love, got the Windy City on my back
So I'm back on my grizzle like a bearskin rug
Plus I'm laying on the floor, blame it on the Go
Little rapper turn it out because I'm very plugged
I convert, I can work anywhere in the world
You can ask my brother Hugg
He'll concur that I'm serious with the words
To the man up above, thank you very much
That I got what I got and I'm at where I'm at
Like an "a" in a circle, with a pay, lil Urkel
What they say when they see lil G
From the F to the F with the amazing verbals
While they race in a circle like they racing a gerbil
I race in a circle like I'm racing a horse
I'm racing a Porsche, while they racing in place
They race in a cage, I race on a course
'Course, that case in the court did not defer the dream
I am still a raisin in the sun, raging against the machine
From the M-A-D-I-to-the-S-to-the-O-N
Potent, to get you open
Movin' like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow that I'm holding

I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow

I'm from the city in the Midwest

Best city in the whole wide-wide world, hey

Hey, hey, don't hate on me
My tank on full, your tank on E
Look good on you, look great on me
'Cause I'ma go and never gonna S-T-O-P
Like hey, hey, don't hate on me
My tank on full, your tank on E
Look good on you, look great on me
'Cause I'ma go and never gonna S-T-O-P
Like hey, hey, I'm the boss, rock Junya Watanabe Lacoste
Beyond clean, in phenom jeans, little rap Isaac Asimov
I love my momma and the ramen that she raised me off
A '80s baby on fire like the safety off
Got my hood riding higher than some 28s
Off of everything I spoke like a 84
And they in love with him and I'm in love with them
And we'll never ride dubs again, no we won't
Trying to get Above the Rim
A little too short to dunk, so we donk

From the M-A-D-I-to-the-S-to-the-O-N
Potent, to get you open
Movin' like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow that I'm holding

I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
I got my go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go gadget flow
