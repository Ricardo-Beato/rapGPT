23 ContributorsShootinâ€™ Moves Lyrics

Piranhas, stay on my toes like orthodontists
Dopeman Nikes, George Costanza
Nigga, it's colonic when I vomit, get in niggas ass
You's a fag just for thinking gay, nigga you an entree
Better yet an Hors D'ouvre, nigga you a cold sore
Lips of a prostitute, buff-ass nigga
Having trouble with the childproof, nigga outlined you
Don't make me go back to that, nigga on a Mongoose
Rest in peace Ron Gook, sitting in a old school
Smoking on some Goku, buds like Dragon Balls
Tequila with the lime juice, times two cyborgs
Smoking on some grapefruit, hoes come twice
But it's three if I eat the cooch, peach coop, no roof
When my hoes coming through, my bitches rap better than you
So quit worrying about what I'm gon' do
Cause I could give a flying fuck about what you doing

I'm shooting moves
So nigga quit worrying, 'bout what I'm doing
Cause I could give a flying fuck about what you doing
My nigga, I'm shooting moves
So nigga quit worrying, 'bout what I'm doing
Cause I could give a flying fuck about what you doing
My nigga, I'm shooting moves

Used to wait for the Dexter, smoking on that Newport
Stacks in the Foamposite, work in the Jansport
Praying for a personal, every time I go to court
Eastland shopping bag, ho's at the food court
Around the time you got your sounds put in that mammoth
I was on Clairmount, 3 for 10 slanging
Shining like the silver on a Air Max '95
Took this rap shit serious about in '05
Got these niggas scared, ask them if I'm lying
Because I shit on niggas bar for bar without trying
Ain't in your top three? Then bitch, you can't count
Only thing that makes sense is dollar amount
Ounce to the face, stank go to waste
You still tryna find a place to record your mixtape
This ain't here for ya
Even Jesus tried to break teeth for dropping vocals1Embed
