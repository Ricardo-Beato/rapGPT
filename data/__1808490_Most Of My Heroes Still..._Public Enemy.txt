5 ContributorsMost Of My Heroes Still... Lyrics
Public Enemy
"Yeah, y'all"
"Hold it now!"

"Yeah y'all, that's right"

You may never heard it
I be spittin' on the senior circuit
After splittin' from the major circus
Check how I reword this
Duckin' young tigers shittin' the woods
Some cats be up to no good
I'm Jack Nigga-less to my hood
From the 'Velt, Roosevelt
You know what's wild
I never felt like some motherless or fatherless child
So I grew up to change the style
I don't care what that company spent
It's inevitable, they can't prevent the event
Through it all, I tell em all to stand tall
If I fall, just add another face to the wall
After all, these are the faces that they won't show
Cause these are the names they don't want you to know
Yes we can, they say no we can't
'Cause most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp
You might also like
"Yeah y'all, that's right"
"Most of my heroes..."
Still don't appear on no stamp
"Most of my heroes..."
Still don't appear on no stamp

"Armageddon has been in effect, go get a late pass! Step!"
"Hold it now!"

From the pin, of the mind, of the Minister (Word!)
Those oppose, and the S1's will see ya (Word!)
All praises are due, don't forget this
(Public Enemy) On the grind, now dig this!

"Yeah y'all, that's right"
"Most of my heroes..."
Still don't appear on no stamp
"Most of my heroes..."
Still don't appear on no stamp

No envy in me, RIP C. Delores Tucker
Salute, Cynthia McKinney
And the crowd goes "Whoa!"
To some of my heroes, be most of y'all's foes
So I stay on my toes
Belafonte's to Biko's
Some dying in-cog-negro
Che, Chavezes, and Castro's
You don't know how it goes
"Ay, yo, yo, yo"
"Get it together"

"Yeah y'all, that's right"
"Most of my heroes..."
Still don't appear on no stamp
"Most of my heroes..."
Still don't appear on no stamp

Public Enemy, we back on the map
Yeah, yeah, c'mon

Say who, what be starin' at me
Expect me, Prince, the First Lady, and Muhammad Ali
Huey P. Newton, H. Rap Brown, Marcus Garvey, Angela Davis
Don't get no plain cramp, my heroes still ain't got no stamp
Kick that shit, G
Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp (Word)
Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp (Word)
Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp (Word)
Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp (Word)
"Yeah, y'all"2Embed
