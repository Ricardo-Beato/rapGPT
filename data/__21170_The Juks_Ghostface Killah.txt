6 ContributorsThe Juks Lyrics
Your roll, your roll (My roll, my roll?)
Ayo, Maurice, go to the store for me, son
My roll, ayo, tell that bitch Keisha come here (Yo, Keisha)
Ayo, tell that bitch Keisha come here, son (Get two Dutches)
(Holler-holler, Keisha)
Niggas rollin' for money over there, dun (I know, I know)
Make sure they bring his ice on, I want that honey bracelet
I want some of that, though (Aight), they gettin' it over there

Ayo, what's in it? Three M's in the bank
Shoot it, oh, you gotta stop?
Six bitches to the top
A four and better, beat the five
I looked him in his eyes, grabbed the dice
Son, I'll five 'em better twice for ya fuckin' life
Money feed good, all downs is a bet
Meanin' any money on the ground is a bet
Open up the pool, give the dice some room
Aight bitches, shoes, Pampers, girls need a nice room
That's a six, I told you that bitch ain't claustrophobic
If you ass-bettin', you just bet yo' ass
Nah, I got the money, I even got one with me
And 'Von bringin', too, he on his way to come get me
He just hit me, he'll be here in fifteen
With them two things, grey Benz and maroon seats
I got a quarter-mil in each of my fur sleeves
The rest is in my long johns, boots and jeans
Come in the buildin', before I pay I wanna see a three
Come in the buildin', nigga
You might also like
Pop your collar (Do whatever you do best)
Just pop your collar (Up the ladder to the hill of success), do us

Ayo, ayo, he had three down and bet three M's
So you know what happened to him
He got three rounds, we all ex-dealers
Ex-killers, Wu gon' ride to the death for the skrilla
I hold my own and rep my niggas
Always oil my guns and inspect my triggas
Sometimes I call my lawyer just to check my figures
Told me not to worry, all checks is clearin'
So fuck my rhymes, I got the best appearance
And I survive through project experience
You wanna roll dice or roll and ride?
No matter, you gon' get holes inside
See, you fuckin' with Theodore Dieni
You fuckin' with a metaphor kingpin
You fuckin' with him? Wu-Tang
Wu, you fuckin' with them?
Dun, you wanna gun to make you slim?
So I'ma pop my collar, get my dollars
Pop all parlors and fuck with money scholars (Huh?)
Know what I mean? (Street scholars, street scholars)
Matter of fact, I'm gonna fuck with Rockweilers
Pop your collar (Pop off, do whatever you do best, ayo)
Get your dollars (New York, up the ladder to the hill of success)
Pop or holla (Don't talk, you know what we gonna do)
Just pop your collar (Do yours, say no more, say no more), do us

Bent off the Jack y Dom, rollin' the dice with a happy arm
Everything good, money on wood
Bank stoppers, I send them home broke
Have them all in they stash, bettin' they own coat
I takes it all, fifty and better, you make the call
Watch you break your all, big sixes cuz I'm a nigga who don't like to fall
High roller, see how my dice kiss
Push, you pay me, and if I roll trips you pay me twice, bitch
I rocks, believe it or not
Come broke to a dice game, step off and leave with a knot
Head cracks is all you see when I'm hot, what's in the pot?
A 100 G's in the bank to the man who got it stopped
My hand is like a gun, feel the heat when it's cocked
4-5-6 your heart drop, way deep in your socks
You wanna walk, book your ass down the street with a bop
The drinks is on you tonight for my peeps in the spot

Pop your collar (Do whatever you do best, yo)
Get your dollars (Up the ladder to the hill of success)
Pop your collar (Theodore Unit, you know what we gonna do)
Just pop your collar (Pop off), do us (Eat, nigga, eat)Embed
