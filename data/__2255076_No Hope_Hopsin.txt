42 ContributorsNo Hope Lyrics
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me

I'm fucking tired of playing God when you in need
The choices you made are on you completely, what's it got to do with me?
You mobbing through the streets, clueless but it's not like you could see
You know I'm cool, so you take it like it's an opportunity
To get some free money, damn you ain't got no shame
You been living off of my dough, bitch I'm not your bank
You be asking to borrow knowing that you not gon' pay
Abusing the privilege my nigga, that is not okay
Why don't you get it? I shouldn't have to explain it
Our foundation should be on some real shit, not you asking for payments
So create a dream, then get off your ass and then chase it
I'm mad and frustrated dealing with this shit, I'm lacking the patience
You the homie, I don't mind you coming around dog
But I should not have to pay for your downfall
Choose your faith, but still even if your day seem great
Just know I got your fucking back either way, you already know
You might also like
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me

Now my own family tripping, I ain't think I would get this shit from siblings
The money I'm making is yours right? It's a given
Let me tell y'all why I get a different feeling
Y'all was living good watching me and my momma struggle once we get the bills in
I don't recall any help or sympathies
Since 15 I been paying rent, you know what that did to me?
Could have been here, had this rap shit popping off, if y'all had lent the hand
But y'all wasn't worried 'bout helping us, you had a different plan
Focused on yourself, and now you holding on for help
You were self centered, and that was just an open door to hell
Oh, you need some money now, yeah of course I know the deal
You want the benefits without playing the courses on the field
You ain't even doing your best or trying
Don't ask me for shit unless you dying, this is me testifying
Just know that when your bright days going straight
I couldn't have your back without feeling strange but you already know
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me

Money can leave you isolated 'cause people are shady
So why debate it? They love cash and fantasize to make it
To get it, we'll fight and break shit, develop unrighteous ways
Even taking the side with Satan, thankfully I've awaken
Foes who abused the privilege by having those who were gifted
Around them close and they vision, stop corroding your friendships
Don't be having your hands out, smiling, hoping to get shit
Mooching off of a man's treasure is bogus and it's just
Not the way you should function with brothers when you're amongst 'em
That is what we call punk shit and it can leave you stuck in
A boat that's already sunken, this can happen to anyone
Sisters, brothers and cousins, they disrespecting, then fuck 'em
That's the way that the fountain leaks, keep on pushing your boundaries
In due time I am bound to see all the snakes that surrounded me
I know that if my brightest days turn gray
You wouldn't have my back unless there was pay, it ain't no secret
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
