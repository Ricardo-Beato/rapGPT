On the road to riches
My car fast, my bitches bad
My locs on, my beat thump, my pistol stashed
It's transition, now it ain't no looking back
My bro home, my daughter straight, now what mo' can a nigga ask?
How it's looking? I'm gone keep getting cash
Cause I'm like that Rolex second hand behind the crystal glass
I keep moving, keep hustling till I see improvement
I know that I can't win them all, but I can't keep losing
What I used to tell myself when life seemed useless
When it felt like if I was to change it'd be for music
When Pac showed us that the pain we felt was not exclusive
Was in the hood, but Shawn Carter showed us no excuses
Now kids tell me I'm the reason that they finished school
And if it wasn't for The Marathon, they wouldn't have made it through it
All on Twitter like, nigga gone and drop your new shit
I'm just taking the time to make the proper use of my influence
A couple hundred thousand cash, a few haters
Lawyer fees for new cases, and a box of blunts later, I give you
The Streets Illustrated, latest issue
The update on my state of mind, the everything I been through
Theme music for young hustlers to get they ends to
To prove to every young nigga banging at what you can do
Theme music for young hustlers to get they ends to
To prove to every young nigga banging of what you can do
My
Beat banging
Gold chain swanging
And all money in, still the song that I'm singing, I'm on
Can't fade him, fate can't change him
Still screaming fuck a bitch, and these bitches can't blame him
It's true
When you in the game, to these hoes can't play him
Respect a nigga pimpin' cause they know
He don't save them, that's right
Can't brake him cause these niggas ain't making
Still try with all they might, but I rebuke you Satan
Let's prayYou might also likeEmbed
