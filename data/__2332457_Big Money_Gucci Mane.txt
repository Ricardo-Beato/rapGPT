Big money, dollar bills
That's all that she want, dollar bills
Ballin', ballin' on you suckas
That's all that she see, money fallin'
Money fallin', money fallin'
That's all that she see, money fallin'
Money fallin', money fallin'
That's all that she see, money fallin'

Aye, I break a bitch before I make a bitch
And I take a brick  before I bake a lick
Gotta cut this and it's an '86
And it's red and white like a peppermint
Got a charger with a body kit, cause the 26 inches couldn't fit
Got a Rolex, costs 60 cent
Police pulled me over, said they couldn't see through tint
Obama Kush, 10 presidents
I spend my whole month rent on an ounce of it
Got a 45 dome, leave the house without it
Got Saks Fifth Ave in my closet, bitch
I got a college bitch, I didn't graduate
But I'm college rich I need knowledge bitch
Wayne Gretzky wrist with no hockey stick
And I ain't fuckin' with you, got a picky dick
I got your girl, lil' stick on my pocket book
Sayin' watcha wanna do, but won't knock the bitch
I'm in a drop 6
I might talk slick, but baby girl, I ain't here just to pop shit
Need 30 more man in this topless bitch
Gimme topp kit kick rocks bitch
Need you in the car to get topless
Got a bitch, 1 hoe, I'mma flight risk

Ballers, ballers, man and that's all she date is ball player
Ballers, ballers, man and that's all she date, that's all she date
Ballers, ballers, man and that's all she date is ball player
Ballers, ballers, man and that's all she date, that's all she date

Big money, dollar bills
That's all that she want, dollar bills
Ballin', ballin' on you suckas
That's all that she see, money fallin'

Gucci Mane in verse, no reverse, need to go to church
Girl please don't come 'round on the verse, want your ass the worst
Damn, Guwop, you know you need to hush, you gon' make me blush
Girl gon' suck my dick, I'm in a rush, I'm about to bust
Smokin' cannabis in a bluff, bitch get on this bus
18 inch, bitch bocuwap, 3hun, no I never trust
Man, your nigga broke, he a lie buy you just a car
That necklace cost me damn near 30 thousand, this changed her heart
My young bitch would take the charge
Fuckin' so many hoes that she paranoid
Private jet, we on our way to Illinois
Dome got me won't answer the phone for my boy
We at your dome probably boxes fuckin' with the squad
Ballers, ballers, man and that's all she date is ball player
Ballers, ballers, man and that's all she date, that's all she date
Ballers, ballers, man and that's all she date is ball player
Ballers, ballers, man and that's all she date, that's all she date

Big money, dollar bills
That's all that she want, dollar bills
Ballin', ballin' on you suckas
That's all that she see, money fallin'
Money fallin', money fallin'
That's all that she see, money fallin'
Money fallin', money fallin'
That's all that she see, money fallin'1Embed
