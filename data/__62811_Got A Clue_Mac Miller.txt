23 ContributorsGot A Clue Lyrics
Ayo
You see that girl walk by, man?
Oof, she's somethin' else
I gotta say somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?

Uh, glance at her when she walkin' by
The type that never stop to talk to guys
She alone and you not surprised
'Cause she ain't fit for no other man
So you approach as a gentleman
"Hello, ma'am, today you lookin' pretty damn elegant"
I think she get the message like a telegram
I'ma be your cab or your yellow van
Tell me where, I'll take you where you wanna go
To the top, she perfect and she oughta know
When she walkin' by the studio
You can see my heart beatin' through my clothes
She ain't around, time movin' slow
I wanna be wherever you gon' go
And I wonder if she know my name
She shine like she ain't know what rain is
The game is the same as it was as some lame kids
You wanna hang with her every single day, it's funny
'Cause your friends say you whipped
Every late night, you gotta go and dip
To pick her up, and I've been sick of sluts
And this girl? She ain't gon' give it up
She want me puttin' in work like school
And I be smitten when she here, like a fool
But keep my cool, gotta be smooth
Eyes like Elmer, got me glued
These other dudes is not for you
I think Cupid musta shot you, too
You might also like
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I wrote a couple bars for you
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I had to write a couple bars for you

I seen her at the dry cleaner, locked eyes
It was rainin', she lookin' like sunshine
I told her we could have a fun time
Let me just take you out to lunch
I'm a really nice guy, I ain't gon' hurt you
I ain't even 'bout to flirt, too
'Cause I'ma be straight up with you
And don't bring no make-up with you
I just wanna chill, kick it at the crib
Every time we kiss, it tickle on my lips
I love the way that you lookin' at me
I just wanna see you lookin' happy
You grab me, pull me, tease me, fool me
Ain't gon' let me get it at the movies
Why you sittin' over a few seats?
Come and move closer to me
Uh, I hope you know that you got me
Here's my number, girl, you can call me
And if you guessin', don't stress
'Cause I ain't havin' no mess
She the only thing on my mind
I think about her all the time
And it's hard 'cause I'm on my grind
But I think I'ma call her mine

Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I wrote a couple bars for you
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I had to write a couple bars for you1Embed
