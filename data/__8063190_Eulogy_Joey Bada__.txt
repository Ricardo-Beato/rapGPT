40 ContributorsEulogy Lyrics
Huh
I love that, like
I'm up feelin' right, the way niggas do this shit, man
Shit is a honor
It's a honor, really
Yeah (Badmon)
Uh

Just lookin' at my generation
Overdosed on blue pills, caught up in the Matrix
Gotta spread love, though, 'cause it's a lotta hatred
Know it's a marathon and these motherfuckers racist
Everybody's dangerous, posin' with the stainless just to be famous
It's like you gotta be brainless, for real
'Cause believin' in things that ain't even real
They thought he was a gangsta, they thought he'd never tell
Time will tell, it reveals and it heals so I chill
Another day, another deal, made another mill'
But what do that mean when these kids still gettin' killed over no reason?
R.I.P. my cousin Rell', yo, I'm still grievin'
That's why I'm usually unavail
But what I need to call for help for? Bitch, I put myself on
Niggas behind bars vent to me on my cell phone
Hate it when they gotta leave the message at the dial tone
But they know I gotta do me if we gon' eat
So I proceed to unleash the beast, and decease the beast
Let me speak my peace, and if you reach, I teach
I'm only here because I'm known in the streets
I ain't proud about it but I wouldn't ride without it, ayy
Push me to my limit, bet you see I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Can these niggas fuck with me? I highly doubt it
I'm mildly psychotic, hide the body in the trunk
And still hit the hydraulics and prolly forget about it
The flow's a sick dot, it see through the trick knowledge
Never did college and I still raised dollars for tuition
You could buy my album for like eight dollars
Best money that you'll ever spend, I promise
Best money that you'll ever spend, I promise
Best money that you'll ever lend, I promise
Best money that you'll ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This for my niggas sittin' on the big wheels
Mommies in the six inch heels
And to my haters who'll never know how this shit feels
This shit get real, yeah, uh
This for my niggas sittin' on the big wheels
And my mommies in the six inch heels
And to my haters who'll never know how this shit feels
This shit get real, uh, uh

Ancient teachings on the wall
Hop in the van, bust a cap and we off
Welcome to the upper echelon, stretch your arm, um
I'm feelin' synonymous to Nostradamus
A movin' monument, can't die anonymous
Just tryna make a name for myself, they fraudulent
Get blown out the water fuckin' with the conglomerates
Swimming' mainstream like a hungry hip-hop-potamus
You ain't a great white guy, you just a great white lie
With great ties to what seems to be a great white guy
I got state-wide eyes
One stay on the rise while the other on the enterprise (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

This for my niggas sittin' on the big wheels
And my mommies in the six inch heels
And to my haters who'll never know how this shit feels
This shit get real, yeah
This for my niggas sittin' on the big wheels
And my mommies in the six inch heels
And to my haters who'll never know how this shit feels
This shit get real, uh, uh
Then they say we crazy and delirious
Addicted to drugs, I'm just livin' it up
I put a limit on none, pull my thoughts let it run
Drown in emotion, swim in the outcome
They say problems is opportunities in disguise
And each day I learn, I'm just tryna get it by
Get high for that man and never mind
Mind never matter, neither or ever did time
Fuck clocks, let that shit unwind
Fuck rocket ships, I blast off in my mind
That don't cost a dime, I got unlimited rides
Roller coaster coast between space and time
Uh, what's the matter with this world that we livin' in?
Full of fake snake dealin' niggas and the middleman
Tryna plot against my dividends again
They'll believe in anything when the pyramid, uh3Embed
