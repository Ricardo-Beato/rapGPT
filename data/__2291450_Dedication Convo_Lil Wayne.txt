6 ContributorsDedication Convo Lyrics
It's everybody man
Everybody cross the Grove, everybody cross the Grove
You already knew, man
If you don't know what I'm saying
Then play this shit back, 'cause I don't know what I'm saying
But this is a dedication to the streets
The gangstas, the hood, the fallen soldiers
The down-ass chicks and the people in the slums
Young Money, muh'fucka (dedication to my Mom)
You understand me?
Dedication to our family
That was coming, you see how I spit
And we are Young Money, man
This is a dedication, people
It's gangsta grills, you motherfuckers
Understand that, and who I am?
I am Young Wayne, but now you can call me
This is "Tha Carter," peopleYou might also likeEmbed
