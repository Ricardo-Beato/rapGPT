Believe it or not, that is the sound of an invasion. Yes, that is the sound created by the musical invasion of America by the world's hottest recording group: A Tribe Called Quest
They are non-conformists to such a great degree that no two members ever dress alike. And many educators consider their popularity resulted from their becoming symbols of teenage rebellion
They certainly are raking in a lot of good green American money and gathering hundreds of thousands of teenage fans in the process

Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
"Um, you can!" Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
"Um, you can!" Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
Well, I'm gone...
Gone...

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like a Tribe does
Before this did you really know what life was
Comprehend to the track for it's wide 'cause
Gettin' mentions on the tip of the vibe buzz
Rock 'n' roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afro-centric living is a big shrug
A life filled with *horn* that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives its a plus love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove...

Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times I'm a studio conveyer
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free to drop your pants and check your hair
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes the Tribe of the game rhythm player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air...
"Haha"
"Great, daddio!"
"Haha"

Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
"Um, you can!" Yes, you can!
Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
