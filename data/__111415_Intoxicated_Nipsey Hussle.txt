8 ContributorsIntoxicated Lyrics
Got me intoxicated baby, every time that I see ya
Feels like I'm on that Patron, tryin' to take you home
I know you got a lover and I got somebody too
I wanna please you, don't wanna tease you
We could do whatever you like, like, like

She wants some for tonight (Goldie & Nipsey: for tonight, night, night)
And you know you my type (Goldie & Nipsey: my type, type, type)
So what's up with tonight? (Goldie & Nipsey: tonight, night, night)
Sooo...(Goldie) Tonight? (Nipsey)

And we ain't gotta tell nobody we can keep it on the low, low
Like Shhh...
And you ain't gotta act shy girl cause I already know, know
Like Yaaa...
Middle of the club with a big ass chain, wife beater on, bottle of champagne
Your baby momma grindin' on me, look like a mother fuckin' porno scene
Me, Her, drink, kush, pills, wheels, we push back to my crib showed her how I live
Get up in them guts and that's what I did, that's what I does, that's what I'm 'bout
All money in no money out, that's what I am, that's what I said
So what do you know it's a young nigga gettin' bread
Spending stacks at the mall, takin' stacks to the head
Ball till we fall, dinner in the Feds
That's where we go, you already know but you can ride with me in the Ol' 6-4
And you ain't gotta be a model, you can be a dime for what you got goin' on up inside
Even though you fly, your smell, your waistline, can I make you mine?
For the night, for the time
Man, I mean, you and me both in a relationship you hate the shit but you love it in the same breath, take a sip
You might also like
Got me intoxicated baby, every time that I see ya
Feels like I'm on that Patron, tryin' to take you home
I know you got a lover and I got somebody too
I wanna please you, don't wanna tease you
We could do whatever you like, like, like

She wants some for tonight (Goldie & Nipsey: for tonight, night, night)
And you know you my type (Goldie & Nipsey: my type, type, type)
So what's up with tonight? (Goldie & Nipsey: tonight, night, night)
Sooo...(Goldie) Tonight? (Nipsey)
Bridge (Nipsey):
And you can be my number one girl kinda like the letter A, A, A, yaaa
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we can keep it on the low, low, low, shhh
And you can be my number one girl kinda like the letter A, A, A, yaaa
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we can keep it on the, low, on the, low, on the, low
Shhh...ayyy

Got me intoxicated baby, every time that I see ya
Feels like I'm on that Patron, tryin' to take you home
I know you got a lover and I got somebody too
I wanna please you, don't wanna tease you
We could do whatever you like, like, like
She wants some for tonight (Goldie & Nipsey: for tonight, night, night)
And you know you my type (Goldie & Nipsey: my type, type, type)
So what's up with tonight? (Goldie & Nipsey: tonight, night, night)
Sooo...(Goldie) Tonight? (Nipsey)

Got me intoxicated baby, every time that I see ya

Sooo...(Goldie) Tonight? (Nipsey)2Embed
