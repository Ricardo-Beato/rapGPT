11 ContributorsStrapped Lyrics
Look, pistols popping
Shells fly you see the bodies drop
I'm knee deep in these streets you niggas dip dobbin
Too many niggas tryna hustle
Just stick to robbing
Imagine grinding 12 hours with 200 dollars
Block boy
It's my rise to the top boy
10 speed handle bar before I did the drop boy
I rock a soldier rag but nothing like the hot boys
Mine navy blue "S" dome with the cocked toy
Yea and I walk it like I talk it boy
You don't wanna squabble you socked like the top drawer
White Lincoln with the light grey leather seats
Chrome Alpinas on Pirellis sold separately
Hell yea I'm rich rollin with the weaponry in case I got to pop a fuck nigga like a ecstasy
So a worry on my mind is what you'll never be
I'm ready for what ever beef
You niggas ain't no threat cause I'm

Strapped
But you don't want no problems with my squad
Come through yo block niggas poppin out the cars
We clappin'
And I don't care who you are
Nigga fuck yo hood nigga fuck yo hood
Strapped
But you don't want no problems with my squad
Come through yo block niggas poppin out the cars
We clappin'
And I don't care who you are
Nigga fuck yo hood nigga fuck yo hood

These niggas is bitches they whisper they business to women
And wonder how the cops catch em and bitches is snitching
Brag about a bank lick and a couple of killings
Now he done talked hisself right into a life sentence
Damn
I guess stupid is a stupid does
Just a message for you stupid crips and stupid bloods
Look I'm not as stupid as ya'll thought I was
Come through yo block and let ya'll talk about who cocked the slug
Sick shit, ruthless scandalous Crip shit
What I was raised on stunt and get your brains blown
Slauson nigga I bet you get banged on
That's what my nigga Shady Blue got the gauge for
That's what my nigga Blacc Sam got the Mac for
Feds front of my spot I'm running out the back door
But it's a wrap cause they had me surrounded
Took me to the ground
Then they took me downtown
Cause I was

Strapped
But you don't want no problems with my squad
Come through yo block niggas poppin out the cars
We clappin'
And I don't care who you are
Nigga fuck yo hood nigga fuck yo hood
Strapped
But you don't want no problems with my squad
Come through yo block niggas poppin out the cars
We clappin'
And I don't care who you are
Nigga fuck yo hood nigga fuck yo hood
Now when you come to my hood you better watch yo back
And when I come to yo hood you know I got that Mac
Cause I'm strapped
And you don't want no problems with my squad
Naw you don't want no problems with my squad
I'm fresh of the cocaine block I'm back killing em
Yo boy turn a B 12 base rocks to Benjamins
One way ticket to the NYC
Told my P.O. my auntie died I got to visit my peeps
But um, look you know that's not the case right
I'm splitting dutches on a stoop with a 8th like, yeah
I see it's money on the East Coast
I'm faded off that Henney and that purple city weed smoke
So holla at me cause I got it if you need dope
West side niggas so you know we got the cheap quotes
He so off comma 6 0 comma "S" I'm a threat to enemigos

Strapped
But you don't want no problems with my squad
Come through yo block niggas poppin out the cars
We clappin'
And I don't care who you are
Nigga fuck yo hood nigga fuck yo hood
Strapped
But you don't want no problems with my squad
Come through yo block niggas poppin out the cars
We clappin'
And I don't care who you are
Nigga fuck yo hood nigga fuck yo hoodEmbed
