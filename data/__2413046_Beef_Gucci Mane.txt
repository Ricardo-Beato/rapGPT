15 ContributorsBeef Lyrics
Hey Mane, this the squad
Fo' number's, three letters
Mo' money, mo' bitches

Your nigga's a pussy, we smack him around
Pull out my pistol, I’m backing him down
Running your mouth, and I’ll run in your house
Called out my name, so I'm jerkin' you down
You buyin' a ounce, and you breaking it down
Hop in the house, and I'm burning it down
You walking away while I'm talking to you
Well, this A.K will hit you and turn you around
Desert'll hit you and take off a leg
Step on ya' fingers to get to the bread
Came from the country, I served him a dummy
That's why I keep Tommy guns right by the bed
Hit in the head for something you said
Torture a nigga, I wanted him to beg
You leave me no options, you telling the feds
The 'partment was white, but I painted it red
Fuck a regret when you deep in my debt
You love her so much, then cut me a check
Pay me respect or I'm slicing your neck
Came on the 'crest and got shot in the chest
Cut off your finger and cut off your thumb
And now I want you niggas to throw up your set
Killing the driver and shooting the passenger
Back seat niggas can get all the rest

We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in my flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in our flesh

I told my nigga dissect the beef, and eat that nigga flesh
Cold world, I can see that nigga breath
School of hard knocks, got my heater on my desk
Getting head from a student while I'm cheating on my test
No beginning, it's the end of you
Burner on me, raising temperatures
You are not a fucking killer
But God I know all my nigga perpendicular
Back when niggas was a youngin, and you was the lamest
See, yeah, I remember ya'
Facts upon me, no servina
Serve a nigga, no subpoena
No nigga, I ain’t no killer, but don’t push me
Came in the game, we got good seats
Real nigga know it ain’t squashing no hood beef
What nigga? Don’t front nigga, you a fuck nigga, sup nigga
Free my nigga Rido, and R.I.P to Dunk nigga
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in my flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in our flesh

I don’t owe you niggas shit, fuck favors
$64,000 for this rollie, fuck the haters
I, I don’t owe you niggas shit, fuck favors
$64,000 for this rollie, fuck the haters

We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in my flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
We dissecting beef, we eat these niggas flesh
Brick Squad for life nigga, inked it in our fleshEmbed
