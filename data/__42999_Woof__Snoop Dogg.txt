7 ContributorsWoof! Lyrics
Hell yeah
That was a motherfuckin' trip
The way y'all niggas had the whole world sayin' UH!!!, na, na, na, na
Let's see what Tha Doggfather working with on this shit here
Check this out

Let me hear ya say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay (Come on, everybody say)
Everybody, let me hear ya say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay

I run with convicted felons screamin', yellin'
"Bitch, I'm a soldier!"
Sic'in' my chrome retriever, and I'm finsta get it over
Influenced by the doja
Blastin' at the rollers
Causin' company closures
Fuckin' over the soul, bitch
Your mom shoulda told ya I ain't nothin' nice
Snoop brought the boss
I got this bark that's gonna bite
I, put it on my life, and my favorite weed pipe
Soldier creeds with ice
And watch me boot up in the night
I, capital F-I, the one that bare a shotty
Bringing the drama like your pa caught your ma fucking somebody
What? Lodi Dodi, gin and juice up in the coupe
But not the heartache
Snoop and his soldiers gon' make you say
You might also like
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Yeah, huh-huh, I can make ya say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Yeah, tank doggs, let me hear ya say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Yeah, all my real live niggas say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Yeah, Mystikal, where you at?

Nigga, all I really wanna do when we come 'round
Is get down with the get down
Y'all motherfuckers better sit down
We up in this bitch now
Whatever it take to make it happen
We gon' make our money right
We tryna live some stress-free life
Pressure busts pipes
Yikes!
Know what I like
Keep it hype!
Betcha I right
I put pounds of ice on ya, like white on rice
Vise grips on mics, turnin' 'em tight
I'm burnin' up the limelight, finally
And you ain't gotta strain your eyes to find me
'Cause I'm throwin' bad days behind me
Ah, damn it, it's headlights, now 'bout to let it shine
Come your ass in there tip-toeing, your ass is mine
We got 'em waiting on us by the radio for our albums to drop
Snoop, Fiend, me, Beats By The Pound, you know it's gon' pop
Jump in the game and walk away with enough money to run with
'Til you hear that last fuckin' "woof," we ain't done, bitch
Let me hear ya say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Yeah, huh-huh, all my niggas say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Let me hear ya say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Let me hear ya say
Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)

I come faster than a speedin' bullet
Or I can take my time and move slow
Wake up outta my seat and hit this mic and blow like some indo
You can call me what you want
Just don't call me no punk
My name is Snoop D-O-double-G
And I'm the godfather of G-Funk
I'll put this shit down, I clown, Dogg Pound is my set
Nigga step outta line, I'll shoot 'em in they motherfuckin' spine
And break they necks (Nigga, nigga)
That's how it goes down, you gon' realize that
See, when you run up in my face you liable to get smacked, jacked
Just like that (Like that)
I'm a fool, break the rules, down, way too cool (Hey, hey, hey)
They call me Snoop D-O-double-G
'Cause I'm a fuckin' fool
I can get silly
But I'd rather sit back, relax, new jacks, get smacked
'Cause I'm tryna blaze up a sack
To my nigga Mystikal, Fiend, and my big homie Master P
'Cause that's just the way this shit gon' be
Baby, N-O-L-I-M-I-T (No Limit)
We gon' make y'all say Woof
Until you motherfuckers demand
That nigga named Snoop
I can make 'em say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Huh-huh, huh, huh, I can make 'em say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Soldiers, let me hear ya say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Bitches, bitches, let me hear ya say
Woof! motherfucker, Woof! motherfucker
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)

Everybody in the house, say
Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Up top, come on, yeah
Say Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
Down low, yeah, yeah
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
And on the side, biatch, yeah, yeah, for sure
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Yeah, and not only that, and not only that, this No Limit, baby
(Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay)
Ya heard me? Yeah, yeah
Not only that, woo, yeah
Shit gettin' crazy in this motherfucker
Ya heard me? Uh!Embed
