2 ContributorsSuperhero (TM2) Lyrics
 put 60's on my 
 diamond chain, represent 
Gucci Mane the martian, 
They just say I'm Captain Planet, you're only a Planetere
 say that I'm a hero
 call me Iron Man
Dark  Darkwing Duck for the weed man
SpongeBob part time 
Robocop Uzi, Batgirl choosing
Wonder Woman bracelet 
 jewelry 
 chopper man but I don't wanna kill ya
I think I lost my mojo, beefing with Dr. Evil
 park it at the Libra
Think I lost my mojo, beefing with Dr. Evil
 parked it at the Libra

It's Mr. Futuristic on the 
People call me Neo, cause the kid is so amazing
Sub Zero diamond,  whole nation
Green diamond cryptenight, ice game crazy
 on my wrist  house up on my neck
Mazerati pinky ring, swag on flex
 blood diamonds
I'm a big dog,  woof

Brick Squad 1017, big dog salute
Superhero jewelry,

Earing Batman, black and white diamonds

 hells hot, all my niggas 
Tryna X me out man, Imma give you what I got
Not a superhero, I'm a villian, bitch I'm on my job

Diamonds not bright enough, guess we gotta kick them out

50 cal I split his head, I got  the Punisher
And it got me frozen, call me freze, these are big rocks
Bugs Bunny carots, so I'm like what's up dock?

Fuck that high class shit, I ain't need a uniform
My chain stick out, like the head that's on a unicorn

Told me that it's real, but I found out that it wasn't
If I take off my chain, got niggas tryna feed my birds
Cause I'm shining in the top braket
Chain gang banging fresh hanging
Like pants on a clothes racket
Superhero jewelry,

Earing Batman, black and white diamonds

Earing Batman, black and white diamonds
