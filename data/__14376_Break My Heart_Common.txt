Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(She said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(Uh, she said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
With lots of love to give...
You, love to give... (Uh)
You-you, love to give...
You, love to give...

It was a dream day, met her on spring break
Look like the type that be like "No hable ingl√©s"
She said you look like you rap, where's your bling'e?
And your clothes is tight but you don't seem gay
I said naw, that's dude from NSYNC'e
She wasn't married, kept her ring on her pinky
She said, "You know I don't be datin' rappers"
I said, "I got my SAG card, baby, I'm an actor"

Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(She said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(Uh, she said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
With lots of love to give... (G-give it, uh)
You, love to give... (G-give it, uh, g-give it, yeah)
You-you, love to give... (G-give it, uh, g-give it, uh)
You, love to give... (G-give it, yeah)

Seen her again at All Star weekend, she ain't have tickets
And she ain't into hoopers, she was there to kick it
With her roommate who was a video vixen
Spent so much on outfits, she about to get evicted
Said "I'm married to this rap shit, lookin' for a mistress"
You can be by my side like Flavor and Delishiss
Long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes
She said "You one of them fishes, I know your mind switches", and

Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(She said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(Uh, she said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
With lots of love to give... (G-give it, uh)
You, love to give... (G-give it, uh, g-give it, yeah)
You-you, love to give... (G-give it, uh, g-give it, uh)
You, love to give... (G-give it, yeah)

Time revolve, we fell in love as crazy as Nas
And them broads was textin' 'cause I stop callin' 'em
I met the parents, watch the game with her father and
Questions of marriage and I start dodging' 'em
What happen to me happens to lots of men
Get deep in love and then you're needin' some oxygen
As far as wives I was thinkin' like Solomon
She said "there you go, breakin' my heart again!"
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(She said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(Uh, she said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
With lots of love to give... (G-give it, uh)
You, love to give... (G-give it, uh, g-give it, yeah)
You-you, love to give... (G-give it, uh, g-give it, uh)
You, love to give... (G-give it, yeah)


Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(She said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you, with-
(Uh, she said "don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
With lots of love to give... (G-give it, uh)
You, love to give... (G-give it, uh, g-give it, yeah)
You-you, love to give... (G-give it, uh, g-give it, uh)
You, love to give... (G-give it, yeah)
Give... give... give...3Embed
