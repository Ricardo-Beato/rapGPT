Public Enemy...
Public Enemy... c'mon!
Public Enemy...
Public Enemy...
Pump the music, pump the sound! (Public Enemy)
Once again we gonna do it like this
Pump the music, pump the sound! (Public Enemy)
Once again we gonna do it like this (c'mon!)
Pump the music, pump the sound! (Public Enemy)
Once again we gonna do it like this
Pump the music, pump the sound! (Public Enemy)
Once again we gonna do it like this

WE ARE AT WAR!!!
 + (Souljah)
The American people, must rise up (WE ARE AT WAR!!!)
Out of the evils of war (WE ARE AT WAR!!!)
The evil of racism, and the evil of politics (WE ARE AT WAR!!!)
I am constantly reminded of the fact (WE ARE AT WAR!!!)

Pump the music, pump the sound! (Public Enemy)
Once again we gonna do it like this
Pump the music, pump the sound! (Public Enemy)
Once again we gonna do it like this (c'mon!)
Pump the music, pump the sound! (Public Enemy)
Once again we gonna do it like this
Pump the music, pump the sound! (Public Enemy)
Once again we gonna do it like this (WE ARE AT WAR!!!)
You might also like + (Sister Souljah)
The war, is only a symptom (WE ARE AT WAR!!!)
Of international militarism (WE ARE AT WAR!!!)
Racism, and imperialism (WE ARE AT WAR!!!)
And an unworkable capitalism (WE ARE AT WAR!!!)
That makes the rich richer and the poor poorer

Public Enemy...
