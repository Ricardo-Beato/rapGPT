4 ContributorsCarousel Lyrics
I want my up as steady as my down
When I, I, I
I want my cup as heavy as my crown
When I, I, I
Look in the mirror, I'm so glad I found a friend
When I come around again
I want my up steady as my down
My cup heavy as my crown when
When I come around

She told me to come inside and get out of the raindrops
And stop living your life like a day job
I'm tryna make this feel like a holiday
It's a complicated celebration nowadays
Gotta take it any way we can acquire it
With consideration to our time and our environment
Trying to find a silver lining with yourself included
It's why we play these records like therе's keys in the music
It could be as simplе as it's supposed to be
If only what they told me was actually what they showed me
Hope the kids get a chance to tell a brand new story
But in the meantime, please don't stand so close to me
She says she never loved the police
That's when I knew I wanted to protect myself from her sting
And I don't know what to think, but now I'm trying to redeem
For every time I didn't seem to keep my eye in your team
And I can be as careless as a dream
But as careful as the breeze carry seeds from the trees and
Spread 'em 'cross the field until they too little to see
Until they barely just a ripple in the sea
Specifically, I'm free to be stressed
And worried 'bout whatever sequence of events and experiences
I'm feeling incomplete and let me get this release
I believe that I need some relief
I disappear into the night like a what?
You might also like
I was a horrible thief, forgot to steal anything
I'm on the carousel tryna take care of myself
We can laugh, we can sing, I'll be back next spring
On the carousel tryna take care of ourself
I'm as present at the callus underneath that ring
You on the carousel tryna take care of yourself
I appreciate the challenge, but these lights ain't green
On the carousel tryna take care of myselfEmbed
