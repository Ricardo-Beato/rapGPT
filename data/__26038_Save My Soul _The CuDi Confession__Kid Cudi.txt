30 ContributorsSave My Soul (The CuDi Confession) Lyrics
I got some bad news this mornin'
Which in turn made my day

Lord help me out
Save my soul, need to find a new route
I don't even hear what other niggas talking 'bout
Call me a hipster as long as you're a listener
Label me what you like
I'm close to my victory, dozed in the fight
When I open my eyes somehow seeing night
Beyond tryna see what being rich feel like
Six-figure checks for my mom for peace
Everybody wanna stick on me like leech
Take my blood, give fake love
'Til I turned them down, now I'm the one who changed, bruh?
Ask why I don't call
'Cause when I was starving, you wasn't at all
Around, now I gotta shut shit down
Be a man, pick friends, all selective now
You're cool, you're cool, fuck you
And to the bitch thatâ€”oh yeah, fuck you too
Tried to shine, now everyone knows
Yeah, Kid Cudi slipped up and loved them hoes
We all make mistakes, yes
No worries, I just kill a bitch with success
While she at home stressed out eating ice cream
I'm at the Grammys living out a nice dream
No bitch on arm
Just my words and my stoner charm
And my dimples deep, I smile at peace
'Cause I went out and got what most y'all seek
Now I'm the one you meet
Who throws you the peace sign, missed not one step
And this is just the first step
God walks with me, but I'm still vexed

Oh, how could this be?
All this time, I've lived vicariously
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?13Embed
