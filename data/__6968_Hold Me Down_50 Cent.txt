12 ContributorsHold Me Down Lyrics
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down

Through every altercation
I put no one above you, mm-mm I love you
They shook up when we jux 'em, you see how they be looking
It's frightening like lightning, you crack off, they start booking
It's beef until I get out in broad day with my shit out
That's when they say I'm illing and when she get to killing
Now my baby she precious, I warn you not to test us
I aim her at your head, nigga, motherfuck the vests
I'm antisocial, quit acting like you know me
Before I go postal, you know I got her on me
I'm riding with her on cocked, Audi R8 drop
Feel the wind blow, twist the indo, smoke it up, it's fundamental
You can't get to her, poke 'em up when we get intimate
That's when I get into shit
She 32 I'm 34, I fuck her raw
She revolve 6 times then I feed her more

I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down

When niggas get to tripping
I need you by my side, yeah, so they can't catch me slipping
I take you out shopping, get you clean, get it popping
Use my finger, get ya hot, girl, I know your spot, yeah
I love you if you love me back, you'll never jam when I react
To sucker shit when they get hit and we take off if you get tossed
I'll be back, I want you, so I'll be back
I'll never change, I be the same, a nigga stunt, I let it rain
I'm off the chain, I'm all in, mane
I'll hit you up, you think I'm playing, I be strapped
Go 'head fuck around, I be strapped
24/7 I'm back holding, mistake me for a chump
Bite off more than you can chew, more beef than you want
Come through repeatedly, show you what bananas about
I'm a mechanic, find out when the hammers come out

I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down3Embed
