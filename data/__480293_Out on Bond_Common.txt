17 ContributorsOut on Bond Lyrics
Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Plastic bag carryin', no two paces
IPhone, belt by Gucci
Bands with loose change and some car keys
To the Maserati, license plate read "God Body"
Passenger side only ride hot bodies
When we was young as we wanted, show our bodies
Cadillac come from the Southside army
The army now, don't try to harm me now
It's my time, you can't alarm me now
I ball, bitches wanna palm me now
Vacation in palm tree style
In the morning where the dons be now
Drinkin' lattes, over breakfast I pray and end it with a Ashe
Cops say we lookin' for a nigga thats dressed nice
Seats be goin' way back like Just Ice
Black leather wearin' "justice" on the collar
Change is we only ain't trustin' the dollars
Try to get me, get wet like bed sheets
Probably with technique, and let the Tec speak
Like the led conference I rap off the head conscious
Freestyle, free trap niggas from bondage
Every word you heard is bond is
Double-0 87, on some Bond shit
I'm out on bond
You might also like
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames

Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Los Padrinos to juvenile placement
Known for C-notes, the feds confiscatin'
Back to that block with brains on the pavement
Paid restitution, O from the lootin' enter
Cause they did it, you was influenced
Your mind gone, life don't seem much bigger
Than your time zone, broke as the rich get richer
Blunt burnt lips and a worn out liver
That's everyday livin', guns everywhere chillin'
Got you feelin' like this money comin' sooner than later
'Til then I'll be runnin' from the judge and the bailiff
Crime commitin' cause these women love a man in Mercedes
I never save for when it's rainy, hope Jehovah can save me
While I'm out on bond tryin' to buy my time
'Til I hit the main line in that cell confined

Preposterous chains, top notch dames
Classic rap music, rollin' in the Range
Preposterous chains, top notch dames
Classic rap music, rollin' in the Range4Embed
