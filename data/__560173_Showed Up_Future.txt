A whole eighth of codeine
I just, I just
I just, I just
Super Future, Future Hendrix, the Wizard
You dig?

I just, I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My lil' young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just, I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Mixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein (Yeah)

Red lean in a Fanta, you can't taste the caffeine (Yeah)
Customs stamp my passport, I'm on my way to Beijing (Woo)
Smashin' on a trophy, crashin', I might OD (Ah)
Checkin' out my moji (What?)
I just came from Oslo, Norway, everything was gourmet
A couple million worth of whips when I step out my doorway (Skrrt)
I just, I just, I just throwed a bird away in Lenox (What?)
Went to Magic, throwed some racks, and nigga, I ain't finished (Huh?)
Baby, promise me you'll never go trip on what I be sippin' (Syrup)

I was drugged up on so many drugs
I just showed up in this bitch with some Latin Kings and some Bloods
I came through that bitch with 4 Trey and my cuz
We screamin', "ABK," nigga, so you know what it was
You might also like
I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My lil' young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just, I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Mixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein (Yeah)
I just, I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My lil' young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just, I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Mixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein (Yeah)

Fuck the jury, nigga, fuck the DA, nigga, fuck the judge, nigga (Yeah)
Only Mexicanos that push kilos can judge niggas (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck the bitch all in the shower, all in the tub, nigga (Woo)
I'm Pablo, El Chapo to these lil' niggas (Future)
I got new scars, I got new cars, I'm a loose cannon (Swerve)
And I'm affiliated with them gangsta niggas like Don Cannon
I just, I just bought my bitch a new Celine (Fur)
I just told my jeweler, "Go and make me ten rings" (Bling)
Yeah, I won
I'm pimpin' on some bitches, call me Future Don Juan (Future)
I got Murder Squad with me and I brought your broad with me
Know some trigger happy niggas that'll go to war with me
And I'm Lil Mexico until the Lord come get me

I was drugged up on so many drugs
I just showed up in this bitch with some Latin Kings and some Bloods
I came through that bitch with 4 Trey and my cuz
We screamin', "ABK," nigga, so you know what it was
I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My lil' young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just, I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Mixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein (Yeah)
I just, I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My lil' young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just, I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Mixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein (Yeah)
