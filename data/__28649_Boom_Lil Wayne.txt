35 ContributorsBoom Lyrics
Mouse drop the track
That'll make you bounce it back, what
Yeah
Hehe
Tell 'em, yeah, bah!

Weezy badâ€”naw, really, I'm good
Sound like a T-Rex live under my hood
Gotta know the Tec live under my seat
Put you in the ground; now, you live under my feet
All-white diamonds on the front of my teeth
And you better put the "O" in front of my "G"
The bullshit they talking doesn't come to my knee
I'm like a linebacker: Don't run it by me
My two best friends will accompany me
And right now, they are in my dungarees, sleep
One named "Mac," one named "Nina"
They hit you, make you do the Macarena
Where your tool? You gon' need it like a muh'fucker
And I am so New Orleans like a muh'fucker
It's Young Money and we eating, get your own supper
Make me go off in the trunk, get that Bone Crusher, haha!
Tecs, AKs, I leave the scene ugly
Chest, head, face, arm, leg, stomach
I never been afraid, I ain't scared of nothing
'Cause I got my thang, my thang, my thang
And that bitch go boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
You hear them guns, like boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
You might also like
They like the way I ball, they call me "Hot Sauce"
They know I keep that toaster; you can be my Pop Tart
I never had height, but, boy, I got heart
And I ain't gotta speak, I just let my car talk
I got more clips than any movie you saw
I pull up on you like I need some Grey Poupon
Hardhat? No, but I got the tool on
And you should be my paper if ever the tool's drawn, yeah
Flow retarded: When I spit, I get my drool on
I don't rap, I just shit, like a newborn
I don't write, I just spit, like a tooth gone
So tell them haters, "Cut it out" like a coupon
How come that chopper sound like a nuke bomb?
Little nigga, gotta hold that bitch with two arms
I got that heat, the fire, and the lukewarm
I'm on your heels like a shoehorn

Tecs, AKs, I leave the scene ugly
Chest, head, face, arm, leg, stomach
I never been afraid, I ain't scared of nothing
'Cause I got my thang, my thang, my thang
And that bitch go boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
You hear them guns, like boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom25Embed
