1 ContributorSells Like Teens Hear It LyricsYeah yeah yeah yeah boy
Yeah yeah yeah yeah boy

I’m not the old head who be sideline booing
What my generation call mumble gum chewing
Listen to it closer as you get near it
Smells and sells like teens hear it

You smell like a mud duck who lived out all his luck
Bugged out now you’re stuck slipping like a hockey puck
Perpetrating emcee that’s the way it goes
I been rapping on the mic
Since you were shittin’ in your clothes
Trying get so fast but you ain’t slick
Step back give me room
And kiss my…
I’m gonna tell you once
Ain’t gonna tell you again
Don’t never in life try to do this again
I’m still the boss, gimme a high five
Gimme the mic live king cold live
Flav don’t live on that tip G
But don’t get sleep on me
I get it!
Can’t nobody do it like me boy…

I’m not the old head who be sideline booing
What my generation call mumble gum chewing
Listen to it closer as you get near it
Smells and sells like teens hear it
I’m not the old head who be sideline booing
What my generation call mumble gum chewing
Listen to it closer as you get near it
Smells and sells like teens hear it

Used to be a joke, big butt and a smile
Screw being broke, substance over style
Try to walk a mile in these old school shoes
Many don’t like to walk, old and young, do you?
Crazy when you see it, skateboard guarantee it
A whole lotta love goin’ on if you wanna believe it
Millennial hear baby boomers fearing it
Sells like teenagers hearin’ it

I’m not the old head who be sideline booing
What my generation call mumble gum chewing
Listen to it closer as you get near it
Smells and sells like teens hear it
I’m not the old head who be sideline booing
What my generation call mumble gum chewing
Listen to it closer as you get near it
Smells and sells like teens hear it
80's 90’s real hip hop generation
Classified as art of inducing violence
Media and visions have limitations
Gotta hear out the streets anticipation
What you hear what you get
New souls just hear it how industry sells it
Teens became a target
Dreams for red carpet
Lies but believe it
Take it or leave it

I’m not the old head who be sideline booing
What my generation call mumble gum chewing
Listen to it closer as you get near it
Smells and sells like teens hear it
I’m not the old head who be sideline booing
What my generation call mumble gum chewing
Listen to it closer as you get near it
Smells and sells like teens hear it
