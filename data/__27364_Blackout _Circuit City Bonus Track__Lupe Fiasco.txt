21 ContributorsBlackout (Circuit City Bonus Track) Lyrics
I'm feelin' like, I ain't feelin' right
I'm feelin' like, I'm finna fly
Right in the sky, unidentified
Flying object, that I sit inside
You can get a ride, just get in line
Hand by your heart, like memorize
Ask Scotty please, could you energize?
Beam on up, to the Enterprise
From the inner city, or the Windy City
Where's Mini-mini? Not Mini-me's
Only Mini-me's, not a lot of hymns
Only one eye, whole lot of them
Saw a cyclops, that's a eye clock
Like a Rolex, with a eye patch
See what I got, matches on the wall
Plus a crazy flow, suicide watch
I'm just killin' time, plus I'm insane
In a straight jacket, but it's Romanelli
I'm just gettin' back, for now it's kinda poor
Want to have things, couldn't afford a Pelle
So don't mind me, cause I ain't got a mind
I don't front hard, I ain't got a mind
I'm just gettin' mine, but don't step here
Because it's something buried, that I didn't find
And if Iâ€™m on top like a mohawk
I remember when, I was so not
It was no locks, man I couldn't ball
I was so bald, Robocop
I was Mr. Clean, now I'm Mr. T
But a different team, F&F rules
Call me F.I., from the Westside
And I'm underground, pepperin' you fool (yeah homey)
You might also like
Creepin' on a come up, history, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I told you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's cause everything is black
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black)

And I'm feelin' good, like a villian would
If he was doin' bad, kill Superman
Tied to a log, pushed into a saw
Take a little dog, right through the fan
And it mean man, like a dictionary
Like a definition, like you never listen
Not the "ition" endin', but the deaf part
Break it in half, like an intermission
You'll see then, what I mean then
Or what I meant there, doesn't impair
Now you're learnin' it, keep rehearsin' it
'Til it's permanent, like pimp hair
Got an empire, I'm the emperor
Like the cat were, I'll be faster
You're tryin' to add syrup, just to slow me down
But I blow 'em down, like I'm half-were
That's wolf-man, you got a full house
I got a full moon, then I pull out
The ace up my sleeve, like my hand hurt
Lend me your chips, what they took now
What they put now, gotta look down
And check your shoulder, cause I'll be over
Like a boater, you got boulders
In your loafers, put your foot down
While I Ottoman, or a Laz-E-Boy
Or a handstand, see I elevate
Like Otis, my toes is
And my flow sick, let it marinate
Try to break it down, might take a while
All good though, I'll wait around
While you chase it down, that white rabbit
Down that long hole, like paper towels (yeah homey)
Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's cause everything is black
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, everything is black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, you can't see me)

So this light's out, like a lighthouse
In the daytime, make it lay down
Make it go to bed, make it go to sleep
Like Deebo, when he was chokin' Craig
That's a headlock, it's what I said I got
The whole game in, like shooter box
Then the Sho Kosugi, if you don't know the movies
I ninja vanish, Michael Dudikoff
I get super low, I get super lost
I be super cool, like a super boss
Say they super bad, but they super soft
Like super chicken, without the super sauce
Let's step out, it's a rap now
Blow your candles, and your lamps out
When I pull up, you can pull the plug
Cause it's game over, it's a black out
Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's cause everything is black
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, everything is black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, you can't see me)1Embed
