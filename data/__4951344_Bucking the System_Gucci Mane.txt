7 ContributorsBucking the System Lyrics
Zaytoven
Huh
They should put me on SportsCenter with all this ballin' I be doin' (Gucci)
You can't see Wop on your best day, nigga (Gang)
It's Gucci
Huh

Trappin' all day on the goddamn skreets
I didn't even have nowhere to goddamn sleep
I remember recordin' in Zay' mama basement
Way, way, way before he ever had a placement (On God)
Dead bodies in the bando, we called it a vacant (Bando)
Smokin', drinkin', sellin' dope but I was on probation (Facts)
Turned into a killer soon as I left my Cecilia (Straight up)
I don't think they feel ya 'til the ghetto try to kill ya' (Oh Lord)
Free my niggas in the system, motherfuck the system
If you a snitch, fuck you and who snitchin' with ya (Fuck ya)
Loan money walk, let the lady take her picture (Mwah)
Not every day the bitch see a million dollar nigga (Well damn)
Hired killers with me now, I can't be a victim (Pow, pow)
Choppa close by all the time, I'm buckin' the system
Diamonds precious, but nothin's more precious than wisdom (Bling)
The fresh is in the buildin', bless the ghetto-children (Bless 'em)
Fronted me to pack, I ain't pound 'em back, I'm buckin'
Been known to buck the system, call the plug and told 'em, "Fuck 'em"
Pockets swole for parole, I feel is an injustice
For me to be broke and strugglin', I can't be out hustlin' (Gucci)

I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin'
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin' the system
I'm buckin' on niggas, I'm buckin' up pistols
I'm takin' up pistols and kill 'em
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin'
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin' the system
Don't fuck with these niggas
Don't rock with these niggas
They try me, I'm buckin' the system

Breadwinner fly and I'm goin' out gangsta'
Gold mouth dawg and your homeboy fakin'
Breadwinner landlord, need a little favor
Peterbilt, eighteen-wheeler with the reefer trailer
I don't get a load in, I'ma send a load, bitch
Shot the strong arm to the judge up in court, bitch
Ding-dong, push button bricks, front door shit
1017, nigga, Breadwinner, Brick Squad! (Brick Squad!)
I control a forklift, yeah, they just sent four
Hundred round discharge, writin' on the clipboard
Put you in the coffin, I bought a new fit for it
Bite a nigga apple (Baow), MacBook laptop
Droptop, MAC-11, ridin' with the strap out
Got my own blueprint, guess I got it mapped out
Just was on Carolina, standin' in the trap house
Said I wouldn't be shit, think I didn't hear about it
Now a nigga clip cost bigger than your real house
I get on a helicopter blindfold to Mexico
You pull up to meet a middle man at Texaco
Breadwinner safeguard, run off on who?
You gotta send the money 'fore the load come through
Nigga Peewee League, pay with peewee cheese
I be overseas, I'm in Medellín with it
If you takin' my lick, I got felonies, nigga
Livin' like that when I fell in these systems
Real Hermés, what we sell in these trenches
Deal cocaine, but the recipe different
Ask Lee Lucas if I'm cut like that
Real street nigga, but the pedigree different
Pillow talk 'bout me, you a jelly bean nigga
I slam on your fam' if you tell on me nigga
I slam on your fam' if you tell on me nigga
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin'
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin' the system
I'm buckin' on niggas, I'm buckin' up pistols
I'm takin' up pistols and kill 'em
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin'
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin' the system
Don't fuck with these niggas
Don't rock with these niggas
They try me, I'm buckin' the systemEmbed
