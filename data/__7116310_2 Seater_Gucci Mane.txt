3 Contributors2 Seater Lyrics
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 

She remind me of my drop top Chevy
We back to back in drop tops, me and R. Kelly
And y'all ain't ready
We in twin 9 11's, better call the parametics
Breathe, breathe, breathe heavy
My Gucci ,  Gucci Mane heavy
I know I might be ugly, but my cars real sexy
And I don't see nothing wrong with the Gucci Mane flexing
Vroom vroom, let's 
Hundred thousand ,  R. Kelly
 goddamn 
Bought a Chevy, but I could've bought a hard top Bentley

Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my

Trae Tha Truth!
Straight out of Texas,  naturally slower
 over
 I'm the truth, and I told her I'd show her
I lost the top, and caught a fine for indecent exposure
 posted up like I'm shaking 
So much ice, I got the block feeling like they aneemic
Swagger competition,  the title
My gangstas say I'm up to bat to be the next American Idol
So much candy on my whip,  I'm a trip
Looking like I'm related to a project lady 
That means it's full of gloss,  floss  south
 it's whatever, cause I'm a boss
 character on my chain
 black diamonds 
Check out this double C, the way  the frame

Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 

I'm walking in the Gucci shop, me and my baby
Thirteen thousand, so we Gucci bag crazy
That's my lady, yeah that's my baby
 Gucci ,  red 
Woke up in Chicago, 
Me and my lady,  black and red 
 red 
Got them Gucci frames on, and they real expencive
Riding in my 2 seeter, me and my Gucci
Everytime I , say this is your Gucci
Gucci Mane and R. Kelly
Pull up to the club, 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my 
Drop top 2 seeter, me and my Embed
