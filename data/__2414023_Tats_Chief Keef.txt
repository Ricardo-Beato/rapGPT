17 ContributorsTats Lyrics
All on my skin
Dope all up in the wind
You ain't won, lil bitch nigga I win
You ain't won, bitch nigga I win
I got tats all over my skin
Smoke all up in the wind
Off this dope, looking like DJ Kenn
You ain't won, bitch nigga I win
I win, I win
I win, I win
I win, I win, I win

I got tats all on my skin
I got smoke all up in the wind
Off this dope, looking like DJ Kenn
You didn't won, bitch nigga I win
Hop in my car, now I'm in the wind
Talking 'bout money, then I went in
Then walked out with a check in my pocket
All I need is a check and a rocket

Get the money, in stores bitch I walk in
Cash out, I'm cashing
Get it right back, bitch it's like that
All the bitches like that
All the bitches like me cause I'm so icy
Smoking dope, that shit all in the wind
All my friends, the ones that's dead
RIP Big Glo them my mans
My right hand
Got a Breitling on my left hand
I'm icy, ain't shit you can tell me
I do this shit for Big Glo, Big Glo, Big Glo, Big Glo
You might also like
I got tats all on my skin
I got smoke all up in the wind
Off this dope, looking like DJ Kenn
You didn't won, bitch nigga I win
Hop in my car, now I'm in the wind
Talking 'bout money, then I went in
Then walked out with a check in my pocket
All I need is a check and a rocket

I'm glo'd up
Bitch hang with me, she throw up
She fainted
Nigga test me, get painted
Trust me, I make the arrangements
Chain hanging
And my dick swanging
Jiggling like my keys
Shawty said she like me just because I'm me
Don't you see, don't you see, don't you see, don't you see

I got tats all on my skin
I got smoke all up in the wind
Off this dope, looking like DJ Kenn
You didn't won, bitch nigga I win
Hop in my car, now I'min the wind
Talking 'bout money, then I went in
Then walked out with a check in my pocket
All I need is a check and a rocketEmbed
