9 ContributorsSLIDE FOR ME Lyrics
Honorable C.N.O.T.E

I got this one chick on the side
Late at night, I know she slide for me
I'm going slow on 65
I know the police, they got fines for me
My brothers with me down to ride
Ain’t gotta ask, I know they'd die for me
We going up, we going live
And bitch we taking off like five, four, three
Two, one

She say you not funny, she want her a new one
She curse me out when she under influence
Speakin' in something that I am not fluent in
Oh it's you again
I can't get rid of ya, I'm glad that we ain't do nothin' on video
TMZ offer you something, you give it up
I know, you can't be trusted
Someone that I was in lust with
And now I can't function
Me, I don't know where the function's at
I got the whip, y'all got the contraband
Where is my conscious at
You might also like
I got this one chick on the side
Late at night, I know she slide for me
I'm going slow on 65
I know the police, they got fines for me
My brothers with me down to ride
Ain’t gotta ask, I know they'd die for me
We going up, we going live
And bitch we taking off like five, four, three
Two, one

Trust me, I know what I'm doin'
Can't give a fuck 'bout what you on
I know my enemies stewin'
I got a crush on a stewardess
Her outfit got somethin' to do with it
Gave her my number, I'm shootin' it
Soon as we landed, I got me a text, ooh
Who is this
Oh wait, I know who it is
Back in '08 I was lollygagging
I'm on the wave, now they call me captain
Go 'head and pay me in proper fashion
I know she hates me, this always happens
I got this one chick on the side
Late at night, I know she slide for me
I'm going slow on 65
I know the police, they got fines for me
My brothers with me down to ride
Ain’t gotta ask, I know they'd die for me
We going up, we going live
And bitch we taking off like five, four, three
Two, oneEmbed
