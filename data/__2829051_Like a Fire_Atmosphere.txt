A recording...it's like "Hi this is a recording" and then....

I was born on a rug made of dogs playing poker
Shoulda never let me cross your border
Sock full of quarters, lost on the corner
Not too high but I'm not too sober
I filled it up just to spill the cup
Better fix your bridges, they're still corrupt
My dreams are vivid, I don't wish for wishes
You know nobody that beats the business
And I don't even miss when it was all so simple
Sick off the vino, kicking out the window
Sometimes life's like the card game War
Hide a couple knives in the silverware drawer
Loot like a cop then deploy of troops
Got heavy artillery shootin' from the rooftop
She can't see me when I move through the nuance
What, so what, so what you want, huh?

Run wild like a man on fire
Get live like a roof on fire
Make love like a world on fire
Burn out like a fire
You might also likeRun wild like a man on fire
Get live like a roof on fire
Make love like a world on fire
Burn out like a fire

I figured out that you're fraudulent
I hope you feel that that's a compliment
'Cause you've been hollering the phony rhetoric for a minute
We outta give you a ribbon for the commitment
It's no squabble, salute, I raise my bottle
To the fact that you found a few fools who would follow
We live for the now cause there ain't no tomorrow
But my mixtape still needs an outro
And you can mark these words with a Sharpie
We make party as long as there's a heartbeat
I'm like a Harley, you're like a Hardly
Get behind me, Satan, you can't harm me
I'm not scared of the flood, squaring up
When Armageddon come, I turn the stereo up
Making love in the back of an American truck
Bust a nut, jump up and hit the airhorn button, what?
Run wild like a man on fire
Get live like a roof on fire
Make love like a world on fire
Burn out like a fire
Run wild like a man on fire
Get live like a roof on fire
Make love like a world on fire
Burn out like a fireEmbed
