55 ContributorsSpecial Lyrics
Thugger, Thugger, Thugger, baby
Mike WiLL in here, motherfuckin' Ear Drummers
You know what I'm sayin'?
I appreciate the love at all times, I promise
Ya digg? Ya digg?

I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess
She said she not going for that
She keep her a Smith & Wesson
She keep it so confidential
She'll erase you with a pistol
My diamonds they got way bigger
I bought me a tiger, Tigger

My diamonds they shine of course
Fuck her with a charlie horse
Pull up, let Lil' Dolly bust
Four fives in them Calicos
My cars sound like Need for Speed
My feet on some Mickey D's
He clutching, he acting crazy
She want Lil' Lucci to leave
I told her he can not go
He got to stay with me with .44's
My Forgis sittin' tall like a rollercoast
These fuck niggas slower than rollie-pollies
DJ Sky flying higher
YSL never tell no choir
She want to fuck on my meal like Myers
I'm ninja lil' nigga
Tell 'em or tell something
Walking in with bands on us
Big B but Chanel on us
Laced up with some L's on us
Motherfucker go crazy draw down with the steel on him
And I really, really, really can't tell prepare for jail on 'em
You might also like
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess
She said she not going for that
She keep her a Smith & Wesson
She keep it so confidential
She'll erase you with a pistol
My diamonds they got way bigger
I bought me a tiger, Tigger

Pull up in a Tesla
And if that shit don't impress her
My swagger on special
You cuffin' that hoe trying to rescue
She on her knees like she want me to bless her
I try to get in her drawer like a dresser
I fuck that bitch like I'm trying to impress her
Look, shout out to Thugger
Cause bitch I'm a thug and they know I'm covered
He blood like we brothers
You niggas ain't tough you fuck one up we gon' bust like a bubble
Balling on them like the Rucker
Lollipops, you niggas suckers
Keep that MC Hammer you can't touch us
My swagger mean as a jerk
I'm popping tags like they percs
My bitch ain't bad, she the worst
One of her bags half a bird
Pull out that Audemar, my diamonds water water you would think that I could surf
I'm the same nigga had to work
And I serve a nigga like Lurch, swerve
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess
She said she not going for that
She keep her a Smith & Wesson
She keep it so confidential
She'll erase you with a pistol
My diamonds they got way bigger
I bought me a tiger, Tigger

Offset!
I got a K and it's special just like its a cereal
I'm looking down on your peasants because I'm the king and I'm the superior
You know I got shooters on top of the roof and you think that I'm playing I'm serious
I'm on them Percocets and Vicodins
I'm adding the money not minusing
I got a bad bitch look like Kylie Jenner
It's a millionaire club and you not a member
We slaying your hoe put that dick up in her
Don't try me lil' nigga, I recommend it
Fifty thousand for the Audemar Piguet
You think about robbing nigga? Better abort the mission like you killing children
Cause I got that semi Grinch, stole Christmas, send my shooter through your chimney
She fucked the star and tried to keep the condom
I fucked that hoe after hours like a Roma
Coca Cola coming from Tijuana
My wrists is sick, sometimes I want to vomit
Got that pump in my truck, I'm not talking about Donald
I want an island bitch, come here Rihanna
I got out of jail screaming, "Fuck the 'your honor'!"
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess
She said she not going for that
She keep her a Smith & Wesson
She keep it so confidential
She'll erase you with a pistol
My diamonds they got way bigger
I bought me a tiger, Tigger9Embed
