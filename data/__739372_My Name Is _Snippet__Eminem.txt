6 ContributorsMy Name Is (Snippet) Lyrics

Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

Excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?

Hi kids, do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight
I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
Slim Shady, you a basehead!
Uh-uhhh!
So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!
Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut
"Shady wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a fuck
God sent me to piss the world off
Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim ShadyYou might also likeEmbed
