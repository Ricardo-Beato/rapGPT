(Wheel it!)
Yeah (Six!)
Yeah
Murda on tha beat so it's not nice

That’s Baka, he's a no-long-talker
Quick to let the motherfuckin' TEC slam
We don’t need to hear about a next man
Yutes talk down, then they get ran
Left them, get dipped from the whole ends
If Gilla call shots, no questions
G-Way til I'm restin'
But we still got love for the West End
If it's a chit-chat ting, better talk nice
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Skull gets hot, then I'm not nice
You tryna date her and she been let me wop twice
Now you man are on a diss ting
Just know man like Chubbs
He's a fixer if I ever gotta fix tings
Just know man like Fif, he's a sickaz
You get tanned, he don’t miss things
Just know man like me, I’m a Sixer
And I oversee the whole thing
Yeah, I pree the whole thing (SN1)
Yeah, I pree the whole thing
Preme got the err tucked, can't see the whole thing
Niggas wanna talk splits, now we need the whole thing

I'm on the best side, got the TEC lined
In the whip, on the left side, on a death ride (Switch it)
MAC-10 and the spesh flies, and the TEC slide
Nutty shit like somethin' just climbed out the X-Files (Ooh)
Textbook, like it's old school, like in textiles
Lighty lookin' healthy and she gets smiles
Home time, grab a quick drink and she gets wild
Sexy, and I rate that and her sex style (Switch it)
