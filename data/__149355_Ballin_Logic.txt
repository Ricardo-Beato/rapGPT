Okay
It's RattPack 'til my pulse flat, we keep it real, no false rap
I got four cards and they all black, got four broads and they all that
We call that ballin', doin' this is my callin'
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin', I'm like, "Yeah
What it do?" Penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through with my whole team, they coming too
That's real, too real, motherfucker, tell me how you feel
I'm too good for my own good, I won't leak the album, I'll let it spill
Number one, bitch, I bet it will, do the numbers I said it will
I played the game and I'm still the same and I never changed just to get a deal

Bitch, I'm ballin'
Ballin', I came from nuttin' to somethin'
Like it's nuttin', yeah, you know I done it, now there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know

I'ma live life 'til I overdose while they sleepin' on me, that's comatose
I went mainstream with my main team, you just mad as fuck, you ain't come close
And your next girl is my ex-girl, she fine as hell, but she a mess girl
All I do is rhyme, I got no time, so I can't reply to your text, girl
Bitch, I'm back again and I run it, always gotta keep it one-hunnid
All of y'all know y'all want it, turn it up and get blunted
I'm like, "Fuck the money, fuck the fame," I came here to fuck up the game
Gon' get it, I'm feelin' myself, fresh to death, bitch, I'm killin' myself; I'm gone
We burnin' it up, step in the building, we turnin' it up
Talkin' that shit, but they never admit when I step to the mic I be murderin' it
And we livin' real good, mainstream, but it's still good
I got raw shit, I got real shit, but right now it's time for that feel good
We call that ballin', doin' this is my callin'
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin', I'm like, "Yeah
What it do?" Penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through with my whole team, they coming too, that's
You might also like
Ballin', ballin'
I came from nuttin' to somethin'
Like it's nuttin', yeah, you know I done it, now there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know

Yeah
You know that we ballin', we been goin' all-in
Hold on, let me slow it down so y'all get the shit
These haters talk, but I don't give a shit
Got models, bottles, and the piff is lit
But we ballin', kinda like Spalding and Rawlings
On the road to riches never stallin'
Got your girl all up all on my nuts, boy
She do it with joy, no almonds, ugh
Living life to perfection, V.I.P., that's the section
Presidential watch, presidential suites
You would think we held an election
It go Logic first, then I'm up next
I do not converse, I just cut checks
I do not rehearse, I just drop the verse
I need to cop a hearse, 'cause I'm fresh to death
I bet you never seen so much designer
Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer
Boy, I stunt when I ain't even tryna
Swaggin' is nice, but first I'ma rhymer
And I rep Maryland, home of the Terrapins
Say you spit crack, homie, we spit that heroin
Bring it right to your front door like I'm carolin'
Standing next to me would be so embarrassin', yeah, we be
Ballin', ballin'
I came from nuttin' to somethin'
Like it's nuttin', yeah, you know I done it, now there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know116Embed
