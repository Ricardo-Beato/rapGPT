20 ContributorsHow I Did It (Perfection) Lyrics
Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it
I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it
This should be addition, these niggas subtractin'
And why I'm so tense, man, i should be relaxin'
Remember times on the highway with them ten
Done it all the best, cuz ive never seen the pen
Still do it for the streets cause they taught that boy a lesson
You done it how i did it, man, they call that shit perfection

I'm from a small hood, but I had big dreams
My uncle Robert taught me how to use the big beam
That was right before he caught his life sentences
Do what you gotta, just put your life in it, (hey)
Me and Goldmouth in this jeep, we on the road
All I saw was red and blue lights, I thought he told
Butterflies as we going through this roadblock
Ask yourself questions like (is this where my road stop?)
I'm tryna be cool, this nigga nervous
He sweatin' like a two dollar whore in Sunday Service
Got at least two blocks of hard back in this bitch
Right now I'm thinkin' we should've better packaged this shit
God works in mysterious ways and yes He do
Said "Mister that's a nice Cherokee" and they let us through
So, don't get to talkin' these records, I sold millions
3.5 off in Magic, I bought billions!

Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it
I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it
This should be addition, these niggas subtractin'
And why I'm so tense, man, i should be relaxin'
Remember times on the highway with them ten
Done it all the best, cuz ive never seen the pen
Still do it for the streets cause they taught that boy a lesson
You done it how i did it, man, they call that shit perfection

Hit my nigga up on the chirp, said "What's the ticket?"
24 extra 5, nigga show you how to whip it
Iâ€™m getting cooking, next to homies they counting the cash man
What to do with the wrap? (Never put it in the trash can!)
This shit is so deep, I'm talking so deep!
I'm the king of the kitchen now, this is my sink
I'm the king of the kitchen nigga this is my stove
That's why I got my own lane, bitch I made my own road (That's right!)
Now I'm movin' weight like a trainer and a diet
Used to put the work in a bag and then I tie it
Flashbacks I can't deny, but you tell them police ass niggas "Bitch I'm retired"
That's why I do it for the ones in the street, ones in the cage
All the shit I'm goin' through, I should be askin' for a raise
Don't get to talkin' this work, I made millions
3.5 off in Visions, I bought billions
Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it
I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it
This should be addition, these niggas subtractin'
And why I'm so tense, man, i should be relaxin'
Remember times on the highway with them ten
Done it all the best, cuz ive never seen the pen
Still do it for the streets cause they taught that boy a lesson
You done it how i did it, man, they call that shit perfection6Embed
