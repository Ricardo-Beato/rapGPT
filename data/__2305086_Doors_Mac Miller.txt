Yeah

I know it's been a minute since I've been away
Didn't mean to cause you pain, I just needed to escape
Ain't sayin' that I'm sober, I'm just in a better place
I'm on my way over, I'm just runnin' kinda late
And you know I've been through all the highs
I've seen all the lows, lost track of time
I'm coming home, you know my mind
Places it goes, and it goes, and it goes

It's only a game
Don't be afraid
These doors will close
And people change
One day you're gone
Right now you're here
Don't leave just yet
Don't disappear

Good morning, babyYou might also like9Embed
