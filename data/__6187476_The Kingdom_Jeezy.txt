Hmm, hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm

I gotta give 'em my heart, I gotta give 'em my soul (Woo)
Gotta push through the pain, gotta stay in control (Yeah)
See they want me to fold, yeah, they want me to break
Leave me dead in the streets, naw that can't be my fate
Tell me who can I trust? Tell me who shall I fear? (Yeah)
Hennessy in my cup (Cup), Hennessy in my tears (Damn)
Gasoline in my lungs, lil' bro on the drums
No high school diplomas, so they think that I'm dumb
Lord send me a check, Lord send me a sign (A sign)
At least send me my watch, in case I run out of time (Time)
They wanna give me a charge, they wanna give me a case (A case)
Teacher called me a failure, said it right to my face
Yeah, they called me a dealer, then they called me a killer (Yeah)
Then I went to the bank, there they called me a nigga (Damn)
You might also like
They forgot that I dream and my momma a queen
They forgot that I'm strong, they forgot that I'm a king (Woo)

All the bullshit is gettin' really old (What's up?)
Gotta tell the story just in case it's never told
Right hand to God, it does somethin' to my soul (Yeah)
When a black man turn nothin' into gold, nigga
Keep a cup full, so you know it's goin' down (Down)
One thing about the world, yeah, you know it's goin' round (Haha)
Keep your head up, nigga no lookin' down (Nah)
When the let you out them cuffs, readjust your crown
King (Let's go)

I gotta stay on my path, I gotta conquer my goals
Some call it success, I call it food for the soul
I know some can relate and the rest gonna hate
Do it with it without you, so it ain't no debate (Nah)
See blood in the street nightmares when I sleep (Sleep)
They must think I'm a diver, niggas said that I'm deep
Oxygen is a must, niggas dyin' for air
Got us all charged up, y'all better give him the chair (Yeah)
They got a license to kill, is you ready to die? (Die)
Notorious thugs, put your hands in the sky (The sky)
Why you think that I'm drinkin'? It's too numb all the pain (Woo)
Why you think that I'm smokin'? It's to numb all the fame (Yeah)
Feelin' like I'm a target, got an "X" on my back (Back)
Not no regular artist, Malcolm X in a hat (Yeah)
They forgot that I dream and my momma a queen
They forgot that I'm strong, they forgot that I'm a king (Woo)

All the bullshit is gettin' really old (What's up?)
Gotta tell the story just in case it's never told (Yeah)
Right hand to God, it does somethin' to my soul (Yeah)
When a black man turn nothin' into gold, nigga
Keep a cup full, so you know it's goin' down (Down)
One thing about the world, yeah, you know it's goin' round (Haha)
Keep your head up, nigga no lookin' down (Nah)
When the let you out them cuffs, readjust your crown
King (Let's go)

Yeah, I know a place, that's if you wanna roll
Bring your own weed, even drink your liquor slow
Everybody in that bitch worth six figures
Best part about it they ain't killin' no niggas
Yeah, I know a place, that's if you wanna roll
Money in the air, plenty strippers on the pole
Ain't no opps so you don't need no triggers
Best part about it they ain't killin' no niggasEmbed
