15 ContributorsSo Low Lyrics
I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low get low but you never been as low as me

I always speak for the struggle my people still hurting
I'm a name brand I'm a product but still a real person
I'm still flirting with death although I'm still certain
About my commitments in life although I'm still searching
I bet I find a way if not I bet I make a path
One thats seldom traveled by the masses
I never stuck in all the traffic I cut through all the plastic
Enemies of the enlightened like the government is fascist
I talk it how I live it yet I'm still considered a walking contradiction
Cause I'm breaking out of your artistic prison listen
I got my own demons what I'm supposed to do with yours
Times like this I gotta remind myself what I do It for
People I knew before celebrity swear they see the change in me
I tell em change is god you gotta let it be
How does it feel to come full circle
Still cursing still pursing my lips to pull purple but
You might also like

Witness it the building of a legacy
So let us just pray cause the journey thats ahead of us
Got us facing a task that just might get the best of us
Thats why we gotta clash with the Titans like Pegasus
No Oedipus but it's like the beat is my therapist
When I let it in it get up in the cracks and the crevices
Of my memories what kind of treasure are you buried with
You fight when you die are you a soldier or a terrorist
Remember this there's no one else to blame when you're solo
Establish your fan base local before you take it global
Don't be scared spend your own dough
You gotta speak up be vocal sometimes you feel so low
Ain't nowhere to go but up go with us
We just getting started why you slowing up
But know enough to know by a collective we
Even if my name is on the record sleeve I ain't into brevity
What the fuck is a celebrity
