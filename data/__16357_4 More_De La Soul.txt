(Never gonna give up on you)
Yeah, we gonna do it like this
(Just a little bit)
Like that
(Just a little bit)
Zhané
(Just a little bit)
De La
(Just a little bit)
C'mon!

I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more! (Don't front, front!)
I'll never give you up (Never!)
No, I'll never stop (I'll never stop, baby!)
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more! (Don't front, front!)

It's that brown man from Long Islandin' shores
Got a way with women, so I get away with yours
Because you're whole game's outdated
Which leaves all the pretty women heavily sedated
You might also like
Mommy, you can play your Ripley's, or believe it or not
Shoot gift like Heron with skills of Gil-Scott
Nights like Sir Lancelot can get heated
Prescribin' your vibe, love, I know how you need it

I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more! (Don't front, front!)
I'll never give you up (Never!)
No, I'll never stop (I'll never stop, baby!)
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more! (Don't front, front!)

I like to mingle sometimes, so I head outta state
To find a couple of dimes, but at a government rate
Can't settle for no nickels, even pennies for thought
For short, I need connections with big bank selections
Securin' all the sections with sing-sing corrections
Seedin' like nature, escapin' like gas
Tell me how long this love is gonna last?
Thinkin' fast might spoil somethin', turn a whole week to nothin'
Extra to your lady is special
Seen a bigger picture on the screen
But you're a movie, you move me
You soothe me like holidays, getaways
The brochure said do it, so true
It's not a hold-hand mission, cut the public display
Heard you're headed for the stars, put the gazers away
Nine times out of ten, we cut to good friends
But when we on the tenth, we gotta go the length!
I'm not a playa, yet I get more play
Than a talk show shown across the USA
Have 'em moanin' out the vowels sounds — ooh, eee and aahh!
And how, by now, you should know me and my
Crew members do members of the opposite sex
Have they boyfriends screamin', now we got more Techs
Than that ball team in Georgia (Yo, he said he comin' for ya!)
All because the hoe wanna go to the kasbah! Ha!

I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more! (Say-ba-doooo-ba yeah, yeahhh!)
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more! (Don't front, front!)

You can get with some of these women some of the time
When your face is in the light, thus stirred with lime
Is it a crime to sex your mind to death?
Resuscitated, see how many brain cells left
I feel your body's drawn to my positive
Don't even want it, baby, if it's that easy to give
I live right around the corner — three states away
Take a holiday, come check me
Watch how I set the mood, check a movie on the tube
Get your belt mad loose like Lee
Phone's turned way down to avoid the beef
Or the questions, if she's the only one gettin' lessons
Yeah, you're into crime faces, huh? Well, I'll play your Capone
Suzy Q got the grill to make the cake chrome
Situation's gettin' absurd, hot on a plat
So work the format, see how we do that?
Considering you're figurin' we'll love on the rock
I'mma keep it up front to maintain the stock
Displayin' all the goodies from your knuckle to knees
Make it hot like the Island degrees, now that's special!

I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more! (Don't front, front!)
I'll never give you up (Never!)
No, I'll never stop (Never!)
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' for more! (Don't front, front!)1Embed
