Zaytoven
Zaytoven on the track
Gucci!

They call me Chef Boy R-G
But hold that thought
It's a Kodak moment
The way I hold that fork
Hurricane wrist game
Tornado turns dog
Pockets Piggly Wiggly
Can't Kermit The Frog dog

Early in the mornin' I ain't even yawnin'
I'm cookin' up a cake like I'm doin' a performance
When it comes to flossin' g I ain't even talking
Davin's on my dunk got my Chevy moonwalking
10 bricks on my Bart Simpson just look
My watch, 35 pounds of kush
My ring, 36 o's my nig
My bracelet, 500 pounds of mid
A Gucci rap tour bus, y'all hoes follow us
Party pack of pills mane hoes gone swallow
Naturally a loner but I love my kin
Mix the soda with the cola I can buy me a friend
New swag something like trap house times 10
Every nigga round me bust heads, ya dig
Iced out grill I can't buy that bullshit
I preach the street shit like the reverend in a pool pit
You might also like
They call me Chef Boy R-G
But hold that thought
It's a Kodak moment
The way I hold that fork
Hurricane wrist game
Tornado turns dog
Pockets Piggly Wiggly
Can't Kermit The Frog dog

Like the boy ? I got a real good J
1 gram for the 80, that's a real good play
Got them Vince Carter quarters, add soda and water
I'm not athletic, but I'm a straight baller
? Ticket, with the Larry Bird yay
And it's jumping from the free throw like MJ
See my vette pass by like a Steve Nash pass
Stay loyal to the fans or the utah jags
Like Doctor J shorts, my work real tight
You got that Atlanta hawks yay, it won't get right
Catch me on the rebound like Bo Outlaw
Imma Michael Vick whip it, cook it southpaw
36 whole zones tryna make the end zone
Made a ? move and used my cellphone
Work scrambling in the pot just like Steve Young
Buy it for the Keyshawn, sell it for the Deion
They call me Chef Boy R-G
But hold that thought
It's a Kodak moment
The way I hold that fork
Hurricane wrist game
Tornado turns dog
Pockets Piggly Wiggly
Can't Kermit The Frog dog

Gucci on fire like Mojo crackpot
Fell of but I jumped right back like crack rock
Money stupid dumb just like cold blood
Just like Young Hot, I show no love
Your money skinny like ? mines like fat
And my trap roll hard just like Shawty Black
I'm a country ass n***a just like Ace
Got a fetish for the stones just like Four Trey
Money all like bruh, yours like D
And my patience very short just like Courtney C
Angey B recipe, but it's your choice
My girl Asian pussy deep like slick man voice
Like ? '03, man I got bread
My pockets on swole like HB forehead
I'mma money go getter, something like ?
Got a hundred hoes jocking just like Throwback
They call me Chef Boy R-G
But hold that thought
It's a Kodak moment
The way I hold that fork
Hurricane wrist game
Tornado turns dog
Pockets Piggly Wiggly
Can't Kermit The Frog dog1Embed
