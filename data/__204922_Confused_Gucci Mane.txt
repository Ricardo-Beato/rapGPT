24 ContributorsConfused Lyrics
I get high 'til I'm confused
I don't know what else to do
Bentley Coupe or Porsche Coupe
Henny got me so confused
White girl, black girl, I'm confused
Molly, kush, I'm leaning screwed
I'm so geeked up, I'm confused
Cash or check, I'm too confused
Money got me too confused
These girls, they got me too confused
Oxy got me too confused
I'm too confused, I'm too confused
Future, Gucci, too confused
Freeband Gang, we too confused
Brick Squad put you on the news
Free Bales got them too confused

Robin's Jeans or switch to Trues
I don't know, I'm so confused
How many girls, three or two?
Beat that pussy black and blue
Damn, I like the way she look
But I don't like her attitude
Took her out and dicked her down
But she didn't show no gratitude
Cars, I got a lot of them
Forgiato tennis shoes
Trapper to the heart
But I still'll make a business move
I cannot go back to jail
Cause I got too much to lose
Don't leave home without my scale
Cause I got some work to move
Smash, smash
No cuffing, pass her to the crew
Did what I did, I'm finished with her
Then I turn her onto you
Discombobulated, man
I swear, I don't know what to do
Gucci Mane, I'm so confused
That I forgot to bring my roof
You might also like
I get high 'til I'm confused
I don't know what else to do
Bentley Coupe or Porsche Coupe
Henny got me so confused
White girl, black girl, I'm confused
Molly, kush, I'm leaning screwed
I'm so geeked up, I'm confused
Cash or check, I'm too confused
Money got me too confused
These girls, they got me too confused
Oxy got me too confused
I'm too confused, I'm too confused
Future, Gucci, too confused
Freeband Gang, we too confused
Brick Squad put you on the news
Free Bales got them too confused

Drinking lean and smoking kush
I'm in the kitchen like a cook
Lean and molly, ecstasy
I don't know what I done took
My black lawyer Abraham a Jew
Cash or Visa what I do
Foreign, foreign, bad, bad
Bitches all the kids pursue
My iPad and my Metro
And I'm working out the iPhone too
Future on the super booze
The Remy did what I should do
Turn up with puff or fuck with Goose
The Panamera or my coupe
I don't wanna drive no more
Get chauffeured 'round this fucking zoo
Paper got me a like monster
Turned me to a fucking bear
Popping bottles on the sofa
Feel like I'm inside the air
No security, Gucci down
Future plug like everywhere
Freeband Gang, Brick Squad
Free Bales outta here
I get high 'til I'm confused
I don't know what else to do
Bentley Coupe or Porsche Coupe
Henny got me so confused
White girl, black girl, I'm confused
Molly, kush, I'm leaning screwed
I'm so geeked up, I'm confused
Cash or check, I'm too confused
Money got me too confused
These girls, they got me too confused
Oxy got me too confused
I'm too confused, I'm too confused
Future, Gucci, too confused
Freeband Gang, we too confused
Brick Squad put you on the news
Free Bales got them too confused

Solar system on a move
I feel like a thousand goons
Me and Future smoking kush
We high as a hot air balloon
Future Jimi Hendrix
You might catch the kid eating them shrooms
I'm outer space, I'm in Neptune
I'm in Mars and Pluto, too
Brick Squad is a army nigga
Pistols for my whole platoon
If you ain't getting no money
Then you might as well leave the room
Free Bales, Free Bales, Free Bales
We 'bout to give 'em hell
Free pills, free pills, free pills
We got 'em vacuum sealed
I be dripping so much sauce
Got bitches ready to lick it off
I get so much money, man
I swear, I'm geeked up on the soft
Gucci Mane, yeah I'm a boss
I swear, I gotta get my point across
Bricks, I got to get across
In my trap house getting it off
I get high 'til I'm confused
I don't know what else to do
Bentley Coupe or Porsche Coupe
Henny got me so confused
White girl, black girl, I'm confused
Molly, kush, I'm leaning screwed
I'm so geeked up, I'm confused
Cash or check, I'm too confused
Money got me too confused
These girls, they got me too confused
Oxy got me too confused
I'm too confused, I'm too confused
Future, Gucci, too confused
Freeband Gang, we too confused
Brick Squad put you on the news
Free Bales got them too confused15Embed
