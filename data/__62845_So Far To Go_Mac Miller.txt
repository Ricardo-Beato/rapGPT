12 ContributorsSo Far To Go Lyrics
Oh, yo
(Thank y'all for tunin' in) One of the greatest of all time
(Uh; The Jukebox) J Dilla (Change my life)
(Uh; Mac Miller) We miss you
(What up, Dilla?) What up, Haze? What up, Capcom?
(We miss you right here, you know what I'm sayin'?)
East End Empire, TreeJTV (Hip-hop, hip-hop)
So I felt that it would be necessary (I got love for my peoples)
Mac Miller to talk to the people (And that ain't gon' stop)
J Dilla, what up? ()
Uh

I got my mind in the clouds, in paradise livin' with style
My mom should be proud, I've been dedicated now for a while
I'm in love with hip-hop, I'm in love with life
I'm in love with the days, late nights, kush, money
I'm in love with this mic
And now time on my side 'cause I'm young and I'm grindin' so hard
Plus I'm sayin' somethin' every single time that I'm rhymin' my bars
I'm just a child, y'all gon' see me grow
But now I know, I've got so far to go

Uh
Sometimes I think about this time next year
Grindin' to the fullest, kickin' rhymes for your ears
I wonder if they hear me now, comin' fresh with a style
The illest child, always chillin' with a smile
'Cause hip-hop waitin' for me back at home
We just need to have a little time alone
'Cause lately I've been livin' life by my phone
Tryna do business, mind on my dough
Woah, hold up, let me take a rest
Bring it back with my dogs like I'm playin' fetch
I'm tryna be the future, moldin' the CD
Somethin' bumpin' out the system on repeat
My mind's elevated like E.T
Work hard in quick sand, knee deep
You know I'm always doin' double like a re-read
It's like I play the whole game with a cheat sheet
Dollar signs to my name like Too Short
Gonna go broke with this taxin' on Newports
I'm unhealthy, workin' to succeed
Tryna spit out more words than I can read
Stayin' up late, keep burnin' through this weed
My grandma probably turnin' in her G-R-A-V-E, grave, that's right
Spellin' bee champ, fifth grade
This my job, I'm about my guap
Keep it fresh like shoes right out the box
I'm just tryna give you somethin' loud that knocks
So far to go, but I'm never gon' stop
You might also like
I got my mind in the clouds, in paradise livin' with style
My mom should be proud, I've been dedicated now for a while
I'm in love with hip-hop, I'm in love with life
I'm in love with the days, late nights, kush, money
I'm in love with this mic
And now time on my side 'cause I'm young and I'm grindin' so hard
Plus I'm sayin' somethin' every single time that I'm rhymin' my bars
I'm just a child, y'all gon' see me grow
But now I know, I've got so far to goEmbed
