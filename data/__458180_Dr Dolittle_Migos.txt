8 ContributorsDr Dolittle Lyrics
Still trapping out the house with the boards on the window
I got chickens I got biscuits like I'm Mrs. Winners
We been getting guap since a beginner
I'm in the trap talk to my dog Dr. Dolittle
Did I say Dr. Dolittle I feel like Malcom In The Middle
I do got a whole lot of Gorillas
I swear to god they'll kill ya
Hell yea I said Dr.Dolittle
My dogs gon' eat you lil' nigga
Me and my dogs in the trap
We came up off of nickels

First time I kick that door I ain't even know
What I was getting myself into but I came out with gold
Seventeen years old cash out on a jugg
Hit a True Religion Store
Eighteen years old me and RelMoney hit the plug for a boat
My momma mad cause the house reeking
Bagging up grams late night im sleeping
It took her re-up money just to make this rap shit easy
And a whole lot of praying
Gotta lay you down the blueprint
I'm standing here with my dogs
Nigga I know M&M's gone stand
You might also like
Still trapping out the house with the boards on the window
I got chickens I got biscuits like I'm Mrs. Winners
We been getting guap since a beginner
I'm in the trap talk to my dog Dr.Dolittle
Did I say Dr. Dolittle I feel like Malcom In The Middle
I do got a whole lot of Gorillas
I swear to god they'll kill ya
Hell yea I said Dr.Dolittle
My dogs gon' eat you lil' nigga
Me and my dogs in the trap
We came up off of nickels

Fish scale fish scale
Yeah I'm selling dinner plates
Never passed gym class, but I'm good with moving weight
If I front a nigga duece
Then I need 4 back
Offset is a boss trap nigga hash tag
Coca coca coca crack
Hit like Sammy Sosa
From clapping like Magnolia
Tryna sew ya' I don't know ya'
I came up and you fell off
I score a hole in one like golf
My niggas trapping on and off
They get the work and get it off
Still trapping out the house with the boards on the window
I got chickens I got biscuits like I'm Mrs. Winners
We been getting guap since a beginner
I'm in the trap talk to my dog Dr.Dolittle
Did I say Dr. Dolittle I feel like Malcom In The Middle
I do got a whole lot of Gorillas
I swear to god they'll kill ya
Hell yea I said Dr.Dolittle
My dogs gon' eat you lil' nigga
Me and my dogs in the trap
We came up off of nickels2Embed
