47 ContributorsThousand Words Lyrics
Uh

They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine‚ huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong‚ huh
The flash is on this little light of mine‚ yeah
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong‚ uh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah

Uh, a picture's worth a thousand words‚ a video worth a million
But no amount of likes can heal up all this pain that I'm feeling
Maybe conceal it, and hide in all these problems we deal with
I grew up on the principle, to raise a child, need a village
I think we all wanna be a little Instagram famous
Deep down inside, nobody really wanna be nameless
Afraid of being forgotten, so this troll shit, we plottin'
Sittin' on this phone for hours, feel my brain getting rotten
But I can give a fuck less, dawg, a nigga is poppin'
All these bitches that's flockin', shit, a nigga got options
But what's really important is such a silly distortion
We all stuck in this matrix, tryna hide our misfortunes
You might also like
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, huh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, uh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah

Uh, living in this false reality that's in this picture gallery
Based on a nigga's profile, we guessin' salary
The lifestyle you advertise was quite strategized
Make a minimal amount and then we maximize
These niggas cappin' with lies how they capitalize
Creating they own perceptions, what a massive facade
Digital marketing schemes even broader regime
Live how you want on the internet, who thought of this thing?
I mean, I guess it ain't the worst shit, if life was picture perfect
Who could paint a picture vivid as media circus?
The surface is much deeper than even the Earth is
I searched it, lookin' for purpose like my first kiss
At the same time this shit will have you feeling worthless
Back into reality, woke up and just reversed it
Now I'm a new man, even got a new 'Gram
But let me take a picture with this money by my new Lam'
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, huh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, uh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah8Embed
