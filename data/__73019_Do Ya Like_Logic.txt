51 ContributorsDo Ya Like Lyrics
Without me knowing, they melt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up
(Sinatra)

Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (Logic)
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me get it right now, make you get aroused
Baby you been on my mind for a while now
I just wanna take some time
Write this rhyme with a beautiful woman like you in mind
Baby, be mine
I'm tryna find what makes you tick, can we talk?
Maybe walk around the park, trust me, girl, I'll stand apart
All women ain't bitches
And all men aren't dogs even though we bark
'Cause I just want to get to know you
Maybe run around and show you what a gentleman is
Yeah, tell me what it do
Shawty, I'm coming for you
Ain't talking about sex, I'm talking about something from above
I'm talkin' 'bout love
I'm talkin' 'bout love, love, love, love, love
Yeah, now that you know that I'm for real
It's the perfect time to kill
Any fear that you may have
Baby girl, I won't be mad if you ain't feelin' it
But if you down, better believe I'm killin' it
Take you to the crib on that late night drillin' it
(Sinatra)

Wait a second, hold up
How the hell you think I got this name?
Girl, I'm all about the brain
Why you think they call me (Logic)
Okay, condom in my pocket
Lay on the bed, let me rock it
Please don't stop the spit from profit
But this right here on the house
Fuck the bed, we cuttin' on the floor then later on the couch
Ladies give out 'til I gets it in
Make you scream and make you grin
From the very beginnin' from the second I'm in
I'm trying to tease you, let me please you
Baby girl you know I need you
Do you like you never had it (Done)
Putting work with this one right here
Yeah you know it's just for fun
Give it to you like I was trying to conceive a son
I gets it done then I'm ready for more
So, ain't no telling where we'll go
But one thing that I know fo' sho'
This angel has no halo, I don't play no games
You can ask my ex I never eat the box
But if I control her, I may select some freaky shit to start
Then bring it back
We can go for hours, girl I never slept
Tell me how you want it
Face to face or rough and from the back
Just like that, she gon' overwork me if I let her
But I don't give a damn, I just wanna feel better, ayy
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
