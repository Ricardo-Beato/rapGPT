23 ContributorsGive It To Me Lyrics
Only last week I murdered a rock, injured a stone
Hospitalized a brick, I'm so mean I make medicine sick

Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic
Yeah my name is—yeah my name is Logic
And I'm in the fucking building
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic
Yeah my name is—yeah my name is Logic

(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it

Okay, I'ma give it to you like you never had, get you glad
Crucify that pussy, yeah your boy is bad (Boy is bad)
If you want it now then girl lets get it popping
Panties dropping, fuck your man
Now or never shorty, we ain't never stoppin'
So use your logic, mama you won't get this chance again
Take you to the moon just to watch the fucking world spin
Yes I'm living right, but tonight I'm in a world of sin
Try to focus on this music but here comes that girl again
Love the way she talk, the way she walk
The way her curls spin and every time she talk to me
I feel the need for oxygen
You might also like
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it

Yeah my name is Logic and I'm in the fucking building
Searching for the shorty that is down to have my children
Break a genetic code that allows my DNA to fill him
Blood money all I know so you can say I make a killin
When I'm in your presence
My intellect what surrounds you, but we can dumb it down
No need for words, let me astound you
Take a sip of water, smoke a jack, it's time for Round 2
I beat the pussy up, like I want your lunch money
Give you the quick-stick, like fifth-gear, honey
I don't prefer beef, that just isn't my agenda
I'd rather eat beets, like a thursday in november

(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
(I'ma give it to you) Like you want it, you need it
Gotta have it, can't live without it
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic
Yeah my name is—yeah my name is Logic
And I'm in the fucking building
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic
Yeah my name is—yeah my name is LogicEmbed
