5 Contributors6 Foot Tall Lyrics
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
International Rock Star!
Yeah, it's Blanco!
IRS!

Ok, ok, I got the ball
I'm comin' down the court like Jordan with his tongue out
Petite and all, I'm steppin' on y'all like I'm 20 foot tall
Cinammon skin, like a porcelain doll
Juice box liable to start a 20 man brawl
Shame on y'all, thinkin' I'mma fall, I'mma never fall
Like the dope fiend lean, IRS the team
Live in New Jeruz, rep 7-18
Buckingham Palace like Elizabeth the queen, related
Hello, hello, It's Mrs. steal your man
Give 'em right back to you, then steal 'em again
You can get another one, Bet I'll steal him
You already know, Audemars stealin' lookin' like the Aspen slopes
You already snow, rocks, avalanche
You already know, I get stupid like ski racks on the Maybach
James Brown, big payback, ow!
Where my cape at?
Ow! Where my cape at?
