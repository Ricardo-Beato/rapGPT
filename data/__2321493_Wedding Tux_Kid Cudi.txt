27 ContributorsWedding Tux Lyrics
Emotional slave slut
She push and pulls, uses me for what she needs
Just an emotional slave slut
Been tossed aside like rotten meat
While the maggots and vultures feast
Feasting on my memories
Everyone's searching for lightning, oh
Hold up a box of recycling, oh

Bury me to sleep in a wedding tux (Hmm)
Everything, everyone sucks
Bury me to sleep in a wedding tux (Hmm)
Everything, everyone sucks

Just an emotional slave slut
She push and pulls, uses me for what she needs
Just an emotional slave slut
Been tossed aside like rotting meat
While the maggots and vultures feast
I can't wait to be rotting meat
Everyone searching for lightning, oh
Right in plain sight, you deny him, oh
You might also like
Bury me to sleep in a wedding tux
Everything, everyone sucks
Everything, everyone sucks
Bury me to sleep in a wedding tux
Everything, everyone sucks12Embed
