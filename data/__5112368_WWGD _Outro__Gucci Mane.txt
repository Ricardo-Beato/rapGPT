10 ContributorsWWGD (Outro) Lyrics
Zaytoven
Huh? Wop (Evil)
Evil, Evil Knievel, haha

Big boss status, it's the motherfuckin' Wizzop (Wop)
It's lonely at the tizzop (Yeah) so I took some off the tizzop (Skrrt)
I'm shittin' on the industry, my enemies ain't rich as me (Huh)
Your baby dad ain't half as me (Nope), used to buy a half from me (Pussy)
Started off at mountain peak (Mountain), my homeboy cut my first slab for me (Huh)
Fistfight at the skating rink (Yeah), know he would throw the first jab for me (Bah)
Found out he a snitch (Damn), hurt my heart, he can't hang with me (Wow)
Boy, you a bitch, fuck all that shit, you ain't gang to me (Why?)
Low down dirty piece of shit, you ain't gang to me (Nope)
I'm a stand-up nigga, you sittin' pissin', not the same as me (Damn)
'Terrogation room, shoulda thought, "What would Gucci do?" (Gucci)
I'd rather rot in my cell wearin' shower shoes (Damn)
Fuck the police, that's my thoughts, I make power moves
How you turned state on your boys? That's a coward move (Damn)
12-gauge hit you and your boy, it's so powerful
Knocked his head off like a toy, it's so powerful (Damn)

What would Gucci do? Yeah
Stand up like a man? That's what Gucci would do
Turn state, be a snitch? That's what a coward does
Million dollar watch? That's what Gucci do
Be a bitch? That's what a coward do
Man, it's a couple trap niggas still left, man
