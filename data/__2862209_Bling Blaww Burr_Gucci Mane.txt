You see, this car I'm ridin' in cost five hundred thou' (Well, damn)
Tell them pussy-ass niggas they should look at me now (Pussy)
Niggas say that they gon' run up on the Gucci, but how? (Huh?)
And tell your sister I don't love her, I'm in love with her mouth (Mwah)
I'm from East Atlanta, Georgia, I'm in love with the South (6)
I put an ounce in the pot and make it Bankhead bounce (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
My mama found some sacks on me, kicked me out of her house
But I had forty thousand saved, I shoulda been moved out (Hah)
You know Guwop been iced out, but I got new jewels now (Burr, burr, burr, burr)
Think I'm a clone, but if they cut me, then sauce gon' ooze out (Sauce)
I make these haters lose they cool, I done changed the rules (Yeah, yeah)
When real niggas walk in the room, then they change the mood
It's Gucci (Blaow)

She got good head and a fat onion (Yeah)
She only fuck niggas with money
I killed that pussy, all in her tummy
Then I asked that bitch, "Who run it?" (Who run it?)
She said she waitin', I said I'm comin'
I'm on the E-way doing a hundred (Skrrt)
Bitch, I got dope to sell (Yeah)
Fresh as fuck like I got hoes for sale (Ayy, ayy)
Can't fuck with a bitch that don't listen (Nah)
Two bitches in the car with me kissin' (For real)
In Detroit, ballin' like a Piston (Woo)
All this hot sauce got me drippin' (Yeah)
Blow out the candles, make a wish (Make a wish)
Your bitch is like the side dish (Haha)
I might fuck with her, I might not (Yeah)
Depend on if I feel like or not (Hah)
She only fuckin' niggas with them stacks (Yeah)
Yeah, bitch, my motor in the back (It's in the back)
I just wanna hit her from the back
I might dump her, then take her back (Ayy)
My bitch mad at me, but I fixed it, bought her a bag (Hey, hey)
I just walked in the bank with a whole quarter in cash
Bling, blaow, bling, burr
I'm a street nigga with money and that's obvious
She only fuck niggas with money and that's obvious
I'ma keep that shit a hundred and that's obvious
And this watch here cost a hundred and that's obvious
I'm a street nigga with money and that's obvious
She only fuck niggas with money and that's obvious
I'ma keep that shit a hundred and that's obvious
And this watch here cost a hundred and that's obvious (Go, blaow)
