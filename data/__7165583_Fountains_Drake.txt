How do you know the way I feel?
You got me losing my mind, oh
Try to suppress my emotions
They're bursting like fountains, baby
They take me up, they take me down
I’m getting weak in my knees, oh

I got nothing to admire, taste certain
Baby, longing you make me feel something
I got my eyes on you, pull down the curtain
I'll be patient with you, no more fighting

Oh, baby
Come in, come in, yeah, come in
I cannot fathom this life without you
Woah, oh, come in, come in, yeah, come in
This feels like home now
Come in and stay here
Baby
Baby, baby
Baby, baby

I feel you in my mind
I want to dance tonight
It's in thе air tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know it’s all your fault
No, I don't wanna say no
You'vе broken down the door
Don't make me go, no
You might also like
I just wanna hold you
I need no control, no
Would you let me love you, me love you?
It's all over
I lost my composure
I got love to show you
Would you let me love you, me love you, baby?

I got nothing to admire, taste certain
Baby, longing you make me feel something
I got my eyes on you, pull down the curtain
I'll be patient with you, no more fighting

Oh, baby
Come in, come in, yeah, come in
I cannot fathom this life without you
Woah, oh, come in, come in, yeah, come in
This feels like home now
Come in and stay here
Baby
Baby, baby10Embed
