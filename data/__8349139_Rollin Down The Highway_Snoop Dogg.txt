1 ContributorRollin Down The Highway Lyrics
Rollin' down the highway
Pedal to the floor
Same fools ridin’ that been down for years
Nigga pullin' real weight
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
So I won’t be broke no more
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
Rollin' down the highway
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
Pedal to the floor
Same fools ridin' that been down for years (Ooh, ooh)
Nigga pullin' real weight
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
'Cause I can’t be broke no more

Lethal technique, cerebral expertise
My teaspoon of the street to teach you for weeks
The peoplе you meet’ll reach you deep
If they don't reach out and snatch you, creep out and jack you
In this city, policе harass you
Leap out and attack you, beat you, then ask you
Poverty stricken, no positive livin’
Possibilities of me tryin' beat the odds of me livin'
No spot to live in, no pot to piss in
The block and flippin' is better than the cops in prison
And Rams clear a nigga head out
Hella sincere with what I said out, bustin’ all the feds out
And every syllable, G-Dubb is fillable
I'm uncut, still stuck to my umbilical, uncontrollable youth
Leakin' government secrets to the streets when we step in the booth
Big niggas jumpin' and runnin', we comin', gunnin'
Prepare for the youngins, or you'll get done in when we rush in
The busy gorilla filled to the peak, I'm spillin'
Speak my feelin', my heat revealin' and we—
You might also like
Rollin' down the highway
Pedal to the floor
Same fools ridin' that been down for years (Ooh, ooh)
Nigga pullin' real weight
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
So I won't be broke no more
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
Rollin' down the highway
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
Pedal to the floor (Pedal to the medal, you know)
Same fools ridin' that been down for years (Ooh, ooh)
Nigga pullin' real weight (Real weight)
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
'Cause I can't be broke no more

I'm on the 17 in a Benz, tryna get some more wins
I dip out, I dip in, I jump out, I jump in
I roll out, I roll in, no talkin', just dump in
Never punk out, motherfucker, we punked in (Nigga)
I get the money up front
Then drive off very casually, blazin' a blunt
I'm slidin' off, listenin' to 213 and, ah, man
Life is so hard when you're Doggy the Doggy Dogg
I'm talkin' to myself at times, tryna walk a straight line
Driftin', drinkin' and drivin', smokin' on mine
Tryna keep myself from gettin' caught up
'Cause I ain't got time to be doin' time
You might've seen me in the 69, Monte Carlo
Honey blonde, two of a kind, a little toy of mine
G-Funk back in action, Cadillac maccin' (Snoop Dogg)
And you can catch me with the—
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
Rollin' down the highway
Pedal to the floor
Same fools ridin' that been down for years (Ooh, ooh)
Nigga pullin' real weight
Same fools ridin' that been down for years
'Cause I can't be broke no moreEmbed
