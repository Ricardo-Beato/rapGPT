Uh-huh
Fuck

(Mustard on the beat, ho) I don't fuck wit' you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you (You,) lil' stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, uh

I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic (Woah)
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
Brr brr, I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, "I don't fuck wit'-
Chu, bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And every day I wake up celebratin' shit, why?
‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch, I
Stuck to my guns (Woah,) that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here, that's what made me this (This)
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on (Swerve)
And then another one text (Swerve, swerve,) then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like—
You might also like
I don't fuck wit' you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a (E-40)
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do (Hawoo)
I don't give a fuck, uh

Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online, limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich (Hella rich)
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio (Arsenio)
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless (Uh,) you might end up domeless (Uh)
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty (Mmm)
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth (Pour up)
Why you always comin' around with bad news? (Bad news)
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose (Hope I lose)
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew (Crew,) but them niggas cool (Cool)
It's just that—
I don't fuck wit' you (Lil' biatch)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Uh-uh)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do (You)
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for (God)
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for (Swerve, swerve, swerve)
Yeah, I got a lot, but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor (Floor)
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up (Uh)
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up (Uh)
That shit can break ya down, if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up (Yup)
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious (Woah,) feel me
When you get a fine bitch, just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma too real, so I hope you doin' cool
But still—
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
No, no, no, no
Little stupid ass, I ain't fuckin' wit' (Woah)
I ain't fuckin', I ain't, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Woah)
I ain't fuckin' wit'chu, ha
Straight up, yeah, yeah
Woah
