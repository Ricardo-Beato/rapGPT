1 ContributorGoodbyes Lyrics
Before we get up outta here
We wanna thank all of y'all for not forgetting what hip-hop is
Y'all made that shit for real tonight, a'ight?
A'ight, hold on, one more thing
Everybody talkin' 'bout "Keep it real"
Everybody talkin' 'bout "Keep it real"
This is real right here, alright?
White, Black, orange, purple, green, blue, yellow
Up in here enjoying themselves and having a good time
Cut that ignorant shit outta here
We don't wanna duck from guns
We don't wanna call our women "hoes"
We don't wanna call our brothers "niggas"
Hip-hop for real, a'ight?
Ban the bullshit and get down with this band, a'ight?
Native Tongues forever, y'all
Native Tongues forever and we up outta here, peace
(Peace out, y'all)You might also likeEmbed
