9 ContributorsGive It to Me Lyrics
Yeah

If you gon' give it to me baby (give it to me, baby)
Don't play games, jus' give it to me baby
The waitin' is drivin' me crazy
You can have it how you like it, girl, we could get it on tonight
I'm gon' give it to you baby
I ain't playin' games, I'ma give it to you baby
The waiting's been drivin' you crazy
Your place or mine, baby, it's goin' down tonight

(Yo) Girl quit playin' why you tryin' to stall me
Not on the first night, come on, that shit corny
I'm tired of finger-fuckin' this phone
Phone calls bore me, you got me horny
Is you against me or is you for me
Is you into dick pleasin' if so you leavin'
Cell phones off so they won't be ringin'
Might as well get off when you get home you beastin'
Motherfucker already think you cheatin'
Homie woulda cried then give him a reason
I'm tired of you tellin' me how he's cheatin'
Girl don't get mad get even
You might also like
If you gon' give it to me baby (give it to me, baby)
Don't play games, jus' give it to me baby
The waitin' is drivin' me crazy
You can have it how you like it, girl, we could get it on tonight
I'm gon' give it to you baby
I ain't playin' games, I'ma give it to you baby
The waiting's been drivin' you crazy
Your place or mine, baby, it's goin' down tonight

Don't hurt nobody when you move that thang
You make a nigga jus' lose his brain
When you make that ass clap and swing your hips
Put your head in my lap then lick your lips
Come on dip baby dip, yeah I'm 'bout my pimp
With a whole lotta ice, 24's on my whip
You can all take a trip the after party
Thirty two room mansion and ten garages
Make a home flick, how them real m√©nages
So tell your girls it's just me and my partners
We don't throw dollaz we start with 20's
And there's more where that came from, come get with me, yeah..

If you gon' give it to me baby (give it to me, baby)
Don't play games, jus' give it to me baby
The waitin' is drivin' me crazy
You can have it how you like it, girl, we could get it on tonight
I'm gon' give it to you baby
I ain't playin' games, I'ma give it to you baby
The waiting's been drivin' you crazy
Your place or mine, baby, it's goin' down tonight
(Yo Yo) I just wanna get you hot and wet
I'm so seductive I make 'em fiend for the sex
I just wanna stroke your brain
For the first half-hour then I smoke your thang
This is exclusive sex, we a star couple
On the lee-low though, we too much trouble
And your friends is hot, and my friends is the shit
We can have our own private party at the crib
The haze, the licks, your legs can sit
On top of my shoulders while I'm goin' in
Yeah I talk dirty and we jus' met
But you feelin' the vibe you gotta admit..

If you gon' give it to me baby (give it to me, baby)
Don't play games, jus' give it to me baby
The waitin' is drivin' me crazy
You can have it how you like it, girl, we could get it on tonight
I'm gon' give it to you baby
I ain't playin' games, I'ma give it to you baby
The waiting's been drivin' you crazy
Your place or mine, baby, it's goin' down tonightEmbed
