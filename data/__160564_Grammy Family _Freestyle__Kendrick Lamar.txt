28 ContributorsGrammy Family (Freestyle) LyricsI don't need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?
(Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em)
Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, "Fuck the world" with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop
