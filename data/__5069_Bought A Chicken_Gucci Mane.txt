30 ContributorsBought A Chicken Lyrics
Squad, Juice, Woohie, Gucci, Frenchie, Flocka
Squad, okay, Bricksquad, okay, squad (One take no mistake, no flaws baby, touch down with yo bonkers, it's Gucci)

Everyday is Cinemax, every night's a porno
All my niggas gung-ho; animals, Congo
Shining like a french cut diamond out of Frisco
The year's '49 and I know everything that Bo know
Two Thousand 1017 and I'm ballin, Bricksquad Brick boys bad hoes callin
Swagger through new Orleans, rocking with the live band
Rockin' with the G, Bricksquad should be on Gangland
Bad to the bone, leave my hat where my home is
Scrapping told a G I leave my GAT where my tone's at
Brick Squad Mafia, dressed in black, your boy is back
And off the wall with bricks and bails and pints of lean and cars and all
Shining like a French cut diamond like an actor
Everyday is Cinemax, every night's a porno
Gucci Mane La Flare, I know everything that Bo know
Shining like a french cut diamond out of Frisco

I just bought a chicken, and it came with biscuits
Our trap is a drive-thru, call it Mrs. Winters
Chicken finger-licking, don't tolerate no snitching
Bricksquad trappin, chickens in the kitchen
Chicken go for 30, chicken go for 30
30-rack shawty, tryna score a birdie
Chickens go for 30, chickens go for 30
30-rack shawty, tryna score a birdie

Chicken go for 30, but my chicken purrdy
Niggas with them low numbers, his chicken so dirty
I keep it 100, my trap do them numbers (Yes sir)
Cause I keep that super clean, my brick wonder woman
I drop 62 my nigga, 63 grams stronger
My traphouse go super hard, j's love the aroma (Yes sir)
I feel like it's 95, I still got that hunger
Slide through the trap and my pockets on humongous
Bricksquad trappin got young Juiceman with that money
30 rack chicken, come and spend your money
If you spend that 30, your chicken 100
I pull out my trap, pockets on cucumber

I just bought a chicken, and it came with biscuits
Our trap is a drive-thru, call it Mrs. Winters
Chicken finger-licking, don't tolerate no snitching
Bricksquad trappin, chickens in the kitchen
Chicken go for 30, chicken go for 30
30-rack shawty, tryna score a birdie
Chickens go for 30, chickens go for 30
30-rack shawty, tryna score a birdie

I'm from QU Nigga, who is you nigga?
Neighborhood buzz, Wooh Da King? Much bigger
Neighborhood thugs, you are not no killer
Chopper shells beatin' on your chest like godzilla
Affiliated with gangstas, put the cannon to yo mama
Beefin with Wooh will get you and your DJ Drama
Father made a nigga, mama raised a killa
Streets made me bigger, I'm that nigga behind the trigga
Tryna snatch the chain off my CEO neck
Will get you jumped, stabbed, shot if you want respect
Gucci, Juice, Wooh don't fuck around
Chickens go for 30 all the way around
I just bought a chicken, and it came with biscuits
Our trap is a drive-thru, call it Mrs. Winters
Chicken finger-licking, don't tolerate no snitching
Bricksquad trappin, chickens in the kitchen
Chicken go for 30, chicken go for 30
30-rack shawty, tryna score a birdie
Chickens go for 30, chickens go for 30
30-rack shawty, tryna score a birdie6Embed
