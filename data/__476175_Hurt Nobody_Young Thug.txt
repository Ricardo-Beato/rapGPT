12 ContributorsHurt Nobody Lyrics
Riding around in my Rari
I won’t hurt nobody
Finish off with that molly
I won’t hurt nobody
Young nigga gon cop it
I ain’t gon hurt nobody
Gold card in my wallet
I ain’t gon hurt nobody
Every time I want to see her I got to pay just like a lawyer
How the hell she got me loving her just like my daughter
I’m fucking around, let this young nat nat trick me out of my royalties
Stay down, stay stay stay down, she know what loyal is

All on pursuit, 2 door coupe
Panorama when she go to school, Panorama with a tinted roof
5 hoes call me Uncle Luke
Got to say we come with Uncle Snoop
Squad, when I'm round with PeeWee Longway
Blue M&M crip blue
Every time we fuck I’m going raw
Ooh I like it when she says sit it on her jaw
When I leave the club, 100 bitches race to my car
Just tell her mind your business, and I thought I left my sandwich inside the limo
Then I thought about it, my sandwich, talking bout weed
Man he tripping, got me searching all of my bitches
I even bust a nut in one of your Remy's
You might also like
Riding around in my Rari
I won’t hurt nobody
Finish off with that molly
I won’t hurt nobody
Young nigga gon cop it
I ain’t gon hurt nobody
Gold card in my wallet
I ain’t gon hurt nobody
Every time I want to see her I got to pay just like a lawyer
How the hell she got me loving her just like my daughter
I’m fucking around, let this young nat nat trick me out of my royalties
Stay down, stay stay stay down, she know what loyal is

I ain’t gon let that bitch trip me
Atlanta, yeah that bitch better get her degree (stay focused)
She bout to be a doctor (yes she is)
And now I can’t leave her, ain’t got no problem (no)
Yeah in one more year she get her bachelors
We just tryna flip that cash like a spatula
And you know we love big fashion up
Yeah we do everything so professional
I kiss her from her ankle to her neck up
She deserve, diamonds, and all pearls
And when we pull up, we make out and haters ‘url
You know I had to get that ‘Rari, his and hers
Riding around in my Rari
I won’t hurt nobody
Finish off with that molly
I won’t hurt nobody
Young nigga gon cop it
I ain’t gon hurt nobody
Gold card in my wallet
I ain’t gon hurt nobody
Every time I want to see her I got to pay just like a lawyer
How the hell she got me loving her just like my daughter
I’m fucking around, let this young nat nat trick me out of my royalties
Stay down, stay stay stay down, she know what loyal is

Ok she stay down, with a Young Thugga
But she not fat head, more like its brother
Which is MJ, she the best for me
She the best to the kids, she stay down
She know what loyal is
So I spoil her with everything she like
Everything she want, everything she need
But she don’t really need nothing but this D
And I'm gon give it to her
My daughter, I’m gon get to her
Stay down, stay stay stay down
She know what a loyal is
She stay down from one P, now I ran up with a palm tree
And she stay down, stay stay stay down
Shawty girl just stay down
Now I’m turning her motherfucking life around6Embed
