17 ContributorsShow me that you love Lyrics
Embedded in emotion, I'm open, hopin' whoever's
Calling's all in for the low-key, it was O-M-O-Y-E
I read my daughter's name slowly, I'm asleep, sleepin'
With the TV on, two in the morn', "Who the hell is this?"
On some Biggie Warn', something's wrong, what's going on?
You should be under covers, warm, is there a thunderstorm?
Someone done you wrong? Words stumbled on, she mumbled on
Something's on, oh shit, she lit, a habit she got, legit
We talked a bit, truthfully I was tired
Youthfully, she was high with her friends, I said bye quick
The phone collided with my sleep again, three minutes later
But there's another layer, she said I didn't care
She said I wasn't there when she was younger
Summer tour buses wasn't enough to show what love is
She said I did things that a dad doesn't, and that she had questions
If I'm a good father, why all the bad judgement?
I'm looking past judgement, about to ask somethin'
But she was bag bustin', inside I'm mad, cussin'
Inside I'm sad, dustin' off my pride
I thought that I did protect and provide, and I'm a father that's live
What about them rides with you in the backseat?
You tellin' me if it's a wack beat, I came to a few track meets
Weekend movies, I got you tickets to Lil' Uzi
Truly I try, she said
"It's the things that you didn't do, not what you did"
It hurt her spirit when she saw me with another woman's kid
Peeled back and thought, to love her, I gotta listen
Now love and action is the new vision, she said
"Dad, let your actions be your loudest speaker"
And now my daughter is now my teacher, with love
You might also like
Show me that you're there
Show me that you care
I've been looking for you
But you don't wanna share
I've been looking for you
Even over there
Will you stay around this time
Or should I be prepared?
Show me that you're there
Show me how you care
You like to come around here
(You know actions speak louder than words, right?)
Show me that you love me
Show me that you care
This space is feeling empty
But you don't see me there
You won't feel the pain
And you won't take the blame
How you come around here
And you just stay the same
Show me that you love
Show me that you care
When is the time for
You to pull a chair?
And tell me who you are
And tell me you'll be there
And show up when it's hard
And show me you care
Show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me
