10 ContributorsAinâ€™t Going Back Lyrics
Yeah, no more struggle, no more pain (what)
Fuck you mean? It's turnt up (Thugger, ay!)

I'm just riding 'round, laid back (Skrrrrrrr!)
And I'm sipping purple drank
All the shit I go through, sometimes man I can't think
And all these haters 'round me, please move up out my space
Smoke so much with this bitch she say she can't feel her face
I been through hell and back, I ain't going back that route
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back that route
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back that route
Damn right I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn right

I remember shooting it out with those runts man (bah!)
I remember shooting it out with four season (bah!)
I remember shooting it out with every fucking man
Now I look like Black Ken, ay
I remember going to war with all my fucking sisters (hey sister)
I remember falling in love with a fucking hooker (freak nasty ho)
I remember jumping on niggas like trampolines (let's get it)
I remember I ain't like to rap now rapping is my thing
It pays me, I get 7,500 a show nigga
Y'all little niggas ain't 'bout it, you wanna roll coke nigga
I remember that nasty white smell no coke nigga
I remember my momma broke down in coke 
You might also like
I'm just riding 'round, laid back (Skrrrrrrr!)
And I'm sipping purple drank
All the shit I go through, sometimes man I can't think
And all these haters 'round me, please move up out my space
Smoke so much with this bitch she say she can't feel her face
I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn right

I'm so sick of all this bullshit going on around me
Who are you to judge me, and ever try and down me (you can't)
Or clown me? (clown me)
And start grinding (grinding)
Said I used to shop at JC Penny now I'm worth a pretty penny
I was only tryna learn something, you said get out your business
Now I'm on the road I can't accept calls I'm probably busy
Now I don't got a brother, but I got a mother
That helped me, now she had my back, when no other
Had it, I don't give a damn man I got her back (I do)
What ever she need I swear I'm coming ASAP
Alright I do this for D'Asia, Samari, and Junior
I hope they stay in school I got kicked out as a junior
I'm just riding 'round, laid back (Skrrrrrrr!)
And I'm sipping purple drank
All the shit I go through, sometimes man I can't think
And all these haters 'round me, please move up out my space
Smoke so much with this bitch she say she can't feel her face
I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn rightEmbed
