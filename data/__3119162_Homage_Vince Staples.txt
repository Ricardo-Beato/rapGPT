75 ContributorsHomage Lyrics
Go stupid
Don't think too much, you gon' lose it
Just lose yourself in the music
Get off your ass and move that thang, girl
All my girls is my main girl
'Round the world in them planes
Still ain't changed, still slightly deranged
Still O.C., I won't be restrained, girl

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back

Outrun my gun, I'm the big shot now
Prima Donna had them like "wow!"
Hitchcock of my modern day
Where the fuck is my VMA?
Where the fuck is my Grammy?
Supermodels wearin' no panties
Supercars, not drivin' no Camry
Fresh meals on the table, no Rally's

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back

My girlfriend looks like she's from Gilmore
Dance on my Benz like we from Fillmore
This my ghetto story, crescendo
Coupe with them same windows as limos
Won't no label have me in limbo
Too much tempo, in Richard Prince mode
Robert Longo, black as the Congo
Pay me pronto, or it's no convo

I'm on a new level
I am too cultured and too ghetto
If you knew better you'd do better
But then you would know why the world on my penis
Please do not treat me like I'm not a genius
I'm runnin' on empty, the new River Phoenix
I'm out in Bristol, bro from the ends got a pistol
The bro from the ends down to get you
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back

Was a pleasure to meet you
Long time ago I creeped through
Now whenever I see you
Can't figure where did I meet you
Everything see through
Your face, that smile, I see you
Nowadays I don't see you
Mostly 'cause I don't need to14Embed
