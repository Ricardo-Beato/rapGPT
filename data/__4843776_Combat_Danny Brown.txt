59 ContributorsCombat Lyrics
Twelve-gauge shotguns, I seen twelve-gauge, um, pumps

I don't give a fuck
I could talk a cat off the back of a fish truck
Tell me, "What's up?"
All about the game, so I'm hunting big buck
Big butt, slim waist, and her hair long
Pass it down to me like a heirloom
The Henny got me wetter than whale piss
I die for this shit like Elvis
Boss up and shake down
Get it jumpin' like a techno breakdown
Night young and we just gettin' started
Let me walk on yard at the Bruiser Brigade party
Got smoke, of course
Goin' up, fireworks on the Fourth
Take mine, and I do it with force
Been with this shit since I jumped off the porch
Used to chop grams on my Grandma's faucet
Pay me what it costs, I ain't tryna hear offers
Tryna play Brown, you be hangin' with Hoffman
Copped a pound and I broke it down in ounces
Bust it open like them hoes came in
Got more pills than the Olsen twins
Focus, I can see where ocean is
Kush stankin' like it broke the wind
You might also like
What it is, what it is, what you know about?
Came a long way from that dope house
What it is, what it is, what you know about?
Came a long way from the—

All I cared about was the stacks and the stage
When it's time to re-up, then my partner got his hash
Ain't rocket science class, I ain't tryna pass math
Twelve grams on the scale, watch me do arts and crafts
Any day could be my last, livin' like that
Tripped over the crack, crippled by circumstance
Nigga gotta face the facts, make this world your own
Sun sprinkled light for this mega-marathon
Tryna live on through my music
The future influence, the next to do it
The odds are against you, kiddo
Life want everything from you, like a divorced widow
Tryna get it like the next negro
Want beef? You gon' fuck around and end up a vegetable
Tryna give you a lil' game
Get some, get locked, get out and back again

What it is, what it is, what you know about?
Came a long way from that dope house
What it is, what it is, what you know about?
Came a long way from the—
It's a combat zone
Every fiend, want they own
Red top, blue top
Get the green on the block
It's a combat zone
Every fiend, want they own
Red top, blue top
Get the green on the block
It's a combat zone
Tryna get that bag
Catch that lick, get that bag
It's a combat zone
Tryna swerve from 12
It never fails when you goin' through Hell
It's a combat zone
Catch that lick real quick (Combat)
Get the bag, get the bag, whatchu got?
It's a combat zone
Get that lick real quick (Combat)
Get the bag up, and the swag up
Before they call for back up

Listen, all a nigga wanted was a Chevy on some Daytons
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout no lawyer, nigga, fuck savin'
Didn't know we'd see them horrors like Wes Craven
Hook jumpin' out them vans, throw us on pavement
Locked up with dirty white boys, all musty
Prayin' for probation, hope I get lucky
Court-appointed lawyers, gotta stay coppin'
Put you in predicament, but that's your only option
Sink or swim, look at him in the system
Just another nigga, one-way ticket to a prison
Tried to help, only hurt in the end
How the fuck 'posed to take care your kids from the pen'?
It's the life that we chose, friends become foes
That nigga snitched on, everybody know
Some don't know how to stick to the code
Nobody to trust, that's the way life goes
I've seen hand grenades (Combat zone)
I've seen beer... beer-can (Combat), beer-can bazookas made (Combat zone)
Damn things hit you (Combat), just-just as getting hit with a gun (It's a combat zone)
I've seen .22 zip guns (Combat), I've seen .38 zip guns
I've seen (Combat zone), I'll tell you
This about things you think you'd never see on the street I've seen (Combat)
I've seen dynamite on the street
I've seen all this
You'd be surprised, man
Pretty soon they're gonna steal the damn atom bomb3Embed
