(It's Hoodrich, nigga)
Shout out to Swamp
Shout out to mothafuckin' Swizzop
Shout out that boy Swamp
They say give my shoutouts
Shit, I say shout out to Swamp
Shout out to Swamp Izzo
And shout out to Swizzop Izzo, all them
(Swamp Izzo)

New Bentley, not rented
Five hoes with me, they trickin'
No splittin', bring it all
You trippin', ho take it off
Let them folks see what you got (Yeah)
Take a nigga studio and bring it to the spot (Yeah)
Roc Crew will make yo block hot (Yeah)
Then hit the club and bottle pop and pop them Xans
We Kind Krip Killas, not Ku Klux Klan (Yeah)
I promise I don't love that ho, but I love my man dem
No homo though, but I'm solo do'
Cause thats how you get more dough though
I had them bitches lookin' weird 'cause I let boo .44 show
I didn't have mine on me that day 'cause JimBo had a kick door
You know we spend that cash everyday like we get 4-4 dough
And free Obama, fuck them snitches, haha like Speedo
You might also like
Yeah, hahahahaha
Yeah, hahahahaha (Come on)

Shoutout to 1426, my left wrist is a half a brick
My right wrist is a whole brick, yo bitch on some more shit, umkay
Like young Future she know this, I'm leanin' with LeOtis
I fly past, you floatin', umkay
Your young bitch with another bitch
And another bitch and another bitch
And another bitch and another bitch, they gay
They ridin' 'round with Young Thug
But they not gettin' nothin' big
They might get enough to get braids like cliche1Embed
