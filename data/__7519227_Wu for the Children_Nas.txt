Yeah
I don't work this hard to be around people I don’t like
Uh, yeah

Gotta be a special type nigga to deal with my life
Gotta be a special type nigga to feel what I write
Special like my classics
Special like my listeners who have attachments to my old style
Won't let me pass it

I don't see the point with weak sayings like
"All them niggas on top be blocking," or never help, man, stop it
It’s hard watching brothers who smart but think they not
I need them to realize what they got is a fresh start
That brother that you claim so powerful
The one you said he has a whole lot of pull
Probably already tried to pull his brothers up
And got betrayed, got snaked, got played
Meanwhile he balance his challenges, hard to keep himself paid
It's so hard for him, even though his talent is God-given
Pardon him, stop putting your faults on him
What he did to you now?
The man in him is bringing the kid in you out
You kid him, he still playin' the victim, you weirdin' me out
That's what my perspective is, maybe 'cause I'm a specialist
Sippin' mixed liquor beverages
Six figure checks are big, but eight figure checks and you rich
The Nas enthusiasts thinkin’ they know what’s best for me
More than I know what's best for me, no rest for me

Gotta be a special type nigga to deal with my life (Yo, yo)
Gotta be a special type nigga to feel what I write
Special like my classics
Special like my listeners who have attachments to my old style
Won’t let me pass it

Special (Yo, yo)
Yeah, it's a privilege, VSOP shit (Yo)
Special (Yo, yo)
Very special (Yo)

Hit, turn up the sample, we makin' magic
This thing is bigger than I could ever imagine
Duckin' the flashes from the cameras, leave out the back
Jump in a spacecraft, we can’t tell where we at
Chauffeur drivin' like a high-speed chase, trunk full of smack
Tallest buildin' in Manhattan, sippin' on Manhattan's
Listen to The Manhattan's, Queens to Brooklyn, oh what a feelin'
I shoulda had Grammy's when Ol' Dirty said "Wu for the children"
Shoulda did that remix verse on Gimme the Loot for Biggie
Me, Jay, and Frank White is like Cole, Drizzy, and Kenny
One girl for the rest of your life, is that realistic?
Some had told me they like when you call 'em all types of bitches
Ran through a few of them, some gangsta, some Christian
Some with a heart full of hate for me, even with a new nigga
They label me a sinner because I left with they soul
There's really no other feelin' havin' that type of control, nigga
Gotta be special type woman to deal with my life
Gotta be special type woman to feel what I write
Special like my classics
Special like my listeners who have attachments to my old style
Won't let me pass it
Gotta be a special type nigga to deal with my life
Gotta be a special type nigga to feel what I write
Special like my classics
Special like my listeners who have attachments to my old style
Won't let me pass it

Special
Yeah, it's a privilege, VSOP shit
Special, very special

Rest in peace ODB, Tahim, Virgil
