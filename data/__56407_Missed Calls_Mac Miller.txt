31 ContributorsMissed Calls Lyrics
Hey
It's like

Long days, longer nights
You keep startin' fights, think you always right
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin', but I know you might
Now get along, I get along, I go
You sing along to every song that you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine
You breakin' hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growin' old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm eight or nine
Tryin' to move on, talkin' to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causin' so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that?
Rippin' people's hearts out, you too cute for that, cute for that
I been on the same shit (Same shit)
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language (Language)
I guess people always goin' through changes (Changes)
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all goin' into detail
'Bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
So go (Go)
I'll be fine on my own" (Own)
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all goin' into detail
'Bout how you used to love me, I keep changin' like the leaves
Hell, go (Go)
You'll be fine on your own" (Own)

She tell me, "You an asshole, superficial douchebag
Wishin' that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me," she said, "I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and none of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time
'Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm 'bout to lose you
I'ma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep"

Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all goin' into detail
'Bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
So go (Go)
I'll be fine on my own" (Own)
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all goin' into detail
'Bout how you used to love me, I keep changin' like the leaves
Hell, go (Go)
You'll be fine on your own" (Own)49Embed
