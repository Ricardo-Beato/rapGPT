Yeah, young rich niggas
Back to back, two times
Hahaha
30, you a fool for this one

Hit a nigga with the throwaway
Bitch I came from another place
Unfortunately we couldn't beat the case
Fuck it we outta jail anyway
You want the Migo gang? You got to pay
Kickin' in doors for the 10k, 14k, anything
Young nigga cashin' out for the change
I already dreamed that I had the fame
Red and white coupe like a candy cane
Pop a perc, it feel like Bruce Wayne
Chop a brick like I'm Tsung Shang
Bitch I'm dabbin' in my own lane
Chokeslam a nigga, Quavo Kane
I hate a nigga tryna cook plain
Cause my money taller than a great dane
We gave the world dab fever check
My receipt is thousand dollar sneakers
Stop and get a play from cheetah
Quavo Derek Jeter, keep a street sweeper
I'm a salt water alligator eater
I play with water, you can check the meter
Cookie bag, that's my choice of reefer
Migo gang, aka grim reapers
You might also like
Try the squad, nigga shots fired
Thugger daughter motherfuckin' tired (my niece)
Baby bottles, ain't no babies cryin' (drank)
Hit 'em if he cross the gun line
You holdin' yours? I'ma bust mine
He lookin' wrong, call it sus time
Free my niggas, give 'em phone time
Skin a nigga like a pork rind
We get to the money in short time
Watch us make it back 10 times
My wrist spinnin', I'm so fuckin' tired
That my favorite line, I'm motherfuckin' tired
Chop a brick like a samurai
We the niggas make the birds fly
Then I fucked the bitch five times
Then I took her out cause I'm fuckin' tired

Takeoff!!
Just fucked a model bitch five times
I just ate a burger from Five Guys
I'm smokin' on cookies from High Times
You smokin' but don’t roll them outside
Migo gang, we have them mob ties
Put a fuck nigga on Fox 5
Pretty little bitch with her mouth wide
She see me pull up in that, frog eyes
Yeah bitch, it’s 30 on the beat (30 Roc)
Keep a 30 by my side
My bitches on fleek, Louboutin they feet
Ain't no question my niggas gon' ride
Ain't talkin' bout Drexler
When they come to that dope, nigga, I bet it's gon' glide
Ain't talkin' bout Dexter
Cook in the laboratory, Fendi frames on my eyes
Remember my pockets win the lottery
So every check gotta pay my tithes
Nigga tellin' lies just to cut time
My nigga you see 'em televised
No matter how hard I try
When I put music out I'm still gon' get criticized
Nigga fuckin' round with squad
Think they wanna get decapitized
Try the squad, nigga shots fired
Thugger daughter motherfuckin' tired (my niece)
Baby bottles, ain't no babies cryin' (drank)
Hit 'em if he cross the gun line
You holdin' yours? I'ma bust mine
He lookin' wrong, call it sus time
Free my niggas, give 'em phone time
Skin a nigga like a pork rind
We get to the money in short time
Watch us make it back 10 times
My wrist spinnin', I'm so fuckin' tired
That my favorite line I'm motherfuckin' tired
Chop a brick like a samurai
We the niggas make the birds fly
Then I fucked the bitch five times
Then I took her out cause I'm fuckin' tired

I'm tired.... I'm tired
These niggas flexin'
They talk about diamonds, they do not got VS inside 'em
I hit a lick, we divided it
Porsche with the gator inside of it
I'm on three Percs and I'm out of it
She gonna suck me up privately
I was young when the trap game adopted me
Grabbed the stick and shot his abdomen
Young nigga I am an arson
I got the pump in the cut with the carbon
My wrist cost a motherfuckin' 'Rari
I am a boss, I pull strings like a guitarist
You out of season, you need Lawries
Pull up in Beamers but trap out a Taurus
Look at the brick on my wrist look like Mick
When I got famous I darkened my tint
She took a mile when I gave her an inch
Won't sell my soul for some cash or a Bent
Hop in the plane and we land in Berlin
Christian Dior my bitch and her friend
(?) when I was in the pen
Prayin' to God that I don't go again
Try the squad, nigga shots fired
Thugger daughter motherfuckin' tired (my niece)
Baby bottles, ain't no babies cryin' (drank)
Hit 'em if he cross the gun line
You holdin' yours? I'ma bust mine
He lookin' wrong, call it sus time
Free my niggas, give 'em phone time
Skin a nigga like a pork rind
We get to the money in short time
Watch us make it back 10 times
My wrist spinnin', I'm so fuckin' tired
That my favorite line I'm motherfuckin' tired
Chop a brick like a samurai
We the niggas make the birds fly
Then I fucked the bitch five times
Then I took her out cause I'm fuckin' tired1Embed
