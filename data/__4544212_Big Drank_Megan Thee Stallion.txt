Big drank, big drank
Big drank, big drank, ah
Big drank, big drank
Big drank, big drank, ayy, ooh
LilJu made this beat

Ayy, ooh
Big drank, big drank
Big drank, big drank
Big drank, big drank
Ayy, ooh
Big drank, big drank
Big drank, big drank
Big drank, big drank
You can get a bizzer
And be sippin' on that sizzurp
Ayy, big drank, big drank
Big drank, big drank
Big drank, big drank

If you got a sixteen, my nigga got a bizzer
I hate when you be trippin' and be sippin' on that sizzurp
You be actin' berzerk, nigga, what's the wizzord?
Told him, "Give me brain," and he do it like a nizzerd
I hate when you get on that drink, you don't wanna listen to me
You act like I get on your nerves, you don't pay attention to me, ayy
Baby tell me what's up, why you acting so stub'?
Tell me what's important, is it me or what's in your cup?
Take it all off, bend over, let you see it
Need a real bitch, then, baby, let me be it
Tell me what's important, is it me or what's in your cup?
(Choking on that doja sweet and sippin' on that sizzurp)

You fell in love with the soda, baby, just hold up
I don't be smokin' no weed but he taught me how to roll up
Pour the drank on my body, yeah, drink it all off me
Do it, do it, do it, sloppy, yeah, you know what I need
Back that ass up, oh yeah
Do I like that? Oh yeah
Bend it over to my toes, yeah
On the drank, fuck me slow, yeah
I told him stop sippin' but I love them codeine kisses
Posting all our pictures, putting bitches in our business
Got a sixteen, my nigga got a bizzer
Hate when he be tripping and be sippin' on that sizzurp
Hate when you be stupid, and you be actin' sti-nuck
(Choking on that doja sweet and sippin' on that sizzurp)
