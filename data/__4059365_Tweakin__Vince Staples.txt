85 ContributorsTweakin’ Lyrics
This for the ones
(Never had none and never been bums)
Live by the gun
(Die by the gun, rise 'fore the sun)
Grind for the goals
(World for my girl, lies for the hoes)
Slide for the Cro’s
(Ride for the Cro's, nine to your dome)

Warhol on the wall, ball 'til you fall
Never text, never call, I suggest you applaud
I’m the set's synagogue, get blessed by the god
Don't get clapped on
Just a young black man with a backbone
In a black Comme Homme, Comme Black on
In the Batmobile, black, no chrome, yeah
When Jabari died, was off the porch for homicides
Then when Half had died, I bought some things to pass the guys
But when Johnny died, all I had was shows booked
Down to burn in Hell, I don't care how my soul look
I know you gon' tell, I can tell by your froze look
But I love you still, flaws and all, you my dawg
Put me behind bars and all 'cause we came up at the Park
It's just crazy seein' everybody change when things get hard
You might also like
We just lost somebody else this weekend, no, no
Think that I am jumping off the deep end, yeah, yeah
Nothing out of something, now it’s leaving
Tryna find my peace of mind, it’s fleeting
I'm tweakin’, I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin’, I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'

Look at how far we done came (Yeah, yeah)
Now I'm a face and a name (Yeah, yeah)
Just got a call 'bout my tweets (Tweets, yeah)
Told me to watch what I'm sayin' (Sayin', yeah)
Just got a call 'bout the streets (Streets, yeah)
Told me to watch for a Jeep (Jeep, yeah)
Liberty lurking the east (East, yeah)
They hoppin' out, ready to squeeze (Squeeze, yeah)
Niggas emotional nowadays
Lyin', they hidin' they coward ways
Cryin' in court when they catch a case
Off of the porch in eleventh grade
Calling her weak when my mama prayed
Prolly why none of my karma came
Just put the Benz in my mama name
(Family first like Hungarians)
Had me up in church at a young age
Should've had the nigga at the gun range
Woulda been a lot more useful, shit
Who up in the pulpit, truthful shit
Rich or poor people gon' use the shit
Might as well go and get used to it
Tryna get rich, get everybody fed
But everybody dead (Everybody dead)
We just lost somebody else this weekend, no, no
Think that I am jumping off the deep end, yeah, yeah
Nothing out of something, now it's leaving
Tryna find my piece of mind, it's fleeting
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'

Look how far we came
Look how far we came
