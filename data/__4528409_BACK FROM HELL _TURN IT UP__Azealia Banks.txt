13 ContributorsBACK FROM HELL (TURN IT UP) Lyrics
I pack the piece
And blow the smoke in the sky, 'cause I’m potent
You bitches broke, 'cause I'm loaded
I’m flyin', I'm focused
You couldn't find me, got you makin' another call
I take that paper, make it flip like a somersault
They talk about me, keep my name in their mouth like a grill
You cannot copy me, cannot stop me
I'm sexy and real
Sayonara, see you later
I'm gone and I'm ghost
Cheers to my haters, see you later, I’m makin’ the toast
They can't recall
Said they’ve seen me, they haven't, withdraws
I just withdraw all deposits, my check and I ball
That crystal ball, show you frontin' ain't nothin’ at all
I'm with my dogs and we're ready, so don't get involved
Coast to coast, I'm the reason these hoes in their feelings
Hands high, put your palms all the way to the ceilin'
I set the price on anybody, I know what I'm worth
I got the drip, I got that water, that water, that earth
Young AB, heat up the AC
Hit that escape key, still can't escape meYou might also like2Embed
