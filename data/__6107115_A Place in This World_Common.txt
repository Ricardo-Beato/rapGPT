10 ContributorsA Place in This World Lyrics
No justice or justification
We trust in God but can't trust in a nation
The cusp of generations searching for a ventilation
If 2020 vision is any indication
Of where we are, where we've been, where do we go?
American ain't legible
My rights are being left behind
In questioned times, they say invest in nines
Tryna rest my mind, the press be pressed to find
Stories by my kind, a suggested crime
Though many, many holler about justicе reform
But won't put dollars where thе hustle is born
You know our politicians, they like to perform
Acting and singing that government song
How they love America when you lovin' it wrong
We the people are becoming reborn

Get knocked down but stand up
I still believe that there's a place in this world
For people just like you
People all around the world (Stand up)
I still believe that there's a place in this world
A place for me and you
Get knocked down but stand up (Up)
I still believe that there's a place in this world
For people just like you
People all around the world (Stand up)
I still believe that there's a place in this world
A place for me and you
You might also like
Elastic winner in America
It's more content than there is character
Truth is we starring at a derringer
Old ways is the barrel that's daring us
We bear the cross and cross rivers
Of stolen souls and lost figures told by Doc Rivers
Movement of the people, we take God with us
And we recreate equal that will outlive us
Delivered to this Earth with authority
Never thought of myself as a minority
Cordial invites to far left and alt-rights
I'm from the Bob Marley party, everything will be alright
You say, "All life matters"
But you paying no mind when Black life shatters
I know there's light at the end of the struggle
Revolution and love is like a couple

Get knocked down but stand up
I still believe that there's a place in this world
For people just like you
People all around the world (Stand up)
I still believe that there's a place in this world
A place for me and you
Get knocked down but stand up (Up)
I still believe that there's a place in this world
For people just like you
People all around the world (Stand up)
I still believe that there's a place in this world
A place for me and youEmbed
