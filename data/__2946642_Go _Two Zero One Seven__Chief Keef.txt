12 ContributorsGo (Two Zero One Seven) Lyrics
Aye Chief Sosa, how you do it? (Do what?)
Smoke that dope like that, you a fool
I'm in that all, that bitch is tall
Me and my closet, look like the mall
Two-hundred miles
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

The early bird get the first worm, go
Cops can't come in here without no search warrant, no
Sosa do you love any these bitches? No
In that all white Wraith, bitch, I'm playin' in the snow
I got that jocker now, we can just spark it out
You want to talk it out, what is you talkin' 'bout?
I up the pistol, there's nothin' to talk about
I was just juggin', and thuggin', and ballin' out
I was just hoppin' out, bitches was fallin' out
I'm in that big all white body I'm wildin' out
I was just hoppin' out, bitches was fallin' out
I'm in that big all white body I'm wildin' out
You might also like
Aye Chief Sosa, how you do it? (Do what?)
Smoke that dope like that, you a fool
I'm in that all, that bitch is tall
Me and my closet, look like the mall
Two-hundred miles
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

It's 8 in the mornin' and I'm snorin', yawnin'
Now I'm up in the foreign, doin' somethin' important
Smokin' the dope and countin' the profit
And makin' the serves and billin' these corners
Feds pull me over, they say I look loaded
I'm saying, "No sir, it's just marijuana"
I know you hear me, I'm kickin' persona
I got a four nickel up in the bomber
What's my portfolio? My name is Julio
I'm goin' coolio up in the Louis coat
Big ass clip on me and it shoot a movie though
You do not want to be up in that movie though
Your hoe just pulled up and gave me that coochie though
Gave me the top and gave me the booty though
You not a gangster, you really a goofy though
You not a gangster, you really a goofy though
Aye Chief Sosa, how you do it? (Do what?)
Smoke that dope like that, you a fool
I'm in that all, that bitch is tall
Me and my closet, look like the mall
Two-hundred miles
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

I'm so high, I'm screamin' out dopey
I'm about to win me a trophy
Bitches is tryin' to blow me
Look at my ice, it's snowy
Look in my eyes, it's Kobe
Look at the coupe, it's floatin'
Bitch sendin' me emojis
Hit her with the stogie
Fah fah bitch it's lit
Litter than a bitch
Step in my arsenal
I've been doin' extended shit
She got one night and a man
She shoes tryin' to stand this shit
I told her that that ain't happenin'
We might as well end this shit
I'm throwin' bands in the club, and I'm so high
You need to put some season on your beef nigga, 'cause that shit's so dry
Aye Chief Sosa, how you do it? (Do what?)
Smoke that dope like that, you a fool
I'm in that all, that bitch is tall
Me and my closet, look like the mall
Two-hundred miles
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go1Embed
