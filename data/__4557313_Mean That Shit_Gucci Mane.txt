5 ContributorsMean That Shit Lyrics
Zaytoven

Ha, kissin' and huggin', say that you her husband
Guess you really love that bitch, nah
I ain't finna spare that bitch, huh?
I ain't finna spare that bitch, huh?
Pay a bitch rent, tried to turn me to a trick
Better go and suck a dead man dick, uh
I ain't finna make you rich now
What you eat don't make me shit now
You a scandalous ass bitch, tried to turn me to a lick
But you won't let her see that shit now
Bet you regret that shit, yeah
Can't finesse, bitch, respect my clique, yeah
I'm a lunatic, but my goon is really sick
They'll cut you up in pieces, bitch, yeah
Grab nephews and nieces, bitch, yeah
Tell your wife she better bring them grips, yeah
Had a hardtop Lamb' and a droptop M
And the hardtop bright red, bitch, yeah
Pay a J to clean that shit, yeah
Say it like I mean that shit, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
