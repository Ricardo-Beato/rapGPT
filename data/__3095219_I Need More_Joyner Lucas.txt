You got some scary intentions
Your brain is clouded with too many possessions
You think you rich but you depressing yourself
It's just so pathetic and materialistic
And all you do is flash your money and fortune
You ride around in that Ferrari and Porsches
And all you talk about is Bugatti and foreigns
You walk around like you somebody important
You surrounded by leaches and beggars
And none of them niggas wanna see you do better
I bet they plotting, wanna see what you got
Cause you brag a lot and make it seem like they jealous
So what the fuck you even see in the mirror?
Your future couldn't really be any clearer
And when it rains, you gon' need an umbrella
But you don't listen, you don't see it or hear it
And all you ever say is...
You might also like
I need more hoes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more clothes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more dough, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more blow, wha, wha, wha, whoo, whoo

I need more hoes, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more clothes, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more dough, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more blow, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah

I think you really aggressive
Your brain is clouded with too many possessions
You think you rich but you depressing yourself
It's just so pathetic and materialistic
I really think that all them drugs got you tripping
Your brain is ruined and your logic is different
I know that syrup got your body in shivers
If I was you, I'd get that out of my system
And I think that you bugging and stuff
You just shit on everyone who's stuck in a rut
Always flash your money out in public and stunt
And we all just look at you in fucking disgust
Maybe you're just insecure with no luck
And deep down you're a dub without nothing to love
And I wonder if you'll ever realize what's up
And be humble and just say enough is enough
But for now you just wanna say
I need more hoes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more clothes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more dough, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more blow, wha, wha, wha, whoo, whoo

I need more hoes, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more clothes, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more dough, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more blow, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
I need more hoes, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more clothes, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more dough, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more blow, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah

Yeah, I must be really possessive
My brain is clouded with too many possessions
I think I'm rich but I'm depressed and I'm selfish
I'm so pathetic and materialistic
Like how the fuck I let the money do this
Man I swear to God that I would never be tripping
I promised that I would have respect and be different
But now I make it rain on plenty of strippers
I'm surrounded by leeches and beggars
And none them niggas wanna see me do better
I bet they plottin', want to take what I got
Cause I brag a lot and make it seem like they jealous
And I never had nothing
I just wanna live like them rappers on TV forever
But what have I become? Maybe I'm one of them
Maybe I just don't know any better
And now what I'm sayin' is
I need more hoes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more clothes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more dough, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more blow, wha, wha, wha
