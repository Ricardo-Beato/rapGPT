3 ContributorsBye Bye Lyrics
I rode the streets and my hood is just like a warzone
You died if you put your use in defending your home
If you hustlin' everyday, hold on
Come for mine imma sing you a slow song
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby

Do you know the meaning of survival when the rifle is trifle
Not a gun or a rifle not a knife for them to stifle
Put my hand upon the Bible open it and get an eye-full
Tryna keep my head above water and not be spiteful
The humanity, vanity, replaced it's insanity
So many casualties casually forgotten and randomly
Thoughts stricken on beaches and you soft bitches are panicking
Black Milk on drums man this shit is so fucking menacing
What the world needs baby we feed them the truth
Lead them into the booth kicking this shit for the youth
They won't play it on the radio fuck 'em
If we stand together we can always overcome 'em
They won't play it on the radio fuck 'em
If we stand together we can always overcome 'em

I rode the streets and my hood is just like a warzone
You died if you put your use in defending your home
If you hustlin' everyday, hold on
Come for mine imma sing you a slow song
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby

I'm having visions of a bunch of bad decisions
That I might regret later but this is the life we living
The streets are unforgiving man they colder than ice
Gotta be holding while i'm rolling at night
This ain't right
All I hear is guns shooting, police chase alluding
Robbing, stealing, lootin' round the projects I just moved in
Feel like what the fuck i'm doing
I'm really 'bout to lose it
And if you come for mine i'll bring your life to a conclusion
I rode the streets and my hood is just like a warzone
You died if you put your use in defending your home
If you hustlin' everyday, hold on
Come for mine imma sing you a slow song
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby

Hit a lick to help my mom
We riding without no dad around
Life is about pussy, basketball and having this rapping crowd
Kill em with kindness and they starting killing my happy smile
I didn't tag em down and tie em up and try to wrap no fucking
Cord around his neck, started looking for that check
Seen a little homie die young feel like I was looking at myself
Hold on, and I know pain and I ain't talking 'bout them whoopings by the belt
Trials and tribulations be all grow and we all need help
But yo these things we meant preventing
Political strategies looking like
Open terrorism, hold on Dizzy don't get 'em
Talking in third person as I let my personalities split 'em
Like M. Night Shyamalan i'm talking mental divisions
They been tearing families down since before Abraham Lincoln
Rip facts, these vocal dubs i'm really just thinking
And we finding out that life is real, I don't know how to feel
Making all this money just to get us out my mommas crib
I rode the streets and my hood is just like a warzone
You died if you put your use in defending your home
If you hustlin' everyday, hold on
Come for mine imma sing you a slow song
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullaby
Budum-bye, bye, bye
Let me sing you a lullabyEmbed
