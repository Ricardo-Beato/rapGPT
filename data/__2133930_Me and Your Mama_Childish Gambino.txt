I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
Do what you want
(I'm telling you…) Let me into your heart

Can't stand it, backhanded
They wanna see us falling apart
You know that I love you
So let me into you

Let me into your heart
(Do you really love me? I'ma get you, girl, ahhh!)

This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been
You can see us far then near
You might also like
Let me into your heart
(Oh, this ain't no bullshit, I really love you, girl)
Oh, oh, god
Girl, you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
Girl, you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
I'm in love when we are smokin' that
(Oh my God, I)
Let me in (Girl, you really got a hold, woo!)147Embed
