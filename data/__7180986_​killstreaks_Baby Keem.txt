Want to catch me? Want to catch me?
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Want to catch me? Want to catch me?
Go on, go on, go on, go on

PinkPanther, Pink-PinkPanther, Pink

You got me runnin' 'round the country, I'm tryna find you (Want to catch me?)
I need a girl I can relate to and confide to (Want to catch me?)
See me dealin' with my mom, will you help me through it? (Go on, go on)
Heads up, stand tough, girl, you made me do it (Go on, go on)
I can hide you in the mansion, might lock the bedroom (Want to catch me?)
Killstreaks, killstreaks, when I need some leg room (Want to catch me?)
Introduce you to the homies, you ain't know 'em (Go on, go on)
On the flight back to Paris, I gotta show 'em (Go on, go on)

Baby, did I make you proud?
I know I'm hard to handlе
I'ma come break you down
Even if you don't do scandals
Pick you up and down (Up and down), scandals
Pick you up and down (Up and down), scandals

Found a whole new way to get lost around you ('Round)
And I can't get help, I'm so down by myself (Baby, yeah)

Let's take a walk around Fremont Road, dawg (Don't stop, road, dawg)

And I know the good morals on your socials (PinkPanther)
First Lady, President, you in the Oval (PinkPanther)
I'm at the O2, I'm goin' postal (Don't stop)
You on the side stage, I had to show you (Don't stop)
They told you I was next up, when I told you (PinkPanther)
I had to fall back just to get to know you (Pink-PinkPanther, Pink)
