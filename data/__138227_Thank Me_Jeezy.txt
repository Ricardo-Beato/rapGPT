3 ContributorsThank Me Lyrics
You niggas actin like you can’t beat
You niggas like it like it ain’t me
See acting like y’all niggers can’t see
You motherfuckers all should thank me
You welcome, motherfuckas! (x4)

We let you talking next snow, nigga bring that shit back
Gotta step in gotta flay then you know it’s that bad
If he want my last 9, I’ma let that 9 go
If the nigga want it hard, I’ma whip that 9 slow
Nigga taking my time , nigga I ain’t in no rush
Man you nigga know the deal, my money longer than a bus
Man you nigga know the deal, my choppers longer than a bitch
We hop up I pop your ass and even help me dig a ditch
If the nigga stay talking to the folks, then he a snitch
If the niggas stay going to the bank, then nigga rich
If the nigga stay reading up, the nigga on the shit
If we meet the day before tonight, then I don’t know the bitch


I said, all hail the young originator of the plate
Broke the whole thing down left the paper full of shake
If you know it that mean that’s a problem full of crumbs
And you know what that mean, that’s a trap full of bum
And you know what that mean, that’s a pocket full of cash
Say you want the same things, so I went up in the stash
Don’t be playing with my money if you do I’m gonna blast
Nigga thought of sweet here you know I had to last
If you smoke a hundred swishers everyday, that swisher light
If you keep your 40 cal. everyday, that’s pistol light
If you set that white body everyday that crystal light
Know some niggers keep that car key griming kryptonite
