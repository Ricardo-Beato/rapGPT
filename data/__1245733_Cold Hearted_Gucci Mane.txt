7 ContributorsCold Hearted Lyrics
I'm a heart breaker
Yeah!
This is Gucci
I didn't mean to break your heart baby
Is just me not even you

I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
Most time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)

Now now, I've been so many places chasing paper under the sun
Wanna start the fam but god I can't be faithful to one
I got a problem, and it ain't like I don't feel for you babe
And I hate to see them tears on your face
But I can't erase all the memories we've made
Got my brain goin crazy it's like I'm stuck in the maze
Don't lose your hope in me, pray that you keep the faith
All your secrets are safe with me take that shit to the grave

I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
Most time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)
You might also like
Now now, 'cause I'm a heart breaker (heart breaker)
I'm a heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
I'm drinking champagne out the bottle

I'm drinking Ace of spades like that shit bottled water
I'm drinking Ace of spades like that shit bottled water
I got the preacher's daughter doing all the shit I taught her
Go so hard I might break them hoes
Dick so hard it might break her jaw
Cold hearted I ain't got no heart
Broke bitch she don't want no job
How you gon help if the times get hard
Ride or die but you ain't got no car?
Push button I ain't got no key
Want to marry me and take half of my stash
Break her heart and broke the bitch in half
I hate these hoes, but I love my fans
We happy now, but the shit won't last
It's a plane crash to where I drop my bands
Hand to hand that's where I made this cash
I ain't tryin' to give it up so fast
Player smashed and now you in my past
Hundred bands I used to wipe my ass
Ace of spades but I don't need no glass
Got the racks imma pass so the hoes gonna dance
I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
Most time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)

Now now, 'cause I'm a heart breaker (heart breaker)
I'm a heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
I'm drinking champagne out the bottleEmbed
