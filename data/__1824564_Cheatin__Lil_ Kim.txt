6 ContributorsCheatinâ€™ Lyrics
Kimmy Blanco, What's up baby?
CT got your back, you know what it is
Shout out to the whole Tri-State
Shout out to all the websites, shout out to all the blogs
Shout out to all the radio stations
Most of all, shout out to the streets

It was love at first sight, everthing was right
I didn't know, him had another life with a kid and wife
And he bought me a ring and he bought us both the same cars
What started out as a simple love affair
Ended with someone inside an electric chair
And the same man that she was in love with's now in love with me
I didn't mean to hurt her, could've been somebody's mom
But she took his heart when, she pulled out that gun
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station
You might also like
I can't imagine what I'd do if I was in her show
'Cause if he did this to me, I'd probably kill him too
'Cause if he played me for a fool, I'd probably lose my cool
And reach for my firearm
I wish she didn't lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what she was thinking
But I know what she was feeling
And now he's no longer around
I didn't mean to hurt him, could've been somebody's son
But she took his heart when, she pulled out that gun
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
But hear me now

I never thought she'd do it
I never thought she'd do it
I never thought she'd do it
Oh gosh
Why ever do she do it?
Why ever do she do it?
Why ever do she do it?
Why do she pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger? Boom!
And end this, end this life so soon
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger, boom
Now what you gon' do? Me say, what you gon' do?
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam
Me say one man down, oh god
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam
Me say one man down
Now you are a criminal, criminal, criminal
Yes you are a criminal, criminal, criminal
Yes now somebody hold the gun, whilst she run out of town
Before it be another: one man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station1Embed
