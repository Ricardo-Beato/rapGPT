This one's for the beautiful people
All my beautiful people (Shout out to Deanna)
RIP to Bennie, man, what the fuck? Free Unfoonk
Free Unfoonk, free Dulu, free Zoo Crew
Swamp tell these folk, man
Can't do nothin' with me, I promise you
Yeah, free Unfoonk
RIP to Bennie man, what's up, big bro?
I love you nigga, yeah
I'm grown, I'm gettin' money now, nigga
How you doin' though? Yay
Shouts out to all the lil' ones
Lil Zuk, keep goin'
I know you goin' to the top now, yay
Big Duck, I love you, I love you, I love you

My brother just got life and ten
It got me hatin' all the niggas that got out the pen'
And that's a sin but he ain't gettin' out the pen'
So I don't give a damn, I don't give a damn
What you talkin' 'bout? I'll take your lungs out
At your mom's house on your mom's couch
'Cause I'm from the South and you're not from the south
And the funeral homes? It's my fun house
Now I'm killin' myself 'cause I didn't get help
I got my mind right and started remakin' myself
'Til I dreamed of gettin' killed, now I'm fakin' myself
Now I be movin' extra slow like I'm makin' myself, yeah
You might also like
To all my niggas dead and gone (Yeah)
Come back home (Yeah)
Got me in my zone all week (I love you)
It's all on me (Yeah)
It's all on me (RIP to Tre, man)
It's all on me (I love my Rock family)
It's all on me (No homo)
I gotta keep my head up strong 'cause life goes on (I love Jonesboro South, no homo)
'Til my mission here is complete
It's all on me (I love all my fans, no homo)
It's all on me
It's all on me (Yeah)
It's all on me (Yeah)
It's all on me (But look)

RIP to your folk and your folk and RIP to Bennie
Sippin' on this mud got me leanin'
I'm thinking like I'm dreamin'
Sell dope, it's the only way we eatin'
So therefore we keep them fiendin'
And the pots what we keep on steamin'
And RIP to Man and RIP to Tre
Free my nigga Qua, free Lil T Jay
Don't worry 'bout what they say
Nigga, you'll come home one day
And I'm up but my partner got bricks put up for me
And I lost three people in three years
But to Big Duck it feels like seconds
Shouts out to nine-eleven
But I'm a Blood so shouts out to five
Red Cartel may eat you alive
And the ROC Crew may eat you alive
And Jonesboro South may leave you tied, no jive, yeah
To all my niggas dead and gone (RIP to Marion)
Come back home (Free Ripman)
Got me in my zone all week (Free Edgar, free Unfoonk)
It's all on me (Free Dulu)
It's all on me (Free Zoo Crew)
It's all on me (Yeah)
It's all on me (I love my Rock family)
I gotta keep my head up strong 'cause life goes on (If you, if you lost somebody close, nigga)
'Til my mission here is complete (Yeah, street nigga, nigga)
It's all on me (I know how it feel)
It's all on me (This verse right here for y'all)
It's all on me (You dig?)
It's all on me
It's all on me

Let's go to Pool Creek, RIP Danny and Weezy
Jonesboro South, rest in peace O's and Neezy
Let's go to Cleveland, Lil Tre and Lil Man
Let's go to Four Seasons, Lil Chug and Nana
Let's hit the Westside, Lil Roody and Duke
Boulevard, McCannons Ville, Cheese and Nunny
Summerhill back to the North, Lil Nick and Quez
Let's go to Boulevard Ave, free all the feds
I will leave you dead, put some on your head
Have your mama scared, have your family scared
Put your ass to bed and this one 'bout the dead
So I'ma ride this bitch like a bike with pegs, ugh
To all my niggas dead and gone (Yeah)
Come back home (Yeah)
Got me in my zone all week (Yeah)
It's all on me (Yes)
It's all on me (Yes)
It's all on me (Yes)
It's all on me (Yeah)
I gotta keep my head up strong (Yeah), 'cause life goes on (Yeah)
'Til my mission here is complete
It's all on me (Shout out to my brothers)
It's all on me (I love y'all, nigga)
