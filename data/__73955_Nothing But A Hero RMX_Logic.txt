40 ContributorsNothing But A Hero RMX Lyrics
Alright
In the sky it's a bird, it's a plane, nah, who that?
Everybody want me to save 'em, I can't do that
Got a little shine and they wonder where the loot at
The life of an artist, I had to pursue that

Superman all the time, yeah, true that
That's why I laugh, when they ask, "Man, where the suit at?"
I love my family, love my friends
But when it comes down to money see it all depends
'Cause now I got new family, I got new friends
That I never even seen before, where does it end?
See, I got loved ones and I got enemies
But at the end of the day, I don't know their identities
Are they loving entities or people
Befriending me for the fame?
Breaking in the game, life'll never be the same
It'll never be the same, and they all like

You are my superhero
I said it, I said it
You are my superhero
You might also like
I was gone for a minute, came back in a flash
Spit crack, up a dude's rock, like dash
Any dame, know I got game, go ask
This is my true identity, no mask
Most wish to get it and rub on a flask
I wish to get it and rub on her aâ€”
Hip-Hop, what I'm talking 'bout, you ain't on
And a metaphor, means I am hands on
Out for the green, with a buzz, like Hornet
I ain't rip the game yet, I just torn it
See? The good guy gets the dame
And if a shawty got a donk, like Lois Lane
I turn into the parapalegic, from X-Men
You ain't get it? I'm all about the brain
Step to the mic, he a beast
Hungry in the game, still looking for a feast
All about my dough on the rise like yeast
And I'ma keep going 'til I motherfucking decease
See I stood on the side humbly, like Alfred
But now it's time, to jump in the bat outfit
And I could give a damn, if you doubt it
'Cause when I hit the stage, they shout it
Uh, yeah, they shout it, what'd they shout? They shout

You are my superhero
I said it, I said it
You are my superhero
Know the flow never awkward, man
Stepped in the booth, they like, "I'll be damned"
Kid opened his mouth and shocked me, man
And I get the honeys wetter, than Aqua-Man
See? That's that sex appeal
I guess that'll add another mill', to the deal
But right now, I'm just tryna get a meal
In the Bat-cave, sharpening the skill
With an Iron-Man mindset, they can never steal
Villain on the mic though, yeah, I had to kill it
I wrote this rhyme, in braille, just for you to feel it
Let the flow pour for a minute, but I gotta seal it

Hopefully now, y'all know me, got a grip on the game
Like it was fresh up out the Sony

You are my superhero
I said it, I said it
You are my superhero10Embed
