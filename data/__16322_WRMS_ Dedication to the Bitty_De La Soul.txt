Of course you're listening to WRMS FM, and we play nothing but De La Slow music
We're coming up on the hour of ten o'clock. It's a full moon, and perfect night for lovers. We're about to do something we don't usually do, and that's... well I'll show you
BITTY: Hello, hello, who's this?
SQUIRREL: Squirrel
BITTY: Hi! Listen, I don't have a lot of time, my name's Mizuna, I'm on my dinner break from Burger King and I just called to tell you that I love your new radio station, I love everything you guys do
SQUIRREL: Thank you. And with that, the next song is just for you. And when you go back tell all the Burger King honeys that if they want to call and talk to me, just call WRMS. See yaYou might also likeEmbed
