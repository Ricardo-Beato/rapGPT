5 ContributorsSmash the Crowd Lyrics
Hooooo!
Come on!

Haters gonna hate
Fakers gonna fake
Breakers gonna break
Neophytes gonna make mistakes
Sleepers gotta wake
I’ma say it again
I’ma say it loud
Gimme a group
Not one man
To smash the crowd
We get panoramic
Across the stage
Like a whole planet dammit
One man or one woman
Can’t understand
The group plan
Making of the band
Gimme some bass and guitar and some drums
(God-God-Goddamn!)
I get bored from R&B keyboards
Unless they cut like a sword
I bet on DJ Lord
On two turntables
Do I say willin’ and able
A lotta Serato
Revolving from old record labels
Party’s over, oops outta time
Smashin’ this crowd was designed
(Everybody now)
You might also like
Somebody say hooooo!
Smash the crowd!
Somebody say
Smash the crowd!
Give it to the man, he know how to rock the crowd

Ice with the enemy
Iceberg’s the enemy
Smashers of this mosh pit
Hardcore rap shit
Black mask shit
Pop off get your ass kicked
Or worse, a casket
S1s who blast it
I’m not happy with this soft hippy cotton candy
Bang the crowd hard or get the fuck out my yard
I crash crowds from all angles
Destroy bars like Hell’s Angels

Bleed the needle from the left
Bleed it to the right
These vocals gone electric
Loudness for these masses
Keep the catalog from fallin’ apart
Reach teaching new tunes from them old masters
(Uh!)
Excuse me?
(Dynamite soul!)
Greatest players playin’
Greatest band in the world
Greatest rhymers be sayin’
Greatest band in the world
But what the fuck is the problem that this world ain’t solvin’
It’s the get rich scheme
And chasing the fake dream
I spit like a black tech 9 with infrared beam
Been feedin’ hip hop fiends since a teen
My mic still blow steam
I’m a mix between
Doc Strange and David Blaine
Spittin’ blue flames
Slow Flow smashin’ the crowd
Like I smashed Jane
Fear of a black planet
Time to pop the chain
Cause hip hop got them goin’ insane

Somebody say hooooo!
Smash the crowd!
Somebody say
Smash the crowd!Embed
