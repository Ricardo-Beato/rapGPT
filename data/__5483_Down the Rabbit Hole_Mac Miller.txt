25 ContributorsDown the Rabbit Hole Lyrics
Hey
And it's the best day ever
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, 'cause we gon' go
Pack your motherfuckin' bags, we gon' go

Hey, I got a
Cup of Henny, joint of good
Not gettin' any sleep, even though I should
Catch a early flight, hit another city
For a concert full of fans who be fuckin' with me
Countin' hundreds, fifties, groupie hoes
That all love to show me how they drop they booties low
Two at once, that's a ménage à trois
Watch their bras come off, have me sayin', "La-di-da"
Rock 'n' roll, livin' life
Gettin' head, get it twice
It feels like I've been drunk for the eleventh night
Don't know how I'm gonna wake up in time to catch this flight
All these bitches in the front row tryna dress alike
They do a lot of barkin', but they never bite
They lookin' at me like, "I'm gonna have some sex tonight"
And yes, I might if it's alright, 'cause...

I got what you need If you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip
This heart can be your drugs, just please don't take too much
You can have it free of charge though, I do it for the love, 'cause
I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip
This heart can be your drugs, just please don't take too much
You can have it free of charge though, I do it for the love, 'cause

First I
Take a breath, then let it out
Hear 'em clap a little while, then I take my bow
I'm on my job, but maybe out my mind
Got some liquor and some weed, it's about that time
Anyway you name it, I'm entertainment
I make it, I'll admit, I'm kinda famous
My life is like a vacation
'Cause day out and day in, these hotels, Days Inns
Travel navigation, I switch up my location
Days goin' without shavin', the road life's a bitch
But fuck it, this the good life, so for no life, I'd switch
Got my money comin' faster than these women I get into
Can't tell me how to live my life, chill, fool, I been cool
I'm the type of dude, pretty cool, kinda nice, not rude
'Cause some hoes who like my tunes
Get front row then show their boobs
Party every night, they worry that I blow the fuse
But I'm way too young, and don't know rules 

I got what you need If you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip
This heart can be your drugs, just please don't take too much
You can have it free of charge though, I do it for the love, 'cause
I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip
This heart can be your drugs, just please don't take too much
You can have it free of charge though, I do it for the love, 'cause4Embed
