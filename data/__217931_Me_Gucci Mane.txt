31 ContributorsMe Lyrics
Me, I got my own back
I'm the CEO, CFO, account manager, and security

Who the only one you trust? (me)
CEO, so who I'm signed to? (me)
When I got beef, man, who I run to? (me)
She live with you, but why she riding with (me)?
Bags of kush, who my weed man? (me)
PTs, BTs, man, who my lean man? (me)
So much jewelry, I got a million on (me)
Versace down, these hoes keep kissing on (me)
Yellow diamonds, dripping, pissing, say I rap explicit
In the kitchen whipping, doing the dishes, I'm my own assistance
I hit a lick so low cuffed on myself, then I took me to Lenox
If you ain't getting no money with me then what you doing with me?

Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a "we"
I book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me
I cop the dope, then front the dope, then me come shop with me
On the TV watching me, in a Bentley listening to me
I'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me; I'm my own goon, I'm shooting for me
I'm so turnt I'm jocking me, you hating on me and I'm hating on me
Watching you watching me, and she cheating on you and she cheating on me
Me, me
You might also like
Mimi, Mimi, me, yeah the bitch name Mimi, me
Fucking and sucking me, but I know the bitch running game on me
And she put the thang on me, why you put the blame on me?
That's a shame on me, and her credit card on E, car on E
So, yeah, she put her mouth on me
Put it on freeze is a mini disease
Powerful me, can you do it for me?
Shopping for you like I'm shopping for me
Like I'm trapping for you but I'm trapping for me
Boss of a nigga but working for me
Struggle for you but she cuddle for me
Boss of my label, I'm rapping for me
And where would I be if it wasn't for me?
Tony Montana Six wasn't for me
Wasn't for you and she wasn't for me
Don't leave it to beaver, man, leave it to me
Looking at me and I'm jam of the week
Riding through the through with the top in the teeth
Gucci Gambino, who talking to me?
Baby Latino, she fine in some jeans
Gucci bilingual, I'm talking to ti

Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a "we"
I book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me
I cop the dope, then front the dope, then me come shop with me
On the TV watching me, in a Bentley listening to me
I'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me; I'm my own goon, I'm shooting for me
I'm so turnt I'm jocking me, you hating on me and I'm hating on me
Watching you watching me, and she cheating on you and she cheating on me
Me, me
I got lean by the PT, but I'm serving me
And they should name me De-me-trius cause all I think about is me
MTV, that's Me TV
HOV, but I'm ridin' just me
One deep chilling in this damn RV
With a touchdown, I'm a front this shit to me
Give it to me, leave it to me
You screaming, "Why did it happen to me?"
Your girlfriend squirting and spitting on me
I guess baby girl happy to see me
Got a trapping disease, smoking disease
Them hustlers ain't welcome? I'm happy to leave
Your uncle and brother be coping for me
10 bales of the weed in they family trees
Snitch of the force, say you got it from me
Average go broke it won't happen to me
Don't got jumper but putting up the numbers
So much cash I need another machine
Rappers are fake, Gucci a G
Who am I featuring? I'm featuring me
Don't need a road manager, managing me
Manage the dope and the weed and the lean

Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a "we"
I book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me
I cop the dope, then front the dope, then me come shop with me
On the TV watching me, in a Bentley listening to me
I'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me; I'm my own goon, I'm shooting for me
I'm so turnt I'm jocking me, you hating on me and I'm hating on me
Watching you watching me, and she cheating on you and she cheating on me
Me, me
Who the only one you trust? (me)
CEO, so who I'm signed to? (me)
When I got beef, man, who I run to? (me)
She live with you, but why she riding with (me)?
Bags of kush; who my weed man? (me)
Pts, BTs, man, who my lean man? (me)
So much jewelry, I got a million on (me)
Versace down, these hoes keep kissing on (me)
