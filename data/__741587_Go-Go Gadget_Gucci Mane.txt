Go-Go Gadget
Go-Go Gadget
Go-Go Gadget Gucci
Go-Go Gadget Gucci
Go-Go Gadget Gucci

Go Go Gadget Go Go Gadget Go Go Gadget Go
Photomatic polo-addict tatted like a biker tatted
So old fashion I’m romantic all I smoke is dro
And my bullets go through cement doors
Got gadgets you ain’t seen before
Too erratic let ya have it
I’m a savage burning cabbage
If you ratted brains be splattered
On the wall like painted 
Gangsta  this gangsta  this a gangsta anthem I see
Solo addict, hydro Cali, ten times with your baby daddy
Too pathetic why you telling
Why you playing stupid when you did it
Now you swimming in the fucking Chattahoochee
Who did you  going at it
Tell em Gucci 
Yes he on me braining Gucci skulls stupid Gucci go

Go-Go Gadget Gucci
Go-Go Gadget Gucci

Go Go Gadget Go Go Gadget
I go broke got no more gadgets
Smoking Cali barely standin’
Diamonds dancin’ in my mansion
Go go gadget go go goons
Then leave you stanking in the alley
Stupid goons with super guns
Who say them boys ain’t playing barely
Turn to a truck I can self destruct
I can drop the top, I can let it up
He let you down,  I stepped it up
He  but I ripped it up
I changed the paint, I can change the guts
I can change the lane and I can change the cut
I can change my style, I can change my slang
But fuck that shit I ain’t changin nuuh
I remain the same, Inspector Gadget
 niggas be extra lame
Got so much dope need extra veins
May not deal in the stock exchange
But I do deal in the block exchange
Three million dollars on a private plane
Count money on the jet with a money machine
