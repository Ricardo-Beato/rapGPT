Wheezy Beats
The beat is produced by my nigga Wheezy
That's one of my newest engineers
I mean, one of my newest producers
I'm high, sorry, yeah

I pulled up outside in that new big coupe body Benz (Skrt)
When I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend (Trend)
Unlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen (Uh-uh)
Pile all my yays and I better not never see the lens (Lens)
Fresh start, I wanna play, baby (Play)
Come love a boss, you my babe, baby (Play)
I'm eatin' like I ain't ate (Ate, ate, late)
And I'm workin' like a maid

Come through, won't you see me with my lenses, I'ma trap it (Yea)
Pitch it, I'ma I press it, then I tint it, I got falcons (Yea)
In the Honda Civic, I'ma get it (Rrrr), I got dolphins (Yea)
In the fuckin' fender and they bending
Help me eat (Help me)
Baby don't let me sit here and bleed (I got)
I got Halloween, trick or treats up my sleeve
You can't-you can't Future me because she know this me (What?)
You might also like
She notice me, she notice me (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
She know Young Thugger-Thugger (What? Yeah)
She notice me, she notice me (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
She know Young Thugger-Thugger (Yeah, yeah)
She notice me, she notice me (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
She know Young Thugger-Thugger (Yeah)
She notice me, she notice me (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, yeah)
She know Young Thugger-Thugger (Yeah)

I am the truth (Yeah) and these bitches they know
My right hand on it, bitch suck on my dick (Ooh)
I'ma pull my dick straight outta my boxers
Then she gon' start suckin' like tick (Yeah)
She be the truth when she suckin' that dick
And she wanted my milk like a W.I.C (Ooh)
She don't play games and she don't go no kids
But lil' mama say that I'm it (Yeah)
Ice is drippin' like a faucet
I am hotter than a Taki
Fifth pocket, look like a wallet
Woah, woah no Kemosabe (Woah)
I got Ms like talkin' Molly
And I'm still hot like a pocket
Baby girl suck on my balls like a basket
Get a nigga out of dental, tragic
Lil' mama my money stretch like elastic (Yeah)
No rubber, I might just use plastic (Yeah)
I'm a real boss, I'ma fuck her and leave her in dirt
Like a muh'fuckin' Maverick (Yeah)
And I got lucky, I'm lucky muh'fucka
I might just go play for the Celtics (I'm a Celtic)
I'ma run up with no helper
If I get dealt with, get dealt with (Fuck it)
Bitch I'm a muh'fuckin' killer (I said)
Earring bigger than a pillow (Who is?)
Eat your main bitch like a Skittle (Eat it)
Buy my Burberry at Dillard's (Bhrr)
Boy you know that you not realer, a thriller (Uh-uh)
Boy you know that you're not built like that
Hit you with 3 like Reggie Miller, mama askin' how he kill like that
Big old body Benz
She wanna fuck me in my (Yeah) big old body Benz
She need to suck me in my (Yeah) big old body Benz (Hey, yeah)
I won't stop and I won't end
I swear, I promise
I (Woo) pulled up outside in that new big coupe body Benz (Skrt)
When I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend (Trend)
Unlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen (Uh-uh)
Pile all my yays and I better not never see the lens (Lens)
Fresh start, I wanna play, baby (Play)
Come love a boss, you my babe, baby (Play)
I'm eatin' like I ain't ate (Ate, ate, late)
And I'm workin' like a maid (Ay, ayy)8Embed
