7 ContributorsStraight Out the Lot Lyrics
'Scuse me, 'scuse me, 'scuse me
'Scuse me, 'scuse me, 'scuse me
It ain't nothing new to me

Yeah, straight out the lot (Skrrt), I got a lot (Wassup)
Walking through the penthouse and my bitch got Gucci socks (Wassup)
I don't really wear chains like that, but my neck filled up with rocks (What else?)
Niggas know I get to the bag, so I don't gotta walk 'round with knots (Damn)
Had to cut it off 'cause I can't really deal with all that baggage (All that baggage)
I've been in my bag every day just saving up my cabbage (Yeah, that's facts)
Back in the day, I was locked in, now a nigga double platinum (Double platinum)
I donе fell in love with the Lambo truck, no, I don't want thе Phantom (yeah, let's go)

I'm finna get a spot in LA, but I'ma still stay in Atlanta (Yeah, that's facts)
They be talking that cheddar (Uh, uh)
But I'm rich it don't matter (Nah, nah)
Don't make no sense, don't got no friends, I did it all by my self (Myself)
Don't grab no six, don't want no bands
I'm in the Range by myself

Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me
I've been making movies, it ain't nothing new to me, yeah
Don't use me, use me, use me
My heart always on my sleeve, it ain't nothing new to me, yeah

Drop the top in the coupe', like it's summertime (Summertime)
Runnin' laps around the game, I ain't even in my prime
If you catch me with her, just know she a dime, yeah (Facts)
This a plain jane AP, not a Timex

Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me (Let's go)

Don't use me, use me, use me
My heart always on my sleeve, it ain't nothing new to me, yeah
