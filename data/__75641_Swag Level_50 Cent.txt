9 ContributorsSwag Level Lyrics
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?
First it was the Glock going hand to hand
Then I got to moving the gram by gram
Your boy get bread, that’s without a doubt
One by one, I knocks them out

I get that paper nigga, I get that paper
Benz on chrome shoes, crib sitting on mad acres
If I don’t get it on this time, I’ll get it on the next flip
Ball blowing them bottles and creep off with the next bitch
It’s recreation all, when it’s nothing to do
Fuck up a hater or two, or send a nigga at you
Gem star will scratch you, you're not on my stature, you’re just a rapper
In fact, you’re a regular rapper
Say the wrong line and I’ll get your ass wrapped up
Bass line bumping, whole spot dumping
Like go on to my niggas, get the mossberg pumping
I blow bread nigga, heavy bread
It was rip to big now heavy dead
Now all the fat bitches ask if it was something…

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, I gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?

And I be swagging all day, I be swagging all day
I’m from NY, but I fuck with HBK
When I’m out in the bay feels like home sweet home
Now niggas can’t fuck with the shit I’m on
What up Blood, don’t get it fucked up
A nigga spot pumping out, get you stuck up
Out of habit, I got bad habits
Semi autos, and fully automatics
Click clack it, ra-ta-ta-tat it
Clap clap shit, reload, clap clap shit
I been doing this I don’t need practice
I been doing this I don’t need practice

My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying that the hell is that mean?
My swag on ten I gets the green
People always saying what the hell is that mean?
I get, I gets the bread, I blow, I blows the bread
I get, I gets the bread, I blow, I blows the breadEmbed
