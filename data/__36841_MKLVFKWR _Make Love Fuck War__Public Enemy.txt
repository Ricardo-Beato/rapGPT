Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright now, COME ON!!

Alright y'all, COME ON!!

Fingers in the air, like you really give a damn
Peace sign up, let me hear you say: YEAH!!
Power to The People, put your hands in the air
Peace sign high, like you really do care
Fingers in the air, like you really give a damn
Peace sign up, let me hear you say: YEAH!!
Power to The People, put your hands in the air
Peace sign high, like you really do care

You might also like
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!!

Rather be sitting just to get in it
Power to the people not the governments
Capitalists, communists and terrorists
Swear to God, I don't know the difference
Making new slaves out of the immigrants
Want to know where all the money went
Another trillion spent by the government
Here the bomb go, sent by the presidents
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!
COME ON!!

Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!!
Tell the leaders, they got to feed us
Grand Theft Oil, gonna bleed us
New World Order, doesn't need us
Call for peace, better heed us
Dictators, Human Haters
Hand on the bomb, Mass Debators
Finger on the button, infiltrators
MAKE LOVE, FUCK WAR, PEACE WILL SAVE US!
Yeah, COME ON!!

Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright now, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!!
Break it now, break it now

Check one two..
We want everybody to put this sign up in the air
And at the count of three
Everybody tell me what this sign means: PEACE!!
COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright now, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
Alright y'all, COME ON!!
Put your hands in the air y'all
ALRIGHT NOW!! COME ON!!
