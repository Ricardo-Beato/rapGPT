Oh, what do ya know? He comes

Down, like water, fresh out the clouds clown
Ground you like terrible weather
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon
Most rappers is real hard but still hardly rhyming
To all, (rise and shine) give God the glory
I already give a percent of mine to Bert & Cory
And still got bills and employees to pay
So excuse me Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days
My ways of control is hard to swallow
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind
Sorry to dis-appoint, but dis joint's mine
'Splay your indie but say no
More or I'll blind you like Spit did to Ramo
(Through the dirt) And edit the clip and lost Kano
My mens wear problems like Timbs
See it all in they face, ask Mase, he got wars to win
Scores to settle, crews to crush
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile
It's Long Isle y'all (Long Island)
Longevity sustaining my celebrity status
From AM to PM, you see him on file y'all
I was told to step righteous, so when it's done
Everyone will say I stepped right
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop
Shining his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light
You might also like
A few short words, and what do ya know?
Oh, what do ya know? He comes

Ayo I'm up against these walls here, my back stiff straight up
Dazzling and razzling broads like I'm little Juan Magic
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop
Top drama every time these commas don't drop
Pop spots like lint on your shirt, the net worth
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six
I circumcise the track, you just a dick, overlapped and hooded
Skin repeated like Stuttering John
I repeat like yesterday, it don't stop
George of this poor life pop, put the Scarlet
In a place she believes, much better than your lies
She say she lookin' better in my eyes, bullshit!
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin to fuck
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby
I tried to speak my piece in court but Judge Mills paused me
Bifocusedly die hopeless sometimes
Yo cry your poker face, you oughta try it one time
When God is an iPod, you stand to download
Demanded like slaves on trial (We want free!)
Man cock aim ready, it's time you MC
So you rappers bust BB guns, graffiti runs
Through my veins since cable with the wired remote
Woodgraining like you wired his float
C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul
We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old
Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow
A group of kids so original, you heard?
C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul
We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old
Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow
A group of kids so original, you heard?

Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners who got 'em
We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew, and his whack dancers
Biting is forbidden, pah, pay that tax
And don't you ever look at us funny
Boy, we'll bring rap back
And that'll hurt you like Superman chased by a group of men
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in
Floor you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn
Hula-hoop all bitches crew full with brand new Keds
Cutmaster kill 'em, make sure we cut classics
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the PA
And just lay whooptay whooptay?
Use the ruse, sport beads, and snatch a dude's toupee
Since tuning into T-La Rock and AJ
Ghostface gats is fresh squeezed like a glass of OJ
Girls, you can go cruising in my OJ
A few short words, and what do ya know?
Oh, what do ya know? He comesEmbed
