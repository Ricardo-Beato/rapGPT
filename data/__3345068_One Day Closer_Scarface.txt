2 ContributorsOne Day Closer Lyrics
My mama told me find a real job
'Cause I'm what I'm doing don't cut it
Say she never seen a nigga get rich struggling and shit
Just fussing and I ain't trying to hear that
Leaving out the house, I peep the news and it's clear that
If mama woulda said a few words to them damn fools
You wouldn't have them killers in the classroom
The destructor of the innocent
Praises be to God the beneficent
Most merciful, and I would never question you
But babies being shot down'll hurt a dude
I know the devil's got her heels on
But as I walk through the valley, I just feel home
And life has got a funny way of testing
A man of faith but all in all it's a blessing
To walk up out the storm without a scratch on me
And live to talk about my journeyâ€”where you at, homie?

Sam was born by the river; Martin, he had a dream
But that don't mean there will be harmony
Just because the choir sings
They say that change gon' come
So when is change gon' come?
Somebody tell me; somebody tell me
You might also like
I'm not gon' lie, I'm getting scared now
I started burying my classmates
I remember skipping classes in the 8th grade
And walking to the Burger King at lunchtime
And coming back before the bell rung, but one time
We decided we was finna ditch the whole day
And catch the metro to Sharpstown, I'll always
Remember Kurtis beatboxing on the back seat
Me freestyling, they knew every rapper that he
Bring up to us, K run through us
Man, I miss them old days, if one knew us
You knew that we was destined for greatness
Father's Day came, that's when God set to take him
Too many dying young, no sequel
And I have gone a many night sleepless
Every page turned brings the ending
One day closer, it's on you on how you spend it

Sam was born by the river, and Martin, he had a dream
But that don't mean there will be harmony
Just because the choir sings
They say that change gon' come (Change gon' come)
So when is change gon' come? (When is change gon' come?)
Somebody tell me; somebody tell me
And every day it's something different
It's either politics or one's religion (Yeah, yeah)
We need to keep our guns in my opinion
It's the people that you need to take control of
You have the right to bear your arms what they told us
It's tragic when an innocent is gunned down
But Congress wants to take away our guns? Wow!
Now, what about off in Chicago?
Huh? Them little children in Chicago
Parents heart-broke; I pray I never know that feeling
And although the truth is so revealing
We push it to the side like we don't matter
And that shit makes me madder
That's right, my government Brad Jordan
No different than a Trayvon Martin
No different than a shot down leader
Your picture of a blue-eyed JesusEmbed
