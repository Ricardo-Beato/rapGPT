Black athletes, White agents
Black preacher, White Jesus
Black drug dealer, White government
Black entertainers, White lawyers
This is for the ones that do it
This is for the ones that tell
This is for the ones that's scared
White mans heaven is a black mans hell
This is for the ones that take em
This is for the ones that sell
This is for the ones that OD
White mans heaven is a black mans hell
This is for the ones on the corner
This is for the ones in the cell
This is for the ones under the ground
White mans heaven is a black mans hell
Black Monday, White Christmas
Black success story, White wife
Black police, White judges
Black business, White accountants
Black record company, White distribution
Black comedians, White media
Black politicians, White president
Black genocide, White world order
