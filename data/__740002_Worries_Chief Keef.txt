10 ContributorsWorries Lyrics
Pull up on a hot block in a hot car
With a hot thot, with a gun with some hot stuff
Pull up on a thot block, here the thots come
Runnin' up to my car, like, "Sosa, can I have some?"
Pull up on an opp block with a lot of guns
With a lot of shooters just to shoot 'em, make them niggas run
Pulled up smokin' weed, rollin' weed, loadin' heat
I ain't got no worries 'cause I'm gettin' money

Pull up on a flat block just to get flats
Then I pull off, pop a flat, now I'm gettin' that
Bitches say I'm gettin' fat but I don't drink no six-packs
I'm flexing with this six-pack, six grand my Fitch hat

Pull up on a hot block in a hot car
With a hot thot, with a gun with some hot stuff
Pull up on a thot block, here the thots come
Runnin' up to my car, like, "Sosa, can I have some?"
Pull up on an opp block with a lot of guns
With a lot of shooters just to shoot 'em, make them niggas run
Pulled up smokin' weed, rollin' weed, loadin' heat
I ain't got no worries 'cause I'm gettin' money

Pulled up to the liquor pen and I get ten fifths of Henn'
Pull up to the studio, tryna make some hits again
And I got all this damn ink, bitch tryna read my tats again
Said she like the smell on me, smokin' that shit from Pakistan
30 thousand in these Trues, hundred dollars for these shoes
Five hundred dollars for these Trues, 200 thousand for this coupe
Parkin' my car in handicap, ticket, big deal, can beat that
Pull up on my plug like, "Where the weed at?"
I need that, hand me that

Pull up on a hot block in a hot car
With a hot thot, with a gun with some hot stuff
Pull up on a thot block, here the thots come
Runnin' up to my car, like, "Sosa, can I have some?"
Pull up on an opp block with a lot of guns
With a lot of shooters just to shoot 'em, make them niggas run
Pulled up smokin' weed, rollin' weed, loadin' heat
I ain't got no worries 'cause I'm gettin' money9Embed
