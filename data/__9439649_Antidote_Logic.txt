7 ContributorsAntidote Lyrics
Bitch

This all I make, go over your head like Michelangelo
I got my shirt off in this ho like I'm D'Angelo
You got that wack shit in your playlist, this the antidote
My bitch is bad as fuck, got two kids, sip and yeah, she smoke
This all I make, go over your head like Michelangelo (Bitch)
I got my shirt off in this ho like I'm D'Angelo
You got that wack shit in your playlist, this the antidote
My bitch is bad as fuck, got two kids, sip and yeah, she smoke

Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Taking your mom, taking your sis
Taking your bro, I ain't got no kids
Rocking to RZA, John Travolta
Get high, time irresponsible
I'm lit in this bitch, rock the boat
Swim to the scene, socks is soaked
Heart is gold, lens is chrome
Vs, Vs, Vs, Vs
Bitch throw me neck, I don't shop at Lids
Bitch want a shot, tell her sip on her kids
Nigga purp' like Grimace, I get high like blimp
Get popped in the dome, nigga, I don't attempt
Paint in the crib, Michelangelo
Any bitch sell wet Costa Rica coast
You might also like
This all I make, go over your head like Michelangelo (Bitch)
I got my shirt off in this ho like I'm D'Angelo
You got that wack shit in your playlist, this the antidote
My bitch is bad as fuck, got two kids, sip and yeah, she smoke
This all I make, go over your head like Michelangelo (Bitch)
I got my shirt off in this ho like I'm D'Angelo
You got that wack shit in your playlist, this the antidote
My bitch is bad as fuck, got two kids, sip and yeah, she smoke

Made a million and another million and I made it out
You's a bitch

Only fucking with the clout 'cause your money running out
I see the drought, the fuck you talking about?
Everyone know you a bitch
Ain't no talking it down, you bitch, you a punk, you a disgrace
Get this money, get from me, get bread, don't get crumby
I'm the one of one, bitches want me
The left, the right, the black, the white
The complication in the game, erasing the name
Pain, what a lot of money bring
Gotta maintain for the gang-gang, for the bloodline of mine
Can only take so much, feel like everywhere I look
The people crook, really wanna take from us
Need a break, need an escape, need to cut cake
But you can't escape the fate
Everybody fake, everybody take
Everybody want what they can't have
Can't laugh, can't have happiness 'cause yous a bitch
This all I make, go over your head like Michelangelo (Bitch)
I got my shirt off in this ho like I'm D'Angelo
You got that wack shit in your playlist, this the antidote
My bitch is bad as fuck, got two kids, sip and yeah, she smoke
This all I make, go over your head like Michelangelo (Bitch)
I got my shirt off in this ho like I'm D'Angelo
You got that wack shit in your playlist, this the antidote
My bitch is bad as fuck, got two kids, sip and yeah, she smokeEmbed
