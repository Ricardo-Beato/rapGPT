4 ContributorsDreaming Lyrics
(Don't wake me, I'm dreaming)
This feels like a dream, yeah
(Don't wake me, I'm dreaming) haha

I'm dreaming big, real big, I got big dreams
I'll kill 'em this year, I got big schemes
It's bigger than coke, it's bigger than dope
My marijuana mentality went up in smoke
I go hard, so hard there ain't nothing harder (yeeeahhh)
Poor or rich, my nigga, I hustle regardless
'Til I die and touch the sky
I'll be trying to get my piece of the pie
Shoot me or love me or hate me or leave me alone (c'mon)
The jealousy's growing 'cause I'm in the zone (yeah)
The underground king, I'm on the throne
'Cause niggas just ain't on the shit that I'm on
What I've been through shift my mental
It sounds like murder on the instrumental (yeah)
I tend to spaz, I went through cash
So fast got to get me some more

If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep (man!)
Don't wake me up 'til my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming then leave me alone (feels like New Jack City, ha ha)
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
I can't get over the fact that I'm with you (ha ha)
Now that I have you I don't know what to do
(I don't know what to do)
Girl, if I'm dreaming I'm dreaming 'bout you (that's fo' sure)
About the things that I'd like to do (wo-wo-woo!)
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming (don't wake me girl)
Girl, don't wake me (ha ha)
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming (this feels too good man)
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you

If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep (let me dream man)
Don't wake me up 'til my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone (leave me alone)
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
I've been waiting for such a long time (I need you, girl)
For you to say that you would be mine (come on)
Now that you're here, here by my side (yeah)
I can't control the way that I feel inside (I can't believe it)

Don't wake me, I'm dreaming (it feels like a dream)
Girl, don't wake me
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming (ha ha)
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you

If I'm dreaming just let me sleep (don't wake me up)
Don't wake me up 'til my dream is complete (come on, baby, I'm)
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone (leave me alone)
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone

Don't wake me up 'cause Clean Cut's dreaming (yeah)
In a deep sleep my mind keeps scheming (come on)
I heard she had a man, I said ''so what?''
She be looking sweeter than a honey (?) donut
And I wanna taste her, straight, no chaser
We can do this now if not then maybe later (uh huh)
Front to back, in fact I keep her screaming
For you I'm fiending, girl, you got me dreaming
(This year make me wan' do the wop, man)

If I'm dreaming about you, let's make this dream come true
(You can make it come true)
If I'm dreaming about you, let's make this dream of love come true (AOWW!)

Don't wake me, I'm dreaming (ha ha)
Girl, don't wake me (you should love me, man)
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you (come on)

If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete ('til my dream's complete)
If I'm dreaming then leave me alone (leave me alone)
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep (it was not me, man)
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
(It was the educated brother from the bank.. oh my God!)
This dream is just, just you and me (I'm dreaming)
Come here, babyEmbed
