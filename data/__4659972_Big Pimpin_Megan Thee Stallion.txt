Big pimpin', we spendin’ cheese, check 'em out now
Big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.’s
We doin' big pimpin' up in N.Y.C
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
Yo, yo, yo
Big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We doin' big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.’s
We doin’ big pimpin' up in N.Y.C
It’s just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

H.B.I.C, P.I.M.P, it's the same thing
I'm committed to this money, somethin' like a wedding ring (Yeah)
Super pussy, make it bang (Yeah), something like a .45
Shoutout to them bitches who be beefed out on the other side (What’s up?)
What's up to my daddy? Taught me hustlin' was the only way (What's up?)
What's up to them niggas? Woke up, who chain they gon' take today? (What's up?)
What's up to them bitches makin' money in the booty club?
Bring all of my niggas in, I bet they gon' show y'all love
Money makin' Megan (Megan)
Megan the assassin
Hop on any beat and crash it
Like I'm drunk driving and spazzin'
Show me any bitch, I'll pass her (Pass her)
Train her like her master (Master)
Put her on her knees, pray to me like a pastor
Pussy tighter than a trapper
Wrap that dick up like a wrapper (Yeah)
Stand over his face then stroll on it like a capper (Ah)
Tell that bitch I'm just your cousin (Cousin)
If she get to buggin' (Buggin')
Runnin' 'round the city, blowin' money wit' your husband (Mwah)
Smoking loud, pouring up, two piece and some Gucci pumps
Ridin' 'round with a thug, watchin' money piling up (Piling up)
Everybody want a piece, everybody wanna eat (Wanna eat)
Niggas out here playing hard but don't got them dirty feet (Uh-uh)
Hangin' at the South with the best sun (Best sun)
Still get low with the worse some (Worse some)
Don't come around me 'less you worth some
If the bitch wanna hang, tell her, "Twerk some" (Twerk some)
If the bitch wanna jump, tell her, "Do some" (Do some)
If the nigga want me, tell him, "Eat some" (Yaeh)
Say you gotta lotta money, let me see some
Me, you, and the money, have a threesome (Ah)
Put you on some player shit (Player shit)
Shake that ass like Diamond did
Booty make him run and tell all his friends
Wet wet make him wanna have a lot of kids
Kick that nigga if he actin' like a bitch though
Ride 'round gettin' money with a rich ho
Breakin' these niggas, tryna see what the hit for
If you wanna play, have my nigga do a kick door
You might also like
Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it "buck"
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys, smokin' weed and makin' noise
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
'Cause we be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B1Embed
