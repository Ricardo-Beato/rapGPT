15 ContributorsEast Atlanta Lyrics
I’m pretty sure if you look up in the dictionary
Next to the word trap nigga, trap house, trap anything nigga
You gon see a picture of my ass and my nigga Guwop
We raise you little niggas man, understand that, Trapology
You know I won’t let ya’ll get to the whole soul when I hear my voice with my brother man
It’s what we do nigga, Zone 6 East Atlanta what’s up ?

On the block eating noodles
I’m a rock, you a poodle
In the club with a snub
I’m a motherfucking shooter
In a drop top spider
Titties showing like Hooters
I’m the plug tryna serve all the cocaine users
I’m an East Atlanta nigga we don’t really like strangers
Selling dubs so big fit your whole fore finger
I’m an East Atlanta nigga we don’t really like strangers
If your girl like rich niggas I suggest you don’t bring her

I’m an East Atlanta boss, yeah I run this out of town
Gucci Mane was locked up I had to hold this shit down
I got bricks, I got pounds, I done brought the price down
Keep lil nuke with me every day, yeah he’ll lay your ass down
This a Southside beat but I’m from the east side
When I was on the block working you lil niggas couldn’t come outside
That ain’t his whip, that’s devil ride, but I was on the driver’s side
Rest in peace to OGD, I wish my nigga was still alive
You might also like
On the block eating noodles
I’m a rock, you a poodle
In the club with a snub
I’m a motherfucking shooter
In a drop top spider
Titties showing like Hooters
I’m the plug tryna serve all the cocaine users
I’m an East Atlanta nigga we don’t really like strangers
Selling dubs so big fit your whole four fingers
I’m an East Atlanta nigga we don’t really like strangers
If your girl like rich niggas I suggest you don’t bring herEmbed
