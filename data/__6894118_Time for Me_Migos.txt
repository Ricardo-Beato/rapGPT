50 ContributorsTime for Me Lyrics
I 'preciate you
You makin' me realize all the time I wasted
Thinkin' 'bout them bando days, goin' back to the basic
But I don't really think you know that though
So I thought I'd explain it

In the bando I hated starvin' (Starvin')
In the bando I hated starvin' (Bando)
So many late nights I had to lock in
Spinnin' and finessin' niggas, robbin' (Spinnin')
When the gang meet at the 'partments
There's only the gang that's important (Gang)
Keepin' it real in all fields and clean up your spills, you never get extorted (For real)

The Nawf ain't raised nothin' dumb (Uh-huh)
You niggas can't take nothin' from me
Feel like I been raised in the jungle (Jungle)
My momma ain't raised no dummy (Momma)
Nah, I ain't never been a scrub (Scrub)
Shit get sticky out the mud
Five watches plain, three flood (Flood)
Nigga want smoke, it's all love
Nigga want smoke, it's all love (Smoke)
Don't get it twisted, I still keep it on me
I'll spin the whole block, just 'cause (Skrrt, skrrt)
Young nigga please don't do it (No)
She gets sticky like mud (Mud)
Five watches plain, three flood (Flood)
Ain't got time, but I got time today
I ain't even goin' for mean mug (Mug)
Buckshots, straight slugs
I got blue tips in this gun (Blue)
Ain't even goin' for none (No, no)
Twelve, yeah, squally I run (Twelve)
Young nigga fresh out on bond (Yeah)
Ain't got time, but I got time today
When you see me, please don't judge (Nope)
In the bando I hated starvin'
You might also like
(Hey) In the trenches, I had to rob 'em
Sinnin' and spinnin' and shootin' carbons (Spin)
They go body for body, coffin for coffin (Body for body)
She gon' dive in my water just like a dolphin (Dolphin)
Pull up in Ferraris, see the boss in here
Bitch nigga, we don't even rock with them (Bitch nigga)
One life to live, can't pause the film (Hoo)
Hey, what's your name, baby? (What's your name?)
I can see it in your eyes, you been through pain, baby (Pain)
I can tell I make you shy, I'm not a lame, baby (Lane)
Get money and I get high on private planes, lady (Get money)
Two Tommys to get the spendin' 'til they feel lazy (Two Tommys)
Twinkle, twinkle, yellow diamonds like I urinated (Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle)
I done been in situations, never cooperated (Never cooperated)
We can always have a talk, long as the guap related (Long as the racks involved)

In the bando I hated starvin' (Starvin')
In the bando I hated starvin' (Starvin')
So many late nights had to lock in (Yeah)
Spinnin' and finessin' niggas robbin' (Spendin')
When the gang meet at the 'partments (Yeah)
There's only the gang that's important (Important)
Keepin' it real in all fields and clean up your spills, you never get extorted (Extorted, Takeoff!)
I ain't never get extorted (Never)
God first, my family, the gang, that's important (The gang)
I miss the fans and the game, miss the feelin' of performance (I miss you)
Thankin' God on my knees when I wake up in the mornin' (Religion)
The legendary bando days in my grandma house recordin' (Grandma)
Back when I was sippin' Ac' and movin' like a tortoise (Drank)
Finessin' for them Benjamins, runnin' faster than Forrest (Run!)
I'ma take that bag and plant a seed, watch I grow it (Grow it)
It ain't now or 'nother, I do this shit for my mother (Momma)
Feelin' like I'm Russell, collecting a triple-double (Russell)
Lookin' at these nigga, we know that we got 'em shook (Look up)
And I ain't gotta touch you, like a key start, that's a finger push
They hop out that sprinter bus, give it up tell 'em "Pick it up"
A mil' in that vacuum seal look just like a mega bust (A whole mil')
No gen' five, but they know not to play with us (Don't do that)
I guess since we came out the Nawf, that's why they hate on us

In the bando I hated starvin'
In the bando I hated starvin'
So many late nights had to lock in
Juggin' and finessin' niggas, robbin' (Robbin')
When the gang meet at the 'partments
There's only the gang that's important (Important)
Keepin' it real in all fields, you clean up your spills, you never get extorted
'Cause she get sticky like mud (Mud)
Five watches plain, three flood
Nigga want smoke, it's all love
Nigga want smoke, it's all love
M-m-m-murda on it4Embed
