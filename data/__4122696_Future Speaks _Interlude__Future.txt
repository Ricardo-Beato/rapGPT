6 ContributorsFuture Speaks (Interlude) Lyrics
What up, it's the astronaut kid, the designer kid
Future and you rocking with me
Dirty Sprite, yeah
The drink muddy, nigga
I'm taking that shit to a whole 'notha level
It's been a motherfucking movie
It's epic, motion picture, understand that
Double salute to the streets, did it for us
A1 since day one, Freeband gang
Shoutout to the worldYou might also likeEmbed
