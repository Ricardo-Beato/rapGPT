60 ContributorsCudderIsBack Lyrics
Yeah, wassup?
Mmmhm nigga, yeah it's me (laugh)
Yeah, I’m back baby
Cudi, hey

Ottoman couch, how handsome your furniture
Lovelier now, but dressed for funeral
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall

Huh, stay home a lot, no TV (yeah)
Just thoughts, and a heap of good weed (yeah)
Same jeans, same old Converse
Bape tees and the Walees, so works
I'm cool, some niggas mad at it
Lookin' in from the outside, fantastic
Can't keep the negative alive
They be on my dick, if Kid Cudi die
Don't cry hater, I forgive (yeah)
Now go and get my album and get off my dick (yeah)
I smile and I’m pleasant, the weed is the essence
But if I’m in the club, we gon’ tear this shit up
I’m talkin' 'bout shots, ridiculous amounts (uh)
Cause if you’re gonna rage, should be all about (aye)
Take, take another shot or you’re soft
Dream On campaign I’m the mother lovin' boss (yeah)
Haters suck my balls, two time (hehe)
I never say goodbye 'cause I’m on mine
All my life, wanna do some' major
Now every little thing I do might make it in the paper (man)
Cudi found y’all nigga, po-po (whatever)
Mad drunk in the street, no photo (I rage)
Hatin' motherfuckas, don't know yo
I guess this was the life I chose
Wanna get up in my mind
Wanna know about me and Amanda Bynes (Amanda please)
Wanna know really, really, really who I’m datin'
Is she civilian or super duper famous? (hmmm)
Is she African American, Caucasian, or Asian? (so many)
Or maybe Spanish (yeah)
It don’t matter my nigga, I love them all
As long as she don’t need stupid amounts of makeup
To makeup the self esteem (I know)
Selfish dreams can reflect the blessing
I am tap dancing on a cloud (I am)
Successful raps, I might scream out loud (mhm)
Puttin' it down, for all I met (yeah)
Talking fans, I won't quit (yeah)
I’m puttin' it down, for all I met (yeah)
Talking fans, I won't quit (yeah)
