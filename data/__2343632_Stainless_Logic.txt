It's 2 bars? A'ight...
Motherfuckers wanna get famous, bust guns and get (dangerous, dangerous)
Daddy graduated from Cambridge, yeah, money talks in every language, huh
Real recognize that stainless (stainless), silver spoon what my aim is
Y'all don't know what that game is
Man, y'all don't know what that, uh
Y'all 'bout that fraternity life
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come
Baby girl gon' be 'bout that maternity life
If you do like my daddy, then she gonna be single and alone
That maternity life for eternity life
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life
Cause we do what we do, but hold up let me get it right
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems
But not everybody need a .45 to solve them, revolve them (ba-ba-ba-ba)
Take care of all of them like this, I might just go crazy all the way
Y'all live that life where your safety is only a call away
But not us, mommy and daddy never bought us
Not a god damn thing but they brought us
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust
Outside run around with a gun to bust
Police looking for every one of us
Back then, yeah, all of that was fun to us
Had a little bit of money in the middle, let me hit 'em with a riddle
If I never had a dark night I might not-not-not—
Not be the same—might not be the—

I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over

Ayy, hey now boy?
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gang, gang, gang
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver-
Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average
They cutthroat, yeah they savage
They riding round with the baddest (bitch)
One day I woke up, and said I'm bout to do this
For the rest of my life, no question it's right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light
Looking at the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies, where the truth dies
And hatred multiplies—mu-mu-mu-multi—
Multiplies, I said I can't take it
I remember wondering if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realise it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around, so the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate
And when the situation delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no, can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap, never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen?
Stop spending money on things that glisten
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over
I Know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over

Ayy, hey now boy?
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gat gat gat
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver spoon94Embed
