6 ContributorsAll In A Day Lyrics
All the money in the safe, all the money in the safe
All the money in the safe baby, lets spend it all in a day
I just wanna ball with you, let's shut down a mall or two
Buy it if you wanted to, you know how us ballers do
You so pretty, you so pretty in the face girl
You so pretty you so pretty in the face
You so thick, you so thick in the waist girl
You so fine, you so fine, I'ma try to spend it all

Fucked in the back and then I get it back
Standing in the way but she throwing that ass
All that relay when we speaking that cash
Been steppin' in Giuseppe's
With her friends friend and her bestie
Whippin' fishscale, you can smell it
Got like 10 million on my sketchers
Took like 200 on her dress
If you got it, I get it, I want it, might fuck on your baby momma
100 thousand ain't no money, I blew that on 2 Rollie's
Bought his and her Porsche's
Said I'm gonna give to her a fortress
And I did it all in a day
Let's shop at Fitz plaza, but it don't matter
Cause I got it, with the Louboutin's in your closet
Let's go break the safe, and we go ball like when the Lakers play
I'ma spoil ya, like it's past ya expiration day
Ooh, she a bad bitch with an amazing face
The shit we dealing' leave on the paper plates
Let's go cop twin Rollie's, yeah we matching day and day's
Let's go run through the money in the safe
You might also like
All the money in the safe, all the money in the safe
All the money in the safe baby, lets spend it all in a day
I just wanna ball with you, let's shut down a mall or two
Buy it if you wanted to, you know how us ballers do
You so pretty, you so pretty in the face girl
You so pretty you so pretty in the face
You so thick, you so thick in the waist girl
You so fine, you so fine, I'ma try to spend it all

Now we balling baby, yeah, yeah we balling baby
Yeah we balling baby, yeah, yeah, yeah we balling baby
Now we balling baby, yeah, yeah, we balling baby

Damn this girl so fine, ass fat, titties right, all that
Held it down when I was down, so for that, you know a nigga 
Stroke the pussy, ate the pussy, kill the pussy, and I'm dressed in all black
Usually I hit it twice, take flight, and I never ball back
But there's something about her, that made me wanna spend up every dollar in my safe
I'm usually cold hearted, but you ain't got no worries baby girl cause you straight

All the money in the safe, all the money in the safe
All the money in the safe baby, lets spend it all in a day
I just wanna ball with you, let's shut down a mall or two
Buy it if you wanted to, you know how us ballers do
You so pretty, you so pretty in the face girl
You so pretty you so pretty in the face
You so thick, you so thick in the waist girl
You so fine, you so fine, I'ma try to spend it all

Now we balling baby, yeah, yeah, we balling baby
Yeah we balling baby, yeah, yeah, yeah we balling babyEmbed
