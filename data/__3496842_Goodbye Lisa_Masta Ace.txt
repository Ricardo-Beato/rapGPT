Yo what's up this is Lisa
Leave me a message and I'll get back at you
And if it's important I guess you'll get back at me

Yo it's me, pick up

What's up?

Why you screening your shit?

That nigga Tyreque, he' calling here talking shit

Talkin' about what?
What, he tryin' to get back with you?

Nah, he thinks he's gonna' get this car back
I don't feel like getting into it right now
What you doing?
You might also like
I'm packing

Packing for what?

Remember that school I was telling you about?
The one upstate?

Yeah

Well I enrolled, I'm out tomorrow

What? But you just got home
Why you gonna' do some dumb shit like that?

Yo I can't stay around here no more man
Everyday something's happening
Somebody else got murdered last night

Yeah yeah, I heard but I'm sayin'
You bouncing for who knows how long
For some shit that ain't even making you no money?
Matter of fact, you paying in
That's some dumb shit
And it's mad money in the streets
Nah man, I ain't fuckin' with your brother and them like that man
That's dead, I'm out
I'll call you when I get thereEmbed
