5 ContributorsDamn Liar Lyrics
I got some real bitches with me for patron we on that avion
I got some real bitches with me for patron we on that avion
I’m talking real jury, nigga, fuck that shit got a Mercedes on
No timers in my watch, damn right it cost a Jaguar
Seat up in that ‘Rari thing that be faster than a race car

You’s a god damn liar, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking I ain’t getting money, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we're about that life that you’s a god damn liar
If you think we think it twice, you’s a god damn liar
You’s a god damn liar, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we ain’t counting money, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we ain’t getting money, you’s a god damn liar
If you think we think it twice you’s a god damn liar

Hoes gon be hoes, and niggas gon’ be niggas
Hustlers gon’ be dealers, and niggas gon’ pull triggers
Yeah Im worse than IRS, I came to collect
If you ain’t got no money, just pay me in respect, Yea
Martin Luther, Malcom, Young, Yea I pay the way
Man you niggas acting like I’m still gon’ hop out of that K
Man I can’t even sleep, too busy plottin on you busters
If I’m ever in the spot then I'm balling on you suckers
If a nigga told you different then he motherfucking lied
Bitch I do this shit until I'm motherfucking tired
Hopped off the porch when I was 12, didn't get no rest
If I ever lie, then let them 40′s hit me in my chest
You might also like
You’s a god damn liar, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking I ain’t getting money, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we're about that life that you’s a god damn liar
If you think we think it twice, you’s a god damn liar
You’s a god damn liar, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we ain’t counting money, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we ain’t getting money, you’s a god damn liar
If you think we think it twice you’s a god damn liar

Nigga, you a lie, and you motherfucking know it
And all that gangsta shit you niggas talking, yea, I’m for it
They're hating ass shit, only gon get you so far
Then you turn around and look around and nigga there you are
In the same damn place, damn block, with no progress
To be this nigga here, it takes a process
First you got to hit the block like a real nigga
Then you gonna hit the booth and straight kill niggas
I don’t feel niggas but you bet they felt me
Be a cold day in hell before they melt me
Got my first Glock and hit the block ain’t get no rest
If I ever lie then let them 40′s hit me in my chest

You’s a god damn liar, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking I ain’t getting money, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we're about that life that you’s a god damn liar
If you think we think it twice, you’s a god damn liar
You’s a god damn liar, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we ain’t counting money, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we ain’t getting money, you’s a god damn liar
If you think we think it twice you’s a god damn liar
How you going for it and you know these niggas lie?
Half the hood locked up, and the other half dying
These lying ass rappers, man, I swear these niggas trying
Just to make it another day, nigga, everybody trying
So fuck the world now, nigga, who in it and who ain’t with me
I’m bound to fuck, call the federalies come and get me
This shit here ain’t the game, man this shit here’s the game
I’m talking real jail, real prisons and everything
That’s why I put the God honest truth on every bar
Time is cold out here got a heater in every car
See my first quarter mill when I was 12 ain’t get no rest
If I ever lie then let them 40′s hit me in my chest

You’s a god damn liar, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking I ain’t getting money, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we're about that life that you’s a god damn liar
If you think we think it twice, you’s a god damn liar
You’s a god damn liar, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we ain’t counting money, you’s a god damn liar
Thinking we ain’t getting money, you’s a god damn liar
If you think we think it twice you’s a god damn liarEmbed
