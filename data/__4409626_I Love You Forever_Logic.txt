Hold me in your loving arms, please
Please don't be alarmed, no
Don't sound the alarm
You're always on my mind
I wish you were mine
I wish I could tell you how I feel (How I feel)
I wish I wasn't scared
Don't think you're prepared
For me to tell you how I feel (I feel, I feel)
Even on the days we don't speak
Just the thought of you makes me weak
I feel like Thom, I feel I'm a fucking creep
Pick up the pieces that make me whole again
You give me a reason to live
I said you pick up the pieces that make me whole again
You give me a reason to live
I don't know where I'm going
I don't know where I've been
But I can't go down that road again
No, I can't, no, I can't, I say
I wish I was handsome, I wish I was funny
I wish I was smart and had a whole lot of money
I wish I was good enough for you, for you
I wish I was handsome, I wish I was funny
I wish I was smart and had a whole lot of money
I wish I was good enough for you, ooh
She said oh no no, oh no
You don't see the things that I see
She said oh no no, oh no
You can't fathom the possibilities
And if you'd open up your mind
Maybe there, you would find that I love you forever
And I love you forever more, forever
And I love you forever more, forever
And I love you forever more, forever
And I love you forever
I love you forever
And she said, "I think you're beautiful, I think you're funny
I think you're smart, don't give a fuck about the money
'Cause, baby, you're good enough for me, for me"
And she said, "I think you're beautiful, I think you're funny
I think you're smart, don't give a fuck about the money
'Cause baby, you're good enough, you're good enough
You're good enough"You might also like9Embed
