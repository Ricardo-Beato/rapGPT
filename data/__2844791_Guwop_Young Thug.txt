I done put twenty up under the SIG
You dig? You dig? You dig? (That boy Cassius)
Ayy (Wheezy Beats)

I done put twenty inside the SIG (You dig?)
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid (You dig?)
I pull up to your block and I pop at your bitch (You dig?)
I hopped out the coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch (You dig? You dig? You dig?)
Since I was a youngin, I been gettin' dough (You dig? You dig?)
I count my backend and I turn up the show (You dig? You dig?)
I want hella Xans, it gears me up (You dig? You dig?)
I put the V neck on my team, yeah (You dig? You dig? You dig? You dig? Hey)

I dig everything that you sayin'
I dig everything that you doin' too
I dig the way that you look at me
You dig the way that I look at you
I just wanna grab on your butt, butt
The seat in the Benz, the Chanel Clutch
The FN, it give him a haircut
I roll up a seven of John Dutch
That big booty bounce on the dick and it broke
I don't gotta act like a gangster, she know
Dope, my Backwood look like a pole (Yeah)
My Backwood look like a pole
I sit on clouds of the smoke
I'ma blow clouds of the smoke
Pardon me, pardon my soul
I crack a smile for them folks, ayy
Niggas, they eatin' in broad day
In that ho mouth like a Colgate, yeah
Keepin' that cold case, God, please give me that cold case
Man, I don't want no new friends, forgive me for all of my sins
I donâ€™t wanna think about losin', all I wanna do is win, win (Hey)

Beat down the block like an amp (Beat it)
Goin' up like a skateboard on a ramp (Whoa, ayy)
Go buy the Rollie and bust it (Bust it, bust it, hey)
Talkin' that tough shit, but you know you not gon' bust shit (Huh, huh, huh, grrah)
Look at my fashion, this is a Gucci rugby (Look at it, look at it)
I'm trappin' and rappin', still got them babies in custody (Trappin' and rappin')
My diamonds be dancin', live in a mansion, my life is lovely (My life is lovely, hey)
