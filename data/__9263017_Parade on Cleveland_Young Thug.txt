Woah

How the fuck you out here goin' tit for tat? (Tit for tat)
I should've saw the signs, how could I miss that? (How could I miss that?)
Ayy, soon as I'm fresh out the box like a Tic-Tac
We havin' sex soon as I get my bitch back
It ain't gon' be sexy when I get my lick back
I'm about to mop up some boys, it's custodian time
Me and my thoughts is the loneliest time
Don't tell me 'bout loyalty, show me this time
Don't tell me 'bout loyalty, show me this time
Business is business, you owe me this time
Slime on your head, Nickelodeon time

Oh, woah
Parade on Blevеland soon as I get home
I'm comin' home
I'm comin' homе
All the dawgs, all the lifers
All the pythons, all the vipers
Parade, parade on Bleveland soon as I get home
You already know, you already know

Hello, this is a prepaid call from Jeffery
An inmate at the Cobb county adult detention facility
To accept this call, press zero
To refuse this call, hang up or press one
Yo, what's up, my brother?
What's up, my brother?
Talk to me, what's the word?
Uh, I ain't doin' shit, man
Just pushin' more Peter, more sweeter, more completer
Than any Peter pusher around
See what I'm sayin', twin? Ha (Ha-ha-ha)

Spider back, I'm a big dawg, you a cat
How is that you was ever in the format?
Honeybun, on the bed, yeah, hundred racks
Sun's up, I ain't sleep, I been countin' stacks
Hands down, yeah, the big dawg comin' back
Think you good? Nigga, pants down, you smokin' crack
Michael Kors robe, mm-mm, nah, Michael Jackson
Back in like forty days, forty seconds
Backend after backend like I'm trappin'
Actually, I been trapped in, but I took a black bitch to Beverly Hills
Now she white, Michael Jackson
After we fuck, she told her friends, "Bitch, it's crackin'"
Made a jail call to your bitch, she say you down
You a bug in the grass, finna get ate by my cow
I'm just livin' my life on the jet, ridin' 'round
Two hoes with me, one white, the other one Bobby Brown
Business is business, business is business, business is business
Business is business, business is business, yeah
Business is business, business is business, business is business
Business is business, business is business, yeah
Business is business, business is business, business is business
Business is business, business is business, yeah
Business is business, business is business, business is business
Business is business, business is business
