Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me, I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me, we gon' beef forever
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me, I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me, we gon' beef forever

W—W—Why you always tryna run and hide? (Why?)
Always have my name up in your mouth, you outta line
You gon' make me pop up at your door like "surprise" (Hi)
Like "come outside, lil' bitch, come outside"
Never by my lonely, got my niggas by my side
And all my niggas skrr skrr, yeah, they down to ride
Yeah, my bitches go to work; I'm talking 9 to 5 (Work)
The streets want to fuck around you won't stay alive
Your mouth can cost you, and I’ll make sure that you pay the price
So don't be lackin' when you comin' home from work at night
You run your mouth; I'm poppin' out, now it's on sight
You—You—You gon' be just like my pussy: hella tight
A ho can hate, but don't be fucking with my commas (No)
And if she is, I'll shape her up and she gon' get the line up
Can't be starting all these problems if you cannot solve 'em (Don't do that)
Cardi backing down, I swear to God, that's not an option
You might also like
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me, I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me, we gon' beef forever
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me, I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me, we gon' beef forever

Some bitches claim they with the shit, but they ain't with a thing
I spin the block, come around like a boomerang
Silence, silence, I don't hear a thing
Worry 'bout me, but your pussy smell like turtle tank
I pull up on that check, nothing less, that's all I do
T—T—Ten bands, fifty bands, ain't nuttin' new
I see some people who still worried 'bout my revenue (Why you worry?)
I'm eating good, you wish you could, don't worry about my food
And niggas hating on a female, ain't no way to live (Lil bitch)
You bitch-made, make me wonder if you got a dick (Lil bitch)
How you feeling like a man envying a chick? (Pussy)
Wake up and go get some money, go and find your niche (Get that money)
Silly motherfucker (Silly,) who raised you? (Who raised you?)
A nigga with a pussy? How disgraceful (Oh my God)
I have my hitters come, and duct tape you
And your bitch could get it too, double date, boo
So let's get it, so let's get it, so let's get it
Let's not waste a minute; you clearly started, so let's finish
I don't do forgiveness; they take your kindness for a gimmick
I'm just here for business, I'm running down and I'm with it, bap
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me, I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me, we gon' beef forever
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice
You know me, I be with whatever
If a bitch beef with me, we gon' beef forever
