8 ContributorsGettaway Lyrics
Uh, uh
Uh-huh
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, uh

Close your eyes, visualize, Space Nine verbalize
You chastise, but can't stop my enterprise
Put your rhymes in a line, put your raps in a stack
I'll break you and your singer like Jenga, I mean, um
I spit lightning on you, this tight thing
Space Nine inferno, one verbs be frightening
And for the sword fight tonight, my entourage is in camouflage
Remove your mask, let down your visage
But don't slip up 'cause when I was in my ship, uh
That's when I get ripped up, the whole world, fuck it
G-S-E committee, got your panties shitty
Clique be sick, colossal, you itty-bitty
Space and Missy, sip my style 'til you're pissy
Virginia bitch galactic, what the fuck?

I be writing rhymes, writing rhymes every day (Writing rhymes every day)
Don't you say no more, you don't wanna battle (You don't wanna battle)
Said I'm writing rhymes (Yeah), writing rhymes every day (Writing rhymes every day)
Don't you say no more, you don't wanna battle (No, no, ficky-ficky, no)
You might also like
Mama, Daddy, you ain't ready
Act like you know me, fly as friends bes
I'm sizzling, I'm chilling
Man, you twisting, you sissy
You diss me, you wish we was fucking tight
Auntie, Papa, smoke, la-la
Ha-la, fa-la, don't bother to swalla
This bottle of RÃ©my, got plenty of weed
So give me, give me, give me, give me, give me please
Sees? No one fly like these (Uh-huh)
Bees from overseas, we speak Chinese
Please, little one, please flee
You know my rhymes get tight when I smoke all my weed

I be writing rhymes, writing rhymes every day (Writing rhymes every day)
Don't you say no more, you don't wanna battle (You don't wanna battle)
Said I'm writing rhymes (No), writing rhymes every day (Writing rhymes every day)
Don't you say no more, you don't wanna battle (Uh-huh)
Me, super-duper (Ficky, uh, what?), fly

We high-tech like Timbos, slap faces of dirty hoes
N-Y-M-B-A, a dirty combo when we play (Ooh)
Swirl like the Milky Way, deep like my black hole
I oppose to expose, chemical gases up your nose (Uh)
Fade away like ozone, quasars, moons, and shit
Ayo, Missy, where the clip? I think I need a hit
Shitty Bs up in the place, wanna be down with whoever
Be all up in his face, but ain't even on the level (Uh-huh, ooh)
I pull your wig back, let off steam like nasty pools (Uh-huh)
The heat be too hot, melt down, now up in pot (Ooh)
Count down, three, two, one, lift off, now over-tize (Uh-huh)
Venus, we circlize, and Mars, we tantalize (Uh-huh)
Comet-ize like Hale-Bopp, smoking trees nonstop
Then I send a televise from satellite on Nightline
Yeah, wouldn't you like to get away (Uh) to the moon?
We shine like stars, lock down like metal bars
I be writing rhymes (Yeah), writing rhymes every day (Writing rhymes every day)
Don't you say no more, you don't wanna battle (You don't wanna battle)
Said I'm writing rhymes (Baby), writing rhymes every day (Every day)
Don't you say no more, you don't wanna battle (Yeah), uh

Ayo, I'm kinda scared to do this
'Cause Jimmy tryna scare me saying I'ma give away my publishing
But, um, it don't matter
'Cause I write my own shit (Uh-huh)
Do my own shit (Uh-huh)
Sing my own shit (Uh-huh)
Shit be a hit
Oh, shit be a hit (Uh-huh, you know what?)

My style is a one in a million
I flow on and on and on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
My rhymes give you a really good feeling (Say what? Say what? Uh-huh, uh-huh)
All day long (Rewind it, yeah)
My style is a one in a million (Say what, say what?)
I flow on and on and on (Yeah, yeah, uh-huh)
My rhymes (Uh-huh, uh-huh) give you a really good feeling (Yeah, come on)
All day long (Say what?)
Let me listenEmbed
