4 ContributorsHow Much You Want It Lyrics
Say you wanna know me
First, you gotta show me
How much you want it?
How much you need it?
How much you want it?
How much you need it?
Say you wanna know me
First, you gotta show me
How much you want it?
How much you need it?
How much you want it?
How much you need it?

Damn lil shawty got a lot, I like the way lil shawty rock
Look at that ass lil shawty got, I can't lie she has to squat
Tall, thick, short, small
Took her to the mall and I let her ball
GGT I got them 
Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall
Sex in the city, shawty hair real pretty
Camel toe like Hello Kitty
Damn your waist so itty bitty
But what can you do with it?
Come in the club, and the club pause
Bring it right like a block in the back
She can call me Santa Claus,  cause I got it like that
Like Ray Lewis, I'm boutta sack
Zaytoven, he made this track
Bankroll doing jumpin jacks
Orange Ferrari like a pumpkin patch
Imma shine likе I'm her all
She text mе, I gotta call
She a kitty, I'm a dog
I can't lie, I love 
(It's Gucci!)

Woodgrain tippin', ace of spades bottle sippin'
Big racks, I don't count 'em
I tell them niggas keep flippin'
Put that money on the table, like casino
And you be the star in the movie, Al Pacino, boy you be Nino
Bosses who pay the cost for all of they losses
And them cars that be suicide with them speed of them horses
And them shoes, they be gators
 now or laters
 red bottoms, matching Gucci 
For them niggas who pimpin', you gon be breaking me off
Private charter flights nigga, have you shipping me off
Whipped cream, licking me off
You gon be wiping me down
And you can tell them ugly bitches, that the queen back in town
Yeah
Say you wanna know me
First, you gotta show me
How much you want it?
How much you need it?
How much you want it?
How much you need it?
Say you wanna know me
First, you gotta show me
How much you want it?
How much you need it?
How much you want it?
How much you need it?

Baby bad to the bone, boyfriend left her home alone
Took her keys and now she gone
Can't blame  lil shawty 
Diamonds thick, super cool
Mouth wet as a swimming pool
I think all the women choose
Cause they know I'm super smooth
My girl hang with your girlfriends, so I just smash your girlfriends
Never really were friends, so ain't no love lost then
I'm not a rapper turned actor, I'm a trapper turned rapper
Every day in my hood, an episode of Fear Factor
Seen your girl hanging out at the club and I snatched her
Smashed her, and Imma call that the next chapter
She like being with me cause my cars go faster
Telling all your business, and I ain't even asked her
(It's Gucci!)
Say you wanna know me
That you gotta show me
How much you want it?
How much you need it?
How much you want it?
How much you need it?
Say you wanna know me
That you gotta show me
How much you want it?
How much you need it?
How much you want it?
How much you need it?Embed
