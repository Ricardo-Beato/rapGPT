4 ContributorsNowhere to Go Lyrics
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go

Childish Gambino
I'm trying to hold my liquor
A vomit stain on my t-shirt
A sick boy but getting sicker
I don't really wanna take another marijuana
But I do it 'cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a goner

I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to goYou might also like1Embed
