20 Contributors5 Oâ€™Clock Lyrics
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest
It's (Five o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death (Uh)
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress (Yeah)
But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chest (Haha)

The streets empty 'round five o'clock (Uh-huh)
Driving by the cops (Chyeah)
Low key microscopic to the eyes that watch (Uh-huh)
Everything a hustle when you trying come buy some guap
I'ma keep grinding 'till I'm shining like a diamond watch (Uh-huh)
Me and Bo-head bringin' you the truth (Truth)
With all night sessions we just living in the booth (Yep)
Strong bars like we spittin' out hundred-fifty proof
Take shots, get loose (Oh), 'til you spittin' up yo' food (Oh), like, "Oh"
You see that? I'ma need a recap
Grab a weed sack, chief that 'til my feet flat
I got this covered like a Pro Bowl D-back
Breathe rap and I been known to make the beat clap (Haha)
Need cash so I'm tryin' move some trees fast
Tell you where the meat at, ask you where the cheese at (Yo)
People 'round the city see the youngin and respect the grind (Oh)
Puttin' in the extra time (Oh), guaranteed next to shine
You might also like
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest
It's (Five o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chest

I rise before the sun come up and get my day started (Chyeah)
Pray to the most high, I roll up my haze and spark it
And then my paper starts to roll in
Money in paper bags, hammers with laser tags
We grown men
Out on the corner 'till the early morn'
The blood of a hustler getting mines before I was born
You get scorned by these hot-ass bars
From me and Easy Mac
Crusin' in the 'Lac smoking weed with no seeds in that (No seeds)
There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us (Why?)
Except these labels anticipating and waiting on us
They get the BBS's, radios play us
Then we blaze in the Benz's
And sit this off on BBS's
And from P.A. to Texas
These niggas know about me
International hustler can't move no snow without me
Or get no dough without me
Niggas gettin' they stacking on
Early bird get the worm
I'm out here at the crack of dawn
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest
It's (Five o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress
But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chestEmbed
