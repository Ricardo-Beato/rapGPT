(Cardo got wings)
Now we cookin' up, hey
Yeah

Leave her in the past, but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her

Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone (Yeah, ayy)

Sorrow and sadness next to me
Old hoes see that I'm on, so they textin' me
Ex-bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story, it's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs, not the best thing
The devil tryna test me I'm failing, inhaling

You took it all back
All that heartbreak that was a year ago
Wanted you back so bad, but that's
You might also like
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

What you don't seem to understand is
You really took my love for granted
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish
Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
That I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts, baby, looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep, I've been feeling like a night owl
Music turnt up, neighbors telling me to pipe down
On the other hand, I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me, so it get lonely at night, ayy

I hope her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be

Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Leave her in the past, but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her26Embed
