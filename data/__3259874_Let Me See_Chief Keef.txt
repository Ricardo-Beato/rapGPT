Let me see if I can find some change up in my pocket
Work all out so I gotta restock it
Pussy ain't good but I act like I like it
Let me see if I can find a fuck to give, slightly
Fire comin' out the pipe, lookin' like some lightnin'
In that foreign four door with a couple vikings
Let me see if I can roll this blunt while I'm drivin'
Let me see if I can drop the top while I'm ridin'

Let me see if Louis got these flops in my size
Let me see if these niggas gon' jock my attire
Let me see if Gucci got this top in my size
The only thing I got is my Glock and my pride
Wet his block up and let me see is he gon' slide
Light the car up and let me see is he gon' ride
We can have a threesome, let me see if she don't mind
We can have a meeting but let's see if Keef on time
I don't need no shooter, I'ma shoot for me and mine
Ain't shit changed, bitch, I'm shootin' every time
Let me see if I feel like sellin' you a line
Let me see if these gangstas is really droppin' dimes (let's get it)

Make that money, bitch (let me see)
What you workin' with? (let me see)
What you twerkin' with? (let me see)
Fuck who you in here with (let me see)
We in this Maybach, bitch (let me see)
Pull them curtains, bitch (let me see)
These real fuckin' diamonds (let me see)
And you know that bitch (let me see)
Make that money, bitch (let me see)
What you workin' with? (let me see)
What you twerkin' with? (let me see)
Fuck who you in here with (let me see)

Pull them curtains, bitch (let me see)
These real fuckin' diamonds (let me see)
And you know that bitch (let me see)

Ridin' up in that snowgo, let me see if this store closed
Throwin' bands in this, go go, Louis Vuitton polo
Ridin' up in this pogo, switch gears like gogo
I just smoked like 3 ounces, finna roll up 4 more
Shoppin' out in NoHo, bad bitch named Coco
Smokin' Def yeah nigga So So, livin' fabulous, nigga Loso
Goin' 200 from the popos, 200 smokin' on dope smokes
Hit a pothole on a Low Pros, sneak diss, you so bold
Just iced out a new logo, ain't givin' no free promo
These fuckin' rappers is homos, been off the porch for so long
They ain't ridin' with me then so long, stick in the Glock and it's so long
Pipes on the car, they so long, like (skrt, skrt) bitch, hold on
