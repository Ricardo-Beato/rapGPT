8 ContributorsGOIN BACK DOWN Lyrics
I just about got the airport mapped out
Flights going in and they going back out
Time flies when you bullshitting at the house
Tryna make sense of your thoughts and your doubts
When I get high, I end up
Thinkin' 'bout things I don't wanna think about
So I'ma hit it twice and I send it back 'round
Gettin' paid for what used to get me sat down
My pops didn't like when I used to act out
Now the whole world wanna see me act out, ayy
Think it's something missing, tryna get it back now
Child that was in me might be kidnapped now
Me and my bro only getting one go
In the cap, then the gown, at least for right now

School nights turned into getting patdowns
Out front the club with the ones who got the torch passed down, passed down
Same way they pass the cognac 'round
Same way they pass the cognac 'round
Yeah, we did this last night
And I think it might be goin' back down
Oh yeah, I think it's goin' back down
Bitch, it's goin' back down
I didn't know that we were goin' that route
If I did, then I would've chilled out
I would've held back 'fore it all went south
Baby, I ain't know that I was gon' blackout
But I'm fucked up now
But I'm fucked up now
But I'm fucked up now
You might also like
My vices multiplied in the last three-six-five
I can't get carried away
But this bottle that we sharin' just between the two of us
Got me wanting to get married today, so I'ma keep goin'
It's a rude awakening like they leaf blowing
Outside, when I wake up and my mouth dry, it's
'Bout noon and she layin' next to me
When I went to sleep, I ain't calculate the down side, but it's cool
My homegirl got a full scholarship
But she still feel like she wanna call it quits
She don't wanna go to school, she wanna feel somethin'
But if she turn it down, the world gon' make her feel dumb
Throwing money with the ones I got the deal from
I think it's funny how

School nights turned into getting patdowns
Out front the club with the ones who got the torch passed down, passed down
Same way they pass the cognac 'round
Same way they pass the cognac 'round
Yeah, we did this last night
And I think it might be goin' back down
Oh yeah, I think it's goin' back down
Bitch, it's goin' back down
I didn't know that we were goin' that route
If I did, then I would've chilled out
I would've held back 'fore it all went south
Baby, I ain't know that I was gon' blackout
But I'm fucked up now
But I'm fucked up now
But I'm fucked up nowEmbed
