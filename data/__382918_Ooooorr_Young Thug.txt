Hoodrich
Yeah, it's Thugger
Roll the weed up
I'm in a Maybach
Haha, yeah (Swamp Izzo!)

Labels keep calling me back and forth
When I get the messages, I call back some more
Bet a hundred k, watch it score
And if these free bricks fly, I'm flying for her
And I put my ice on her, she said "Baby, I'm anemic"
I'm like, "I'm anemic too, a Neiman Marcus shopper"
We fly, helicopter
(In five, four, three, two, we out of here, huh)

E.T. phone home I'm long gone
My blunts are long and strong
I hate clones, please send them home
'Fore I put two in they dome (Blap, blah)
Fuck what you're saying, I'll murk ya, boy
Fuck making them leave when you can whip the boy
Anything you want, I'll serve you, boy
Because Big got cocaine and Willie got boy
And my whole crew eating 'round here
Ever since the day that I been bleedin' 'round here
You want to stay? You got your feet around here
Big Duck, please kick your feet up 'round here
You might also like
Labels keep calling me back and forth
When I get the messages, I call back some more
Bet a hundred k, watch it score
And if these free bricks fly, I'm flying for her
And I put my ice on her, she said "Baby, I'm anemic"
I'm like, "I'm anemic too, a Neiman Marcus shopper"
We fly, helicopter
(In five, four, three, two, we out of here, huh)

I'm a Sak's 5th, Lennox Mall, Neiman Marcus shopper
LV, double G, D&G popper
Big money whopper, Lil' money stopper
All pockets gay (Okay), them bitches on pasta (Hoodrich)
Oops I mean partners, 50's mixed with 100's
Gucci bag for my bitch (Just for my bitch), just know I copped
And them niggas you see me with (Ayy), just know they watchin' (Yuh)
So all you do is watch us, no stopper
We roll 30 deep (Yuh), big chopper (Brrat)
And your main ho keep watchin'
This ho keep walkin' up on a player, bitch I'm Capo (Yuh)
She said "I heard you are" - let's go, Wells Fargo

Labels keep calling me back and forth
When I get the messages, I call back some more
Bet a hundred k, watch it score
And if these free bricks fly, I'm flying for her
And I put my ice on her, she said "Baby, I'm anemic"
I'm like, "I'm anemic too, a Neiman Marcus shopper"
We fly, helicopter
(In five, four, three, two, we out of here, huh)
They call me Kumite if you didn't know
Ain't shit change but a different ho
Photoshoot fresh, oh they be
He better catch up, I'm a sight to see
I'm so fly, they call me Speed Racer
Niggas try to be me, erase ya
Y'all flexin' ass people better stay liftin'
While I'm changin' up these whips, y'all lookin' crazy
I can't help myself, I do this every day
I'm a hood icon, nigga anyway
I put the swag, in the talk
Give me credit, it ain't my fault

Labels keep calling me back and forth
When I get the messages, I call back some more
Bet a hundred k, watch it score
And if these free bricks fly, I'm flying for her
And I put my ice on her, she said "Baby, I'm anemic"
I'm like, "I'm anemic too, a Neiman Marcus shopper"
We fly, helicopter
(In five, four, three, two, we out of here, huh)11Embed
