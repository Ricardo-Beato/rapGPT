26 ContributorsRichest Nigga in the Room Lyrics
Huh
Yeah
Burr
Huh
It's Guwop

I was hustlin' before I came up out the womb
Now look at me, the richest nigga in the room
I was hustlin' before I came up out the womb
Now look at me, the richest nigga in the room
Richest nigga (Burr), richest nigga, richest nigga
I'm the richest nigga (Burr), richest nigga, richest nigga (Richest)
I was hustlin' before I came up out the womb
Look at me, I'm the richest nigga in the room (Room)

'89, '96, 2002
I was sellin' dope before they thought that shit was cool
I was the brokest damn nigga in the school
Remember they was laughin' at me, pointin' at my shoes
Back, back in '92 I was a social recluse
'96, I bought me a Caprice coupe
Shot it to the first nigga, sold me a deuce
Yeah, the first nigga sold me a deuce

I was hustlin' before I came up out the womb
Now look at me, the richest nigga in the room
I was hustlin' before I came up out the womb
Now look at me, the richest nigga in the room
Richest nigga (Burr), richest nigga, richest nigga
I'm the richest nigga (Burr, burr), richest nigga, richest nigga (Richest)
I was hustlin' before I came up out the womb
Look at me, I'm the richest nigga in the room (Room)

2002, I was wild as hell (Wild as hell)
Trapper and a rapper, I'ma sign myself (Sign myself)
A lotta people didn't believe time would tell
Had this dark-skin girl, she was fine as hell (Yeah)
Twenty-two years old, ninety days in jail
The only thing I'm tryna do is buy a red Chevelle
This money on my head 'cause I robbed a well (Robbed a well)
Burned all my bridges, time to sink or swim
You's a man or a mouse, hammer head or brim?
Bitch, I'm a hard head 'cause I'm hard to kill
They say Gucci Mane's a cutthroat, he probably is
He'll rob, steal and kill and he probably will
They say Gucci Mane's a jackboy, he probably is
He'll rob, steal and kill and he gone off them pills (Gucci)
I was hustlin' before I came up out the womb
Now look at me, the richest nigga in the room
I was hustlin' before I came up out the womb
Now look at me, the richest nigga in the room
Richest nigga (Burr), richest nigga, richest nigga
I'm the richest nigga (Burr, burr), richest nigga, richest nigga (Richest)
I was hustlin' before I came up out the womb
Look at me, I'm the richest nigga in the room (Room)

Look at me, I'm the richest nigga in the room, room (Huh?)
Man, you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back (Ziggy)
I'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
Man, you know I fuck with Mike WiLL, we go way back (Mike WiLL)
Now they screamin' trap back, nigga, Gucci Mane back, nigga6Embed
