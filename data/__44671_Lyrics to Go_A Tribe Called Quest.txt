Lyrics to go (Lyrics to go)

Goin' on and on to the rhythmic variation (Uh)
Wakin' in the morning, I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation, please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the drum sensation (Right, uh)
Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on, so I cause communication
Bogle at the party, then you got the bogle-ation (Uh)
Decapitatin' foes, yo, as if my name was Jason (Come on)
Makin' all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic, and it's over (Original, uh)
A Tribe Called Quest, we on the run for whatever (Right)
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor (Come on)
Brothers know my steelo, it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her (Yeah)
Silly with the microphone, in other words, I'm loco
Six-foot-zero with my height, complexion cocoa (Uh)
Representin' on the mic, it seems to be my daily (Right)
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey (Uh)
But when it comes to days like this

(It's like that)

I know it's been two years, but see, the Tribe was never fallin' (Uh)
Would have tried for singin', but that stuff was not my callin' (Right, uh)
The mic is in effect, so you know I'm never stallin'
Walkin' through the door and all them suckas started haulin'
Talk a lot of trash, but no one can seem to beat it (Uh)
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it (Uh)
The MCs, they get jelly when the girlies rub my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly (Bust a rhyme)
Today's a hip-hop draft, will I be top-seeded? (Uh)
Worked too frickin' hard while all the rest were gettin' weeded
Steady kickin' styles so I can reach that other level (Uh)
Don't worry about gettin' gassed, I push the pedal to the metal
Always wanted this 'cause it surely beats a scramble (Right)
I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? (Mmm)
This I dedicate to all the honeys that be bogle-in' (Come on, come on, come on)
'Cause at the end of the night, you know Malik will have his Trojans (Uh)
But when it comes to nights like this

Please proceed with caution 'cause the lyricist is fatal (Uh)
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato (Yes, dread, uh)
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh (Right)
Calm and serene like the study was Tao
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease, I defeat organisms (Come on)
That are waitin' in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters (Uh)
Quitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tanglin' my cord with hopes that I'll stop rockin'
Never will that happen, only if it is permitted (Uh)
Wait, I think somebody shitted (Come on)
I guess that would be me 'cause I'm the only one emceein' (Right)
I go for what I know, doin' a show for human beings
Always try to lead, yo, never will I follow
Blowin' up the spot like Fred did to Rollo
And when it comes to days like this
