Look at me Lee
I got it
Takeover
Come look at me Lee, I'm a star
These people love me man
I got it
These people love me
McFly-High

I come from Cleveland, y'all can really hear it now
Hit 'em like comic books, kaboom, pow-pow
Into a girl's mind, spit fine; no wine, dine
I keep two phones, sidekick for bad dimes
And a topical question is why I'm so chill
Girls don't understand, "He ain't even made a mill"
They say I'm Complex just like the magazine
I wear my closet Complex like the magazine
I get in their head
They don't even see my bread
Oh so, oh so fly
Cool as I wanna be, one hell of a guy
I keep 'em short and sweet, thick and petite
Ridin' alongside in my Cutlass Supreme
I'm from a place where old-schools are common (Yep-yep)
Gotta explain every time I'm rhymin' (I be) I be
You might also like
I be all day rollin' in my whip
Got my sippy cup out on the low (Uh-huh, hey)
I keep two pretty women by my side
I'm cooler than a polar bear's toes, and I say
Cleveland is that (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is my, my city (Wow)

Yup-yuppers, smile all the time while
I chop it up like Michael Watt's slow talk style
So the girlies can really catch all my accent
And the double-O got our own accent
Some niggas sell drugs to provide for they fam
Some niggas sell CDs up out they trunk, man
Some niggas they go to school for that higher learnin'
I play the O'Jays, while I'm turnin' lanes
We be on our shit
Freakin' Black & Milds, still controllin' the whip
Ain't no city like Cleveland
Cruisin' with my bad bitch in the evenin'
You wanna know exactly why I'm this way?
Take a trip to the land, swing this way
After the song done, ain't much I can say (Yup-yup)
Cleveland is my city (Yup-yup)
I be all day rollin' in my whip
Got my sippy cup out on the low (Uh-huh, hey)
I keep two pretty women by my side
I'm cooler than a polar bear's toes, and I say
Cleveland is that (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is my, my city37Embed
