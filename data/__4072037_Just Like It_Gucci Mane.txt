Hah (It's Gucci), hah (It’s Gucci, hah)
Real Zone 6, nigga, straight up

I look just like it
Diamond chains on, they bitin' (Uh, uh)
Choke you, can't breathe
Choker chain bitin’ like Tyson
Start with no keys (Skrrt)
I used to ride around with no license (Skrrt)
My diamonds on freeze
But the old me would rob Mike Tyson (Shut up, lay down)
Your bitch chose me
Got a cuff with no key but we solid (Probably 12)
Why the feds on me?
Didn't they hear on "Slippery" I'm nonviolent?
Damn chain still icy (Burr)
Still gamblin' at the 'partment, shootin' dices (Bet it, bet it)
I did kill Bill, I kill his ass in Volume 2 if he try me (I still will)
Do it for the culture
Do it for the vultures, not smilin' (Still trill)
The low life grinders
Give a fuck, I give a fuck, just like 'em (Still real)
Hotbox strike you
Livin’ life by the gun like a Viking (Baow, baow)
I know I’m not a lick (Hah)
But I know I probably look just like it (Huh? Wop)
You might also like
Lookin' just like it (Burr)
Not a lick, but I’m lookin' just like it (With all these damn chains)
I'm lookin' just like it
Sell a brick, hit a lick, yeah I’m lookin' just like it (With all these damn chains)
I'm lookin' just like it
Not a lick, but I know I'm probably lookin' just like it (With all these damn chains)
She lookin' just like it
Super thick, super lit, yeah she lookin' just like it (With all these damn chains)

Hot rifle (Draco)
Savage still ride with no license (21, facts)
Turned 19 (Yeah)
Bought a '79 Camaro with nitrous (On God)
Nigga, them facts (21)
Collier Ridge, nigga, I was sellin' that pack (On God)
Zone 6 niggas don't lack
Ridin' down Moreland Ave, nigga, I'm strapped (21)
Nigga, I pop it
Fifty cal on me so big, gotta jump out the car just to cock it
You don't want smoke, nigga, stop it
Y'all ain't got enough bodies (21)
Look like a lick, dare a nigga try to rob me
4L Gang, nigga killin' is a hobby
Nigga, you ain't hard, you just geekin' on molly
All these VVS's got me lookin' like Follies (21)
I'm on TV (21)
I used to sell dope at BP, yeah (21)
G-body Cutlass (G-body)
Sold QP's at the QT (Yeah, yeah)
I'll give your ass a hundred thousand if you find an SI
Nigga, these VV's (It's water)
Lookin' just like it
Walkin' lick but I keep the H-E-A-T (21, 21)
Lookin' just like it (Burr)
Not a lick, but I'm lookin' just like it (With all these damn chains)
I'm lookin' just like it
Sell a brick, hit a lick, yeah I'm lookin' just like it (With all these damn chains)
I'm lookin' just like it
Not a lick, but I know I'm probably lookin' just like it (With all these damn chains)
She lookin' just like it
Super thick, super lit, yeah she lookin' just like it (With all these damn chains)4Embed
