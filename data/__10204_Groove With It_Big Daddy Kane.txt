4 ContributorsGroove With It Lyrics
Swing, you get up and dance and do your own thing
Cause I got the groove to make your eardrums ring
And I bring this, to all the party people that demand most
Funky as Parliament, smooth as Luther Vandross
I wouldn't present myself to you as somethin that sound nervous
You want it to be live, so here it is at your service
The B the I the G the D-A-double-D-Y
And when it comes to rippin the mic, oh my oh my oh my
I guarantee you by time I'm through
You gotta give me more props than a Motown Revue
And if you thinkin this groove would ever come to an end
Hah, not from a hair off my chinny chin chin
 
For you to groove with it
You've got to move with it
Here's what you do with it
Now it's on you, kick it

Don't ya don't ya don't ya don't ya want
To feel jubilation, a musical vibration
Instead of the feel of paranoia
Thinkin to ride or break out and someone'll floor ya
Good grief, another beef at a concert
The rappers are gettin a rep behind the people that's gettin hurt
The way the fights at the shows are happenin
You might as well let Mike Tyson start rappin
You see we have to realize the main factor
Is to have peace and let the violence cease
So don't throw your fists up, unless you're gonna pump em
In the air, and scream oh yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
You might also like 

Check the lyrics that's flowin right over the tongue like a machete
My silk drawers are sweaty so you know the Kane is ready
To go to work and my job for the evening
Is to pick up the microphone and rap to relieve them
The party society, groovin in a high anxiety
There's dancers by the variety, so go 'head and try it G
As I do body work like Midas
And I can remove the slightest, case of arthritis
Or even rhumabotosis as I heal you with the rhythm
Cause the remedy for the party people standin around is ummm
Dancin and havin a ball
So live life like Michael Jackson, Off the Wall
And wiggle your bodyparts, and start to party hard
Lettin the rhythm run through like a trolley car
Here's a sound you can get into
Uhh, and now it's on you
 
Right right
Now just hold on for a second baby
I gotta put my shades on for this
Yeah, we gonna keep this here broken down for a while
And just toss it up like a French salad, yaknahmsayin?
Umm, aiyyo Bob I need you to pump that bass to the FULLEST
Hold on Mike, we gonna get to you in a second
Bret Lover I need you over here on the side of me for a minute
Ahh, I want you to get a little piece of this here, okay baby?
