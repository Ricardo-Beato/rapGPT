16 ContributorsChild Support Lyrics
Buucker, I'll beat yo' bad-ass
 2x
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
They siblings
Nuthin but my chil'ren
One shot they disappearin'

Bitch niggas
Still wanna check my urine
Still can't believe
What you see and what you're hearin'
You motherfuckers
Thought you knew the whole story
Until your mama
Took a nigga on maury
Read your test results
Are you the father
I looked at his bitch ass told him don't bother
I'm the father of this gangsta shit
Never thought that I have a bunch of bastard kids
Lil' bad-ass kids
I whoop they ass every night
Send the paramedics bitch
And the black and white
I brought you in this world
I'll take you out
Do you ugly
So mamma can't make you out
You know my style a colt
File a report
I'm a dead-beat daddy
No child support
You get fooled like the last trick
Get it out your ass bitch
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
C'mon!
You might also like
 4x
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch

Ya'll niggas know
Ya'll bitches know
Where you get it from
Who's the original
You got your daddy's mouth
Talk like a criminal
Keep it gangsta son
Never get pigeon holed
Rap bastards tryin' to make a classic
Keep your dumb-ass out of the casket
Cause intercope'll spend your money
They don't give a fuck
About a dead rapper
Nigga they'll chop it up
Keep it movin' y'all
They'll come mop it up
Corrupt LAPD cover up
Everyday nigga we know drama
They ain't lookin' for Osama
Ask Biggie's mamma
Thank God that the gangsta's back
We ain't got to put up with this brainless rap
May your lungs collapse n' m.c's are funny
All you can rap about is pussy and money
C'mon!


All y'all rappers should kiss and make up
Take your bullshit jewlry back to Jacob
Get your mind right nigga
And start to wake up
Cause the whole rap industry needs to shake up
You got million dollar niggas killin' million dollar niggas
Bustin' outta Bentleys
Wearin' chinchillasss
There you go again rollin' in your limo
Comin' from the Grammy's shootin' out the window
I know the scripture
But there's something wrong with this picture
What you mad about
Diamonds all in your mouth
No car, no niggas house paid off
I never heard of a rapper gettin' laid off
Boy, you a fool
Or you just act crazy
Or you a grown crack baby born in the 80's
To all you motherfuckers say I went Hollywood
I'm a gangsta
I know when I got it good


 2x
Young rappers lookin' for pocket change
With boo-boo lyrics
Go get your diaper changed

Smell like shit
Heyy baby change this motherfucker
You smell like shit2Embed
