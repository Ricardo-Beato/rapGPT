26 ContributorsPanorama City Lyrics
I built this empire off rebellion
Niggas seem to have a problem with what I be sellin'
All I got is dope and I just make the world inhale it
Bitch, I am the GOAT, you're blind as fuck if you can't tell it
I dropped out of school so I could focus on my mission
Principal is callin', Mama sayin' that I'm missin'
I check in to homeroom and then after that I'm ditchin'
Start off bumpin' Dirty Dozen in my fuckin' system
Mom and Dad would look at me and knew my mind was missin'
I look in the mirror, my reflection was my bestie
That's just how it was since crystal took my nigga Jesse
It's me against the planet, motherfuckers gon' respect me
Shit, but I ain't trippin', got a mighty reflex
Stronger like I'm a feisty T-Rex
Mobbin' the streets with a white T 3X
The mic is 'bout to be how I relieve stress
Niggas blowin' up left and right and it might be me next

Motherfucker, look me in the eyes
And you can see it's no surprise
That I've been livin' like there isn't a tomorrow
All I got is grindin' on my mind
Middle finger to the sky
Fuck the planet or you'll end up with your heart broke
You might also like
In Panorama City, nigga!
You know where to find me at
You know where to find me at
In Panorama City, nigga!
You know where to find me at
You know where to find me at
In Panorama City, nigga!

Before the paper
Way before these groupies ran the world and caused the vapors
I was rockin' fat Osirisâ€™s out with the skaters
Vandalizin' spots until security would chase us
Young and fuckin' clueless as the homies that surround me
Doin' hoodlum shit they got me locked up in the county
Fights are poppin' left and right, these motherfuckers rowdy
They gon' whoop my ass if they find out I'm from the Valley
My whole crew is cocky, homie, nobody could stop us
Chillin' on Tobias Avenue sippin' horchata
Shootin' pellet guns at cars until we saw the coppers
Once we got confronted we would lie and say it's not us, gotcha
A decade later I only grew worse
Niggas say they hate me, that's cool, I hated you first
The truth hurts, I guess it's just a few perks
From all my crazy mood spurts
The power of my mind can fuckin' move earth
Motherfucker, look me in the eyes
And you can see it's no surprise
That I've been livin' like there isn't a tomorrow
All I got is grindin' on my mind
Middle finger to the sky
Fuck the planet or you'll end up with your heart broke

In Panorama City, nigga!
You know where to find me at
You know where to find me at
In Panorama City, nigga!
You know where to find me at
You know where to find me at
In Panorama City, nigga!
You know where to find me at
You know where to find me at
In Panorama City, nigga!
You know where to find me at
You know where to find me at
In Panorama City, nigga!

Find me in the P.C., baby!
Find me in the P.C., baby!
Find me in the P.C., baby!
You know where to find me
In Panorama City, nigga!4Embed
