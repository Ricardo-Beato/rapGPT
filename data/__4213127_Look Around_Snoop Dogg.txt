My nigga, what up, cuz? (Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin', man?)
What's up, though, my nigga? (My nigga, what's up?)
What's up, cuz?

I got a hundred thousand niggas with me
And the motherfuckin' police still fucking with me
But I don't give a fuck, nigga, come and deal with me
I'm acting stupid silly, my lil' bitch from Philly
She sent a nigga 20 G's, cheese through the mail
And now I'm fillin' up with L's, gotta keep a lawyer just in case you niggas tell
Probably squeal, nigga, probably will
Polly want a cracker, nigga, Polly wanna tell (Snitch)
I come from Poly High, nigga, where we rip and ride
And bust niggas, when we bust, it's a four-five
Right to your D-I-Z-ome
Click-clack, bang-bang, you're gone
I got homies that live on the hillside
And got killers that kill that live on the real side (Yeah)

When cuz roll deeper than a motherfucka
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When catch 'em sleeping, they got heaters
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When cuz roll deeper than a motherfucka
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When catch 'em sleeping, they got heaters
Look around, look around

You niggas better act right
'Cause all of mine are right here
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
Look around, look around
Yeah, you niggas better act right
'Cause all of mine are right here
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
Look around look around

You did it, shit it and fell back in it
Disrespect the set, now I gotta represent it
Yeah, motherfucker, I said and I meant it
Concentrated, convicted, crooked cops, they contemplate it
Tried to catch a nigga slippin', I had some bitches with me
I kept it Crippin', me and Whitney had to move swiftly
Onto the next song, we had to press on
I'm preachin' and teachin', nigga, learn this lesson
Me and my niggas, we be deep when we in the streets
Most likely on the creep, tryna find some freaks
Take 'em to the crib, lay 'em in between the sheets
And kick 'em out and talk bad 'bout them on these beats
I'ma tell you, cuz, see, it's a crazy world
And now you in the club kissin' on baby girl
You see them niggas there, they represent this here
So I suggest you shut the fuck up and disappear (Yeah)
When cuz roll deeper than a motherfucka
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When catch 'em sleeping, they got heaters
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When cuz roll deeper than a motherfucka
Look around, look around (Look around, y'all)
When catch 'em sleeping, they got heaters
Look around, look around

You niggas better act right
'Cause all of mine are right here
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
Look around, look around
Yeah, you niggas better act right
'Cause all of mine are right here
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)
(Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?)

Snoop Dogg, I'm a hell of a man
I got a carload of gangstas in this caravan
See them my niggas, I take care of 'em, man
Buying oils from them boys over there in Iran
And now the US nation, I mean the US hatin'
See, 'cause they know a nigga stackin' while he paper chasin'
And showing niggas how to get it, but legitimate
No more crumbs for you bums, fuck a little bit
We want the whole pot, and nigga, why not?
I guess another Black leader gotta get shot
Before y'all recognize, but I'ma wake you up
Shake you up, take my time, take you up, cake you up
And break bread with you
Feed you, fed you, chop game with you
And put you on a real team
'Cause rolling with Snoop Dogg, that's the American dream
You know what I mean? You know what I mean?1Embed
