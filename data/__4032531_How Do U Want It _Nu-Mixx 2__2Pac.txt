2 ContributorsHow Do U Want It (Nu-Mixx 2) Lyrics
Comin' up
A brother in the cash game

I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a brother wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, your hips have got me fiendin'
Body talkin' quick to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, plus the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin wish, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what my foes need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it
You might also like
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real

Tell me, baby, is it cool to touch?
I'm a man that you can trust, not just a fool in lust
Comin' to get you on the bus is so ironic
Exotic, on the verge of erotic
I'm hittin' switches on misses
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
My up and down like a roller coaster
Can I cum inside you?
I ain't stoppin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider
In and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alize
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
The players living Cali days
Delores Tucker, you a fake to me
Instead of tryin' to help a brother, wanna take his G's
Mistaking me for Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot tracks
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, try and top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in my cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I ain't giving up
Very wonder taught us all to cuss
Come on, tell me how you want it
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real

I was raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Say they bustin' off the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is gettin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
They wonder if my lifestyle's changed
And am I through with all the pain
Survivin' in this game, and still the same
Honey, just meet me at the strip club, bring the thong
Look how they shake it for that cash, once again it's on
I had no sympathy for those afraid of mystery
Come get with me, I promise passion and ecstasy
I'm alone, can I come over there tonight?
Depend on me to wanna handle it and get it right
Your body is bangin', baby, I love the way you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for realEmbed
