I'm Morgan Freeman
And I just wanted to take a moment out of my day
To inform every other rapper in the game that Logic is the G.O.A.T.​

Haha, ha, retired for what?
It's the birth of the black white boy
Retired for what? Logic never left
Retired for what? He just got tired of the garbage (Haha)
From you, you, you, and definitely you
For sure

Bar for bar, what you wanna do?You might also like1Embed
