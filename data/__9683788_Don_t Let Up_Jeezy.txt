7 ContributorsDonâ€™t Let Up Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League
Yeah
Let's go

Fucked over as youth, too much drama (Drama)
Grown man now, I'm still dealin' with the trauma (Damn)
Think somethin' wrong, can't feel my emotions (Woo)
Probably why my niggas can't feel my devotion (Damn)
Just touched down, heard **** killed Mike
I don't even think a nigga slept that night (Nah)
How I'm supposed to trust you when I can't trust me? (Me)
How you trust two, when you can't trust three? (Haha)
I got the whole world tellin' me a nigga ain't enough
Every chance they get, tryna put a nigga in some cuffs

It's rigged for us to lose, it's a set up (It's a set up)
If you fall, nigga, get up (Yeah), just don't let up
Young nigga, I know you fed up (Okay)
Just don't let up, just don't let up
Young nigga, I know you fed up
Just don't let up (What's up?), just don't let up
If you fall, nigga, get up (Get up)
Just don't let up, just don't let up
Rigged for us to lose, it's a set up
Just don't let up (Yeah), just don't let up (Let's go)

Better give this shit your all, they ain't set you up to win (Nah)
One wrong move, they gon' throw in the pen (Yeah)
The DEA wanna repo all your cars
The new DA wanna analyze your bars (Haha)
Must've heard Baby Worm say, "Ball Till You Fall" (Fall)
These niggas out here dyin' off the Fentanyl and all
Had to pray for Young Slime 'cause that boy goin' through it (Yeah)
Pray for Lucci too, that plea deal wasn't congruent (Nah)
Way to make your bed, hold your head, young nigga
I ain't gotta say shit, 'nough said, young nigga (Yeah)

It's rigged for us to lose, it's a set up (It's a set up)
If you fall, nigga, get up (Yeah), just don't let up
Young nigga, I know you fed up (Just don't)
Just don't let up, just don't let up
Young nigga, I know you fed up
Just don't let up (What's up?), just don't let up
If you fall, nigga, get up (Get up)
Just don't let up, just don't let up
Rigged for us to lose, it's a set up (Get up)
Just don't let up (Yeah), just don't let up (Let's go)

Just don't let up
Just don't let up
Ooh, ooh
Just don't let up
Just don't let up
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
