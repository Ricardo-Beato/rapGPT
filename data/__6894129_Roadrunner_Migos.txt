56 ContributorsRoadrunner Lyrics
Whoa
You know what I'm saying?
Niggas done forgot about this shit, mane, uh
These niggas trippin', uh
Zaytoven

(Hey)
Maison Margiela, I'm dripping, I'm stepping
They know that I'm repping my gang (Gang)
Wockhardt, the Perky, the Addy
I'm mixing the dope, I got dope in my chain (Dope)
Supercharged all of my cars, and I'm going to Mars (Skrrt)
And this money ain't changed (Mars)
Took off my top, I'm exposing the brain
I got young niggas ready to stain (Grrah)
Told a bad bitch, “Don't speak” (Woo)
Left a waterfall on the sheets (Hey)
Paintings on the wall, Mona Lisa (Mona)
Switch my ho by the week (Sore)
Bring my flame to the street
Fuck her in the throat
Keep my name out the street (Eugh)
Runnin' to the bank, track meet (Bank)
Bricks in the truck, Road Runner, beep beep (Beep beep)
You might also like
Don't give a fuck if a bitch is a nun (Nun)
Shе sucking me numb, til' I go to sleep (Numb)
Woke up and told myself I am thе don (Don)
Then bought me a Dawn, that shit wasn't cheap (Woo)
Nah, nah, ain't givin' no ones (Nah)
I got a lil' stick, and the arm with a reach (Pa, pa, pa, pa)
Trap out the wide body Jeep (Wide body)
You already know 'bout the robotic key (Robotic)
Ran out of thunder, the trap doing numbers (Number)
Burn out the 'Cat, but I serve in the Honda (Burn out)
Saving my money, my vision was tunnel (Woo)
Remember I thought that a hundred was something
I chose the streets and it's hurting my momma (My momma)
I heard the beat and the millions start comin'
I had no money, been locked in the jungle (No money)
I drive the coupe and it's not in the summer (Uh, uh)
Back against the wall, they abandoned a G (Back 'gainst the wall)
The Za' it keep tasting like candy to me (Za Za)
Thotty can fuck on my man and then me (Thot, thot)
Porta potty the opp, you smell the degree (Stain)
The block, the Nawf is embedded in me (Nawf)
Leave him hot, he got hit with the cut in his sleep (Cut)
I pay a dub to my brother, let's eat (Dub)
Bought my bitch a new Urus and buttered the seats
(Hey)
Maison Margiela, I'm dripping, I'm stepping
They know that I'm repping my gang (Gang, my gang)
Wockhardt, the Perky, the Addy
I'm mixing the dope, got dope in my chain (Dope, my chain)
Supercharge all of my cars, and I'm going to Mars (Skrrt)
And this money ain't changed (Mars, money ain't change)
Took off my top, I'm exposing the brain
I got young niggas ready to stain (Rrah)
Told a bad bitch, “Don't Speak” (Woo)
Left a waterfall on the sheets (Hey)
Paintings on the wall, Mona Lisa (Mona)
Switch my ho by the week (Sore)
Bring my flame to the street
Fuck her in the throat
Keep my name out the street (Eugh)
Runnin' to the bank, track meet (Bank)
Bricks in the truck, Road Runner, beep beep (Beep beep)

Demon in the Gladiator Jeep (Skrrt)
Low key movin' in the streets (Low key)
Bulletproof trucks in the fleet (Rrraow)
Mafia ties too deep (Go)
I cut the inside of the Mercedes, I'm crazy (Go)
Don't trap in one spot, we'll switch the location (Switch)
Ordered it up and it came with some gravy (Brrr)
Bigger the bails, better come with the payment (Uh)
Ain't nothin' just the Nawf side, Nawf (Nawf side)
Top floor sittin' like a boss (Top)
Brrt, there go the call (Brrt)
Dominos, them niggas fall (Uh)
Behind the back, double the cross
No, I'm not talkin' 'bout dribble the ball (I'm tellin' ya)
We buckin' that shit on the law (We buckin')
Yo Gotti, the way we get off (Yo Gotti)
From the beginning (Beginning)
We had the talent to win it (Soo)
Protectin' the business (Go)
I'm buying the block new extensions (Buying the block)
You can not walk in my J's, you kiddin'
You will be finished (You niggas bitches)
Hustle mentality, Mamba mentality
Scrape every dollar and penny (Uh)
Maison Margiela, I'm dripping, I'm stepping
They know that I'm repping my gang (Gang, my gang)
Wockhardt, the Perky, the Addy
I'm mixing the dope, I got dope in my chain (Dope, my chain)
Supercharge all of my cars, and I'm going to Mars (Skrrt)
And this money ain't changed (Mars, money ain't change)
Took off my top, I'm exposing the brain
I got young niggas ready to stain (Rrah, ooh)
Told a bad bitch, “Don't Speak” (Woo)
Left a waterfall on the sheets (Hey)
Paintings on the wall, Mona Lisa (Mona)
Switch my ho by the week (Sore)
Bring my flame to the street
Fuck her in the throat
Keep my name out the street (Eugh)
Runnin' to the bank, track meet (Bank)
Bricks in the truck, Road Runner, beep beep (Beep beep)

Big stones, it's a waterfall leak (Leak)
I never been a clone, it's only one of me
When I slide, when I ride, keep the fire under me (Fire)
Niggas in the street don't think shit's sweet (Sweet)
Your bitch act right, I give her a treat (Treat)
Chrome Heart jeans and Patek Phillipe (Ice)
She want a Birkin, I tell her go work it (Work)
She ain't gon' sit there and get it for free (Nah)
Lil' bitty bitch, she petite (She is)
Thinking 'bout taking her home with me (I might)
She hop in the coupe and get to frowning her face
'Cause she talkin' 'bout the Za Za stink (Ew)
My ice came from Elliot
No not the water that's outta your sink (No)
Got so many Ks, Confederate
Don't think about touching on my Cuban link (Brrr)
I got the gang in ink
All of my bro's gon' stain for me (Stain)
I flood the gang with chains
'Cause I know that they won't change on me (Never)
Me and the coupe, that's a couple (Coupe)
I throw the racks in the duffle (Cash)
I gotta ride with a cutter
Styro the cup, and it gotta be double (Drank)

Maison Margiela, I'm dripping, I'm stepping
They know that I'm repping my gang (Gang, my gang)
Wockhardt, the Perky, the Addy
I'm mixing the dope, got dope in my chain (Dope, my chain)
Supercharge all of my cars, and I'm going to Mars (Skrrt)
And this money ain't changed (Mars, money ain't change)
Took off my top, I'm exposing the brain
I got young niggas ready to stain (Oh)
Told a bad bitch, “Don't Speak” (Woo)
Left a waterfall on the sheets (Hey)
Paintings on the wall, Mona Lisa (Mona)
Switch my ho by the week (Sore)
Bring my flame to the street
Fuck her in the throat
Keep my name out the street (Eugh)
Runnin' to the bank, track meet (Bank)
Bricks in the truck, Road Runner, beep beep (Beep beep)2Embed
