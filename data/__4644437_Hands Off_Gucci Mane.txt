Huh

Hands off of you (Yeah)
I can't keep my hands off of you (Her)
Hands off of you (You)
I can't keep my hands off you
Hands off of you (Huh)
I can't keep my hands off of you (Right now)
Hands off of you (Beautiful, huh)
I can't keep my hands off you

Goddamn, you got a stance on you (Well, goddamn)
I know it's rude, I keep glancin' at you (I know it's rude)
You gon' make me spend them bands on you (She gon' make me spend them bands)
Birkin bag, let you cop 'em by the two (Go, by the twos? Go)
All these furs, Gucci, shame on you (All these furs)
All this water on me, I feel like a pool (A lot of water)
You got me hot, I'ma need a fan soon (Hot, hot, hot, hot)
All night sex, it's a full moon (Ooh, woo)

Hands off of you (Wow)
I can't keep my hands off you

I want you all for me, I know I'm selfish (Hah)
When you suck it with no hands, I feel so helpless (I'm selfish)
Tore my dawg's hands off of you because you're Percy
So all the purses that you rockin' must be Hermes (Hands off)
All my diamonds clear as day, they shit be matte green (Hermes)
So much designer every day, they call it tagging (Huh?)
You hear some rap cap in my rap, then come and smack me (It's Gucci)
Soon as my ho see Big Papa, she come attack me (No cap)

Hands off of you (Yeah)

Hands off of you (Her)
