First, we're affected by what we know
When I talk to the kids in high school classes, college classes, that's the first thing I tell 'em
Get the information while you're here
Like nothing worse than being stupid when you get out of school
So get the information, being broke is bad
But being stupid is what's really bad
And what's really, really bad is being broke and stupid

Uh, this the shit I dreamed about when I was only four
Sugar, water, mac and cheese, we were broke and poor (Yeah)
Court evictions, landlords never showed remorse
Now I'm in the building, when they greet me, they gon' hold the door (Yeah)
I never needed your acceptance, this is my destin'
I made devil's work and turned it into God's blessings
Can't knock me off the block, this is not Tetris
Life lessons, I learned tables turn, that's my assessment
They told me to be patient, but I need to flex (Woo)
I'm so famous, I can finally hit JAY-Z direct (Yeah)
I might hit up Drake and tell him to send me the jet (Shoo)
I might drink CÃ®roc with Puff if he send me a check (Word)
Lot of squares in my family, I could see the stress
Bunch of crabs in the bucket tryna eat my flesh
I ain't nothing like you niggas, I don't even rest
I don't sleep until I see success, I wish you the best (Joyner)
I ain't on no hating shit, I just wanna get rich (Word)
I don't do relationships, I don't wanna commit
Lot of bitches did me dirty, ain't talk to me since
And now I'm insecure, closed off, but that's hard to admit (Word)
I'm just thinking 'bout the days that were making me jealous
Can't rain on my parade when I'm made of umbrellas (Woo)
Fuck it, it don't faze me, I don't stay in my feelings
Thought money would change me, but it changed all my niggas (Facts)
I just bought a Lamborghini and painted the ceiling
I ain't bragging, I'm just happy I made me a million
ADHD, I was slow, now they label me brilliant
I'm proud of niggas like Hov, he made him a billion (Yeah)
I hope I never go broke tryna break through the ceilings
Fifty thousand on the low, I might make an appearance (Yeah)
This that shit that made them kids run away from they parents
Nigga, I'm breaking your spirit (Woo)
I told myself if I go out, then I'ma light my wrist (Boom)
If I die today, I'm happy for the life I live (Blah, blah)
And my son is only three, he be like, "Mama rich"
Told him go outside and play, just be inside by six (Ayy)
I done made my niggas proud, you ain't gotta love me
Give a fuck about your opinion, only God could judge me
I don't even write on paper, I just write on Tully (Woo)
I might hire an assistant, make her write it for me (Ayy)
This is me against the world, that's the mood I'm in (Goddamn)
Hop up out the fucking pussy like I'm new again (Woo)
I remember they was calling me a hooligan
In special education, I just might go back to school again, woah
Only hit it once, then I make her leave (Woo, woo)
We ain't cuddlin', I need some space to breathe (Woo, woo)
If she fuck me good, I let her stay 'til three (Woo, woo)
No, I'm not your man, but we can make believe
Okay, you got an ass, that don't mean a thing to me
Stop acting like a brat, bitch, I ain't Jermaine Dupri (Woo)
These pussy niggas talkin' 'bout what they gon' say to me
And they gon' beat me up, I told 'em that's some shit I'd pay to see
Stupid

And what's really, really bad is being broke and stupid
Nothing much worse than that unless you're sick
Like sick, broke, and stupid, that's
About as far as you can fall unless you're ugly, right?
But surely that would be the ultimate, right?
The ultimate negative life, ugly, sick, broke, and stupid

I turned my life into a movie, bitch, I think I'm Rocky
I can't even wear my jewelry now, they think I'm cocky (Ayy, ayy)
I know that I got myself if I ain't got nobody
Just bought a pistol, I just hope that it ain't got no bodies
You gon' have to pay the price if you get wishy-washy (Woo)
This a Talladega Night, I think I'm Ricky Bobby
My advice, quit the music, get a different hobby
All you lil' niggas sound the same, just a different copy, woah
And I bow my head and pray for this (Woo, woo)
Yeah, I spilled my guts and made a mess (Woo, woo)
Shit, I ran on Mars and made a wish
Yeah, I stand on cars like Jaden Smith (Yeah)
And I ball so hard, I sprained my wrist
If I shoot it, then I ain't gon' miss
Loyal nigga, so I ain't gon' switch (Woo)
Blew my money at the strippy, it don't make no sense
Broke and stupid, shit'll never be the same again
And what's really, really bad is being broke and stupid11Embed
