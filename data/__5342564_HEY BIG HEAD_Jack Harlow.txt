23 ContributorsHEY BIG HEAD Lyrics
Hey, big head
I'm locked in tryna' make this bread (Woo)
I can't keep on giving you time
I got cash to make instead (Cash)
She wanna fuck me one-on-one
We might run that train instead
Me and my friend just like twins
Same nutsack and the same dick head (What the fuck?)
Seen that bitch and we ain't impressed (Woo)
Thick brunette and she came from Lex
Phone got bugs and they ain't insects
Feds tuned in when I send my texts
Ain't nobody worried 'bout if I'm next
'Cause they know I'm next
I thank God, I know I'm blessed
I recall when you threw shade
I can let that shit go, I guess
I'm locked in, had to go out less
Everybody act like they know best (Know best)
Her boyfriend ain't fresh
Look like someone I'm gon' outdress
She’s so wet, had to hold my breath
Ain't hit since, she know I'm pressed (Fucked up about it)
Show my chest, let me flex, bitch (Ha)
In the flesh, got connects down in Texas (Woo)
Pussy juice, side of eggs, that's my breakfast
Sugar mama, 56, off of Craigslist (Ayy)
Can we have a threesome with your fuckin' best friend?
I ain't talking Florida when I say I'm destined
She ain't know my money taller than a Westin
Hotel, got your bitches checked in
Ex-chick salty just like Chex Mix (Uh)
Cop a plane ticket for my new chick once the check hits
I come from a city that is very much eclectic
But it's got another side to it that gets hectic
Shorty that I mess with got a friend that's a detective
She gon' run surveillance just to find out who I've slept with
All my jewelry gifted just like me, ain't bought a necklace
I'm not young and reckless, bitch, I'm cool, calm, and collected (Collected)
Flexin', I'm the one that she texting (Texting)
Lightskin from DC like the Redskins (Redskins)
These rappers falling off just like dead skin
I set trends, next up, no question (No question)You might also likeEmbed
