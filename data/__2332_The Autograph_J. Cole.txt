81 ContributorsThe Autograph Lyrics
Just turn the beat down just a little bit
Hey, yeah

They say anything's possible
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain’t stopping for the red lights
Look in my rearview, all I see is niggas' headlights
Catch me if you can ho, they try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you’ll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don’t you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas' ass, no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
Never imagined that the kids would want to be me man
Ay, could it be I give the hopeless broke kids hope?
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost
Simply had to approach, "What's up youngblood?"
Ay, ain't it strange?
A year ago today, my nigga, I was counting change
Yeah, hopping trains up in New York City
Know I gotta thank God, 'cause if you weren’t with me
Then I surely woulda died, you can throw the fork in me
This my New Year's resolution, dawg, no more pork in me
Uh, I ain't no Muslim though
Caron Butler, I’m a wizard if ya doesn't know
It's Young Simba, yeah, I’m ballin’ 'til the buzzer blow
You's tryna kick the shit I kick, man you gon' stub your toe
Boy that's just how tough I go, see this is my light work
This shit y'all callin' classic, I be like, "That might work"
Want you to feel something new, that's how a dyke work
They ask me 'bout pressure, they want to see my pipe burst
You might also like
Not tonight nigga
Ay, not tonight nigga
Yeah, hey
Man, man, hey

Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely
Never met a baby momma momma who don’t like me
Met a couple baby fathers though that wanna fight me
I hit it 'til she snooze like the news nigga, nightly
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me
Now she bitter with this nigga 'cause he ain't quite me
One thing's for certain baby girl, you are a wifey
Two things for fucking sure, I am not the husband though
So run back to him while you still can
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah, that's a real man
I was ashamed all along and I still am
We let the lust interrupt something real, damn
Well girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
I wouldn’t say that you a ho, just made a ho decision
And you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibition
We both know that's what you wanted girl, I know you listenin'

Hey
Girl, I know you listenin'
Uh, I know you listenin'
Hey, yeah
Shoutout to the bootleggers who supply my shit
The fans online tryna find my shit
And to them niggas listening but won't buy my shit
Then catch me in the street and wanna ride my dick
Y’all niggas is the worst, see me
Like, "J. Cole homie, could you sign my burnt CD?"
Nigga please, a album ten dollars, you act like it’s ten Gs
This food for thought cost the same as two No. 3s
So at ease with that broke shit
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit
You know I feel your pain, therefore I slang this hope shit
And give you lines that you rewind and think, "Oh shit"
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit
I give you that and then a whole lot more shit
That "got rich and still rapping like I’m poor" shit
You niggas think you know shit, man you don’t know shit

Ho bitch
Yeah, Cole, bitch
Uh, J. Cole, nigga
