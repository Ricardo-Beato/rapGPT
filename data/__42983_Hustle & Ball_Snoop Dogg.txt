They say money is the key to end all your woes
That's probably why I love it and can't stand them hoes
I chop trees with G's and take trips overseas
And pack a nine all the time and that's for all my enemies
What y'all thought, I can't get caught
It ain't my mothfucking fault they call mister seasoning salt
I'm bringing Gangsta shit to this No Limit click
I'm way down south in a house and I'm bangin this shit
I got gold around my neck that will never ever fade
Rolex watch on my wrist nigga getting paid
That's all I live fo , you dig it
Game is to be sold not to be told that what my nigga P said can you

While your bitch jocking me and clocking this doe
Boy that sound like the old Snoop Dogg, shit I'm trying to get paid
Papered up and trying to ball y'all feel me
Avoiding the snitches and the and the bitches too
And the fake ass snake ass niggas which is you nigga fuck you
I buck you you I stick you I stuck you
I love making that music that y'all niggas say y'all drugs to
