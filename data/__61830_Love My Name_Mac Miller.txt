9 ContributorsLove My Name Lyrics
This one right here, whew, this the one
Not you, bitch, the song (Haha)

Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name

I usually write rhymes in the BlackBerry
But I went back to the pen for this one (What?)
So I'ma let my fingers do the talkin'
And she probably what they talkin' bout (Uh-huh)
Girl, you got to listen (Uh)
I'm in this situation where you got me sittin' waitin'
And I'm losin' all my patience, I just need a vacation (Vacation)
Your friends all player-hatin' (What?)
'Cause I'm the one you always stay awake with (Uh-huh)
Then spend the day with, always wanna walk ya home
And you hate the way my day-to-day is on the road (It's okay)
Front row, know every single song
When she know she comin' home with me, she always bring her thong (Haha)
And bring her lingerie whatever mood she in
Put a movie in, got the lights dim
We gon' make love 'til the nights end (What?)
Have you callin' up ya friends like, "Ooh, I like him" (Haha)
You might also like
Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name

I know I take ya breath away, darling
Smooth playa, treat you like a princess (Uh-huh)
'Cause love tricky like parallel parking (Haha)
A business I won't invest
But I show interest in that slim waist of yours
And I smile when I see that pretty face of yours (What's up?)
Givin' you flavors that you ain't never taste before (Uh-huh)
We gon' make love 'til you achin' sore (Achin' sore)
And baby, don't worry, I'ma be rich
Name in the neon lights, haha (In the neon lights)
So how about you give me that kiss?
'Cause you don't wanna sleep tonight (Haha)
Your one night love, gon' get swept off ya feet
Yes, get undressed from your breast to ya feet (Breast to ya feet)
Light a cigarette just to stay awake
Liquor got us bangin' like a 808
Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name

Throw your hands up, people, party all night
Celebrate my name in the neon lights
Throw your hands up, people, party all night
Celebrate my name in the neon lights
Throw your hands up (You gon' love my name)
Throw your hands up (You gon' love my name)
Throw your hands up (You gon' love my name)
(You gon' love my name) Throw your hands up (Haha)

Baby, if I don't have money (What?)
Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (See the neon lights)
In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)
I know you gon' love my name2Embed
