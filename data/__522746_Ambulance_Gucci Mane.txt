15 ContributorsAmbulance Lyrics
Its gucci  im the fucking boss
I pull my pistol out to get my point across
A hundred becks and loud and im fucking off
5 thousand  thats alot of talk
Twenty box square yeah thats alot of soft
So many blocks in the shop it might make you drop
Ambulances ambulance so much you can't pass like hammer pants
Leave a pussy nigga with no chance so what he thinking with those hands

Fucking told you, shouldn't've fucking tested
Fucking moolies, its gucci!
Fucking told you man fucking test me
Its pain, its gucci!

Helicopter hovering, somebody please cover me
Public enemy number one against the goverment
All these haters mumbling but Gucci Mane not fumbling
Fell back down got up again I excel cause im excellent
Sipping hen I crack a grin, get a tat then start a trend
Baby gotta mumble booty gucci got a bubble bitch
I know thats your lady homie me and her are only friends
But don’t call this iPhone again I’ll get my goons to do you inYou might also like1Embed
