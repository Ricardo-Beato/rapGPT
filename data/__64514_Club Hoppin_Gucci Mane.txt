23 ContributorsClub Hoppin Lyrics
Started in Magic City, ended in Onyx
She fine and she goin' crazy, I'm throwing money
Compound to the velvet, I think I'm Elvis
I always keep green around me like I'm a Celtic
Kamals to the gold room I be bottle poppin'
20 grand all in hundreds, I'm going shopping
Rain to the blue flame bitch I get it poppin'
Come ride with the Gucci man, I'll take you club hoppin'

Baby, come fuck me with girl I'm going clubbin'
Thirties above the skirties but they ain't scrubbin'
Bottles, they keep you coming cause I be thuggin'
I'm feeling all on her titties, we kissing cousins
Blaze our way to the Libra, back to the Cheetah
You know the procedure when I be smoking reefer
My money is doing push-ups, is doing chin ups
I got vanished from Club Vanquish and went to Pin Ups
My diamonds, they're shining bright when they're in the light
In life on a Saturday night with a nigga's wife
Hundred bottles are hundred blunts cause I am a smoker
Good with me, I took a fifty and went to Strokers

Working, you know I'm working, you know I'm grindin'
Shinin', I'm throwing money, a king of diamond
Phantom, I got a Phantom, I think I'm handsome
Bad bitches on my tail, we gon' go to mansion
Cold, so I park the Rolls, and I got the Lambo
I'm ?, so I brought the ammo with me to ?
And I leave on the club ?
And Miami is my second home so I just bought a crib
Decked in cream, yeah, my whole team we about the green
I'm the man of these women's dreams, so I went to Dreams
I don't play on the club play on a Friday
Need a detox I smoking chronic like Dr. Dre


From the trap house to the Playhouse im in Los Angeles
From west coast all way to down south these bitches scandalous
In DC I fuck with Love and i fuck with Stadium
Money be doing flips like in a gymnasium
In New York, I'm in Perfections, I think I'm Diddy
A sinner but I’m a winner in sin city
Adrianna’s in Chi-Town, know I go to Factory
This money didn’t come quick I stacked it up gradually
Four ounces off in my soda ya..that’s the potion
Houston I’m on the drank when I’m off in Motion
Pandemonium in Pandemonium, i’m in Detroit
And I left there and took a private jet back to New York
