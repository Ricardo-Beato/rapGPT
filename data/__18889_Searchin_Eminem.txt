Ain't no one special (Special), special like you (You)
Ain't no one special (Special), special like you (You)
Ain't no one special (Special), special like you (You)
Ain't no one special (Special), special like you (You)

I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby

I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness and the snugglin' and teasin'
Missin' what I remember kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
Buggin' and wheezin', I'm havin' trouble when breathin'
It's even tougher when sleepin'
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'
For lovin' and leavin'
You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
That I'm strugglin' to keep in
Interrupt when I'm speakin'
I got some game that I'm preparin' to run (*Laughter*)
The way your lips sparkle, and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun
No matter what you're wearin', you stun
'Cause you're comparin' to none
I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust
When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you graspin' to trust
But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
I'm not askin' to rush and answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree, then repeat after me
"I love you" (I love you, baby)
'Cause I just need you to see
How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed
Your love's keepin' me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down
'Cause ain't nobody like you, nowhere to be found
You might also like
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
Baby, it's all on you, it's you I call on, boo
Let's set a date up, so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus
You can chill for dinner and breakfast
Time enough to see how this gentleman sexes
We'll start it off with caviar, Dom Pérignon
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see, nobody will hurry things
I got the Izze (Izze), the Bacardi and Hurricane
If daiquiris ain't in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tanqueray
You're an incredible one that's rare
I bet in edible underwear
You'll look impeccable, none compare
I dream of freakin' you, the woman that I'm speakin' to, squo
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do, so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say
Is when you step away, baby, look over in the négligée
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin', but you're the one I want in my life, baby

Ain't no one special (Special), special like you (You)
