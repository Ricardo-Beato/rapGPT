In the trap house we be slanging
Dope boys on the block slanging
J's want the dope so we slanging
Run up with the work we cut your fingers
Slanging, slanging, slanging, slanging
Dope boys on the block slanging
In the trap my nigga we be slanging
The J’s want the dope so we slanging
This one for my niggas that be slanging
In the trap trynna get rich, slanging
In the trap whipping a brick, slanging
Cooking and whipping a fish, slanging
Slanging, slanging, slanging, slanging, slanging
(Ooh) slanging, slanging, slanging (dope boy)
Slanging (trap house)

Gansta’ niggas twisting they fingers (ganstas) dope boys on the block and they slanging
I don’t do no loses, all my niggas they gaining
I got every foreign car my nigga you name it (skrtt)
We up in the game, my niggas not in the bleachers
Trapping and capping to 20 thousand a feature
Trapping famous amous, my niggas they be slanging
Pull out the pistol I put it in your mouth, you eating the chamber
You think that it’s a game, my bullets kickin liu kang (waaa)
When you in the trap can nobody know your real name (Chapo)
When you getting to the money niggas wanting your change
Nigga, I rather be rich I never wanted the fame
Penitentiary chances got me selling cocaine
I be shopping in the mall a couple thousand Balmain
When I’m done shooting the chopper, you gon’ need you a cane
Slang, slang, slang 50 thousand my ring (we slanging)

In the trap house we be slanging

In the trap my nigga we be slanging
The J’s want the dope so we slanging
This one for my niggas that be slanging
In the trap trynna get rich, slanging
In the trap whipping a brick, slanging
Cooking and whipping a fish, slanging
Slanging, slanging, slanging, slanging, slanging
(Ooh) slanging, slanging, slanging (dope boy)

You a fuck nigga, you ain’t banging young nigga
Word on the street you a single, my nigga
Talking to the fed you will bring in the pistol
Word on the street you a finger-fuck nigga
Niggas get close I will burn you like toast, and you know they
Saying Quavo be doing the most (doin the most)
Word on the street you be telling the folks, when we catch you in the hood we gon smoke you like a port
My money long, nigga your money short
Only finger-fuck going on is the dope
Got some tools in my house like it’s Amico
Got the plug pulling up on a cantaloupe post
She hit the rapper when she gonna choke
Then I told Carlito to come with some more
Some more Iggy Azalea, some more Kurtis Blow
Quavo meteorologist predict it’s gon’ snow
In the trap house we be slanging
Dope boys on the block slanging
J’s want the dope so we slanging
Run up with the work we cut your fingers
Slanging, slanging, slanging, slanging
Dope boys on the block slanging
In the trap my nigga we be slanging
The J’s want the dope so we slanging
This one for my niggas that be slanging
In the trap trynna get rich, slanging
In the trap whipping a brick, slanging
Cooking and whipping a fish, slanging
Slanging, slanging, slanging, slanging, slanging
(Ooh) slanging, slanging, slanging (dope boy)
Slanging (trap house)Embed
