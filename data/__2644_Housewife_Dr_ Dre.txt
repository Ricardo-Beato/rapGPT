71 ContributorsHousewife Lyrics
Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)

I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she 'bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin' strong, but comin' home to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin' Spanish
I'm mannish, get yo' nails out my back
Slut, I'm 'bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat (Get the fuck out of here)
Learn the player rules, this is how a player do
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin' shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin' to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin' me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick, huh, got her turnin' tricks, huh
Man, it's a trip, I don't trip, I'm in yo' Lexus flexin'
I left her up in Dallas, Texas, ass naked
You might also like
Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)

Naw, "ho" ain't short for honey, almost had to wail her like Bunny
Tellin' tales of bein' pregnant, catchin' Nordstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef, he caught up in the ho's erotica
Exotic, she's psychotic, rockin' his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics (Sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, "Damn, how could she hit me off with chlamydia?"
Fool, I pity ya
We live in the city of ballers
With more bounce and in a Zapp, she will doo wa ditty ya
The prettier the grittier, the wittier can get her
To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin' ass on Bronson Ave and Pico
At the hotel, motel, or the Holiday Inn (Say what, nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin' up (Beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggas need to stop fuckin' with O.J
Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had a dream of hoes, I had to screen my hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
If you blew my balls right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The ho started callin' when I started boss ballin'
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (Uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (What?)
I knew you would, you wish you could
Break a G down, break me down
But I'ma see you on the rebound (What what?), D.P. style

Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)
Half-dead
Lil' Half-dead the one who jumped out to see ol' Snoop Dogg on lookout boys
He's going to be more than half dead if he don't fill my motherfucking drink up
I'll fill your motherfucking mouth up
Hahahahaha
I don't think so13Embed
