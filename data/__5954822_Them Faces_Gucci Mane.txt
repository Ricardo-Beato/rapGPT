5 ContributorsThem Faces Lyrics
Yeah

Yung Fresh, nigga
Sportscenter
Will Chaimberlin
A hundred points, nigga
Gwop, gwop, gwop, nigga
You get popped, popped, popped, nigga
And we got faces (Yeah)
Zaytoven

I got faces, I got faces
 to Ben Franklin
I love the white girl cause I'm not racist
30,000 on me, all them faces
I got faces, pretty faces
In every video the same old faces
It's the oldheads with the new faces
A hundred thousand cash out on them faces

A hundrеd thousand dollar bankroll, gwop on me
Diamonds everywhеre, I walk around with rocks on me
You can catch me in your hood, might have a Glock on me
With that long ass pistol, gonna pop on me
Faces, all different races
Later on I might hit the club and just waste it
Throw it in the air, can fall like 
Haters mean mug,  can't take it
Riding down the avenue,  cuttless
My face is over here, my face is over there
I think somebody cloned me, my face is everywhere
Yung Ralph
You might also like
I got faces, I got faces
 to Ben Franklin
I love the white girl cause I'm not racist
30,000 on me, all them faces
I got faces, pretty faces
In every video the same old faces
It's the oldheads with the new faces
A hundred thousand cash out on them faces

Got a pocket full of Franklins, Jacksons 
30,000 cash like we gambling
Nigga outta line, he dying, get him an ambulance
 too much blood for them bandages
Whole clique stacked up, white saren rapped up
Extra gram, catch up
Diamonds they glide backwards
Got so many faces, my bracelet it look crazy
They see them stacks to the max they like 
Made the white girl my girl, that's my baby
Kush got me slow-mo like Neo in the Matrix
Young nigga, get your cash up
Stacks on sight, I'm racked up

I got faces, I got faces
 to Ben Franklin
I love the white girl cause I'm not racist
30,000 on me, all them faces
I got faces, pretty faces
In every video the same old faces
It's the oldheads with the new faces
A hundred thousand cash out on them faces
It's Gucci!
Waitress get a hundred, hoe
Whole hundred, keep that shit a hundred
Watch cost a hundred
Chain 200,  spend some big money
Hundred grand cash on me, shawty got that little money
Whip cost a hundred, old school cost a cool hundred
 cost me half a hundred
Shawty danced  shoulda gave her ass a hundred
Ten grand all 
Gucci Mane stuntin, 
I be down the street, 12 got my tool jumpin
2 16's and a hook, that's a whole hundred
So Icey Ent, Gucci got his own money

I got faces, I got faces
 to Ben Franklen
I love the white girl cause I'm not racest
30,000 on me, all them faces
I got faces, pretty faces
In every video the same old faces
It's the oldheads with the new faces
A hundred thousand cash out on them facesEmbed
