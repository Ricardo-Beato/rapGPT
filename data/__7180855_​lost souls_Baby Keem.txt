Ayy, yeah

It's a lot of hoes in here, lot of lost souls
Whole group of dime bitches and they in Vogue
Tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
I'm tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
You see that bitch right there, she fucked OVO
You see that bitch right there, she fucked Romeo
Tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
I'm tryna find me a bitch that no one knows

Jumpin' out the coupe
Pullin' out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose
I'll put you on the news
Titties on the FaceTime, let 'em out
Block him, erase him, let me know
Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's timе to go
When I put you in the latest, makе sure he know

I know that you kiss and tell
Who's someone that we can tell?
You need a real nigga in your life
I come in like a thief in the night
Two phones, I'm the stereotype
Mama know me, I'm picky who I like
There's not a fake bitch in sight
Come in like a thief in the night
You might also like
Jumpin' out the coupe
Pullin' out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose
I'll put you on the news
Titties on the FaceTime, let 'em out
Block him, erase him, let me know
Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's time to go
When I put you in the latest, make sure you know

I'm quick to book a flight, I'm not new to the game
That pussy gettin' tame, go public on the lames
I bought it, say that name, Alexander McQueen
Rolex, woah, heart on froze
Tip my toes
It's hot out here, I've hit my lows
Your leverage in the back
Your best friend was trash, trash, trash
Get gone like The Flash, Flash, Flash
Let's add and subtract, math
I see that you look at these VV-VVs
Let's get you a piece for me

I know that you kiss and tell
Who's someone that we can tell?
You need a real nigga in your life
I come in like a thief in the night
Two phones, I'm the stereotype
Mama know me, I'm picky who I like
There's not a fake bitch in sight
Come in like a thief in the night

Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe
Yeah, I know it's hard, babe
But I'm still on your side, babe
Alright, babe, alright, babe

Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe
Please show me a sign, babe, wish I had more time, babe

Busy all the time, babe, too late to reply, babe
