52 ContributorsYou Are My Enemy Lyrics
Yo, I work hard and barely get paid
How did I get stuck on this page
I've been starving for like six days
I should go and get a switchblade
And try to find out where this bitch stays
I'm a lit flame, what's your future I predict pain
Slit veins, squished brains I'm just saying
Locked in the basement causes madness and errors
All I have to talk to is the fucking man in the mirror
But you never saw it from my perspective
The craft that I perfected got rejected
And thrown out the window with no proper exit
I was humble, now I'm not as pleasant
I'm dropping wreckage on your shady dynasty, bitch I'am not to mess with
You made me think it was impossible that I could blow and get a little money from selling records for copping clothes
Let's talk about the 42 records that Hopsin sold
You sleeping on a fucking pot of gold, so listen close

Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy
You might also like
Yo, hold on one second, I gotta see who's next on this real quick
Oh, this stupid-ass
Alright

Yo, since when are buddies supposed to be so mean
There must be hate in the air that we both breathe
Shit we used to be tighter than emo jeans
The day I boss, stand back and watched the c-notes gleam
I know you see me blowing up, growing up it disturbs you
When my words move fanatics, and in return you gotta post little blogs on the internet
Talking about I've been a wreck, my career is wack I'll never benefit
I hope you die a bitter death
Then lie in a graveyard in regret
Where all of the foul niggas rest
You hating 'cause you witnessing the best
So just confess
You shattered our friendship and you can't fix the mess
I'm not a bit impressed by nothing you've done
My name's stuck on your tongue
Motherfucker you sprung
Give it up, move on
You've taken this shit too far
You mad 'cause you unsatisfied with who you are, bitch
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

Alright, lets see who else we got on this shit
Morgan
Alright, yo

You were the love I used to see in my dreams
But when we met, how come shit can never be what it seem
I was pleased with the things we did together
It's like we was a team
But you would change when I flee from the scene
Around me you were pure hearted, loving and caring
And when we hung out you'd even brighten up your appearance
You fooled me like you were smart, cute and something to stare at
But you was fronting little bitch, now I'm struggling to bare it
Because you were the opposite of what you told me you don't do
Drugs, one night stands and you know that it's so true
You saw my heart exposed, grabbed a hold and then broke through
Hoes are just so rude, fucking bogus and cold too
Oh but there's no dude you would let interfere
With our love, that's the exact shit you said in my ear
When you arrived in my world, I thought Heaven was near
But time made it very clear that the devil was here
So fuck you
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy14Embed
