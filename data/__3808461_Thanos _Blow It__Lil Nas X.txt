46 ContributorsThanos (Blow It) Lyrics
Yeah, what? Yeah, what? Yeah, what? What?
Yeah, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm killin' these niggas, they calling me cocky
Niggas is mad and nobody can stop me
I'm in my bag and there's no need to brag
And you niggas get smacked, I'm your dad and your papi
I'm finna blow, I already know it
I spit hits, I'm a fuckin' poet
You niggas shit, you need to fuckin' quit
You take potential hits and then you fuckin' blow it

I hop on this beat I'm finessing
Look at these blessings, all of my exes from Texas
You niggas is guessing that I will start stressing
Fall back to depression just 'cause yo' rejection
I kill beats, these instrumentals
Niggas talking 'bout, "He got potential"
Niggas joining groups, tryna be Avengers
Scared to stand alone, scared to disassemble
I'm droppin' shit way before December
Be afraid, hope you do remember
In the Escalade, drinking Ace of Spades
Doing escapades, yeah, I do adventures
Droppin' shit, you know that I'm poppin' shit
I switched up my swag and they copied it
Got in my bag and I pulled off the tag
And I don't mean to brag on my mothafuckin' cocky shit
Niggas is, niggas is wack
Smokin' on crack, I am on fire like Jack
I do the same thing as Thugger:
When cops come and pull up, yeah, I put that brack in my brack
Niggas corny, niggas whistle blow
Niggas kiss ass, nigga mistletoe
You gotta thick ass? You should let me know!
I make big cash, Giuseppe' toe
You might also like
I'm killin' these niggas, they calling me cocky
Niggas is mad and nobody can stop me
I'm in my bag and there's no need to brag
And you niggas get smacked, I'm your dad and your papi
I'm finna blow, I already know it
I spit hits, I'm a fuckin' poet
You niggas shit, you need to fuckin' quit
You take potential hits and then you fuckin' blow it

You blew it!
Yeah, nigga you blew it!
Had the mothafuckin' ball and you threw it
You had the screw and you didn't even screw it
Yes, I am Lil Nas and I'm 'bout to get to it
I shit on you niggas, right now, I'm just fartin'
Enter the game, all you niggas departin'
You won't be braggin' about yo' Ferrari
I'm killin' you niggas and no, I'm not sorry!

I'm killin' these niggas, they calling me cocky
Niggas is mad and nobody can stop me
I'm in my bag and there's no need to brag
And you niggas get smacked, I'm your dad and your papi
I'm finna blow, I already know it
I spit hits, I'm a fuckin' poet
You niggas shit, you need to fuckin' quit
You take potential hits and then you fuckin' blow it
I'm killin' these niggas, they calling me cocky
Niggas is mad and nobody can stop me
I'm in my bag and there's no need to brag
And you niggas get smacked, I'm your dad and your papi
I'm finna blow, I already know it
I spit hits, I'm a fuckin' poet
You niggas shit, you need to fuckin' quit
You take potential hits and then you fuckin' blow it2Embed
