Never been a bitch
Hit a couple hundred licks
Stash the money at the crib
Momma going through my-

Never been a bitch
Hit a couple hundred licks
Stash the money at the crib
Momma going through my shit
Had to pass it off to Nick
Now we out in Carson
Went and faced a couple charges
But I'll never snitch
Empty clips on my enemies, Like I'm Pac
Never catch me on the block
Niggas out here trying to breathe
No point in standing on the street
Fuck what you see
I'mma make shit happen
My fam don't eat
Then them dogs 'gon scavenge
Ash, this shit Bracking
Nigga that's blood cracking
Blogs muckrackin'
There's nothing here to see
'Less you tryna to meet the future
Chillin' with a couple shooters
And the truth that's in this music
Then you must see
