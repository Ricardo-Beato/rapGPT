24 ContributorsRe-Up Lyrics
Used to get domed up by crackheads
And still got my balls licked by pretty bitches
Sagging in Scottie Pippens, kid on a Gotti mission
But see his downfall, your best friend snitching
I'm in the kitchen with the Mac, spooning Lactose
Rat bitch rubbing on her titties off the roll
Nigga, calm down, listen for the door
I know my baby momma bet not call no more
Bitch talking Pampers, know she full of shit
Impossible for babies to take that many shits
Rapping 'bout bricks, but I ain't never seen one
I think I seen like three hundred bo's once
Fucking with them addicts, holding automatics
Dog, I ain't lying, even served a Dramatic
Used to bring the lettuce, then I had to dead it
Ass tried to sing every time he wanted credit

And I'm tryna make re-up, fuck around, put a G up
And blow a blunt with my mans
See I'm just tryna make a re-up, fuck around, put a G up
And drink a fifth with my niggas

Christmas every year comes faster and faster
New Year come around, claim a baby on your taxes
Dog, I know connects, you middle-man taxing
Three gram dimes of weed, you was rocking Chloe glasses
Did it for the Jordans for what you feel important
In '02, my weed increased the dropout rate at Northern
Senior bitches skipping, get 'em weeded out
And take 'em to the back room, my nigga smut 'em out
Hood rat bitches putting blunts in they mouth
Smoke some weed, order Coney, time to fuck and out
Rock a fit for three days and go and cop a new one
Rode a bike to Linwood to give away my ones
Hopped up out the cab, and when I step out
The first thing they say "I ain't know them came out"
But nigga I ain't tripping, I'm grinding on a few bucks
Really balling and I'm tryna step it up
