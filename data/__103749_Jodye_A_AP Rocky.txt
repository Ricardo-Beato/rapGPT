11 ContributorsMiLLiON DOLLAR MULLET Lyrics
(Oh, my God, Ronny)
Uh

Million-dollar mullet, I'm talking Ted DiBiase
I'ma disappear and come back with eight watches
AP watches, watch this
Prada Paparazzi
I'ma live my life Miami Vice, Farrah Fawcett
I'ma sip lean
You gon' tattletale while I slide down Tidwell (uh)
I'ma shine blades like a chef
Conan The Barbarian style jewels on neck
It's the white Wyclef, got a brick on my shelf
And I did it by myself, uh
Bitch, you got a complaint? Leave it at the front desk
Shoot a three like Tony Delk
Yeah, my girl brought a girlfriend, made my heart melt
More diamond pointers than a Roosevelt elk, yeah
Mine's crystal clean, your look like skimmed milk
Stop asking all them questions, you gon' wrinkle up my silk, uh
I'm in Shanghai with the top down
Raspberry Roger Clemens throwing 90 off the mound
Nolan Ryan Texas Ranger with the sunset hounds
Half a ticket on my neck every time I pop up
Instead of worrying about me, you need to get your stocks up, yuh
I'ma three-wheel in a Dolce & Gabbana truck
Look into the mirror and then wipe down all the drama
You got another baby mama while I'm chasing a third comma
Still finding who I am, left hand hologram
Right hand, um, Fruity Pebbles Toucan Sam
Ronny J got the bass kicking, Jean-Claude Van Damme
Aventador hard top, hit up Ken Dan Tony
All the way at West palm Lamb
Left hand hold two hundred grand, all cash, uh
Skrt up off the lot and I did the whole dash
Tip Toe to the cellar, the white Mayweather
40K yesterday but it's gon' get better, uh
Orange sapphires that look like sunsets, uh
I'm at Jewel Collect like Johnny Quest
You might also likeCollect call, from who? Alanis Morissette
Why you ain't been in more movies than Johnny Depp?

Johnny deep, deep pockets
I done flipped so much cheese
Should applied at Johnny Rockets
Overqualified, overqualified, hold a lotta ties
In the streets, know a lotta guys, owe a lotta pride
Pink caprice flexin’ on 'em like I had a rubber spine
Limpin out this bitch like I was rollerskatin’ drunk and blind
Out my way, bitches flashin’ to us from the balcony
For you she's a mouse, for me a rat, I leave her out my cave
'Bout to say? Ain't no 'bout to say, fuck what you 'bout to say
Me and that HighRoller Jody, fuck what you about to say
Catfish, shoulda left me in the creek where you found me
Now you got that river-water on ya from my country county
Mud mouth, that's the LSD hit in a petri dish
Must be 'cause they trippin’ on my drawl, easel kit
Paint flying out that Krylon can up on the eastern bridge
AM7 Ounze Zilla, go back on me, read the list
Go back homie, hating on me, I'm too heavy for them kids
This ain't nothing overnight except for me to do your bitch
Ain't interested, bumblebee, interesting intellect
Infamous pinky ring, Slumerican everything
In the mix Ballers Eve playa spin that kickin’ tune
Been up in that trunk with 808s since you was still in school
Billy who? Billy’s hell, Earnhardt, really Dale?
Runnin' laps on suckers, motherfucker go pick up your mail
The mullet king, mullet king
Catfish
Really though
Joe, Jody HighRoller
Fuckin' getting it
Fuckin' getting it
YeahEmbed
