Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you would’a liked it
I-I- I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty, here I go

Uh, should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some mortar shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Uh, I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!"
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-uh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough
You might also like
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
Uh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh
"You promised me you would never change"
Uh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh

Uh, am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on
Now that I'm on I don't really want to worry 'bout getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit "re-dial", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus, this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would’a kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
Uh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh
"You promised me you would never change"
Uh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh

I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she miss the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact, I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know
But same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over32Embed
