26 ContributorsOn Some Real Shit (100,000 Bars) Lyrics
I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
(Let's go) Check it out
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
(One time, one time) I know you gotta feel this (Your boy Mac)
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
(Let's go)

I pull my hoodie down and take a look around
Sounds that shook a town, man, it feel good to smile
So I shouldn't frown when the night is lookin' down
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the smoothest crook around?
Takin' some dollars and makin' away from Impalas
Shakin' the Jakes 'cause they chasin' the face of a robber
Actin' goofy, absolutely
'Cause my passion suits me, so blast the tunes, please
I see the world with four eyes, hip-hop tour guide
Hear the war cries, rap or die
Wanna get signed, drive a four-door ride
Be more fly, 'til then I'll just soar by with a wave
I'm a bat in the cave
Sit back in the shade when I'm passin' the haze
Misbehave, I'm a trouble-makin' teenager
 to please haters
Seat taker, three-term mayor
Gettin' re-elected just three terms later, uh
I've seen greater days, so let the haters play their game
Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey
The ace of spades can make it's way to save the day
But from the start a club of heart was diamond
Now I'm in Zion flyin' through the skyline
The game on my back, I got five spines
Black cat with nine lives, time flies by
So I got one life to lose it, but how will I use it? Uh
I put it all in the music, 'cause y'all pussy
Fold away before they hand you cards
Broke-ass rapper, now you dancin' with the stars
I'm handlin' these bars like a simple situation
Bassin' on them cats who don't fit in the equation
Patience is a virtue, but fuck it, I want it now
Get my record deal ready, get Diddy up on the dial
Hello. what's up, Puffy? I'm on my grind and hungry
Throw me to the people, they gon' love me, trust me, ha
'Cause these older cats is gettin' a little rusty
It's time for a change like Barack said
And I don't care, hip-hop is not dead
Spit hot lead, but none of these haters get shot dead
They don't bother me, I'll even play 'em for my wife
Kick back, have a laugh while you complain about your life
Grr, you hate Mac and you say you gon' fight
It's all good, bro, you entertainment for tonight
Like I'ma be mad you hatin' 'cause I'm white
Do a lot of cryin', lettin' pain out on the mic
'Cause overall I'm iller than most of y'all, y'all pussy
Never ever goin' for it all, you scared of a little risky coachin' call
What happened? I thought you was a know-it-all?
I stay smokin' well, haze got a potent smell
It take me back to kickin' raps back in show-and-tell
I wanted to show people, all of my bro's peoples
Have a dude come up like "Yo, I know people"
The need for Dead Presidents, this dough evil
So lethal, police'll always try to beat you
Seat you down, try and have you run your mouth
Bring your mother out, "Look what your son is now," haha
See, my mom, she know her son is well
The youngest child, she been through it for a while
9-1-1 on the dial with a smile
'Cause I'm wild, foul child style, haha
Too focused on my grind to ever catch an "F"
My heart in it, down eight with five seconds left
I want the best, won't settle for nothin' less
And I always stay dressed in somethin' fresh
So keep your head on straight and show respect to the game
And that's what this beat messaged my brainYou might also like4Embed
