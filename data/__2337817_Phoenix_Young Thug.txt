36 ContributorsPhoenix Lyrics
Thugga, baby

I won't move without my gun, yeah
And it's 'cause I'm the one
She wanna fuck my charms
Hell yeah

But I never told her that I wanna be with her
And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her
And I never told her that she gonna eat with me
Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
If she don't like it she don't see it
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son, no Phoenix

Ayy, lil' momma showing me she don't play
And she never diss her old boy, no way
And I never told her nothing 'bout bae
And every time I leave she want me to stay
But she just don't know how to say
And that's deep but I could say
Anything I want, I run the day, whoa
Hand her my taste, cum on her face
Drank all her waste, okay, mush it not beat it
Hakuna Matata I need it, I am a Mufasa genius
Baby come fuck for no reason
I am the opposite, I'm so the opposite B
I'm the opposite baby
I know some Haitians and they cookin' babies, um, ayy
I meet the momma and meet the grandmomma when I wanna fuck the lil' lady
She ran my water then cook all my food now I feel like I done fucked a waiter
You might also like
I won't move without my girl, yeah
And it's 'cause I'm the one
She wanna fuck my charms
Hell yeah

But I never told her that I wanna be with her
And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her
And I never told her that she gonna eat with me
Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
If she don't like it she don't see it
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son no Phoenix

Started from the top then I fucked her little bottom
I'ma nut on her booty she a Prada
I'm on her institution now I got on my goggles
Baby girl get on my boat no Nautica, whoa
Grab that dick eight fucking ways like a motherfuckin' octopus
I'ma fuck that lil' bitch and listen to 2Pac
Call the lil' bitty bitch when I wanna do her
Baby girl I'm hood rich and I put my crew up
Leave that bitch in a ditch and they wanna sue us
She's a barber, the bitch saying her crew cut
Put my dog in your poo butt
Laying down law with my Russians
No stomach, came out the gutter
Where the hell I'll be without my baby
When she send me pictures everything's the latest
I wanna fuck her without raping
And she'll pull up on you, no baby
I won't move without my gun, yeah
And it's 'cause I'm the one
She wanna fuck my charms
Hell yeah

But I never told her that I wanna be with her
And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her
And I never told her that she gonna eat with me
Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
If she don't like it she don't see it
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son no Phoenix8Embed
