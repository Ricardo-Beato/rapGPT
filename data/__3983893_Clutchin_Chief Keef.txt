16 ContributorsClutchin Lyrics
We don't fuck with police
Pockets on obese
Meet my little friend, Tony
We getting on a jet, OT
These doors got the suction
The drank help me function
You know how I’m bummin'
My shooter with me, clutchin

Jump up in that NASA like I'm jumpin’ in the pool
I'm lactose, all this cheese man, my stomach gon' be through
Told that bitch I don't need a wife and I'd be damned if it is you
She actin' like she don't want no kids, bitch wear it if you fit the shoe
I'm the coolest to your bitch, I was the baddest in the school
Ride that Dually like it’s stick
I mean I’m riding that like a coupe
What you gon' do when that check hit?
You’ll be balling like a fool
If I fucked your bitch once
She gon' be calling like a fool

We don't fuck with police
Pockets on obese
Meet my little friend, Tony
We getting on a jet, OT
These doors got the suction
The drank help me function
You know how I'm bummin’
My shooter with me, clutchin

Who is these niggas, I don't know dem
They say they wanna do it, I might coax dem
Gotta stay on point, and that's on folks nem
He talking out his neck, we gotta choke him
She wanna gamble with me, I'ma poke her
All over the table, call it poker
All that talking, I am not a spoker
Come fuck wit' the gang let me show ya

We don't fuck with police
Pockets on obese
Meet my little friend, Tony
We getting on a jet, OT
The doors got the suction
The drank help me function
You know how I'm bummin'
My shooter with me, clutchin2Embed
