3 ContributorsU.S.D.A. LyricsNow this here is that bomb diggy
Got the a the ks with me
And you ain't sayin shit i keep some killers with me
We right here nigga
Soft white turn flips like cartwheels
Got tonka toys on big wheels
Im on sesame street we got big birds
The code of the street we use big words
Welcome to the jungle where the killers at
Got banana clips where the gorillas at
Black t black skully and a fo-fifth
Twenty six ???? are workin nightshift
Who give a bitch stick dick and presidents
I make a stashhouse out of her residence
Spread money around like this shit is contagious
Like i own a pet shop got parrots in cages
They say i can't rap i hear alotta things
Still bounce on the track like a trampolineYou might also likeEmbed
