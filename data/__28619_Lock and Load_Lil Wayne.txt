31 ContributorsLock and Load Lyrics
Yeah
Vibe with me, sweetheart
It ain't hard
Aww, fuck them niggas, I ain't worried 'bout them
This Cash Money, baby
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout? This Tha Carter II
Kurupt, holler at them niggas (Nigga)

We won (Yeah), we won (Yeah)
And then we shot that BB gun (You know)
And they lost (Yeah), and they lost (That's right)
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Lock and load)
We won, we won (Yeah, it's Weezy Baby, man)
And then we shot that BB gun (See, you gotta be real smooth, real slick about this here)
And they lost, and they lost (Extra gentle, on the tender side)
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (They like it that way, hah, lock and load)

Twenty-two-year-old 17th Ward vet
Life in the fast lane, little red Corvette
Little red handkerchief hangin' out the right side
Back pocket jeans fallin', cover my Evisu sign
Yep, we do shine and they gon' hate
But they hated Jesus, baby, we won't break
So we ride like four Pirellis, so secured
No security, no protectin', no comparin'
Loc-in' heavy, Ocean 11
Aviators, vote-takers, so fakers, ah
No players, I'm Hollygrove to the heart
Hollygrove from the start, don't cross Earhart
Boulevard was the ward I come from
One-seven, one shot? Never that, blum-blum
Brr, brr, pop, pop, clap, clap
What the fuck, Hollygrove, stand up (Nigga), duck
You might also like
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun (Get low)
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Lock and load)
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun (Yeah, me and my nigga Maine is in here smokin' and laughin' at you cats)
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Let's toast to how funny these guys are, we lock and load)

Get 'em, get 'em, Weezy, hit 'em where you kill 'em easy
Sit 'em in the river, leave 'em, they find 'em tomorrow evening
Sinkin', I'm probably drinkin' that syrup
Thinkin' I won't slip, even though I'm leanin' like a broke hip
He ain't know I got the nina with the full clip
That's a somersault, backspin, full flip for ya
Push this button, I flip out and hit something
Miss nothin', I'm just bustin' until the scene clean
Twelve hundred for the jeans, stop playin'
Hundred dollars for the Glock in my pants, who the man?
I am when I stand with it pointed right at ya face
Knock your brains from the back of ya neck for lack of respect
I strap a jet-black gat 'til the death
Tell my mama to bury me with that, no bullshittin'
My hood gettin' kinda crazy where I be
So Ronnie's with me 'cause he's the OG (Nigga)
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun (I told 'em)
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Gotta duck your head, lock and load)
We won (These niggas mad), we won
And then we shot that BB gun (You know they hate you when you get money on 'em)
And they lost, and they lost (But they losin', that's right)
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Yeah, lock and load)

Fresh out the back seat of the phiggity-Phantom
The haters, I make 'em madder when I wave at 'em like, "What up?"
If it ain't 'bout money, I keep goin'
I'm tryna get that green, niggas tryna mow my lawn, but fuck
Them boys, I got the shotty on my arm
If them boys run up, I leave they bodies on the lawn
And duck the fuck outta there, 'cause baby, it's outta there
If this was a movie, it's time to roll the credits, cut
It's all over, all of your brains is all over the motherfuckin' block, I'm a motherfuckin' rock
Hardbody, Eagle Street, seventeen shots
Night vision, double clip, hot steady beam Glock
Pop, drop, little man, drop
This is not for little bitches, you man or a fox?
I'm layin' in the drop, thinkin' of more money
Cash Money, Young Money, take money, your money (Nigga)
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Yeah, lock and load)
We won, we won (You know, I thought they knew it was really real, Daddy)
And then we shot that BB gun (Yeah, homeboy)
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (My motherfuckin' wristband was three hundred dollars, no lie, lock and load)

Dolce & Gabanna
They should pay me for sayin' that shit
So is my jeans
They wasn't three hundred, but they Dolce too
Yeah
Mhm
We won, motherfucker, we winnin' over here
That's right, hey
Somebody call Gordon, tell him pull up front
Open the doors, suicide 'em
Let's ride out
If you got money, you know what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
If you don't, keep thinkin'
If you can do that
Your losing streak is goin' up
Why? 'Cause we here
And I'll fuck this up today, straight up10Embed
