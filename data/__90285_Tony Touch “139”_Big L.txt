11 ContributorsTony Touch “139” Lyrics
Big L

1-3-9

Where I'm from
Yeah, Tony Touch in the house, yeah
Big L Harlem on the rise, 1-3-9
You ain't know!?
One love to my nigga McGruff, Mase Murda, Killa Kam
Rest in peace to my man Bloodshed
Live on baby, the spirit live on
Yeah BBO in the house
Yeah my men stand I'ma rock this shit
Check it out!

Yo I be dat smooth cat you never seen rollin' wit clowns
One of the few from uptown thats holdin' it down
Bitches be on me like I'm welfare, een rich ones
That live in Bel Air is this Big L yeah, hell yeah!
Word up I use a chrome gat, to push domes back
Watch how you talk when you call me feds got my phone tapped
This rap game, I put my life in it, chain got mega ice in it
Push an Infinite, chrome rims light tinted
And you can see pal, it's all about me now
20 g's a show, bitch 3 thou just to freestyle
I made this cheese, it didn't grow on trees
Can you hold somethin?, sure you can hold on these
Yo I'm phat like a old crayon smooth as rayon
L is who the ladies stay on, baby play on
I stay jeweled up pockets swelled up
From banks I held up, plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet, when I hold heat, we roll deep
In a triple-black dark-tinted OG
I catch a fag 3 o lock in the mon'
On the block all alone, then put a Glock to his dome
Tell him give it up quick, you nitwit, dont try to get slick
Or I'mma let this four-fifth spit, and leave your shit split
Prick, it ain't nothin decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, dont try to play like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
And mad niggas be frontin a lot
Popping mad shit, trying to be something they not
Your faggot ass better stay to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing, I'm sick like Manson
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trip, we'll let a bitch starve til her ribs are showingYou might also like2Embed
