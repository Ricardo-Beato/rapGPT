3 ContributorsSecretary Lyrics
She is so sick, and I would love to be her patient
And I will work every day as long as she's my occupation
Be, be, don't you wanna be
Be my secretary, she's my secretary
He's just secondary, we do what we wanna
He don't have the slightest
He thinks she's the nicest
I think she's so nasty
We do it so often
It seems like a job now
Like a nine to five now

Don't you wanna be (don't you wanna be)
Be my secretary (be my secretary)
Come and work for me (come and work for me)
Whatever's necessary (whatever's necessary)

She's my employee of the month
Because of her I never learned how to role a blunt
She do everything for me, roll magazine for me
Shawty act like she gotta run away from him for me
Wayne, lemme quit talkin' and watch where I'm walkin'
I don't wanna step on toes, 'cause her homey gettin' angry
Overtime at the job is keepin' his girl from home
Nine to five or regular hours, but her shift's six to ten
She goes home at ten to be happy with her man
Till I need her too clock back in
You might also like
You can check her resume and see what you will find
She has never missed a day and she has always been on time
When he's not in, that's when she clocks in
And if the bible says it's wrong, God don't forgive us for our sins


Weezy F, motherfuckin' Baby
Weezy F, motherfuckin' Baby
Come and see the motherfuckin'
Come and see the motherfuckin'
Weezy F, motherfuckin' Baby
Come and see the motherfuckin' hospital
Weezy F, motherfuckin' Baby
Come and see the motherfuckin' hospitalEmbed
