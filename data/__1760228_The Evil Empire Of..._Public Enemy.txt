2 ContributorsThe Evil Empire Of... Lyrics

Beware, we live in times under the influence of rhyme
To make the masses scared, seems like everything is everywhere
Fear the media, they make y'all swallow the pill until we clear the air
Beware, because adversaries barely care
You start off doing it, it ends up doing you
And using it ends up abusing you and your surrounding crew
The charisma of ignorance makes you hate, where you at?
Bitter makes you better when you're backed by the fact
Segregation, integration, aggravation, anti-immigration
From a land in total desperation
Y'all ain't gotta buy it or try it
I'll say it, they won't play it
But coming is a new breed of MC's to relay it
Easier to be misunderstood than understand this song
Beware, the youth is not youth for long
Rest in peace, TrayvonYou might also likeEmbed
