26 ContributorsMan Down Lyrics

Aw!
It hurts
The D's trying to pin a murder on me
In the precinct they saying I done murdered homie
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homie
And everybody know my niggas murder for me

You see homo on your crib, it ain't a burglary homey
They finna to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the sticking when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait, I'm getting sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksucking police got it in for me
They flash their lights, they wanna rough me up
Frisk me, find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new Bebo's, who gon' be Eddie Byrne?
Huh, we'll find out when niggas let off the rounds
And his partner's screaming officer down

Police get in the way
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes
I'll murder them, I said I'll murder them
Any motherfucker touch me
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
You don't believe me, wait and see
I'll murder them, you see I told you I'd murder them
You might also like
They saying I'm an accident waiting to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waiting to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies from selling that crack shit
And the third one, came from showing niggas my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggas crawling under cars when I start to cappin'
So they don't know what to say to the captain
But they know if word get back, something gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitching where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay, I go first
Cause your baby's momma is my baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

Police get in the way
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes
I'll murder them, I said I'll murder them
Any motherfucker touch me
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
You don't believe me, wait and see
I'll murder them, you see I told you I'd murder them6Embed
