Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah)

Is your house big? Is your car nice?
Is your girl fine? Fuck her all night?
Is you well paid? Are your shows packed?
If your song played, would they know that?
How the thug life? How the love life?
How the workload? Is your buzz right?
Do the trap jump? Is the plug right?
Got your head right? Boy, yeah right

Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah)

Pretty woman wanna slit the wrist
Pretty woman wanna be a rich man's bitch
Pretty woman want a couple kids
Pretty woman want a new ass, new lips
Pretty woman wanna push a Benz
Come correct or she won't let you in
Thumbin' through a check, she gets it in
Diamonds on your neck, is them pretend?

Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah)

Got an enemy that changes dependin' what direction
You're facin'
Got an enemy that tells you what block and what division
You're placed in
You pretend to get a better idea about the lifestyle
You're chasin'
Keep pretendin', make it real until every cell replaced, erased
Pop 'til it's vacant
Pop 'til the wrist pop
Pop 'til he shakin'
Pop like four on the floor been in rotation
No allegation
Popular demand, I understand my name is only for conversation
New York nigga be like, "Deadass"
L.A. nigga be like, "On the dead homies"
I was off the porch like Fed-Ex
211, got bread on me
K-Dot twilight, the zeitgeist
Roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp, uh
Temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
Just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin' gym, uh
Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty
Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early, uh
Fade like shadows, the stallion, the cattle
A bitches decision for you is narrow
Collision, the money and fame, the pharaoh
The physic, the chemist, the lame
Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain
I said, nigga, yeah right
I don't fair fight but I bear fight
Lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
Hangin' on my last four kills for the highlights
My life, high life, high five, bye-bye
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy, yeah)49Embed
