Get paid
Pocket full of lint, hollows in the clip
I been robbin' since a kid, gettin' paid
Dollars for the rent, get change for the chains
Ayy, get paid, get paid
Ayy, get paid, get paid
Ayy, get paid, get paid
Get paid

Tomorrow never come
I'm on the block all night 'til the sun come up
I can sleep when I'm done
Four deep, five seats, three guns
Hopped out—"Nigga, where you from?"
Long clip, gun aimed, don't run
On Crip, I need your funds
The money gettin' low, finna run up in the store
Freaky bitches tryna ho, I'ma put 'em on the stroll
Niggas snitchin' on the low, never talkin' on the phone ("Hello?")
That's why them niggas screamin', "Free Big Meech"
Not me, nigga, fuck police
Split a pig nigga wig for the boy SD
Money-motivated in the LBC, come and holla at me
You might also like
Get paid
Pocket full of lint, hollows in the clip
I been robbin' since a kid, gettin' paid
Dollars for the rent, get changed for the change
Ayy, get paid, get paid
Ayy, get paid, get paid
Ayy, get paid, get paid
Get paid

Lemme tell you what the OGs told us—
Money over bitches, keep your head on your shoulders
Pussy leave a lot of niggas dead, if you notice
Big-booty cuties be the coldest, cobras
Sittin' in the lawn of the fortress, coolin'
Baby wardrobe all award-show, boujee
Think you could hit that? Nigga, you stupid
Better get your racks up 'fore you start choosin'
Rag on my face, hat on me say "Yankees"
Safe in the floor, K to your dome, pay me
Watch where you go flossin' them gold Daytons
Come to the Norf, my niggas gon' Caine 'em
Sellin' cocaine with my daddy out the Days Inn
Nothin' but a G thang, dollars in the G-string
Long as she gon' make it, she gon' shake it
Money puttin' niggas in the Matrix, face it
Get paid
Pocket full of lint, hollows in the clip
I been robbin' since a kid, gettin' paid
Dollars for the rent, get changed for the change
Ayy, get paid, get paid
Ayy, get paid, get paid
Ayy, get paid, get paid
Get paid

Sellin' pussy on the stroll, ugh
Sellin' highs for the low, ugh
Runnin' in somebody home, ugh
Money is the means of control, ugh58Embed
