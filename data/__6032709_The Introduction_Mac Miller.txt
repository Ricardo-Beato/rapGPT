4 ContributorsThe Introduction Lyrics
Ayy, it's your boy, the class clown himself, Mac Miller
East End Empire all day
Shout out to my man DJ Mynd Tek (Easy Mac can't cheese)
Coast 2 Coast Mixtapes, look outie

Ayo, microphone check, one-two, one-two (Uh-huh)
My name's Mac, what it do? (What it do?)
I'm formerly known as Easy Mac
But I'm gettin' grown now, so I'm past all that
Mac Miller the rap killer, my track iller (Huh?)
With mixtapes like crack dealers, I stack skrilla (Uh-huh)
Fat Swishers at the spot and the room fog
Go ahead and pick a beat out the jukebox (The jukebox)
You can try and stunt me
If you lucky, you may catch me when I'm hungry (Hungry)
Just grumpy on the beat, takin' all that I can eat
Like a buffet at a holiday suite, know what I mean? (Haha)
It's for thе green like H&R Block
The jakes try and stop us, so I'm hatin' еvery cop that I see (Bitch)
There to keep the steets clean (Huh?)
But they as dirty as a homeless dude's jeans
Bitch, please (Haha), still mack with ease
And actually, the name change wasn't 'bout the haters laughin' (Laughin')
 attack like assassins
That's just what the fuck happened (Happened)
Like I said, muhfucker, I still mack easy
Just holla "Mac Miller" when you see me (What's up?)
Now holla "Mac Miller" when you see me (Mac Miller)
I said holla "Mac Miller," it's easy (Mac)You might also likeEmbed
