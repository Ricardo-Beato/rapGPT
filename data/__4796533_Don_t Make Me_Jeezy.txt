10 ContributorsDon’t Make Me Lyrics
Yeah
Justice League
We're here now
We're here
Yeah
Hundred and three plus one, yeah
Don't make me do it
Yeah‚ 'cause you know I will‚ nigga

China from China (China from China)
My shit's designer (My shit designer)
I came from nothin' (I came from nothin')
Thought I'd remind ya (Thought I'd remind ya)
My hustle soared (My hustle soared)
Step on the floor (Step on the floor‚ yeah)
My door go up (My door go up, yeah)
Aventador (Woo, let's go)

Go get it right (Go get it right)
Break out the ice (Break out the ice)
Go get the money (Go get the money‚ yeah)
And count it twice (And count it twice)
You might also like
Don't make me get back up on my shit, boy (Shit)
Take a whole thang, break it all down to nicks (Nicks‚ yeah)
Ziploc, nigga, that's a bag full of tricks (Ha-haa)
And the doors go up (Up), all that's for kicks (Yeah)
Ten on the floor, nigga, that's money well-invested (Ayy)
Got it from my dawg, I ain't even gotta test it (Nah)
Thank God for hustle (Hustle), that's exactly what I'm blessed with (Blessed with)
Iron out the grind (Woo) 'til you get the shit perfected (Ayy)
True wealth is in your heart, boy (Boy), gotta hustle hard, boy (Yeah)
All the hard times got you doubtin', then you're gone, boy

China from China (China from China)
My shit's designer (My shit designer)
I came from nothin' (I came from nothin')
Thought I'd remind ya (Thought I'd remind ya)
My hustle soared (My hustle soared)
Step on the floor (Step on the floor)
My door go up (My door go up)
Aventador (Yeah, let's go)

Don't trust a soul, exactly what it told me (Me)
Couldn't even trust him is what he showed me (Yeah)
When you broke the rules, dawg, you broke my heart (My heart)
Ten-room mansion sittin' in the dark (Damn)
Ten steps ahead, I'm a visionary (Woo)
Richest place in the world is the cemetery (That's right)
If the streets a jungle, I'm a fuckin' lion (Lion)
Shit can be impossible, I'm fuckin' tryin' (Yeah)
Went from baggin' reefer, now we sell tequila ('Quila)
Mix the water with the soda like a margarita (Ha-haa)
Who ever knew the game of life was so for real?
So many layers in the onions you just gotta peel (Yeah)
China from China (China from China)
My shit's designer (My shit designer)
I came from nothin' (I came from nothin')
Thought I'd remind ya (Thought I'd remind ya)
My hustle soared (My hustle soared)
Step on the floor (Step on the floor)
My door go up (My door go up)
Aventador (Yeah, let's go)

Don't make me do it, nigga
Don't make me
Yeah
'Cause you know I will
Yeah
Aventador
My door go up
Aventador
Break out the ice
Go get it right
Safe in the floor
Aventador
Yeah
Go get it right
Break out the ice
Safe in the floor
Yeah
Richest place in the world is the cemetery1Embed
