3 ContributorsStarfield Lyrics
Yeah, uh, yeah

I started with just a dollar and a dream
Like Jermaine in '09, know what I mean?
Fresh on the scene like a first take
I dropped my first tape then felt the earth shake
But let's accelerate
Dropped my second tape, 2011, and now we elevate
Def Jam wanna sign me, it's time to celebrate
But little did I know, I had so much further to go
Had so much further to grow
Had so much further, I know
If you feeling down, you know you can call mе
If nobody around, you know you can call me
Yeah, this shit don't need a featurе
Yeah, you know it's all, know it's all, know it's all, know it's all, know it's all, know it's all

What the fuck is up then?
Logic cites Nujabes, MF Doom, RZA, and Kanye West as key inspirations behind his production style

Yeah, yeah, uh
Grammy-nominated, never won it though
Don't need it, but deep down, I want it though
Bank account still on a hunnid though
My bank account still on a hunnid (Ayy)
But that don't mean shit, that don't mean that I'm shit
It's just me and my clique and we bombin' this shit
Ain't no drama and shit, now I'm throwin' a fit
Watch me throwin' a fit and get lit like I'm Evel Knievel
Just me and my people, we call this the sequel to Under Pressure
Ain't no need to measure who the best
Fuck around and know who the best
Who give a shit? I just spit about this and I know what I love
R-A-double-T, I put nothing above like that thing in the glove
From Maryland to LA, I'm a motherfucking boss at the bars
And I'm down for the cause, who's down for the cause?
Take a step back, hold up (L-O-G-I-C)
Put the city on the map with the city on my back
Let 'em know you're never ever goin' back (L-O-G-I-C)
Don't be scared to murk 'em all, hurt 'em all, watch 'em all
Get up all, watch 'em all get a ball (L-O-G-I-C)
When you grow up in a hood without a male role model
And your momma turn to the bottle
Give a damn about status, who the baddest
I just wanna be the raddest dad as I can be
This shit is systemic inside of us B', the media lie to us B'
They tell us we can be whoever we want to be
And then when we try, what they tell us? (What they tell us?)
What they tell us? To live more realistically (Ayy)
Fuck that, get the fuck back, fuck rap and all that noise
Growing up, how I grew up I really never had a choice
Had killers and murderers in my house and they was all of my boys
But deep down I always knew better, knew that shit I need to avoidYou might also likeEmbed
