12 ContributorsYou Took My Heart Lyrics"So tonight, I wanna talk to you about the relationship
Between money and peace.."
A lot of people say it's not about money, it's about peace!
It's about money...
You took my heart from me
I'll never be the same
Now killing won't be hard for me
Cause I can't feel a thing
Sunday morning, preacher in the pulpit
Kissed my nanna, I can't listen to this bullshit
It's all good til they ask me for an offering
All we got is pain, so that's all I can offer him
My mama cold, she put me in this cold world
Left me, what I got to protect me?
Oh, I got a 9, yeah I got a 9!
And all this ambition, bitch I'm on the grind
Sky's the limit, 2 for 5's the gimmick
You line something up, I tie something up
They run up out that crib with that money, nigga what
School of hard knocks, I'm ahead of my class
With no hesitation put a hole in your ass
See, no it's never my fault when I fuck up
I knock your ass out, to wake you the fuck up
Brass knuckles and my knife: now tell me wassup

I made it to a half a mansion, shit I thought I made it
Hood bitches on a nigga, yeah all on a nigga
The D's his the door with the batter ram
I'm standing by the toilet that's broke, tryna flush this shit
Bizzy was my nigga started fucking with that cracker shit
Beat me out my money, nigga ran off with my mac kid
I was down, he kicked me when I'm down
When I think about this kid, it fucks my head up right now
You know the same niggas that got me shot, killed your brother
And you ain't never did shit about that, motherfucker
When niggas was beefing with you, I shot that park up
Now I'm thinking about the occasions, my gun blazing
You got me feeling like a sucker B
You took my heart from me
(Son, I don't give a fuck son we can back right now)
I'll never be the same
(Niggas gonna try and front on me and be right there?)
Now killing won't be hard for me
(Nah, nah, I'm putting them niggas on house arrest)
Cause I can't feel a thing
I'mma go and I'mma go back, fuck that
I'mma stay on them niggas 'til they can feel me breathing on them
You, you look at these fake ass niggas
They think cause they saying some fake shit in music, that the shit I be saying ain't real
All you gotta do is ask niggas, they tell you about me
They dont say Fifty though they say Boo Boo
Uh uh
Find out
Find out if I let it go
Man turn this shit offEmbed
