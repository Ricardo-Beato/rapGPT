17 ContributorsCoulda Bought a Jet Lyrics
Hundred 'round my wrist, three hundred thousand on my neck, yeah
Watch me flex, baby girl, I'm a walking check
I'm a bag, I'm a sack, make these ho niggas upset
What I spent on a crib, could've went and bought a jet
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex
Man, I could've bought a jet
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex
Man, I could've bought a jet

What I spent on my watch, man, I could've bought a brick
My money so long, I think I should've bought some sticks
Man, I get so high, I think I could belong in heaven
We brought the choppers out, the boys like, "Look, they showin' TEC's"
Watch me by my L's, middle finger to Shondale
I smoke a lot of L's and don't care if I rot in hell
I'm a walking ATM, man, I swear I'm a talkin' mil'
'Cause what I spent on a car, man, I could've bought a crib
Flex, finesse, flex, finesse
See that money, bitch, I get, watch me thumb through a check
Like splash, splash, splash, splash
Man I could've bought a jet with a big booty bitch
Flex, flex, flex, flex
What I spent on my rims, I could've paid your rent
Flex, flex, finesse, finesse
I could've bought a Range Rover with this cash I'm throwing, flex
