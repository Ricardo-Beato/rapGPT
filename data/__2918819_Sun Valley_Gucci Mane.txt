13 ContributorsSun Valley Lyrics
If you think I'm done trappin'
'Cause I made it rappin'
Basically this is something that you don't really know about me
A ghetto superstar, riding through the six
Middle fingers up, screaming Sun Valley
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it

1970 our tower Sun Valley, well young nigga jumped off and started trappin'
A nigga got killed last night what happened?
Fuckin' with them double crossin' bitches from the Valley
Mountain park apartments everybody cappin'
Don't go to triangle 'cause you might just get yo ass kicked
Bottom of the hill shootin' hoops, Sun Valley
Nigga wanna jump me and take my Starter jacket
13 years old but my big bro packin', let's just say they ain't take my Starter jacket
Flashback 97 five dollar crap game, gamblin' in the laundry, man, me and dlick Brandon
Gusto, C-Note, Dante and Landon, Carlos, Dameon and my nigga Lil Red
A's out, twin mine, ketchup on the wall mane
Fast forward '08, million dollar crap game
Walkin' through the apartments Nike Jordan shoe game
Versace glasses, I was only in the 9th grade
Triple gold D's by the 11th grade
Fuckin' all the teachers, all the teachers wanna fuck me
Got locked up 6 months, I was 19, fresh out of high school 6 months in the county
Fast forward '08 10 cars mounted, 3 trucks, 3 verses, 6 hard tops mane
4 hoes, 2 spots, 1 boy set it office, 2 dogs, one a Maltese and one a Yorkie
Iced out dog same size as the Yorkie, if you touch this dog, it goes on and start barkin'
Growlin', brawlin' reppin', ballin', stones not cloudy
I'm big boy ballin', Wilt Cham numbers on a bad day founded, good day, 80, on a great day quarter
Starter, starter, gotta be a starter, starter, starter, gotta be a starter
Starter, starter, So Icy starter, nigga you a bench warmer

If you think I'm done trappin'
'Cause I made it rappin'
Basically this is something that you don't really know about me
A ghetto superstar, riding through the six
Middle fingers up, screaming Sun Valley
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it
I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' it, I'm reppin' itEmbed
