13 ContributorsA Bigger Picture Called Free Lyrics
Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle
The masked struggle that I'm in, the same one that you in
I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Had to take it a step further the way that Ralph tried
Oh that's my stepfather
He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors
For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me
Black is the color of my true love spirit and I do love lyrics
And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club
Still I love

If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9
The toughest in Cook County
They count me out cause I did a crime
They say it's violent time in human beings
But being they ain't seeing me as human
In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones
My pops, y'all built and destroyed him
With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together
What I'ma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love

If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free, make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free, make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah2Embed
