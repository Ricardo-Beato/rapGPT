6 ContributorsNever Had Shit Lyrics
But I ain’t never had shit I ain’t never had shit
Had a lot of bags I ain’t never had shit
My wrist cost this and my watch cost this
And my bitch like this and .. like this
Cause I ain’t never had shit,  I ain’t never had shit
Stunting on these hoes  I ain’t never had shit
My wrist cost this and my bitch like this and my car like this and .. like this
I ain’t never had shit

My bitch real bad and my car real fast
Her neck and ears glass and it cost real cash
She ain’t never had shit I ain’t never had shit
She a top notch bitch I’m a top notch nigga gotta top notch club
Rich nigga rich white folks rich
Got the type of money could take a white man bitch
Man I’m up on these niggas had to ice my wrist man
I’m so up on these niggas had to ice my bitch
So turns up that I can never turn down
Remember me and four going in on a pound
Now I’m stunting on these hoes while my boy locked down
Soon as he touch down we gonna lock this town
I was a petty ass nigga til them blocks touchdown
Now i got the whole world tryna copy my sound
1017 nigga bricksquad time
Got a FN on me overtime I come around

But I ain’t never had shit I ain’t never had shit
Had a lot of bags I ain’t never had shit
My wrist cost this and my watch cost this
And my bitch like this and .. like this
Cause I ain’t never had shit,  I ain’t never had shit
Stunting on these hoes  I ain’t never had shit
My wrist cost this and my watch cost this
And my bitch like this and my car like this and .. like this
I ain’t never had shit

Now I’m balling all these bad bitches keep calling
Baby I’m smoking on pound fuck you on a cloud
This a stick up put your hands up and pull them panties down
Balling like a bitch but a nigga came from nothing
Now I’m filthy rich cause i
You a pussy baby won’t you show me how you buss it
I got a bus full of bitches and they following me on buses
Got a bus full of goons don't make niggas start bussing
Clique full of soldiers don’t make my niggas start rushing
We don’t give a fuck, fuck it, nigga came from nothing now I ball without a budget

But I ain’t never had shit I ain’t never had shit
Had a lot of bags I ain’t never had shit
My wrist cost this and my watch cost this
And my bitch like this and .. like this
Cause I ain’t never had shit,  I ain’t never had shit
Stunting on these hoes  I ain’t never had shit
My wrist cost this and my bitch like this and my car like this and .. like this
I ain’t never had shitEmbed
