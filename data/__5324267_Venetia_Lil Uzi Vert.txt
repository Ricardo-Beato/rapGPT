99 ContributorsVenetia Lyrics
Lil Uzi Vert, to be exact (Oh)
And I'm not from earth, I'm from outer space (Woah, let's go)
And I'm different (Uh), I'm wavy
I'm somewhere I'm not even 'posed to be ('Posed to be), yeah
I remember she ain't even notice me (Notice me), yeah
Why I'm trippin'? She ain't even old as me (Huh)
Her own man not even cold as me (Let's go)
Every time I have a show, gotta sell it out 'fore I go to sleep (Woah)

We got some new bands, we got some new bands, yeah, yeah
We got some new bands, we got some new bands, yeah, yeah (Let's go, let's go)
Treatin' these Diors like it's just old Vans, yeah, yeah
I fuck that lil' bitch, told her just bring her friend, yeah, yeah (Woah)
It's not for me, no, it's just for my mans, yeah, yeah
And I'ma just play with her pussy, yeah, as fast as I can, yeah, yeah (As fast as I can)
I'ma just count these racks, yeah, as fast as I can, yeah, yeah (As fast as I can)
I ain't never trust no bitch, I ain't never trust no man, yeah, yeah (Huh?)

Pull up in a brand new Porsche, followed by a matte black van, yeah, yeah
Never sit by the door, my boy got a matte black thang, bang, bang (Brrr)
All orange on me, baby, orange, yeah, look like Tang, yeah, yeah
I done did everything, ain't do no crack cocaine, yeah, yeah
I ain't never do no dope and your bitch wanna choke, yeah, yeah
And she will suck on this dick if she old enough to vote, yeah, yeah
I took that girl M-I-A, now she wanna drive the boat, yeah, yeah (Let's go)
Now she want my money, I said "Not at all, no, no" (No way)
Spanish girl, she always tryna get my pesos (Woo)
You can't get no money, you don't get no dough-dough (Dough)
She want all that verde, but pockets azul (Azul, azul)
Yeah, she likes my wordplay, no way they stoppin' you (Let's go, let's go)

Now, why the fuck would I give up on my gang if my gang never gave up on me? (Never)
I never, ever tell on my niggas, I don't care if they give me third degree (Fuck 'em)
I'm always gon' be a 1600 nigga with money connecting the streets (Yeah, yeah)
These niggas mad because they is not me, and my niggas, they all gonna eat, come on (Woah)
Wait, I can make a crazy girl go on a date
I can make a gay girl turn to a straight
Take off them jeans and put on her lace (Lace)
Fuck all of that, take your bitch, then I grab on her waist
Talk to the reverend, but I don't know Ma$e
I can not the see the haters, I got maced
Oh my God, oh my God, I'm in a Wraith (Yeah)
She pull up on me, then your bitch gettin' slayed
Louis V everything, I got the taste
She all on my face, so I know she wanna taste
Say I mumble too much, what the fuck is you saying?
Your girl in my bed, and you know she be layin'
She tell me her problems, act like I'm relatin' (One, two, three, let's go)
We got some new bands, we got some new bands, yeah, yeah
We got some new bands, we got some new bands, yeah, yeah
Treatin' these Diors like it's just old Vans, yeah, yeah
I fuck that lil' bitch, told her just bring her friend, yeah, yeah (Let's go, let's go)
It's not for me, no, it's just for my mans, yeah, yeah (Just for my mans)
And I'ma just play with her pussy, yeah, as fast as I can, yeah, yeah (As fast as I can)
