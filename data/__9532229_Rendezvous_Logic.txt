5 ContributorsRendezvous Lyrics
I’m feelin’ good, yeah, I’m feelin’ lovely
Backyard sunset, sippin on that Bubly
Ice Cube in my nightcap, it was a good day
You heard what the hood say, Logic what you should play
Killin’ shit like OJ, I’m rhymin’ like old Jay
Hip-hop phenom, play arenas like I’m Coldplay
Living life and feelin’ good
Live your life you really should
Feelin’ like you’re no good, but deep down you know you could, make your life better
Life’s a bitch but when it’s hard I don’t regret her
With age I get better, instead of
Obsessing over my youth, I’m over my youth
Give it my all, no I never give it less in the booth
I let it pour like liquor, I never lessen the proof
Shoot ‘em straight, no, I can’t water down the truth
Never felt accepted like college, they wouldn’t let him in
I guess I didn’t pass the test like I’m pissing amphetamine
They think they better than, me and my team rocking stages like we Greta Van
But all that shit they put me through made me a better man
An outcast like Sir Lucious, I murder it so Confucius
He say; the man who says he can, and the man who says he can’t, are both correct
I come with respect, you come for me, I come for your neck
Never gamble with your life because if you call, I will collect
Style I perfect, allow me to interject now

Ayo, yeah
I am eclectic, pick up the mic and spit true grit
Word to Hailee Steinfeld, know I rhyme well
Greatest lyricist to ever do it, only time will tell
I got ‘em, I got 'em all fuckin' calling it quits
I chop up the sample to bits and then resample that shit
A student of the game and you? An example of shit
Snake-type stab you with a steak knife
Swear this life is like a game of chess
My queen takes your knight, throw you down a flight if you down to fight
Wrote this song in half a night, just to check the rap game, aight?
Listen, ayo, these pages I write, more like the stages of life
Decided to pick up the pen and put down the device
A piece of advice: Your phone takes a piece of your life
So put that shit down, and keep your chin up in the meantime
This life has a lot more to offer you than screen-time
Let's rewind one time, divine when I spit the rhyme
This is lyrics, when you hear it bow down and revere it
Ain't no need to fear it unless your shit is whack
Got nothing but bars, word to Bourbon Street
Hard as concrete, take a scalpel to your ankles just to show you defeat
Let it register then peep the receipt
You sow what you reap
A lyrical freak far from my peek
And the word on the street I bring the heat
I can't lie to you, I'm here to body you
Crucify you then hit the motherfuckin' rendezvous1Embed
