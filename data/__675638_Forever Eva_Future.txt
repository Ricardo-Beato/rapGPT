I get that cash forever ever

Hang out the brain forever ever
Fuck all the fame forever ever

I hit the lot with them racks on me (Swear)
I went to court with that pack on me (Future)
I had that weed and that molly on me
I pour that lean by the gallon gallon
I got some rings and they mellow yellow (I did it)
Put twenty-five bitches in Margiela (Swear)
My heart in the ghetto, it's permanent (Future)
I'm stuck in the trenches, it's permanent
I swear I be hearing my granddaddy talk to me (Talk to me)
Stack up the mil' like some molly, yeah (Them M's)
Ride for these niggas who loyal
They gave me away, I'm an orphan (Ah)
Middle finger to my daddy, yeah (My daddy)
I had to get inside that paddywagon
Pop a few shots on 'em, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
I lay and play up in Bora Bora (Bora)
I splurge Chanel on the strength for you (Strength)
I know the rage of them demons (I know it)
I seen the doubt in they faces (They doubted me)
Niggas didn't think I would make it (Nah)
I did this shit, no limitation (No 'tation)
Prosperity, no hesitation (Future)
I'll go and give her that work
Then I pull off with a spaceship
I get that cash forever ever
I blow that money forever ever
Ride in that coupe forever ever
Hang out the brain forever ever
Fuck all the fame forever ever
I get them racks forever ever
I get them racks forever ever
I'd rather rap forever ever

The love that we got is forever ever
I got your back forever ever, yeah

I had some dirt on my shoulders, I wiped it off like I was Jigga, man
That Thrilla Manila, man (Man)
I growed up with dealers, man (Man)
I worked in the cold with that pole on me (Pole on me)
And then I went straight to that bowl on me (That bowl on me)
That yopper right there on the stove by me (Yeah)
Stack up that guala in shoeboxes (Yeah)
These bitches be loving my caterings (Yeah)
I told 'em off top I'm an alien (Ah)
Survived the trenches with wolves (Future)
I got it and blew out the roof (The roof)
Spent two dollars and change on the coupe (Skrtt)
Put change on your head and you're done
I get you hit up with drug money (Drug money)
Aggravated by the bullshit (Bullshit)
I told you I ain't have a conscience (Conscience)
Fuck around and kill your mama (Your mama)
In them Maisons and find you like Jason (Jason)
That's Maison Margiela, you follow me? (Designer)

I can see 'em when they doubted me (I got 'em)
They know they should've never doubted me
