20 ContributorsAyo Lyrics
Ayo, ayo
I'm just tryna lay low
I don't give a fuck about what y'all talkin' 'bout
And anythin' you wanna say though
'Cause I'ma get mine, I'ma do me
Have a good time, everybody gon' see
'Cause life's too short to fuck with y'all
And I'm with all my homies
Livin' that life that you wish you was livin'
Ain't talkin' 'bout money, that shit is a given
Ain't talkin' 'bout money and none of that, nah, never that
But I'm talkin' 'bout happiness
I'm talkin' 'bout people who know just how beautiful happy is
I'm here to hold you down
I'm here for you now
Don't let 'em think they know you now, say

I can't fuckin' stand you anymore (Ayo, ayo)
And I don't think you'll ever know
Ayo, ayo (Ayo), ayo, ayo (Ayo), ayo, ayo
Ayo, ayo (Ayo), ayo, ayo (Ayo), ayo, ayo
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin'— Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma— I'ma come through and show my wood pine, I'ma— I'ma come— (Hey)
You might also like
Well, it's a beautiful day
To sit back and smoke on some hay
Leanin' back with my kicks up
I'm in my zone in my home and I'm mindin' my own
Tryin' not to get mixed up in them shenanigans
With you and your man again
No need for panickin'
But last time I almost ended up stiff as a mannequin
On this side, it's darker than Anakin
Takin' the rides is long and exhausting
At the end though, what is it costing?
Not just for me, but my family, and offspring
Got drive like I'm Ryan Gosling
So I put my key in the ignition
Puttin' myself in a better position
And I no longer need your permission, listen

I can't fuckin' stand you anymore (Ayo, ayo)
And I don't think you'll ever know
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin'— Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma— I'ma come through and show my wood pine, I'ma— I'ma come—
Knockin' doors— Knockin'— Knockin' doors down— down
Knockin' doors— Knock— Knock— Knock— Knock— Knockin' doors down
I'ma— I'ma come through— I'ma— I'ma come— down
I'ma come through— I'ma— I'ma come— down
Ayo, man, yo, seriously, y'all
I just wanna thank y'all so much for comin' out tonight, man
You have no idea, dawg, like
Fuckin' two years ago, it was 2009, you know what I'm sayin?
I was just startin' to get into this shit
And now— now here we are, two years later
We're fuckin' rockin' out on stage for a packed crowd
Yo, I never in a million fuckin' years would've thought
That I'd be playin' for a hundred and fifty people, man
Yo, I'm humbled, bro, I'm fuckin' honored, yo
I'ma keep spreadin' the message of peace, love, and positivity
I promise, man, I love y'all, I love hip-hop
I'm so excited to see where this journey takes us
Yo, shout out to all my fuckin' homies, man
Big Lenbo, 6ix, my DJ BossPlayer, Castro
Fuckin' overhypin' and shit, hahaha (Ayy, fuck you, nigga)
Nah, you know I'm fuckin' with you, bro
I just wanna shout out every single person out there supportin', man
Yo, you have my word, like, I love y'all
I'm always gonna do this shit from my heart
I'ma do it for the fans
Like, it— this shit is a fuckin' dream come true
Like, a hundred and fifty people here tonight
Who knows what we could be?
But I promise you, I give you my word here and now
I won't never changeEmbed
