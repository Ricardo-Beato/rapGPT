22 ContributorsPuppets Lyrics
I know a guy with a rock star life
But he still don't fly, so he's mad at the sky
He sits me down, he kicks his wisdom
He's been around, I give him a listen
Seems like he's got a lot of complaints
About how nowadays things ain't the same
Used to place some faith in the basement
A toast for this guy and those kids that he came with
Cause they all on the same shit
Based on cut down placement
Uptown stay strong
Don't ever do a dance with the devil now
That smile is a sign that you're sellin' out
Judgement, gossip, ethics
Let's just exploit all this excess
Then you can feel how he feels
To walk around town lookin' down from them tall heels
And who needs fame or fortune
When you get the same love that the famous snortin'?
A future so afraid of yours
That you strayed from the course
And you came up short
Believe he would have more credibility
If he wasn't just another drunk pill junky
It's obvious to me that he's still hungry
For the superstars a little bad lucky
Go ahead and get mad at God
Point your fingers at your dad and at Santa Claus
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Wouldn't look so bad with the bandage off

It goes one for the bar tab, two for the shine
Let's go to your car, do another line
Barely trust 'em, they're all puppets
Love is nothin', scared of success
One for the bass, two for the drums
Last call gonna take whatever comes
Barely trust 'em, they're all puppets
Love is nothin', scared of success

I think it's great how you used to be great
I can't hate on how you choose to relate
But I know that you had the potential
I understand why you wanted to let go
A lot of pressure in the middle of those shoulders
And we ain't getting nothin' but older
Ain't nothin' changed but the day we run from
But nobody knows that better than you, huh?

One for the bar tab, two for the shine
Let's go to your car and do another line
Barely trust 'em, they're all puppets
Love is nothin', scared of success
One for the bass, two for the drums
Last call gonna take whatever comes
Barely trust 'em, they're all puppets
Love is nothin', scared of success
One for the bar tab, two for the shine
Let's go to your car and do another line
Barely trust 'em, they're all puppets
Love is nothin', scared of success
One for the bass, two for the drums
Last call gonna take whatever comes
Barely trust 'em, they're all puppets
Love is nothin', scared of success
Barely trust them they're all puppets
Love is nothing scared of success3Embed
