4 ContributorsInterlude 6 LyricsLet's see This is a song, um, heh This is a song that, um
The way it was born was very, st- was interesting
Um, my husband's brother came by the house to visit us one day, Brother Ziggy and, he, he was, um he was talking about a song of his called "I Get Out", and uh, uh
It was so powerful, the concept
And, and what it meant, to, to me, you know?
And what it meant for me
He just said that phrase
He said, "I get out"
And he said, "I get out of all your boxes"
And immediately, I just said
"That's it, man, that's it right there"
And the next day, you know
I got in the shower, and while I was in the shower
'Bout three verses and a hook
And all this stuff just came, you know?
And I called him, and I played it for him
Over the phone, all excited, you know
I was like, "Ziggy, you like, but no, ha-ah"
I don't know what's gonna come of this song
I know that he wanted to do one
And we'll see, you know, but, uh, see what happens
But, this is um
My version of the same powerful message
Because it most certainly, is, is very power, powerful
But, uh, I-I'm gonna read this one a little bit
'Cause it, it's fresh, you know, it's fresh
Still a little fresh, I, I wanna make sure that
I get all the words in So, if I pause a little bit, you know
Like I said, its g-, it's reality, so
But ya'll got, I think ya'll got that by now
You know, ha-ha Heh heh heh Alright, let's see
Not that I wrote it in, in a size that I can even read
It's like litte... Okay
Alright, alright, Zig, heh-heh-heh-hehYou might also likeEmbed
