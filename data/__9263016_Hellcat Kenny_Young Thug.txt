I been in the trenches givin' everythin' back (Everythin' back)
You can ask my homies and my goddamn hoes (Yeah)
All this motherfuckin' money off my shows (What?), off of the road (Road)
Put these boys on spoke (Hey)
For fifty, he gone broke (Grah)
Hellcat the folks, suck me out my clothes
Shawty came with force (What?)
Fuck lil' homie claimin'? Keep that on the porch (Ha), damn

None of these niggas, they spittin' the facts
Fuckin' that bitch, do it right from the back
Most of my niggas, they loyal, huh
I ain't even gotta look, turnin' my back (Yeah)
Some of these niggas out here, they be rats
I walk around with three million in my bag
I put the birds in the back of a Track'
Cat on my car, but this shit not a Jag'
My bitch is a frea-ea-ea-eak (Yeah, yeah)
She beggin' me just to come piss in her crack
I looked at her crazy, I never did that (Huh?)
This my first time doin' that and I did it

We don't hold no grudges 'cause business is business, bitch (Yeah, huh?)
