Zaytoven
Get the fuck off the block, man
I don't even know you, B
You don't be with the gang, nigga
You don't make this thing go bang, nigga
You know what I'm sayin'
Call up gang, nigga
Skudda-skuh, doo-doo-doo, bang, nigga
You know what I'm at? Ayy

Major capper alert, major capper
Major capper alert, I'm a major capper
Major capper alert, I'm a major capper
Major capper oh, oh, I'm a major capper
I'm cappin', ayy
Assign sent, gotta find, got it, ayy
Ayy, I'm bracked out, boolin'
What's crackin'? I'm coolin'
Okay, Kool-Aid, okay, Kool-Aid
Okay, Kool-Aid, okay, Kool-Aid
Okay, Kool-Aid, okay, Kool-Aid
Okay, Kool-Aid, okay, Kool-Aid
Okay, Kool-Aid, okay, Kool-Aid
(So, y'all know "Okay, Kool-Aid?"
That mean "Okay, cool," "Okay, bool"
Whatever you wanna say, you know what I'm sayin'?)

I got the popcorn when I start shootin' (You hear me?)
Shootin' at you, you, and you and
I got a hundred for you, you, and you and, ayy
I got a fifty for him and his crew and, ayy
Nike, bitch, I come through doin', ayy
I'm doin' what you never knewin', ayy
Pull up foreign, now I'm riding stupid (Skrrt, ridin')
I pulled up sliding stupid (Skrrt, slidin')
Shawty Lo, man, my diamonds foolish (Shawty Lo, man, my diamonds)
Ain't got a jet, ayy, I'm riding stupid (Ayy, I'm ridin', ayy)
I'm just freestyling to it (Freestyling, ayy)
I just get to it, wildin' through it (Wildin', gang)
I ain't going through, I'm wilding through it, ayy (Wildin' through it)
I'm spending cash like it's nothing to it (Nothin' to it)
You can hear my chains in music
Ayy, I meant you can hear my chains up in the music (Okay, so this why I got a lil' confused)
I come up and I'm banging stupid (I'm bangin' though, I'm always banging)
I come up and I'm slanging Cupid to all the hoes (I'm slangin' love to these hoes)
But I don't believe in Cupid (I don't believe in love, nah)
I think that shit is so stupid (That shit is so, so)
I came through and I'm fucking tripping (Came through, oh)
The hoes like, "So what you doin'?" (What you doin'?)
Say, "I'm wilding, man, I'm living life" (I'm wildin', ayy)
I don't think twice when I'm finna buy (Beep, don't stand a chance)
I don't think twice when I'm finna fuck (When I'm finna fuck that bitch, ayy)
I mean she don't think twice when she finna suck (She finna suck that dick, ayy)
I came through busting like Dillinger (Like Dillinger)
Fuck nigga get your feelings hurt (Nigga, get your feelings hurt)
He wanna cry, that nigga jealous (He jealous, wow)
I'm rocking Margielas (Margielas, ayy)
I'm a no belt rocking (I'm a no belt rocking)
Pull up, show stopping (Pull up, show stopping)
Nigga, you know how I'm rocking (You know how the rock I'm rocking)
I'm shining like my Johnny (Shining like my Johnny)
Bitch pussy funky (Funky, bitch)
Told her, "Bitch, my weed funky" (My weed funky, bitch)
I don't wanna fuck you, dummy (I don't wanna fuck you, bitch)
You a dirty bitch, you a junkie, ayy (You a slander, bitch)
Came through smoking funky, stinky (Bitch, ayy)
And I got my thingy and blingy (Bitch)
I shoot your fucking scalp (Scalp)
Iâ€™m rapping like I'm off a fuckin flap (Fuckin' flap)
Doors flapping (Doors flappin')
I come through, not doin' Charles nothin'
Tell my maid wash my clothes (Wash my clothes)
I told my maid watch my hoes (Watch my hoes)
These hoes might steal something (Might steal somethin')
I don't want to hit 'em with the steel, nah (With the steel, nah)
My bitch got a steel nose (Got a steel nose)
When she thick, she think she got some steel toes (Think she got some steel toes)
What the fuck was that? That ass was tweakin', though
Hahaha, bangEmbed
