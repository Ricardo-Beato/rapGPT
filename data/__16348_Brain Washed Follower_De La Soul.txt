Feeling
POS: Yo what's up man, my name is Pos
MASE: What's up, I'm Mase. Yo, shorty, what's your name?
JEFF: Oh, my name? Jeff. You guys are walking? Now rappers ain't
Supposed to walk
POS: Sorry little man, but you know...
JEFF: Jeff. I told you, my name is Jeff. If you guys are rappers
Where's your dukey gold chains? Y'all don't have no dukey gold chains
MASE: We don't wear gold chains, we'd rather spend our money on
More important things like, equipment, necessities...
DE LA SOUL: And video games!
JEFF: Y'all are crazy. No chains, dag. Okay, where's your BMW?
You're not supposed to walk. Where's your Jeeps, your Maximas?
DOVE: Maximas? Yo, Maxin' would break my flow. And with the cause of
Gas, Jeff man, I'd rather take the transit that's mass
JEFF: What you say? You are C-R-A-Z-E-E. Crazee. Don't you know you
Can't be def if you don't have no gold? Or a car, man? What's up?
MASE: Who told you that?
JEFF: Everybody who's def has gold, cars, money, girls, clothes...
MASE: Wait a minute, wait a minute, shorty, you're buggin'. Do you like
Plug Tunin' and
Potholes?
JEFF: Yeah that song's def
POS: But we don't wear no gold chains, nor do we ride BMWs and
Maxes or Jeeps, yet you still think our music is def, right? Wait a
Minute. Did I say 'def'?
DE LA SOUL: Rrrr-RRAH!
JEFF: What?
POS: Nothing, nothing. It's just that we don't deal with all that
Materialistic stuff, but we still got what it takes to please and
Supply our listeners, understand my man?
JEFF: Where's your beepers? Why don't you have beepers? Everybody wears beepers. You have to have beepers to look down
MASE: AAAUUGHHH! Little man is brainwashed indeed!
DOVE: Nah, nah. Beepers are the least of status situators, man. Plus
I find them ugly as parking tickets
JEFF: You guys talk funny
POS: Well actually our verbal is kinetic, so when released flow A to
Z is perfectly pitched in advance in intricacy
JEFF: Yeah you homeboys are really bugged
POS: Wait a minute. Did he say...
MASE: Bugged?
DE LA SOUL: Rrrr-RRAH!
JEFF: So no car, no beepers, no gold. That's weak man, that's weak
DOVE: Jesus, did he say "weak?" Jesus, they never learn
POS: Foolish mind, have I, have I
