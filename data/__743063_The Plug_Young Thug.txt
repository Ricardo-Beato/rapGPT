6 ContributorsThe Plug Lyrics
Thug World Bitch

I'm high, I'm high, I'm high right now
We the plug, I don't need a plug
We is the plug, we is the plug, we is the plug, we is the plug
We ain't

My crew the number one ballers baby
My crew the number one ballers baby
Been gettin' numbers forgettin' to call 'em baby
I might fuck her, in two days I'mma give them all a baby
We ride like Marta baby
I'mma motherfuckin' Martian baby
You a motherfuckin' walker baby
If you ever, ever play they gone be choppin' you baby
Shit, I'm up in the 'io, uh
Or I'm up in your ho, uh, and someone toe ya dig?
Or I'm up in the Bentley and them tires skinny
And my ring worth twenty
Let go

I'm high, I'm high, I'm high right now
We the plug, I don't need a plug
We is the plug, we is the plug, we is the plug, we is the plug
We ain't

I say - I bet you can't do it like me, I bet you can't do it like me
I'm so high right now, I'm BEAD
I'm flyee, FLYEE
You're a thottie, THOTTIE
Hold up, freeze me, punk ass ho tryna tease me
Really wanna fuck my tattoos, tattoo man please leave me
My wrist is cold but the heat on me degrees me
The ho made Young Thug nut in two minutes, look easy me
Shit, either I need new Ballyâ€™s or my shoes was Clearance
Or I was drunk off your nanny
My tint means stay back
The 2012 Maybach, I just bought Maybach
Let go

I'm high, I'm high, I'm high right now
We the plug, I don't need a plug
We is the plug, we is the plug, we is the plug, we is the plug
We ain't1Embed
