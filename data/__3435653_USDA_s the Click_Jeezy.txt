USDA, USDA
USDA's the clique

Snowman, kill 'em with the flow tho
Back to '93, twelve hunned for a O
Brick mason, yeah, I work them blocks
Tryna build a foundation, yeah, I stack them bricks
Dope sold, paper fold, call it money in the bank
Honda Accord, four bricks in the tank
Y'all niggas ain't no killers, y'all niggas some hoes
Mac-11 spit a loogie, nigga, wet up ya clothes
500 on the purp, so I'm high tonight
Made mack with the chauffeur, so I'm ridin' tonight
Play it how it go, I'on fuck with the snitches
150 on my chain, and it's all for the bitches
