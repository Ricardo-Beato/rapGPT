77 ContributorsWhat’s the Move Lyrics
(BL$$D)
I just let lil' mama suck me up, girl
Is you tryna cry in a Rolls Royce or the bus‚ girl?
I jumped off the porch and went straight up‚ girl (Straight up‚ girl)
You can leave your town and head to another world

What the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you
I'm tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain mines too
I made it rain on you
When it was hard to maintain too
I was playin' games with you
Like you could never play games too, woah (Yeah)

You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
Louis Vuitton, diamonds‚ keep calm (Okay)
All you do is point at what you want (Point it out)
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon (Oh yeah)
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
Nigga tryna buy the cash cost (Woo)
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P‚ I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy

Drip, drip, no shoestring my sneaker, won't trip
My jeans is so tight they don't fit
Still walk around with a stick on my hip
VVS diamonds right behind my lip
Don't walk with less than fifty on my wrist
Diamonds so cold on my neck, it got me sick
Raf Simons, mix it up with the Rick
Flexin' on these haters who sent me 'my bad'
Made it from the soil, made it from the Rex
Richer than your first, richer than your last
LUV, know I got swag
Pop a rubber band, pop another Xan'
I groove around, party pack my hand
I'm seeing double lookin' through my lens
Tell me what you want, I just want your friend

You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
Louis Vuitton, diamonds, keep calm (Okay)
All you do is point at what you want (Point it out)
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon (Oh yeah)
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
Nigga tryna buy the cash cost (Woo)
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P, I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy
Diamonds, they drip down my wrist
Let's get it, fuck all the skits, woo
Left wrist sittin' on a brick (Left wrist)
Bitch have it locked like a pick (Sheesh)
Fittz Park, came for the shit
Grab a AK for the wrist
Gorilla, rockin' Bape on a bitch
Potential court case on a bitch (Bitch)
We livin' state to state on a bitch (We livin' state to state, yeah)
We never ever play with the bitch (We never ever play, no)
Do everything the same on a bitch (Never tell the difference)
We known to pick the brains of a bitch (Big bag)
I throw the big B's on a bitch
I got a few C's on a bitch (Got slatt)
I'm in another league on a bitch
My diamond 'bout to ski on a bitch (Woo)

What's the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you (Oh, yeah)
I was tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain mines too (Yeah)
Make it rain on you (Make it rain, rain)
It was hard to maintain too, ooh (It was hard to maintain)
I was playin' games with you
Like you couldn't play games too, hey, okay
You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
Louis Vuitton, diamonds, keep calm (Okay)
All you do is point at what you want (Point it out)
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon (Oh yeah)
