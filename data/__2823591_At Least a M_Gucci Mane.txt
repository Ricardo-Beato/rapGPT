At least a M
(Mike WiLL Made It)
(Zaytoven)

I'm a walkin' lick, I look like a robber
You niggas ain't mobbin', you know you got a problem
You niggas ain't legit (No), see Gucci with the shit
You keep on talkin' slick, then I'ma go and get the stick (Grra)
Gutter as it get, still the talkin' brick (Skrrt)
Used to have 'em ninety-six impalas sittin' on blades chopped and that was ninety-six (Catch up)
They treat me like a prince
When I was behind the fence you was actin' like a bitch
So I might slap you like a pimp (Woah), my chef is cookin' shrimp (Skrrt)
The haters tryna knock me off my throne but they can't do it, it's like the thirtieth attempt
And you look like a wimp, and I don't even associate with niggas
Who associates don't have at least a M (Don't have at least a M)

Have at least a M (Ms)
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M (Ms)
Have at least a M (M)
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M (M)
Have at least a M (M)
I don't even associate with niggas whose associates don't have at least a M (M)
Have at least a M (It's a M)
I don't even associate with niggas whose associates don't have at least a M

I love the letter M (Huh?)
Gucci Mane a G, I'm from BC, Bouldercrest and I be skrapped up to the T (Grra)
I used to have them P's (P's), I got 'em from AZ
And I used to pay like one for 'em, sell 'em for the three (Shh)
R.I.P. to E (E)
How you let a nigga in a motherfuckin' wheelchair beat, you to the cheese (Damn)
You deserve a D' (D')
Y'all ain't really flunk but you punks gettin' a lil' money, but ain't get money like me (Huh?)
I'm steady pushin' three (Three)
Or you can call it age, but ain't no need to call me unless you got ninety G's (Right)
I'm tryna make a B
You tryna make a play but get the fuck up out my face 'cause, nigga, you the F-E-D-S (Wee)

Have at least a M (Ms)
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M (Ms)
Have at least a M (M)
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M (M)
Have at least a M (M)
I don't even associate with niggas whose associates don't have at least a M (M)
Have at least a M (It's a M)
I don't even associate with niggas whose associates don't have at least a M

I mean like, would I need a nigga 'round me who associates don't even have at least a M (Have a least a M)
You ain't got to be rich to talk to Gucci (Uh), but you gotta be part of somethin' (Yeah)
So you mean to tell me your daddy (M), your momma, your brother, your partner
Ain't nobody gettin' no money? (Shit)
So everybody 'round you broke? (Ha-ha-ha, have at least a M)
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with that, man (Oh hell, no)
Nah, for real, I'm with you Gucc' (M)
I thought, you know, I thought your uncle or somethin' played for the Hawks
Ain't nobody play no pro ball or nothin'? Ain't nobody got nothin'?
Shit, my phone's ringin', this gotta be some money right here
