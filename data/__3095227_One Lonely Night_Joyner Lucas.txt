35 ContributorsOne Lonely Night Lyrics
Yo, what's up, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace

You told me not to take it there
I swear to God, man I wasn't supposed to make it here, ah-ah
I wasn't supposed to make it here, ah-ah (Ay)
Close your eyes when you pray at night
But all the money in the world couldn't save your life, ah-ah
The money couldn't save your life, ah-ah (Uh)

What you gon' do when the club close down
And the liquor runs out and you're all by yourself?
What a lonely night (A lonely night)
One lonely night
What you gon' do when the weed don't ease your brain
And numb your pain like it used to?
That's one lonely night (Yeah)
One lonely night (Yeah)

Hennessy by the bottles, double D's on the models
Plenty trees, we can have as many dreams as we want to
That's my life, a-yah-yah-yah
I'ma be alright, a-yah-yah-yah
Gold teeth and some Benzes, twenty-twos and some bitches
Strip clubs every night, that's the life that I'm livin'
And it's mine, a-yah-yah-yah
I'ma be just fine, a-yah-yah-yah
You might also like
What you gon' do when the party close down
And the drugs run out and you're all by yourself?
What a lonely night (Ay)
One lonely night (Uh)
What you gon' do when the pills don't ease your brain
And numb your pain like it used to?
That's one lonely night (Ay)
One lonely night (Yeah)

I just want some weed now
I let you in and all you did was let me down, ah-ah
You let me down, ah-ah
Close your eyes when you pray at night
But all the money in the world couldn't save your life, ah-ah
All the money couldn't save your life, ah-ah

Hey what's up, it's me
Um, I know you're probably not expecting
To hear from me right now but
I just left the club and ain't gonna lie, I'm a little drunk
And all my friends left me, I'm so sad
I really don't want to be alone tonight, so could you come over?
(*Sighs*) I shouldn't have even went out tonight like
I've just been so lost lately, there's been so much on my mind
But I miss you, please call me back
You're like the only one I can talk to, for real
I love you, but I'm so lonely, please baby
Hennessy by the bottles, double D's on the models
Plenty trees, we can have as many dreams as we want to
That's my life, a-yah-yah-yah
I'ma be alright, a-yah-yah-yah
Gold teeth and some Benzes, twenty-twos and some bitches
Strip clubs every night, that's the life that I'm livin'
And it's mine, a-yah-yah-yah
I'ma be just fine, a-yah-yah-yah
What a lonely night
One lonely night

Oh shit, oh shit, here we go again
Make sure you take them clothes off, bitch I'm going in
And you gon' take this dick while I press record
And tonight you my slave, don't you ever tell me no again
Said don't you ever tell me no again
Bitch I'm possessive and I never let you go again
Oh who hittin' you phone at two in the morning?
And I had to tell that nigga, "Don't you ever text my hoe again"
Said, "Don't you ever text my hoe again
Look nigga, I don't care how long you been friends
I don't care if you knew each other since you was kids"
Bitch, I don't care if your little brother is cool with his
I'm the shit, oh shit, where the noise at?
Everybody got a squad, can't avoid that
Niggas screaming "Gang gang gang," oh yeah
But when the shit hit the fan, where your boys at?
Oh shit, oh shit, I don't have a Visa
I think I'ma fall in love with a ballerina
Just let me hit it and I ain't waitin' for marriage neither
Cause she gon' fall and I'ma ball like alopecia
Heh, I said I go bald like alopecia
I turned to God and then read the Bible and grabbed the heater
I want a mansion in Hollywood and Pasadena
But I still ain't got shit and I ain't too happy neither
And everything was all good just a week ago
I heard some shit about you, I ain't believe it though
Cause I don't listen to the gossip or tea and go
And treat your differently cause niggas wanted me to know
Huh, yeah that's for you to guess and me to know
And shorty said I'm cold hearted, my shit three below
Yeah I just ran into the bank, give me all the bread
I ain't really want to do it but I need the dough
Oh shit, here we go again
Make sure you take them clothes off, bitch I'm going in
But you gon' take this dick while I press record
And tonight you my slave, don't you ever tell me no again
(*Crying*) Shut the fuck up, hoe
Look, don't you ever tell me no again
Bitch I'm possessive and I'll never let you go again
But who hittin' you phone at two in the morning?
And I had to tell that nigga, "Don't you ever text my hoe again"
Woo! Yeah, don't you ever text my hoe again
Cause I'm possessive and I'll never let you go again
Hah, don't you ever call my phone again
Yo, yo, hello, you
The fuck? Whoa2Embed
