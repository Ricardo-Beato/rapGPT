7 ContributorsOn and On LyricsHook:
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on

The game don't stop it goes on and on
Ain't a damn thing changed just because I was gone
I be robbing mad niggas in the street for loot
Since there ain't no money in jail, I'm taking sneaks or boots
Inmates is getting bust wide open over jew-els
Names rings two bells, so large I got two cells
On the Island it was strictly a bing thing
Niggas know the half, from the L to Sing Sing
Ding Ding! Another knock out on the lock out
Money was kinda big so I bought the soap and sock out
Hit him up quick and ran up in his cell
Robbed him and scared the motherfucker to tell
C.Os give a nigga respect, they know my style
I'm going all out with two fifths running wild
I'll play the low until it's time to do what I gotta do
So just hope I ain't scheming on you
Hook:
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on

First get knocked off, coming through the bullpen
A nigga running his mouth, about how he had pull when
Another nigga tries his hand he bitches up
And that'll be a nigga, that the doctors stitches up
You know a nigga pussy when he says that "I'm
Not really looking for trouble, I just wanna do my time"
Fucks me up, don't turn into a Christian now
The Lord won't save that ass when I take your chow
But after that it'll be aight shorty, shit'll be merry
Just wash my clothes and give up the commissary
Bitches I used to fuck with it is cut off
I got enough on my mind, doing time Up North
Hold up, I got my eye on these white guys
One of them got on a pair of Timbs and they my size
You know what happens next, I ain't even have to say it
Wherever I'm at, that's how I play it
Hook:
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
Tiiiiiimes up, I'm playing the gate, watching the clock
On my way out, trade in my soap and sock for a Glock
Back on the block, seeing a lot of new faces
Which means more money from a lot of new places
I give a nigga every reason to trust me
But if you don't want to get robbed you better bust heat
Bumped into a nigga, I remember from up top
Looked him up and down (AIYYO), "What's up Hobb?"
In jail he was washing draws and shit
Now that we both out, money gots to be a Vic
A crab nigga so it's only right I shit on him
Should I smack him first, or sick the Pit on him
He said he's got a whole block and he's running it
I played him like he played hisself, had him sonning it
Take it from a real nigga whose word is bond
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
Hook:
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and on
On and on, on and on
The game don't stop, it goes on and onEmbed
