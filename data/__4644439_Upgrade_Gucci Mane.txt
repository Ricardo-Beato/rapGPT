10 ContributorsUpgrade Lyrics
Huh
Ain't nobody like you
Wow, huh

Don't need no upgrade, 'cause you're my upgrade
You taste like strawberry with sugar on top and some whipped cream
Ain't nobody fuckin' with you, girl, I like the way you're shaped
Ain't wasting no time, I'ma fuck you right now, freaking to Jodeci
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you

I've been thinkin' 'bout you constantly, girl, I can't even lie
Be to hard to leave you 'lone, baby, I can't even try
Yeah, your looks the first thing captured me, girl, I can't even lie
Way your gap keep lookin' at me, hard for me look in your eyes
Fuck your friends, don't tell 'em shit 'bout me, them bitches love to pry (It's Gucci)
Never met a nigga half of me, they devils in disguise
All the stupid shit I do, I wish I knew the reason why
All the things I put you through, I know that you my ride or die
Heard the cops was lookin' for me, you know you my alibi
Know it's hard to love me sometimes and you tryin' hard not to cry
Every day my life is wonderful and you the reason why
I get too cocky, man, I'm feeling myself, I need some humble pie
You might also like
Don't need no upgrade, 'cause you're my upgrade
You taste like strawberry with sugar on top and some whipped cream
Ain't nobody fuckin' with you, girl, I like the way you're shaped
Ain't wasting no time, I'ma fuck you right now, freaking to Jodeci
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you

I know anything that I want, I can get it though
I know you was special, when I met you I admitted though
I told you how it gotta be and you said you was with it, so
I can peep by the convo, you not no silly ho
Yeah, I own all the cars you seen in the video
Do you know you lookin' at a cold-hearted gigolo?
Diamonds in my Figaro, run circles 'round a square, ho
She don't wanna downgrade, she's Gucci Mane LaFlare's ho
Head on the yacht, cool, fuck me on the chair, ooh
Suck me in the air, woah, baby got a rare throat
Hard dog, black crow, passenger, ass swole
North Pole, ice froze, red paint, good scroll

Don't need no upgrade, 'cause you're my upgrade
You taste like strawberry with sugar on top and some whipped cream
Ain't nobody fuckin' with you, girl, I like the way you're shaped
Ain't wasting no time, I'ma fuck you right now, freaking to Jodeci
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
Ain't nobody like you
Ain't nobody like you (Upgrade, upgrade)
(J. White, I need a beat I can go off on, ooh)
Ain't nobody like
Ain't nobody like youEmbed
