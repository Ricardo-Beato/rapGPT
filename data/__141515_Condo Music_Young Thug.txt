18 ContributorsCondo Music Lyrics
I'll shoot at you and yo ho, like a porno movie
I'm always high, call this condo music
And if the girl wanna come, let her in
Word around town is that them young niggas went in
I'm sittin' at the end while you still beginning
I love her friends, I love her friends, oh yeah

He ain't came in my spot, come skatin' under my blocks
Unless you heard 'bout it, then get shot, I ain't no ho, nigga
And even at a concert, I'll show a nigga
Or just like double seals, I'll pour that nigga
That's my protocol, my word law
My birds soft, my horse boss
Feed me, feed me
I don't rap for free, the opposite of freebee
I want a whole grammy, I wanna hit yo nanny
I'll take another .5 now I'm the last standing
I call him Damu Nick, 'cause he stay with that cannon
And he gon' sit in your front yard, even if you was Stanley

I'll shoot at you and yo ho, like a porno movie
I'm always high, call this condo music
And if the girl wanna come, let her in
Word around town is that them young niggas went in
I'm sittin' at the end while you still beginning
I love her friends, I love her friends, oh yeah

I should take a pic, all this fly shit I got on
I'm fly, I'm fly, like I've been airborne
Yo girl suck me up, she suck me up like she work on porn
It's so hot, it's so hot call her remy like all star
I'll take a aim and skeet right in her jaw
You ain't gettin' paper that's a personal problem, it ain't my fault
I'm too focused and level-headed, fill up a money vault
You try some stupid shit, pull out the sticks and come chalk 'em out
I'm on four different drugs, shit I'm high as a loft
I just buy expensive clothes, fuck what the shit cost
Keep a closet full of work, ain't no such thing as drought
'Migo drop 'em off, we get 'em in and we get 'em out

I'll shoot at you and yo ho, like a porno movie
I'm always high, call this condo music
And if the girl wanna come, let her in
Word around town is that them young niggas went in
I'm sittin' at the end while you still beginning
I love her friends, I love her friends, oh yeah6Embed
