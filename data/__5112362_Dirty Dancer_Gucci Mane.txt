Uh

And she dance to the song (Yeah)
She my sunshine, I ain't never comin' home (Ooh)
Ooh, she dance to the song (Song)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Money on the table (Oh)
Perfect like Eve but I'm no Abel (Oh)
She make the crowd go, "Ooh," she smooth
Money on the table (Oh)
Sweet like fruit but I'm no Abel (Oh)
She make the crowd go, "Ooh," she smooth

Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
She want it to rain so I throw these bands up
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
I don't want nobody but you (Go)

GPS, my pimpin', baby, fuck with me tonight
I won't lead you wrong, won't you let me in your life? (Woo)
All this ice I'm rockin', you know I can't wait in line
I got all this money but don't have a lot of time
Money stacked up too high, ain't no way I'm fallin' off (No)
All these wolves we brought out, she like "I'll just follow y'all"
I just came to ball out, I make these bitches have withdrawal
She say every time she see me that she hittin' the mall (It's Gucci)
You might also like
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
She want it to rain so I throw these bands up
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
I don't want nobody but you (Go)

Big boy business, came up independent
Straight up out the trenches, add it up (Skrr)
This lil' bitch, she bad as fuck (Wow)
Money make her get nasty, yeah (Yeah)
I'ma let her ride passenger
All the dope boys won't fuck on her
Killin' these hoes, it's a massacre
Every time she pull up, fuck it up
Heard you fell in love with a trafficker (Skrr)
Love when we fuck, it's rough as fuck
She snuck in that Derringer
Don't run up on us, don't try your luck
Broke niggas keep tryin' her (What?)
But they gon' have to step it up (Damn)
Rich niggas keep flyin' her
So it's gettin' hard to keep in touch

And she dance to the song (Yeah)
She my sunshine, I ain't never comin' home (Ooh)
Ooh, she dance to the song (Song)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Money on the table (Oh)
Perfect like Eve but I'm no Abel (Oh)
She make the crowd go, "Ooh," she smooth
Money on the table (Oh)
Sweet like fruit but I'm no Abel (Oh)
She make the crowd go, "Ooh," she smooth
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
She want it to rain so I throw these bands up
Dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
I don't want nobody but you

Dirty dancer, dirty dancer
She wanted to throw these bands up
Dirty dancer, dirty dancer
I don't want nobodyEmbed
