7 ContributorsMeltdown Lyrics
Bet it, bet it taste like candy

I broke up wit my ex I couldn't take his sarcasm
Everytime we bone I had to fake an orgasm
Moanin and groanin tried to make him feel manly
I'd rather use my toys, plus my hands come in handy
I finally told him that my heart was somewhere else
Whenever we sexed I wished that he was someone else
That dude that approached me at the bar the other night
That be the mister right and hot enough to melt some ice
I think I'm in love like Beyonce be with Jigga
It's not his major figure that want him to be my nigga
He got that magic stick that make my little pussy quiver
Juices runnin like a river slowly down my kitty litter
Boy I'm so glad I found a nigga like you
A thug like you to make a girl say - ooh
Hope he feel as strong as my po hah do
With you by my side its like I'm drunk off booze
If you be my man only my man
I wouldn't mind tastin' your magic stick, magic stick
If you don't cheat or sleep around
Ain't nothing wrong with tastin' your magic stick
You might also like
I bet it taste like candy, made to melt in my mouth
I know you got plenty, baby you the shit
Now what you workin wit candy made to melt in my mouth
I know you got plenty, I like the way, I like the way
I like the way, I like the way

I like the way you work your stick boo
The way you work it like voodoo
The way you wind and you wind and you grind
Don't stop the way you work your stick
Baby the way you work your stick
Baby keep on and keep on and keep on keep goin

My ex-boyfriend had to go
He didn't know how to work that magic stick
But I found a guy that sure do love
It's so true his love is cla-hassic yeah oohhh

I bet it taste like candy, made to melt in my mouth
I know you got plenty, baby you the shit
Now what you workin wit candy made to melt in my mouth
I know you got plenty, I like the way, I like the way
I like the way, I like the way
I like the way you work your stick boo
The way you work it like voodoo
The way you wind and you wind and you grind
Don't stop the way you work your stick
Baby the way you work your stick
Baby keep on and keep on and keep on keep goin

I could play Janet you could play J.D
If you like Beyonce you could play Jay-Z
Check for them other chicks cos they not me
They're just some copy cats there's only one Missy
M-to the I double ss don't test
I'm hard as the cushion on a bulletproof vest
But you got me whipped like slaves in the days
You're cool as the shade and ice and lemonade
I think I wanna marry you baby I will carry
Guess it's necessary and on the contrary
You be mister right and mister legendary
The more I fall in love the more it gets scary

I like the way you work your stick boo
The way you work it like voodoo
The way you wind and you wind and you grind
Don't stop the way you work your stick
Baby the way you work your stick
Baby keep on and keep on and keep on keep goin
I think I'm in love like Beyonce be with Jigga1Embed
