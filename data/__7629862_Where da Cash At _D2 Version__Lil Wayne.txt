You catch my girl legs open, better smash that
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”

Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at (My nigga, Curren$y), where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at (Young Money), where the cash at (Cash Money)
Don't be surprised if shе ask, “Where the cash at?” (Weezy F. Baby!)

Hold on, hold on, hold on. This song right hеre? This my nigga, Curren$y the Hot Spitta (That's right), you heard me? First artist on Young Money-Cash Money. 'Bout to hit y’all in the head with that muh’fuckin’ “Where da Cash At,” featuring Remy Martin and my muh’fuckin’ self, man. Do what you does, lil’ daddy! I came to get money and that’s what we gon’ do!

You catch my girl legs open, better smash that (Yeah)
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at (We did part two)
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at (’Cause the first wasn’t enough)
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at (We still gon’ prove to y’all niggas who we is)
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at (My nigga, Weezy F. Baby)
Where the— Where the cash at (You know what they call me!), where the cash at (Yuh)
Where the— Where the cash at (My nigga, Curren$y! Yuh), where the cash at (Huh?)
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Spitta, Spitta, yuh! Young Money, AMG)

Bitches come a dime a dozen; I fuck 'em, sisters, cousins
It's a revolvin' door: pussy goin', pussy comin'
And when they go to you, it's coming back to me with money
I tell her, "Put them shoes on and keep my paper runnin'"
I put my mack down, just like a G supposed to
And if she don't come home with it, then she sleepin' over
I got ‘em creepin' over; we doin' dinner soda
I like the Ameries—you can have them Omarosas
Them niggas down below us—baby, we up and over
I'm tryna get inside that thing that’s in between your shoulders
I'm talkin' large totals, I'm talkin' large motives
I'm talkin' burnin' rubber—that melted Pirelli odor
I'm hoppin' out a Lotus—you lookin' at my bitch?
You wanna holler? You can holler—take her on a trip
But when the deed done, you gotta send her back
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at

Where the— where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Yeah, ha)
I got a bitch in the back (Back), got a ho in the front (Front)
Got purp' in the Dutch (Yeah), got purp' in the cup
I tell her, "Get your money, ho, or just stop breathin'
'Cause if it ain't about that dough, it ain't about me, neither" (Gangsta—)
See, a gangsta like myself? I get that paper and pussy
Then I went and make that pussy bring that paper straight to me, bitch!
You lookin' at a real pimp—ask my old hoes (Yeah)
And they'll tell you, no remote, I control hoes
I'm a whole load—give you that game, mama
If he ain't payin', then he shouldn't be playin’—I’m sayin'
Broke niggas only make jokes, nigga (Ha)
I make more then I can fit in this quote, nigga—
Unquote—come sun-soak with me, bitch
Fly you down here and put you on some South Beach shit (Yeah)
And if you smile at my bitch, I make her smile back (Back)
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”

Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at (Uh-huh), where the cash at (Geah)
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Check, yo, look)
See, that other chick asked that—she said, "Where the cash at?" Rem’ said, "Where the paper, plastic, product, and where the stash at?
Where the keys to the whip and the crib, and where’s the address of—
That bitch that be hidin' shit in her ass-crack?"
Niggas I'm fuckin' call me “baby,” like I'm related to Weezy
Some of 'em call me “R-uh”; none of them call me easy
Found out I'm fuckin' her man—now this bird is callin' me, screamin'
Chicken, wait—bitches I be fryin', they just call me greasy
See, I know he got a main, but I'm cool being the other one
'Cause he can't get tight when he hear I piped another one
I don’t fall in love with them—cum and then I'm done with them
Most they get from me is wet pussy and some bubblegum, but—
This one dude had me laughin' (Haha)
If it's just one thing I can't stand, it's a baggy Magnum
Would've thought somebody threw me a camera the way I caught a flashback
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”

Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”Embed
