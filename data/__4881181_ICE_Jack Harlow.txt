14 ContributorsICE Lyrics
I can't hear you through this
Right now, right now
Ooh!

Dentyne, put it on ice right now, ayy
Tell me what you like right now
Is you with me?
Tell your best friend pipe down
'Cause I ain't tryna hear it right now
In a Bentley, high-top pull up on ya
Do you got a full cup on ya?
Got history, between me and you
Baby, tell me, is you trying see it through? (Ayy, yeah)

Lot of fake stuff that I'm seeing through
It be hard for me to be enthused
Know you're sick of being cool
I know you're sick of being nice
Y'all can spend time in the day, I'm the one that you gon' see at night
We got something, we can breathe tonight
I know it's been some years but I can see it clear cut
I'ma pull up with the seersuck' (Uh!)
Pull up, get your rear fucked on (Uh!)
I know it's a weird system that we living in
That's why we living like we never gonna live again
I got family down in Texas, up in Michigan
So when I pull up, do a show, it's significant
You might also like
Dentyne, put it on ice right now, ayy
Tell me what you like right now
Is you with me?
Tell your best friend pipe down
'Cause I ain't tryna hear it right now
In a Bentley, high-top pull up on ya
Do you got a full cup on ya?
Got history, between me and you
Baby, tell me, is you trying see it through? (Ayy)

Can we pick the tempo up?
Smoke something, pour up (Pour up, ooh)
Best friend heard something 'bout me
Where'd she get the info from? (Where she get that?)
Rolling with the windows up
Hot box in the park, see me in the dark (Dark)
I'm attached to ya, think we need to be apart
Even at a distance, you can keep me in your heart, one time (One)
I don't see the sunshine
Nocturnal, cheap wine
If you need it, I'm buyin' (Hey)
Light with the dark, yeah I need to combine
I think you need to come by (Come by)
Dentyne, put it on ice right now, ayy
Tell me what you like right now
Is you with me?
Tell your best friend pipe down
'Cause I ain't tryna hear it right now
In a Bentley, high-top pull up on ya
Do you got a full cup on ya?
Got history, between me and you
Baby, tell me, is you trying see it through? (Ayy)

Can we pick the tempo up?
Smoke something, pour up (Pour up, ooh)
Can we pick the tempo up?
Smoke something, pour up (Pour up, ooh)1Embed
