25 ContributorsI Just Wanna Lyrics
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know, let me know

Somebody let me know right now
'Cause honestly I don't know right now
And I could be high right now
But I still feel low somehow
Do you ever feel like you don't even know
Which direction you should go? If so homie, take it slow
Pop a bottle with some dro, let all of your worries go
Consume yourself within this flow
Whether your girl is actin' up or your man was cheating on you
Or you can't pay your bills or you can't take it no mo'
Or somebody done passed away
Be strong and live another day

I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think

This is Shakespeare's mind state, 808 and heartbreak
They feelin' so alone, can someone relate to their heart's ache?
Used to walk into a room and that would make their heart race
But you ain't seen that person for some time and now your heart aches
Now do you even know where you really wanna go?
You been down that street before, maybe you should take it slow
Think about the life you livin', but don't think so hard it hurts
Life is truly a gift but at the same it is a curse
Now, you gotta persevere, get over any fear
You let go of the wheel, but now I think it's time to steer
So show 'em that you ready and show 'em that you strong
But not tonight cause you gon' get your good time on

I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think
I said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink
There's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think

Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know6Embed
