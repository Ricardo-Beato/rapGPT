4 ContributorsNightmares Lyrics
I have nightmares, nightmares, all the time
I wake up, I look up, shook up
Say fuck, put my hands on my nine
Niggas I cut, or we stuck, and they move
So we buck, they come back
In my dreams at night I have nightmares
Nightmares, all the time

Last night I had a vision of my dead friends in my sleep
They showed my things, I ain't really wanna see
They showed me flashbacks of murder
Scenes, bodies bubblin', in acid tubs
With they feet head and hands cut off
Oh shit, I had woke up buggin', sweatin' bullets
Checkin' for my gun, I gotta
Stop smoking that haze or something
I know I ain't crazy, I'll go outside for
Some fresh air maybe, it's 3 o'clock in the night
The block is on fire, took
My nigga bottle for a swig oh the fire
He told he just had seen the bitch ass
Nigga, must be god that's keeping me from seein' this nigga
Wanna crawl on me, and creep on me
Cause they know better then to let me see him in front
Of me, outside the car, away from the police
I'll turn him into dreams, demons in my sleep
You might also like
I have nightmares, nightmares, all the time
I wake up, I look up, shook up
Say fuck, put my hands on my nine
Niggas I cut, or we stuck, and they move
So we buck, they come back
In my dreams at night I have nightmares
Nightmares, all the time

Every time I go to sleep its like I stroll down memory lane
And see the dirt I've done before I acquired the fame
If you can see what I see, you see me
Poppin' the chain, or you see me scrappin'
I pull out and pop off that thang
I'm usually hustlin', bubblin', slingin' that 'caine
No matter the weather its sun
Snow sleet or it's rain, see fiends got a habit
It hurts so they feedin' they
Vein, and I gotta habit of havin' grams of it man
I'm chasin' the paper, it' simple i'm bout my bread
I cock it and pop it your white tee will turn red
See niggas that know me, who owe me, they see me
They run, they know
If I catch em I cut em for feed em my gun
It's real in the field, nigga front
And get yo cap peeled, with that nina, that tech
That ooo wop or that mac mill,  unload then reload, I live by the streets code
And pray to lord have mercy on my soul
I have nightmares, nightmares, all the time
I wake up, I look up, shook up
Say fuck, put my hands on my nine
Niggas I cut, or we stuck, and they move
So we buck, they come back
In my dreams at night I have nightmares
Nightmares, all the time

Keep havin' these dreams, I think I'm just losin' my brain
I wake up in sweat, my girl think i'm sniffin' that 'caine
I try to remember, but none of
Them ever the same, I dream of my brother
But never since he passed away
He talk to me, and I can't hear nothing he say
Fuck it, go along with it, just be happy to see him
I think that nigga tryna tell me something
Though, when I see him I forget to ask him
Fuck I wanna know
Probably tryna to tell me, your gun , it better blow
When you in the street
Can't react slow, cause niggas in this rap game, think shit sweet
Getting disrespectful like I won't push meat
Should be poppin' off in my dream but then I get caught
Is he tryin' to tell me so my soldiers cause you a bust
Niggas wanna see my down, I ain't 'fraid of getting poked
Damn if I ever go broke
I have nightmares, nightmares, all the time
I wake up, I look up, shook up
Say fuck, put my hands on my nine
Niggas I cut, or we stuck, and they move
So we buck, they come back
In my dreams at night I have nightmares
Nightmares, all the timeEmbed
