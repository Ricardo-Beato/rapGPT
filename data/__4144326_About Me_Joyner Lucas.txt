4 ContributorsAbout Me Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Lord Quest, what up?
Future Joyner out here
Uh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh

Couple things about me I don't puff a lot of (Lot of, lot of)
Not a Christian and my auntie say I cuss a lot, uh (A lot, uh, a lot, uh)
She a bad bitch but I done heard enough about her ('bout her, 'bout her)
She mean a lot to you but I don't give a fuck about her ('bout her, 'bout her)

When I'm rich, they'll be jags that I'm drippin' outta (Outta, outta)
So what the fuck I gotta do to make a couple dollars? (Dollars, dollars)
Life's a bitch, you shouldn't press your luck around her ('round her, 'round her)
Just throw a condom on, but fuck a  (, )

Everybody call me Joyner but my Mom different (Different)
She call me Gary, but the fiends call me Joseph Griffin (Griffin)
Chef boy, cookin' up hits in my boy's kitchen (Kitchen)
Guaranteed that once they hit it, they'll be all trippin' (Trippin')

Clap, clap, let the heater go (Go)
Everything was good just a week ago ('go, 'go)
Let the birds talk, chirpin' ain't a secret though (Though)
But these bitches know that they won't ever look at me for dough (Dough)

Couple things about me I don't puff a lot of (Lot of, lot of)
Not a Christian and my momma say I cuss a lot, uh (A lot, uh, a lot, uh)
She a bad bitch but I done heard enough about her ('bout her, 'bout her)
She mean a lot to you but I don't give a fuck about her ('bout her, 'bout her)

What you know about me? I don't talk a lotta, (Lotta)
She got a big mouth, so I don't really talk around her ('round her)
Steady searching for the love, but it's hard to find it (Find it)
She want my heart but only my goddaughter got it
Hoes with the modem, I don't  the car around it ('round it)
Swallow your pride, take a shot, and build a bar around it ('round it)
Dehydration in my flow, but the water rising (Rising)
Drink 'em up, shit 'em out in my port-a-potty (Potty)

When I'm rich, they'll be jags that I'm drippin' outta (Outta, outta)
So what the fuck I gotta do to make a couple dollars? (Dollars, dollars)
Life's a bitch, you shouldn't press your luck around her ('round her, 'round her)
Just throw a condom on, but fuck a  (, )

Snitches know the definition of a lawyer means
Do you know the definition of your loyal means
Now a nigga out of prison, payin' lawyer fees
One squeeze, last breath right before you leave
Clap, clap, let the heater go (Go)
Everything was good just a week ago ('go, 'go)
Let the birds talk, chirpin' ain't a secret though (Though)
But these bitches know that they won't ever look at me for dough (Dough)

Couple things about me I don't puff a lot of (Lot of, lot of)
Not a Christian and my momma say I cuss a lot, uh (A lot, uh, a lot, uh)
She a bad bitch but I done heard enough about her ('bout her, 'bout her)
She mean a lot to you but I don't give a fuck about her ('bout her, 'bout her)

Give a fuck about her
I don't give a fuck about her
Bitches come down in dozens, manEmbed
