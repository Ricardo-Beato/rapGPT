This ain't a diss song, this a real song (DY Krazy)
Nigga, we ain't runnin' from no responsibilities
I take care of families
I'm embarrassed over this mess that I done caused

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

Gotta keep it stashed up for the trial
Material intentions, gotta play it foul
I'm in rare form like a hyena runnin' wild
All the opps gettin' gunned down

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile
You might also like
I lost connections to the streets and I was in denial
I seen a grown man shed tears 'cause he lost his trial
I saved the streets, a crazy feeling just to lose a child
Have a one-on-one with God, yeah, it been a while
I woke up paranoid off drugs, I said, "I'm tired now"
I answer my phone in the middle of the night, like, "Who done died now?"
Knowin' I'm involved, but we gon' slide back when it's dyin' down
I don't know who opps no more, you look crazy, I'm firin' rounds
I love the streets, it's a portion of me
I came from nothin' to the voice of the streets
I got blood in the streets
The way he died, I advise he died in his sleep
That's the trenches, yeah, yeah

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

Public conversation got you touchin' clouds
Popped the wrong pill, hit the wrong dial
Ain't no visitation, waitin' for the trial (Ain't no visitation)
Took my last name, this ain't 'bout the child (Woah)
Real classy Jazzy, real don't do no trollin'
Gotta treat you like you dead when you playin' bogus
See, Pluto, you my brother, gotta stay focused
Sometimes I get in my feelings, too, I wish I wore a Trojan
They tryna go viral off DMs, that's why I'm antisocial
I'm just tryna teach the killers not to use emotion
I got a whole bitch, don't think about my old bitch
I'm just tryna live my life and catch this moment, yeah

I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

We can't even get no sleep behind this shit
You make a temporary decision
That cause permanent pain
Shit ain't goin' nowhere (I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides)
That hood mentality feel like you can go through anything, nigga (Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile)6Embed
