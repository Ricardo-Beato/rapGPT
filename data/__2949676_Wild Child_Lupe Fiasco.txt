21 ContributorsWild Child Lyrics
And they say, and they say
And they say-ay-ay-ay, and they say

Uh, yeah, one time for the drama
Halcyon vibes got me feelin' like a llama
At peace with the beast in these streets
At least I think that I am
Meditate away the drama or I'ma just go bananas
Life's a beach but no Bahamas, I just wanna wear pajamas
Whole life I been fightin' on piranhas
With katanas inside of my hand
I just wanna lay down, play sounds for the coolout
And, fall asleep on the pool couch
And, wake up to the new wave
And, take a break from the schoolhouse
Yeah, I don't wanna hear about it
Wouldn't be in here without it, not true
I don't wanna be alone, I ain't leavin' you at home
What's bein' on your own without... you?

Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
You might also like
Yeah, two times for the photo
Where the land, man, I don't know
Revolution to the bone door
Underground styles, shoulda came out of Stone's Throw
Yeah, for the good food and good times
Good moves, good friends and a good mind
Confident you'll compliment my consciousness
'Cause you were born under this sign
I just need a little peek
Little look in the book of important things
'Cause you can do, try to
Get loose without doin' a damn thing
Yeah, I don't wanna hear about it
Wouldn't be in here without it, not true
I don't wanna be alone, I ain't leavin' you at home
What's bein' in the zone without, you?

Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
I'm singin' it, oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Yeah, oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child

In the backseat or the backyard
Feeling like we got no problems at all
I'm so happy when I'm with you, with you
Make me feel so free when I'm with you
When I'm with you
Make me feel so free when I'm with you
When I'm with you
Three times to be good to myself
Relax back, that's good for my health
So do not devise on my bae
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't heard about nothin'
I ain't workin' on nothin'
But my perfect lil' woman

Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Said oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child, like a wild child
I'm singin' now, oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Yeah, said oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child
Oooh wild5Embed
