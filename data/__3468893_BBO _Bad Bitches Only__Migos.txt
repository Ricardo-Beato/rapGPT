Buddah bless this beat

AP on me, iced out, tennis chains, iced out (Ice)
Whole pointers 'round my neck, lookin' like a lighthouse (Shine)
Lil' nigga, pipe down, choppa make ya pipe down
Runnin' man (Woo), runnin' man (Woo), catch me if you can
Bad bitches only, bad bitches on me (Bad)
Bad bitches only, bad bitches on me (Woo)
Bad bitches only, bad bitches on me (Bad)
Bad bitches only, bad bitches on me (Woo)

Hit her for a minute then I pass her to the homie (Pass)
Hit her for a minute then I passed her to the homie (Go)
I don't wanna see you when I wake up in the mornin' (Nah)
Bad bitches only (Go), bad bitches on me
Huncho

Bad bitches and I know some savage bitches (Bad)
Get it on they own, they don't have to ask you bitches (Get it)
Postin' pictures on the 'gram and @ your bitches (Posted)
Secure the bag, lifestyle real expensive (Secure the bag)
All these bad bitches lookin' for attention (Attention-tention)
That ain't bad, fake bad, she pretendin' (That ain't bad)
If you pay to get in your bag then you winnin' (Winnin', winnin')
All these Jones soldier, fuck it, they call me Quincy
Popped that seal (Pop it), close that deal (Close it)
We in the field (Yeah), spread them bills (Woo, ayy)
Lean spill (Goddamn), on that Lear (Phew)
Maybach seat with the sheers (Curtains), AP shiftin' gears (Gone)

We in the field with sticks like this Arcadia (Pah pah)
Flippin' the game and you niggas gon' meet your maker (Brrt)
Uh, Goyard, havin' them racks and no regard (Racks, racks)
Uh, walkin' around with a bad bitch, she a barbie (Bad, bad)
Uh, I started my engine, I’m nowhere, where the car is? (Skrrt)
Uh, hopped in the Wraith and she asked me, “What the stars is?” (woo, woo)
Every month on the third we get to Narcs in (Packs)
Dogs barkin' then kick the door, no narcs in (None)
Livin' the wild life, think I am Tarzan (Wow)
I took your broad again, she wanna come with the stars again (Hey, hey)

Whole pointers 'round my neck, lookin' like a lighthouse (Shine)

Bad bitches on me, only bad bitches want me
Hold up, where the bad bitches? Look at all the sad bitches (Sad)
Say a hundred, do two hundred on the dash, smash nigga (Smash)
Who want it? 'Cause we run it, ain't no question, ask niggas (Ask)
Better punt it on the fourth, 'cause ain't no runnin' past niggas (No)
Man, we done it, that's important, who you trust to blast with you? (Who?)
Make it spaz, that's a quarter cash in the caterpillar (Spaz)
Porsche tags on the nigga ass, I'm a cop killer (Fuck 'em)
Reggie Miller, shoot 'em, bill up, say 'Phillipe' while you say, 'Philip'
Double cup, codeine killer, Houston Texas, now who trilla?
Bad bitches in the mirror, told her take the team with her (Bad)
Bet she bring the team with her, bring the blue and green, lookin' at my (Ice)
