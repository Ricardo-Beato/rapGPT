(I got ta) Run you down like a Polo skip
(I got ta) Rip MC's like a paper bag
(I got ta) Wear a disguise to escape a nag
(I got ta) Go to my shows in a limousine, but
(I got ta) Stay in touch with my inner scene
(I got ta) Keep my house nice and tidy
(I got ta) Learn a lot about the whitey
(I got ta) Buy a house with all my riches
(I got ta) Invest the rest, avoid the ditches
(I got ta) Eat my frank with mustard only
(I got ta) Call up a friend when I get lonely
(I got ta) Do enough shows because the rent's due
(I got ta) Get paid, cause it makes sense to
(I got ta) Uplift rap so it's respected
(I got ta) Help all those that are connected
(I got ta) Give a girl enough affection
(I got ta) Turn her heart in my direction
(I got ta) Grab the mic from the stage and
(I got ta) Drop more spice than a Cajun
(I got ta) Smoke MC's like a cigarette
(I got ta) Rap in a style they can't figure yet
(I got ta) Teach the youth that they capable
(I got ta) Show the ghetto is escapable
(I got ta) Walk soft but carry a big stick
(I got ta) Wise up and stop eating pig quick
(I got ta) Manifest words til they're understood
(I got ta) Make more noise than thunder could
(I got ta) Play an MC like a sham shirt
So step back or you're gonna get slammed, squirt
(I got ta) Get on the floor with a fly step
(I got ta) Come on strong like a bicep
(I got ta) Ball up my fist, that's the power sign
And MC's clean up your act cause it's shower time
(I got ta) Drop my rhymes like a sandbag
(I got ta) Pick up the microphone and rag
MC's who try to be better than
(I got ta) Heat up the party like a sweater can
(I got ta) Learn from the mistakes that I've made
(I got ta) Walk whatever path is laid
(I got ta) Let things fall as they may
(I got ta) Live my life by the day
(I got ta) Help out a friend that's in trouble
(I got ta) Tell 'em we all have to struggle
(I got ta) Go to school with the other man
(I got ta) Get as close as I can
(I got ta) Know what he knows to know him
And then my chance to survive is less grim
(I got ta) Also have knowledge of self though
(I got ta) Learn that plus achieve wealth, yo
(I got ta) Share that wealth with my family
And community and still live happily
Not ever after cause life ain't a fairytale
(I got ta) Stay on my toes and I'll never fail
(I got ta) Carry the crowd like a duffle bag
You saw me score and you still wanna scuffle? Dag
(I got ta) Admit you got a lot of heart, kid
You better run like somebody smart did
(I got ta) Remember the Benz that my man drove
Now it's all smashed up in a grove
(I got ta) Recall the first day he bought it though
And as he boasted and posted I said "So?"
(I got ta) Say he was the man a month back
Ten workers on the ave selling smack
On Saturday, he made his last mistake, so now
(I got ta) Buy a suit for his wake

I got ta (Repeat x4)
I got to avoid surrounding myself with too many materialistic things
But I got to live the life enjoyed by the law-abiding black kings
I got to motivate others to achieve and become a part of this elite group
And that's really what the struggle for equality is all about, troop
I got to understand the pain and strife of the next man
So I got to avoid flaunting, showing off and high posting if I can
I got to make sure Action is understood comepletely by all followers
I got to convert the color of your shirt from blue to white collars
I got to close my eyes, ball up my fist and thank God for the freedom of speech
Then I got to use my knowledge of the English language to write songs that teach

I want to say peace to DJ Mister Cee, Steady Pace
The whole Action Posse, the whole Action Posse
The whole Action to the third power movement
And everybody that believes in Master AceEmbed
