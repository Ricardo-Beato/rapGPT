7 ContributorsAll The Time Lyrics
You made a jugg today, okay I’m making jugg all the time
You just start getting money, we been get money all the time
You buy a outfit out the mall, we buy mall out all the time
200 on the dash catch me riding foreign all the time
You pour up once a week, I drank on lean more den all the time
True Religion Robin Jeans Designer on me all the time
Everytime we hit the club we make a movie all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time

Early morning chasing paper like its going outta style
You looking for it, I know where its at
I been serving old boy for a while
Juugin’, Finessin’, for a while
Hustling gambling for a while
Break the law, fuck the law, 400 hot juvenile
Stupid loud in the crowd, raining money pouring down
All the time you see the future could be holding a hundred pounds
All the time I drank patron and ordered up a hundred rounds
You wanna shot you can take a shot get fucked up til you fallin’ down
All the time I come around theres bitches round
Puerto rican Japanese got several nationalities
They fuck with me I keep it street Dolce G is on my feet
True Religion sag off me I spend them bands like its free
You might also like
You made a jugg today, okay I’m making jugg all the time
You just start getting money, we been get money all the time
You buy a outfit out the mall, we buy mall out all the time
200 on the dash catch me riding foreign all the time
You pour up once a week, I drank on lean more den all the time
True Religion Robin Jeans Designer on me all the time
Everytime we hit the club we make a movie all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time

In the clouds like a vert
Like Waffle House I keep that syrup
Tastin’ like a sunken soda
Got me higher than a solar
Bird colder than a cola, high roller new V Motor
Did a lot with baking soda, red and white, Coca Cola
DOCE what that is Doce Doce from the flo’ up
From the flo’ up millennium I’m on M&M’s get plenty them
275 come seventy five get in the mix with 20 chicks
Come to city take a pic

You made a jugg today, okay I’m making jugg all the time
You just start getting money, we been get money all the time
You buy a outfit out the mall, we buy mall out all the time
200 on the dash catch me riding foreign all the time
You pour up once a week, I drank on lean more den all the time
True Religion Robin Jeans Designer on me all the time
Everytime we hit the club we make a movie all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the timeEmbed
