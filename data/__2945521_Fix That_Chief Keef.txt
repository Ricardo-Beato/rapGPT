22 ContributorsFix That Lyrics
I hit Saks, I spend racks
I spend stacks, I can get it back
Nigga, get back, I go click clack
Leave the pussy wet, don't get bitch smacked
Ride down on ya, in the tic tac
And this designer on me, it's fuckin' mismatched
Grab a big Mac, break your Kit Kat
All these tools on me, and I can fix that

When I was up in rehab, I was smokin' tooka dope
Ayy, boy what you smokin' on? It's probably some fookah dope
Buy a Gucci throw it on, 5000 for it, how you ain't know?
Walk up in the Louis store, they know I got them big bankrolls
I am sippin' purple drank, no girl, this is not yellow
No I do not know that hoe, she in Miami, I know
Now I'm somewhere in west coast, smokin' on the best dope
Fat ass clipper in my chop, if you want a trim, let's go
Ooh, I'm acting a fool, hoes say I'm rude
And some say I'm cute, and make me food
I'm up at Barney's, don't want no Louis
I want Balmain's, I don't want no shoes
So smooth, won't catch me snooze
Ooh, my watch a fool
It's fucked, them niggas bools
Is it false, and or is it true?

Y'all know how we bummin' man
Fresh off of tourin' man, back off of tourin' man
Back at it 24-H 365 man
Walk up in Barney's, can't even decide, man
Balmain's, no red bottoms
You hear me? Big bands, finesse y'all
You see us doin' this shit nigga, 'cause we still doin' this shit
Nigga, so was doin' this shit 'cause we been doin' this shit
Nigga, y'all know how the fuck we comin', nigga
R.I.P. Blood nigga, R.I.P. Cap nigga
Sneak diss, catch a slug, nigga

Put a nigga on a stretcher
Who is that though? Youngest flexer
Y'all got questions, I can't answer
I'm a rich nigga, no time for dandruff
Dodgin' Aiki, smokin' dopey
She has the best head, she gets a trophy
Nigga, I'm 2-4, you do not know me
You are a peon, that's what she told me5Embed
