11 ContributorsChurch Lyrics
Peace, this is Spike Lee AKA Shelton Jackson Lee
AKA loving husband and father of Tonya and Satchel and Jackson
I'm here with De La Soul AKA De La, AKA The Plugs
We're about to get in this song, "Church" AKA "It's Reality" (Ayo)

Wake up, wipe the sleep from ya eye-cracks
It's time to focus y'all, fix ya IMAX
In other words, listen to the brother's words
Ingest these anecdotes with hope
Then your ass may learn how to cope
It's not always good just to get by
Who's coverin' your stakes when you bet high?
You're chasin' cars, clothes and rocks
Identify with the goods you got
Make sure it's VS1, not
Imperfect, leavin' you unclear
I really don't care to see your tattoos there
I'd rather see you graduate the school year
Black folk, go put a book in your face
But first give the hook a taste, bring the preacher in

Heal, heal, y'all
We comin' healin'
It's real, it's real
It's realer than real, realer than real
Heal, y'all, we comin' healin'
So let it heal, it's real
It's real
It's realer than real, realer than real
You might also like
Sick world that we live in like some tell it
Some put it in books, some yell it
You need to make your own choice, be your own voice
Set your soapbox up, let your talk fight
Pull your socks up, get your walk right
Or the chalk might outline you one day
You oughta try steppin' outside you one day
You circle 'round yourself like you the answer
To the question of your inner self
But keep ya falsehoods to a minimum (Minimum)

We all need a little church
A life update, keyword "update"
If they don't serve change, don't bite the bait
Instead of givin' you a share, servin' you a dish
I lead you to the water, show you how to fish
Ain't nothin' wrong makin' that bread with it
But don't let the bread get to your head, get it?
And admit it when you can't stand alone
I wanna stand up, give all the pretend up
And get a full blast of my demands up
The rhyme runneth over, sip the man's cup
There's something in our words that reveal ('Veal)
Sure 'nuff real
Heal, y'all, we come to heal
So let it heal you
It's real, it's real
It's realer than real, realer than real
Heal, y'all, we gonna heal it
So let it heal, it's real
So real
It's realer than real, for real, for real

The early bird gets the worm in this rotten apple
But explore deep and you will the find the seed
Plant more ether, get your mind free
We roll passionate, put your lights last in it
You're holdin' fear too close, unfasten it
And like old age invades youth
Invade falseness with truth
Replace rebelling with rebirth
Face new dwelling, that's your turf
Now kick back and put your feet up on the sofa, bruh
Relax (Relax) and learn how to punch back
And do your work to the max
The payoff's much sweeter than the payback
Even the haystack needle wouldn't play that
So let's pray at church (Church)
Heal, heal, y'all
We comin' healin'
It's real, it's real
It's realer than real, realer than real
Heal, y'all, we comin' healin'
So let it heal, it's real
It's real
It's realer than real, realer than real

Reality (Reality), real
Reality (Reality), real
Reality (Reality), real
Reality (Reality), real
Reality (Reality), real
Reality
Hm-mm-mm

You know what I mean? Rap outsold crack
You know? So rap— or hip-hop culture
However you wanna dice it, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's the most powerful drug there is, man
It changed corporate America, it changed the way you feel about me
It changed the way that I— I do my thing now
Busta was the one that came out on— on the award show and said
That hip-hop is the only thing that provides jobs for people that don't even love the shit
I mean, come on, man, I mean what else is there to say?Embed
