13 ContributorsDope Smokes Lyrics
Look how my ice hittin' off of my wife beater
Hop out on you stuntin' in a white creature
Sixteen ounces in the two liter
M16 in the two seater
In Barney's gettin' designer by the boat load
Don't stress over me baby girl, smoke dope
And the only thing I'm dodgin' is popo's
And I'm in love with the dope smokes

I love runnin' through the bands
You ain't Glo, then we givin' niggas tans
You want the flow, I can give a nigga a hand
How these shells fly, I'm givin' niggas fans
Up in Hermes, hand the clerk big bands
Big choppa on me 'cause I got big hands
Big racks on me like I'm wearin' big pants
If my car go vroom, then my shit madd
I ain't Jesus, you won't fuck around with my feast
And your beauty queen fuckin' around with a beast
Automatic on me, fuck around we'll squeeze
110, 55, do that shit with ease

Look how my ice hittin' off of my wife beater
Hop out on you stuntin' in a white creature
Sixteen ounces in the two liter
M16 in the two seater
In Barney's gettin' designer by the boat load
Don't stress over me baby girl, smoke dope
And the only thing I'm dodgin' is popo's
And I'm in love with the dope smokes
You might also like
Throwin' money from the top, it's fallin' on the floor
I'm gon' send some shots, that's all a nigga know
And how many I squeeze, it's off how far a nigga go
Runnin' through these pounds to show how much a nigga smoke
I ain't even got to say it, you know where a nigga from
You can have a .30 on you, we takin' niggas guns
When I was up in school, I was takin' niggas lunch
And this ice on me dedicated to a gun
They say I do the most
I be like on folks
Now let's have a fuckin' toast
'Cause I made it through the smoke

Look how my ice hittin' off of my wife beater
Hop out on you stuntin' in a white creature
Sixteen ounces in the two liter
M16 in the two seater
In Barney's gettin' designer by the boat load
Don't stress over me baby girl, smoke dope
And the only thing I'm dodgin' is popo's
And I'm in love with the dope smokes3Embed
