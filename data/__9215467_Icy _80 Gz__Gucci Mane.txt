1 ContributorIcy (80 Gz) Lyrics
She digging my fit, she think I'm the shit (think I'm the shit)
Is this the chain on my neck, or the watch in my wrist (the watch in my wrist)
Maybe the ice in my ear, or the bracelet (my bracelet)
But she look like the type that could take a dick (take the dick)
Uh, young Gucci Mane (Gucci Mane)
Don't kiss me baby, you can kiss my chain (kiss my chain)
Uh, you gotta be a dime piece (dime piece)
Just to look at the rocks in my time piece (time piece)
Uh, I come through in a drop top Jag (drop top tag)
Or a old school Chevy with the antique tags ('tique tags)
My pockets so heavy that I can't walk steady (walk steady)
Niggas copping ice we done done it already (oh!)
Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie
I ride big Chevys cause a nigga ain't petty
I'm icy (so icy, so icy), so motherfuckin' snowed up
Little kids wanna be like Gucci when they grow up
Uh, me, Jeezy and Boo
We ain't hatin pussy nigga go and do what you do
'Cause we icy (so icy), so icy (so icy)
We icy (so icy), so icy (so icy)You might also likeEmbed
