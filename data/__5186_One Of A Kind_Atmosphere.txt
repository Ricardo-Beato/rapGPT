"I'm different 'cause I respect my audience and I don't yell at them, and I'm special 'cause I respect my audience"
(Yeah!)
Shut the fuck up!

The way she listen to what the MC said
She might as well plug the RCA cords into her head
Taking that into consideration at the center of creation
Cats still criticize my frustration raps
Well off he goes, coming cop some flows
Cross your toes and hopes that I don't climb you like an obstacle
Mission impossible, fishing in the kitchen sink
Y'all fall for anything so what you think this kid will bring
Poker face, let me hold my place
The name-sake is Slug, but you, you can call me stoker ace
Open invitation to catch today's ejaculation all across the front
Of your pretty little apron
This goes to those that own a mouth full of Sean's load
Thanks for starting, now you're barking down the wrong road
Sacrifice plays a part in grabbing mics
From now to the afterlife, I'll continue passion-like
I love this fucking whore with all my heart
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from doing my part
It gave me life, it saved me life, it raised me right
So slide, shoulder slide, and please hand over that mic

Who am I? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of y'all even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame
What is this? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of y'all even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame

So point a finger at the sucker that's having a good summer
Ain't got no bread, no wheat, no wonder
But I got the phone number to this weakness
I know who can put me back together, make me feel whole
So take me apart, try to break me down
Spend all you got just to hate the clown
You can fake the frown, imitate the sound
Underworld, world-wide, wide world of underground
It goes, one little, two little, three little indie rap
Headphones, backpacks watch 'em all piggyback
Switch up my styles, they all complain
But see which kids next year sound the same as me?
The same shit yesterday was like today
Only difference is I trust even less of what you say
But all in all I still make the noise, I still break the toys, I still hate your voice
I still say fuck a major label 'til it limps
Put your deal up our table and we'll show you who's the pimp
There is no sympathy for the careless
Fuck the extra credit and fuck the demerits
Class dismissed
Pain
Pain
Pain
You're all the same

Who am I? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of y'all even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame
What is this? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of y'all even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame
Who am I? One of a kind, one at a time
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame2Embed
