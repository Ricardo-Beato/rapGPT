Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Mmm-mh

I been smokin' on the gas, hocus pocus on the gas
I been snorklin' in the cash, going Krogers with the bags
I done went blonde, goin' Hulk Hogan on they ass
Tell my shooters "Count me out", and I end up doin' the math
I been fuckin' in the shower so my dreads soaked
I been fuckin' on the counter 'cause my bed's soaked
You know my lean nice and cold, like some dead folks
You know my eyes nice and low, like I make egg rolls, oh
I got them pills, we call 'em illies
I got the wet, I'm water whippin'
I rob his ass like Robin Givens
I get them Ms a mile a minute
Don't pay your bill, I'm power trippin'
BET, that's how I'm livin'
I got three hoes followin' me
Ho, ho, ho; I'm down the chimney
Hello, I make her throw away her pussy toys, yeah
Ain't got a job, I make her look employed, yeah
She do the money count in just her drawers, yeah
I make her count out loud, I listen hard
I been fuckin' models, they been walkin' 'round in towels
They been snortin' powder, I been in here takin' downers
They been countin' for hours, getting kisses by the thousands
Money and the power, they be in here watchin' Power
All my shooters accurate, codeine like a daiquiri
Run up, run up in your factory, mask is on like Michael Jackson
Brrrt! Pull up like a taxi, stereo on maxi
Nigga, bury your own casket
Nigga, say hello to Rabbit
My lil homies bang, my lil homies, they deranged
They don't want the fame, kill your ass then fly to Spain
Ding-ding, coke and ice cream, that shit got a nice ring
Put my face up in the pussy, I'm just sight-seeing
Yeah, starin' at the world through an automatic
Sweet mother of pearl, sweet Jesus of Nazareth
Quickly, quickly, quickly, gettin' slow, baby
I could turn your baby to a poor baby, sure baby
Look, I cannot sit down without gettin' down
What's new in town? Let's do it now
A couple marbles ain't been found
A couple screws been screwed around
My father ain't been 'round, my heart ain't missed a pound
The system of a down, and it's been up and down
A psycho, all I'm missin' is the gown
Sippin' up, I piss enough to drown, twistin' up a pound
High as fuck, a Bentley truck on clouds, y'all so underground
I break a whole bunch of fuckin' vows
Come to hunt you down
All up in your section
Use protection when you fuck around
Possession of deception, imperfection, no affection
No correct your transgression, turn depression to aggression
Got an obsession for expression
With no pressure, no discretion, and the F is for the
"Flesh of all the fleshless ones, I left 'em, F 'em."

Your bitch open so we run in it, any club, got my gun in it
I ain't even got to touch you dudes, I'll get you killed young nigga
Eat, sleep, talk shit, rap, brand new AK, all black
Tunechi gave me this gift wrapped
Your bars sweet, candy, Kit-Kat
Hope you pussy niggas get mad
Keep the voodoo on me, witchcraft
Off-White, Gucci, mix match
All my diamonds drip, shit splash
Black BMW, your bitch gave me top at the W
She told me Dollaz I'm over you
These bitches way too emotional, uh
So much perkys, I'm barely sober
Diamond choker, crazy, bipolar
Keep my niggas with me, I tote 'em
Never be committed, I told her
Enough with you niggas, I do not fuck with you niggas
I know I'm stuck with you niggas
Grew up with you niggas
We all was swipin' cards, scammin' it up with you niggas
Miami ballin', it's a hobby, call a nigga Joe Robbie
Haitian food or hibachi, ATV's, walkie-talkies
Chris Paul, we load the rocket
Eight ball, corner pocket
Ah man, nigga stop it, you know it's Dollaz
When it comes to rap, no problems
Haha, hold up, talk to 'em
I'm the hottest out in my city, Bad Boy too, ask Diddy
Hundred foot yacht, jet skiin', bitches kissin' bitches, lesbian
Niggas talkin' beef, let's see 'em
Y'all don't want beef, y'all vegan
If so, come, no semen
(Yeah, you get it?)
Future put me on, he from Atlanta
Niggas in my city crabs in a barrel
Made it out without y'all help
I can say I did it myself
Tunechi told me leave this beat blessed
I killed this shit, no stress
First 48, this stretch
Someone tell me what's next?5Embed
