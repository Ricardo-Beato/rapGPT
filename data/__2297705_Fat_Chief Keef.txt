16 ContributorsFat Lyrics
Zaytoven

Bet me, I got ten stacks, nigga
You trippin', I got them racks, nigga
Come to my house, the gang gotta pat niggas
Down, the gang love to whack niggas
Mmh, mmh, Chief Sosa love to slap bitches
Let's get it done, Chief Sosa love to wrap shit up
The green I love, I don't care about no black nigga
Or no white nigga, skinny nigga, fat nigga

You saw me walk up with the fuckin' racks, right?
Flamin' hot a nigga, bitch it's snack time
Gummybear a nigga just like Trolli
I'm in the tropics gettin' head by Leloni (Bang)
She said, "You fucked my friend, why you tryin' me?"
She said she ain't a thot, I'm like, "Bitch, don't lie to me"
Bitch, I ain't a bed, you can't lie on me
I fuck around and leave you, don't rely on me
I got hella guns, right now they tweakin'
Gotta wake 'em up, right now they sleepin'
I got hella cash and she want me to throw it
He say he got cash but I want him to show it (Bang)

Bet me, I got ten stacks, nigga
You trippin', I got them racks, nigga
Come to my house, the gang gotta pat niggas
Down, the gang love to whack niggas
Mmh, mmh, Chief Sosa love to slap bitches
Let's get it done, Chief Sosa love to wrap shit up
The green I love, I don't care about no black nigga
Or no white nigga, skinny nigga, fat nigga

I don't care about you lil' two boys
My watch a house, you didn't even know it
I be pimpin' like I'm ballin' with Jordan
Dennis Rodman with the colorful floors
This bitch be actin' just like Felicia
I told the bitch, "Beat it, Chewbacca"
I see this goofy nigga starin' at me
He like, "I just wanna see what you coppin'" (Bang, bang)

Bet me, I got ten stacks, nigga
You trippin', I got them racks, nigga
Come to my house, the gang gotta pat niggas
Down, the gang love to whack niggas
Mmh, mmh, Chief Sosa love to slap bitches
Let's get it done, Chief Sosa love to wrap shit up
The green I love, I don't care about no black nigga
Or no white nigga, skinny nigga, fat nigga
I don't care about a black nigga, white nigga, skinny nigga, fat nigga
A fat nigga
I don't care about a white nigga, black nigga, skinny nigga, fat nigga
A fat nigga
My pockets fat, nigga
That's why I don't care about a black nigga, skinny nigga, fat nigga, white nigga1Embed
