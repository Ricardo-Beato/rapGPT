11 ContributorsCatch A Box Lyrics
Turn up niggas
C4 nigga, Dun Deal
Big Guwop

Pour the lean so dark, it look like Jack Daniels
She’s a supermodel bitch but she got a Nathaniel
I drag a bitch by her hair, captain caveman
15 chains but I’m not a slave, man
Girl you got me real horny but your girlfriend corny
I never ever forced the check but I ride on Forji's
Reroll a vic or two, take a picture boo
And you can do me how you want, you got a Nicki booty
I spill my lean on her ass she got a sticky butt
I need half the deposit back, you got a rental booty
You got on 10 Versace chains that’s something Frenchie do
I got on 15 diamond necklace like Big Meech'll do
I murked the man and beat the charges just like Boosie did
Big diamond rings hang off my finger, Liberace kid
In a black Magnum pullin' up with plenty bails of mid
And if you tell 'em what we did then we’ll kidnap your kid (squad)

Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
All I wanna know is
Can you catch a box, ho?
I might send some dope, ho
I might send some smoke, ho
All I wanna know, 'do
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
I might send some pints, ho
I might send some blocks, ho
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch these blocks, ho?
You might also like
Can you catch a block ho?
Can you catch a block ho?
Can you catch this box coming off the loading dock, ho
Cargo mill when I'm feeling these smurf
Got a light blue box with blocks in it
And a rose gold watch with rocks in it
And an all-red Bentley with Glocks in it
My hoes love to go shopping
All I'm good at is catching boxes
Got an airport plane cross country
No contraband just hundreds
I'm post the mill and we punched it
Racists drinking them dirty Sunkists
If I had one wish, wish for three wrists
2 Rollies on each that’ll make 6
Send a box so big that she can't lift
And a weed so loud that she can’t keep hiff
Go right now bitch cause your plane here
And I ain’t even gotta know yo real name dude
Caught so many passes last year
She helped me get the Naismith
And she shake that ass at night time
But she catch boxes on day shift

Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
All I wanna know is
Can you catch a box, ho?
I might send some dope, ho
I might send some smoke, ho
All I wanna know, 'do
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
I might send some pints, ho
I might send some blocks, ho
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch these blocks, ho?2Embed
