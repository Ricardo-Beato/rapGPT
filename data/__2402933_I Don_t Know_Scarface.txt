5 ContributorsI Don’t Know Lyrics
Miss me, wished me, well, I am done now
Won't be coming back again, I'll let you run wild
Smile for the camera, pose for a snapshot
This will be the last tape, I'm about to cash out
Fun while it lasted, maybe in the next life
I can be your girlfriend 'cause I don't need an ex-wife
They tellin' me that beauty's only skin deep
Inside empty, pissed off simply
'Cause I will not apologize for nothin' I done did wrong
Bitch, you done chose me, you are gonna win some
And lose some, that's just a couple thang
Fine if it works, if it don't, that's another ring
Sold to the highest bidder, my nigga
Ho had the nerve to tell her mama I hit her
Never had to, that is not true
Now I got a new boo thang, and that is not you, ooh

Let us fly to the heart
It's a fight for the love
Simple words weren't enough
I don't know, I don't know
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she goin', where she goin'?
It feels like I'm in hell
I don't know, I don't know
You might also like
I don't wanna play the blame game, nah, that is not me
I can pack my own bags, no use tryna stop me
I got my mind made, a spade is a spade, ma
You took what we had and made it bad, what's to save now?
Relationship is gone, ain't no heart here
Just an ice box where it was, if it's not clear
Let me make it for you — we are over, find another
Ain't no use in tryna reason with this stupid motherfucker
I never shoulda trust us, you was dirty from the jumpstreet
You wanted a rap star, you ain't really want me
Settle for a anybody, shit you done was idiotic
You thought I was broke, huh? Bitch, I'm gettin' plenty money
That shit is really funny, you gave me the ten count
You threw in the towel on me, then brought that Benz out
You at your friend's house booed up with some dude
With pictures on your Instagram, smiling with him, fuck you

Let us fly to the heart
It's a fight for the love
Simple words weren't enough
I don't know, I don't know
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she goin', where she goin'?
It feels like I'm in hell
I don't know, I don't know
Hey, it's a new me, I hope you found new you
And got your shit together, I ain't mad, baby, do you
There's plenty other dudes to fall in lust with
For holidays, or any other days you put your trust in
You're a must win, losing ain't an option
You don't wanna work
You want the finer things, stop this
You ain't no better than the next bitch beggin'
Can't pour piss out of them boots you put your legs in
And even want a fairytale wedding
Like a nigga wanna wife you, and I don't even like you
The love gone, how am I gon' write a love song?
I'm wishing you the best, but wouldn't fuck you with a glove on
Now girl gone, how nice of you to stop by
Bitch that you accused me of sleeping with is my wife now
Let me be nice now, here's you introduction
Mrs. Jordan, here's that stupid bitch that I was fuckin'

Let us fly to the heart
It's a fight for the love
Simple words weren't enough
I don't know, I don't know
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she goin', where she goin'?
It feels like I'm in hell
I don't know, I don't knowEmbed
