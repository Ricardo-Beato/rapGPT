16 ContributorsThe Pound (Intro) Lyrics
Rah! I'ma hit a mothafucka with the pound, pound, pound, pound
It's the Pound Syndrome
Good God the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound
Un-unbelievable Pound Syndrome
Can you, can you, ca-can you believe it?
The Pound, the-the-the-the-the
The pound, the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound

If you're looking for trouble then you found it, the new album
Of two-thousand-and-fifteen, I'm too violent
This shit seems like I'm cooped out with lucid dreams
I'm a new route for these emcee's
This is a drought that's coming
I'm about to sprout to start a new style's full of envy
I need to cool down what is in me
Everything I had bottled up pukes out when the pen bleeds
You drown from a 16, who's doubtin' the sick steeze?
I could spit a wild verse without taking a breath
Then crowd surf, who's helping this kid breathe?
The worlds against me so I gotta come harder than the average
Think smarter than the masses
Everybody's on the move, ain't no time to get caught up in the traffic
When shit goes down I got the heart of an assassin
This here's harder than my last shit
Gotta do it now, no luck in tomorrow if it crashes
If I do die before I awake, I don't think too many will feel sorrow for my ashes
With this song I've frozen time, don't skip this, don't rewind
The throne is mine, close your eyes as I provoke the mind
This was bound to happen before I wrote the lines
And it's so divine the way my influence multiplied
It's like I created a cult inside this rap industry
Please don't look so surprised
I'm at the top, I ain't throwing down a rope to climb, come on

Pound, pound, pound, pound
It's the Pound Syndrome
Good God the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound
Un-unbelievable Pound Syndrome
Can you, can you, ca-can you believe it?
The Pound, the-the-the-the-the
The pound, the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound7Embed
