My chain!
My chain, my chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain?

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

I came to the club, just to floss my chain mayne
Catch another charge and I'm goin to the chain gang
... Oh I think I'm icy
Sold a hundred thou' eatin bologna sellin white streaks
.... Don't you see how bright it is?
City girls and country girls be tellin me how tight it is
.... These girls they be choosy
Diamonds be so sparkly they thank my chain was movin
... My chain is off the chain
Stacked up me some money, budget off and bought a chain
.... Check the way my chain hang
Gucci I don't gangbang, all I do is chain swang
You might also like
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci

Gucci you be shinin, Gucci you be shining man
Go on turn me on homes tell me who your diamond man
... My girlfriend actin lame
She say I'm actin different just because I got this chain
... Haters get your hater on
When they see them yellow stones, holla at'cha later on
My chain hang to my shoestrang
Like my watch and ring, but I know you love my chain
My chain hang to my ding-a-ling
I do my thug thang when I'm in the club mayne
When you heard "So Icy," you thought of Gucci Mane
I got that stupid money so I bought a stupid chain

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci
Yeah, my first chain I had to rob for it
Jesus piece, yellow diamonds sittin all in it
I'm on some Slick Rick shit, 2006 Mr. T
Diamonds so bright ain't no way you can't see the G
Look I don't dance, I just lean with it
Yeah my piece sick, every robber tryin to leave with it
I got that New York fitted on, full suit dickie on
Gucci link chain, blue stones in a nigga charm
Now watch me do it, do it with no hands
Drop twenty grand on that bezel and that band
Cause I'm the man, I-I-I'm the man
Got no wife, but my chain got my girlfriend

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain mayne?
Young Gucci Mane and I'm poppin off the chain mayne
And my Jacob is so fruity
Call me Gucci Mane or you call me Gucci Gucci1Embed
