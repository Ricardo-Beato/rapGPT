6 ContributorsFriendly Skies Lyrics
Yeah, lil' slow jam
Do you wanna fly with me?
Do you wanna fly with me?
Do you wanna fly with me?
Do you wanna fly with me?

Kiss me, hold me
The weatherman says it's gonna be
Cold tonight
Whatever, man
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever, man, you wanna do, I'll be the pilot
Don't miss your flight (Do you wanna fly with me?)

I'm the stewardess of the plane
Can you feel the turbulence and maintain?
Please refrain, stay in your seat
Until we reach the gate (Until we reach the gate)
I'm the stewardess of the plane
Can you feel the turbulence and maintain?
Please refrain, stay in your seat (Yo, Missy, check this out)

Take me higher
Let's just go for a little joy ride
Whatever, man
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Let's stay buckled up
And let's make love across the friendly skies, yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
I'm the passenger of this plane
I feel the turbulence, I'll maintain
I will refrain, I'll stay in my seat
Until I reach the gate ('Til I reach the gate, no, no, no)
I'm the passenger of this plane
I feel the turbulence, I'll maintain (I'll maintain)
I will refrain, I'll stay in my seat (Do you wanna fly with me?)

I want you (I want you)
Ba-baby, want to (Baby, you know I want)
I really, really wanna— (Uh) you
I sho nuff wanna— you
I want you (Yes, I do, I want you)
Baby, baby, I want to (I know you know what I want)
I really, really wanna— you (I really wanna— you)
I sho nuff wanna— (Sho nuff wanna) you

Is there anything that you want?
Is there anything that you need?
Call on me (Ginuwine)
Call on me (Ginuwine)
Is there anything that you want?
Is there anything that you crave?
Call on me (Ginuwine)
'Cause I'm a passenger of your plane
Yeah
Come on, Missy, fly with me
Come on, Missy, fly with me, fly with me
Come on, Missy, fly with me (Check it out, check it out)
Come on, Missy, fly with me, fly with me1Embed
