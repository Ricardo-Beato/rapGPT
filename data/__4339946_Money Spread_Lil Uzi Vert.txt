69 ContributorsMoney Spread Lyrics
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Oh my God
Yeah
Y'all niggas be workin' so hard
I don't do nothin'
I don't do shit (Lil Uzi)
Y'all want this shit so bad (Lil Uzi, I swear)
Y'all want it? Come on, you can have it
Huh-huh-huh, huh, hurry up, hurry up, take this shit (Huh-huh-huh)
Take it 'fore I take it back (Hurry up)
Let's go

Open up a loaf of bread, then spread it out
I remember I almost ain't make it out (Yeah)
You too old, you just keep tryna burn it out
She said, "Lil Uzi, please, can you eat me out?"
I said, "No, I cannot, I could beat it out"
Put it in her, she screamin' like, "Take it out" (Ouch)
There's no feelings with no, um, relations now
I had got money, then took the paper route (Yeah)
My deposit, it look just look like my saving now
Get hit with a charge, my boy gon' take it now
But don't worry, 'cause we gonna break him out (We got him)
Cook the crack like a chef, so I base it out (Whip it)
Okay, my, my, my, my, that's my baby now
Keep it on the low 'cause that's your lady now
I just made me a hundred and eighty now
That's how much the promoter be payin' now

What you gon' do? Yeah, huh
When they come for you? Yeah, huh
What you gon' do? Yeah, huh

But I'm off the boot, yeah, huh
I don't ever lose, I don't ever snooze
'Cause I just popped me two blues, yeah
No, I don't follow no rules
Fuck your bitch right out the sole of her shoes, yeah
That Billie Jean, Billie Jean, Billie Jean, yeah
These niggas stealin' my moves, yeah
Five-seveN, Five-seveN, Five-seveN, Five, FN bust your top, yeah
Put it right in her neck just like a tie
I go to her crib just with my fire
I got a thot live on my opp's block
She always give up the drop (Drop)
We always gon' be on top
Whether you like it or not (Not, not)
My chain too cold, but I'm hot, made it colder
Hit from the back, she made me say, "Woah, there" (Let's go)
I hit that girl, made her pull her rotor (Okay)
I hit that, then I had break my shoulder (Yeah, yeah)

Open up a loaf of bread, then spread it out (Out)
I remember I almost ain't make it out (Out)
You too old, you just keep tryna burn it out (Oh)
She said, "Lil Uzi, please, can you eat me out?" (Yeah)
I said, "No, I cannot, I could beat it out" (Ew)
Put it in her, she screamin' like, "Take it out" (Ouch)
There's no feelings with no, um, relations now (Yeah)

My deposit, it look just look like my saving now (Yeah)
Get hit with a charge, my boy gon' take it now (Woo)
But don't worry, 'cause we gonna break him out
Cook the crack like a chef, so I base it out (Master chef)
Okay, my, my, my, my, that's my baby now (My, my, my)

Hahaha, I got your bitch over here promotin' my nuts (I got your bitch)
Yeah, your ho is a slut, hit her from the back, nigga, in her guts (Give me that)
Yeah, slap it on her butt, whole lotta white stuff on her butt (Yeah)
I know that ho freaky, she's a nut (Yeah)
She just sucked me up, young nigga goin' nuts (Uh-huh)
Uh, Glock 17 holdin' the nuts, y'all niggas really frontin' for what?
Get a pussy nigga bust for nothin' (Fah-fah)
All that talkin', need to hush it, bluffin'
Kill a nigga for the money, frontin'
In the hood, hoes stuntin', money (Stuntin')
In the booty club throwin' money (Money)
Just like a diamond, nigga, know I'm shinin'
And I do this shit Monday through Sunday
Y'all broke as fuck, can't get no money (Huh?)
I'm laughin', these niggas, they ain't doin' nothin' (Nah)
Yeah, I smoke big blunts, I smoke big blunts, bitch, I big stunt
Everybody know that Slime got a big gun
Niggas be playin', when I point my finger, they gon' shoot somethin' (Fah-fah)

Open up a loaf of bread, then spread it out
