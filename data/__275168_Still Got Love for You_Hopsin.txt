33 ContributorsStill Got Love for You Lyrics
You left me and you went home to Indianapolis
If I wanted, I'd be getting plenty of ass and tits
But I want you, can you send me an answer quick?
Lost in your love, baby, give me a map to this
Never knew what love felt like till I met you
My heart wasn't for any other woman except you
But you stabbed it till it bled through
And now my head screwed 'cause I shoulda been the one who had left you
Accepted our break up really wasn't that pleasant
But I learned to deal with it and didn't ask questions
No point in making the past present
But after a month and a half, you was a month and a half pregnant
Damn, my heart taken badly
Now I'm a situation dealing with another baby daddy
Sad part about it yo, it's not even my kid
Evidence proves you really out of your mind, bitch

I swear I thought you was my lady (lady)
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
You might also like
I'm in shock, life feeling like a crazy movie
I really don't appreciate the way you do me
Since I got your news I been dating groupies
But they never last, all they want is fame and jewelry
These gold-diggers can't recruit me
I keep running back to you as if the pain is soothing
'Cause the bond we had is something I got used to
My mind is telling me to say bye-bye, screw you
You ain't even in love with the guy you having a kid with
When I think about it I get sick, you did this
Clubbing with your friends and drinking till you get senseless
Shoulda thought about this shit before you sipped it
You put faith into his dick
And now you pregnant by a dipshit, life is all twisted
Our world could've been terrific
But the Hopsin bus passed baby, and you missed it

I swear I thought you was my lady (lady)
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Now ain't no reason to be smiling for
I'm always the type looking down on whores
And even though the goddamn child is yours
You know I still got your back on child support
'Cause we both know you don't make enough for day care
That shoulda been my baby, what the fuck, this ain't fair
Call if you need me that's fine by me
But the jealousy killing me 'cause that's not my seed
I don't know why I take this crap from you
Break my back for you, I can't adapt to you
We ain't compatible, face the facts, it's true
But when you lost why do I make a path for you?
I spent a long time working at making our love tighter
But you sipping JÃ¤germeister, and having these one nighters
I'll never be able to trust you
My nigga Tecca Nina said it best, "I love you, but fuck you"

Oh no no no, you played your games
And now we'll never be the same
See I love you, but I hate you
And I hate the fact I still love you
Yeah yeah, oh why, oh why

I swear I thought you was my lady (lady)
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me14Embed
