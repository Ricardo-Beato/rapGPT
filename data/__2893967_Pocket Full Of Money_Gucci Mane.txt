6 ContributorsPocket Full Of Money Lyrics
I got a pocket full of money, and I'm gon' be honest
I'm a leave here with your woman
Cause I'm so damn dishonest
I'mma pull up to the club, and park my shit in front of it
I need a bunch of condoms cause I fuck a lot of hundreds
I got a pocket full of money, and I'm gon' be honest
I'm a leave here with your woman
Cause I'm so damn dishonest
I'mma pull up to the club, and park my shit in front of it
I need a bunch of condoms cause I fuck a lot of hundreds

Serve deuces, serve ounces
My trap house be bouncin'
Your baby brother got a bomb from me
Yellow Ferrari, its a bumblebee
Bitch can't get a crumb from me
If a nigga wanna hang with me, gotta shoot a firearm for me
Got a company,  off a quarter key
Run off on me its a tragedy
Gold masterpiece like I'm Master P
Wanna sign with me, wanna rap with me
Then you first you gotta be a trap athelete
Get your whole clique killed for a half a p
Industry no rapsody
In my hood y'all couldn't last a week
My young niggas bout to leave out the Jeep
Earn your keep
Headshot across the street your brains leak all down the street
You might also like
I got a pocket full of money, and I'm gon' be honest
I'm a leave here with your woman
Cause I'm so damn dishonest
I'mma pull up to the club, and park my shit in front of it
I need a bunch of condoms cause I fuck a lot of hundreds
I got a pocket full of money, and I'm gon' be honest
I'm a leave here with your woman
Cause I'm so damn dishonest
I'mma pull up to the club, and park my shit in front of it
I need a bunch of condoms cause I fuck a lot of hundreds

I'ma pull up right in front the club
I am the club, I run the club
Smokin' on this cali bud
Your girlfriend on all type of drugs
I only rock designer clothes
I only sell designer drugs
I'm sellin dope, this country town is borin' we can't find a club
Shoot it out with barney guns
I bet I pop behind the club
My young niggas hop out and park
Bitch you standin' right by the club
50 shots thats not enough, 200 shots that monkey nuts
Gucci Mane got monkey nuts
I bet them niggas don't try us
Bricks in the wall are hockey dust
50  start a massacre
Pullin' up to your passenger, then shootin' up your challenger
Nigga see me textin' you, why you ain't answer us
Better go hide in Canada, make em beat up your manager
I got a pocket full of money, and I'm gon' be honest
I'm a leave here with your woman
Cause I'm so damn dishonest
I'mma pull up to the club, and park my shit in front of it
I need a bunch of condoms cause I fuck a lot of hundreds
I got a pocket full of money, and I'm gon' be honest
I'm a leave here with your woman
Cause I'm so damn dishonest
I'mma pull up to the club, and park my shit in front of it
I need a bunch of condoms cause I fuck a lot of hundredsEmbed
