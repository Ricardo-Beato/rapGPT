God, I thought I loved you so
God, I thought I loved you so

They done let in the skinny jean-wearing
Fro-for-days in a old AA
Ball' so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don’t sleep
Figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think

Oh, oh-oh, oh
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga, hey
You might also like
I live through words, not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, past the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
Lotta of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Some things will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga

Hey, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga, yeah
Oh, oh (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, 'cause nigga
We live this shit, hey
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, nigga
Yeah
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Here we go
On, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
And we dream
Oh, oh-oh, oh
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and67Embed
