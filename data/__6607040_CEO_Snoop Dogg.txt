21 ContributorsCEO Lyrics
Rick Rock beats

I'm back like I never left
In this motherfucker spitting rhymes 'til my last breath
Snoop Dogg in the building, yes, y'all
Line 'em up, barber shop, fade 'em all
I'm watching the game from the halls of fame
I'm balling, mayne, I boss up back in this thang
Believe me, bro, you wanna stick around and see the show
See me go, Snoop Dogg, CEO
Proceed to capitalize, I'm back with my guys, slapping the five
Making more hits to slap in your trunk
They know this is gangsta funk
Take your risk and get what you want
Fuck with this, I figured he won't
Figured they lying, I'm a cold muthafucka, it's getting chilly
I didn't really wanna fuck him up and slap him silly
So I ran that bitch-ass nigga up out the city

Back up in the motherfucker, tell me how you feel now (How you feel now, oh)
Either you're fake or you're plastic, it's hard to keep it real now (What? So real)
How many niggas you shot, how much money you got
And do you really post up on the block?
Not ordinary, it may vary
I get my means by any means necessary
You might also like
I'm on my shit, only boss niggas that I'm with
Still no talking from my bitch
Slick nigga but don't slip
You don't wanna be on the wrong side of that four-fifth
Don Dada, want a lotta
Niggas wanna fuck around with that gun shotta
Ambitions of a rider
Machiavelli tip, sitting back, let it rip
I'm on a private island, million on a trip
Level up, niggas don't move 'til I tell 'em what it is
I'm 'bout to blow this whole label up, ya dig?
I got a plan to change up the game, it's big
Listen close and follow me
I'm 'bout to tell you how it's 'bout to be
Check the game and the pedigree
I'm the same nigga from the Beach
With more knowledge and more game, the best weed
Real talk, nigga, preach

Back up in the motherfucker, tell me how you feel now (We back, we back, we back)
Either you're fake or you're plastic, it's hard to keep it real now (Fake-ass nigga)
How my niggas you shot, how much money you got
And do you really post up on the block?
Not ordinary, it may vary
I get my means by any means necessary
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Rick Rock
Snoop Dogg, haha, CEO
