15 ContributorsCrown Lyrics
Chance you've seen her once in a dream
Let me show you better, bring you closer to see
Can you undress her down to her lingeries?
Run your fingers through the middle while I smoke potpourri
Got champagne spillin' on the sofa, the seats
Lookin' cocaine dealer white, a code for the key
Hit em' with the venom, with the cobra, the squeeze
And I really wanna wrestle with the boa in ya jeans
I look at you, look at us, look at me
Got a vision of a lovin' that we both wanna see
Shouldn't I, wouldn't I
Couldn't I be your lucky lady f-forever f-f
Come on

When I'm reppin' this crown
I be steppin' in style, I be breakin' it down
Doin' feminine things
Pink lemonade chain and my belly ring bling
When I come for this cash
Not a regular bitch, don't you ever forget
That I'm reppin' this crown
So you better wild out when the queen is in town

Mami on a mint Kawasaki in the Chlo√© khaki
Issey Miyake, folding yen with Miss Origami
I'm a global bitch, you a local thotty
I be, I be in a Paris lobby
Playing Tamigotchi, who Pocket Polly?
Hop to Mali, sisters in Bali
Get the picture, papi, get richer mami (Uh)
It really ain't fair
You see me, you see me, you stop and you stare
Finessing and flair
You see me I'm sexy, them bitches they jealous
I step in the room and I'm breaking your focus
I bet you your fellas be checking up on it
I jump in the Rover, I rip up the road
And I'm ready, I'm naked
I'm knocking, now open up
You might also like
And once you find out what I'm talking 'bout
You'll never be lonely
You see the stars and the clouds up above you
And baby no one will ever, ever love you like I do
(Yeah)

When I'm reppin' this crown
I be steppin' in style, I be breakin' it down
Doin' feminine things
Pink lemonade chain and my belly ring bling
When I come for this cash
Not a regular bitch, don't you ever forget
That I'm reppin' this crown
So you better wild out when the queen is in town

When I'm reppin' this crown
I be steppin' in style, I be breakin' it down
Doin' feminine things
Pink lemonade chain and my belly ring bling
When I come for this cash
Not a regular bitch, don't you ever forget
That I'm reppin' this crown
So you better wild out when the queen is in town
When I'm reppin' this crown
I be steppin' in style, I be breakin' it down
Doin' feminine things
Pink lemonade chain and my belly ring bling
When I come for this cash
Not a regular bitch, don't you ever forget
That I'm reppin' this crown
So you better wild out when the queen is in townEmbed
