8 ContributorsSugar Lyrics
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so

Tell me, have you ever been addicted to somebody
Still functioning within the melancholy
Baby's mommy got me raw like a zombie
Prolly won't stop until she murder me softly
Vanity is such a popular scene
We could build a family out of the crop of the cream
It's you plus me, we followin' dreams
So why we treat each other like we on the opposite teams, huh?
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
I'm trying to play without my poker face
I put the joker in a shoulder holster
Underneath the floor in a hole
And I'ma save it for a stormy day
And if the clouds break tint
The sun will brush it off like it's all made of lint
Silly you, gimme kiss, never say you never gave me nothing
'Cause you gave me shit
You might also like
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so
You're such a sweet thing
You're so mean to me and me and me
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so

Sometimes I wonder if you're fucking with my head
Some kinda monster living underneath the bed
But forever I'mma ride with you, one hundred percent
Even when I never fully understand whatever you said
Feels like I'm looking at something, painful
A little illustration of an angel
You're like a tattoo that's on my eyeball
I'm blind from the shine of your halo
Girl, my imagination is the busiest
Why you trying to match wits with an idiot?
Passion is the measuring stick
We qualify, we set the world on fire
Just to burn up all the pretty shit
I promise you, that I'm accountable
Probably trying to prove, our love is possible
Now paint a portrait of complaints
But when it makes a mess, confess the stains

You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so
You're such a sweet thing
You're so mean to me and me and me
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so

It must be the devil when I taste her sweat, it's the sweetest
Might forfeit just to reach an agreement
Throw the fight and then I'll hold you tight
Poke a hole in the lid so we don't suffocate and choke tonight
I know I prolly ain't right, but I'm just right
We thug life for the love life
And look at where we took it, but you ain't have to cook it for me
Sugar ain't good for me, sugar ain't
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so
You're such a sweet thing
You're so mean to me and me and me
You're such a sweet thing
You so, you so

You such a, you such a
You so, you so
You such a you such a
You so, you soEmbed
