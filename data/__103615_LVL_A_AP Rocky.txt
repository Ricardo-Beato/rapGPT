8 ContributorsQuest Lyrics
(Perfect!)

I'm on a quest (I'm on a mission)
And I'm gon' need a pole for that (I'm gon' need a pole)
Think I'm gon' need a TEC, yeah (I'm gon' need a TEC)
Or I'm making a sword for that (I'm making a sword)
Put it up to yo' neck (It's at yo' neck)
I don't do back and forth (I don't do back and forth)
I hop in the foreign (I hop in the foreign)
With a ho who do porn (Slut)
And I got her wet, she pourin' (Yeah)

Rockin' Rick Owen head to toe (Rick, it's head to toe)
Yes, I'm back on my shit, you know (Uh)
And I'm smoking on Do-Si-Dos (Smoking on Do-Si-Dos)
Then I go make a hit, for sure (Yeah)
And I'm poppin' my shit, you know (I'm poppin' my shit, for sure)
Prolly fuckin' yo' bitch, for sure (Yeah)
And I'm stacking a brick, for sure (Fuck that ho)
I walk in the store and I spend on clothes what you gon' spend on rent (Fuck that ho)
Japanese clothes what I go put on 'cause they don't get fly as this (Fly as this)
I got a track fit, it's Balеnciaga, no I don't rock ASICS (Fuck that shit)
I feel like Wayne on the Tha C V 'causе this flow I spit so sick (I feel like Wayne)
I got a K with a TEC-9 and I ain't afraid to shoot that bitch (Fah, fah, fah, fah)
Yes, I'm a dog going canine and I got a bone to pick with that bitch (Yeah, huh, huh)
They tryna tarnish on my name, throw a lil' dirt up on that shit (Yeah, huh, huh)
I tell 'em, "Suck up on my dick, get a lil' nasty on that shit" (Tell 'em who's gonna suck)
