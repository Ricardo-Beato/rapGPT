2 ContributorsAnything Lyrics
For a dollar bill people will do anything
They'd rob and steal for a dollar bill
Yeah, they will
Yeah, just gon' sit back and let the beat ride a lil' bit
Let a motherfucker hear what it's supposed to sound like, you dig?

Yeah, I'm from around the way, I slung about a ounce a day
I'm living proof you ain't got no excuse
If it was there, it ain't got shit to lose
Them older cats would chunk a nigga fronts
Would rock it up and smoke that shit in blunts
For tennis shoes, we was gettin' fools
We caught you slippin', we would get at you
With no respect, fuck a nigga set
We shot it up and murk his connects
What's yours is mine for a dollar sign
I blame the grind, I was outta line
I'm reminiscing on what niggas did
For big rewards, you took a bigger risk
They say what comes around it go around
And when you least expect, the shit be goin' down

Gotta get it how I live, that's how the streets raised me, oh
And for that paper most niggas do, anything (Anything), anything
A solid dude, so that's how a move, I'm a street-made G
Not tryna lose, so I gotta do anything, anything
You might also like
They called it murder in the first degree
And it was then that it occurred to me
This was some inside shit
That was your friend got hit, huh
They knew all about the stash spot
Knew where the money was and cashed out
You got the nerve to act like you don't know
When all the while you steady gettin' mo'
Just remember, dude, we watchin' you
I spared your life the day they shot at you
'Cause if I didn't, they was coming back to finish off yo' ass
You a walkin' dead and it's a fact
You slimy niggas play the game wrong
Get popped, can't do they time, so they sang songs
I turned the game on, watch the Knicks play
I sent them shottas at yo' ass 'cause you a bitchmade nigga

Gotta get it how I live
That's how the streets raised me (The streets raised me)
And for that paper most niggas do, anything (Anything), anything
A solid dude, so that's how a move, I'm a street-made G
Not tryna lose, so I gotta do anything, anything

Real nigga in your presence
Money couldn't change me past or the present
Homie, I'm the essence, tote a Smith & Wesson
Eyes hella tiny, in the hood is where you find me
Out here with the grimey, bitches wanna come up
Niggas slangin' snow packs, nose runnin' from 'em
Let you get your mind right, money on that weed, though
Baby on them mollywhops, blinded by the weed smoke
We come from them streets, ho, I stay on that ign'ant ish
Ain't nothin' 'bout me weak, ho, always game to stomp a bitch
And stomp a bitch, and stomp a bitch, got super boxing game
So I prefer to punch a bitch, mission accomplished
Put me up against whatever, I am bustin' it
A nigga's born hustlin' and tusslin'
And strugglin' and musclin'
Just making you aware who you fuckin' withEmbed
