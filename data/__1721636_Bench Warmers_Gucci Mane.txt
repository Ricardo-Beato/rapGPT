12 ContributorsBench Warmers Lyrics
Gucci make money
That's what you call money
Small money mall money you ain't got no money
Black cars stupid guwap got that white folk money money
Six day work week smoke break on Sunday
So country country cash out hundreds
Dropped 70 on my Hummer but that ain't bout nothing
So country country cash out hundreds
So country country cash out hundreds
Dropped 70 on my Hummer but that ain't bout nothing
60 g's on the Vet but that wasn't no stuntin'
Bart Simpson chain appraised at a clean 100
Mighty mouse charm appraised at just 50
Have it shine like Diddy's
Cross em up like Bibby
Many men wanna kill me but I'm not 50
I'mma take one with me let me know who with me
Who you with mutherfucker blood in no envy
When the fed's snatched me I said I had no memory
Iâ€™m tha hottest thang to hit patchwerk this century
Used to have a 10 speed now I'm riding a bentley(yeeeeaaaa)

This for the bench warmers
Get off the bench and try to be a starter
The water boys just go and get the water
Damn you a reflection of your father(yeah)
This for the bench warmers
Your daddy say he wish he had a daughter
Damn you a reflection of your father
I bet that you wish you was a baller (GUCCI)
You might also like
Gucci godfather, flow just like water
Never bought s-dot carter's
I rock with a new jack swag so I rock more harder
One thang I never do is kiss my partner
No kunta kinte more like shaka (shaka zulu)
We don't shoot arrows we shoot chopper's
No voo-doo priest psychic or which doctor can predict
When gucci gone get off ya
La costra nostra
Glock's and holsters
Roaches, witches, rats and vultures
To get it out of victim we might use torture my
Saucers got million's so I keep lawyer's
You derail us, we'll destroy ya
Big boss man, Never been no worker
Mojo gettin paid just to roll up purple
Gotta be a boss to get in my circle
Got to get it off or the click might murk ya
You gotta be a boss to get in this circle
You gotta get it off or my click might murk ya pussy!

This for the bench warmers
Get off the bench and try to be a starter
The water boys just go an get the water
Damn you a reflection of your father(yeah)
This for the bench warmers
Your daddy say he wish he had a daughter
Damn you a reflection of your father I bet that u wish you was a baller (GUCCI)
What's up Jeezy and what's up Kiki
Them weak ass niggas couldn't hurt my pinky
Trying to kill the kid nigga, what you thinking?
Stop Gucci breathing you must be dreaming
Somebody pinch me cause I'm not sleeping
Black man found slain and I'm not weeping
No surrender, Fuck retreating
Spies in the operation, I smell treason
I never killed the man cause I had no reason
Dope game hard and you still hadn't Meechie
I never killed the man cause I had no reason
The dope game hard and you still lil jeezy pussy
