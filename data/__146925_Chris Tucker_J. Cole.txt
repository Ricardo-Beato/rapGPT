Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Ayy, all you broke nigga be quiet
I can't control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge
My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga, I don't fuck with no birds
My main chick she got real hair, never had to shop to get hers
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat, but goddamn she rocking them furs
Ball so hard ma'fucker wanna fine me, and now the ho wanna climb me
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me
Ball so hard, I'm the truth, nigga, All-Star game, catching 'oops, nigga
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops, nigga

Ha, Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Ayy, all you broke nigga be quiet

Cole world, safe to say I'm cold-blooded
In this cold life the more cold you are, seem like the more the hoes love you
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shoot the video with no budget, go
Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ayy
She think I'm in the NBA, why a nigga can't have his MBA?
Next time I'ma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon' shock her
"You're so tall, what team do you play for?" No bitch, I'm a doctor
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah, float like a propeller, no helicopter shit
Knots thick like a bowlegged chick, stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar, ha
Fuck your 9, I'm a whole different caliber, nigga say they pop 'cause they don't fill they collars up
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up, bitch nigga

Ayy, all you broke nigga be quiet

I'ma start off with these four bars, I'm in a barbie at a sports bar
I'm rockin' gold bars, whoop your ass with this crowbar, I'm like "Oh Boy
Catch your girl off that rebound" (Rebound,) fix her hair up, get her a re-do (Re-do)
Just my car out the paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin' re-coupe (Tell 'em)
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it 'fore I go on a dinner date
Might eat a rich bitch (Might eat a rich bitch,) yes, I got me expensive taste (Yeah)
Got my pockets on full (Full,) stomach on full (Full,) gun on full, I got full coverage (True)
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin' on gas, full service (Damn)
Money talk, true story, if you ain't got none then don't say shit (Uh)
Banana clips goin' apeshit, you don't make money, don't make sense
I got gold on my bracelet (Bracelet,) got your girlfriend chasin' it (Chasin' it)
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit, uh

Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, ma'fucker
Ayy, all you broke nigga be quiet
This liquor I been sippin' got me kissing all these models
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow
Please don't tell my mama I spent my tuition on these bottles
Just to pay back all these loans, man, we gon' have to hit the lotto9Embed
