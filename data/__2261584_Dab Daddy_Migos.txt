Yeah, ahhh
Lemme talk my shit, nigga
Migo, huh
Fuck wrong with these niggas, nigga?
Yeah

When I copped the coupe they was mad at me
Hoes calling me the dab daddy (I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy)
Bettin' poker chips, I ain't playin' Madden (I ain't playin' Madden and I ain't playin' sticks)
I'm a rich nigga, you can check my status (You can check my status, you can check the stats)
Pass chemistry, fuck mathmatics (Fuck mathmatics, I ain't pass school)
My money counter do the adding (Money counter do the rules)
I bought a carpet from Aladdin (I bought a carpet from Aladdin)
So I can finesse and do magic (So I can fly and finesse, nigga)
Rammin' the engine in traffic
Lost Mike and Pete, that's tragic (R.I.P., damn)

I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy yeah
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy

Offset
From the jail cell, my wrist so sick it got sickle cells
Working my wrist like a ferris wheel, you say this and that while my pockets filled
We don't spare no nigga, cut his head off and show me his real
We got diamonds and gold, ain't no stainless steel
Independant, we didn't take a deal
I know you heard about the fight, I know you heard about the shooting, I know you heard a nigga ruthless
Thirty thousand for a viewing
Bitch you see the dab
10 pairs Margielas, you do the math
When I pull up on Beverly shopping, I pull up in a Phantom, not in a cab
Red bottom drippin' it's a blood bath
Ferragamo, arrested for my dab
Say I'm the dab daddy with my dabbin' ass
Fuck your bitch one time I give her back, here!
You might also like
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy yeah
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy

Dab! Dab! On top of dab
Takeoff in the kitchen like I'm Dexter's Lab
Walk in the mall and I dip in Ge'
Swappin', no swappin', no check the tag
Dab daddy so the bitches wanna take selfies
Dicking it up, never not fuck they momma, they call me Melvin
Young rich nigga but they know that we handsome and wealthy
Takeoff is spillin' Actavis on new Margielas
Everywhere I go they call me dab daddy
Dab daddy, got the different, different dab
Flippin' dab like a acrobat
Flippin' it, flippin' it, flippin' 'em
2500 my typa drink, I got expensive habits (Actavis, Actavis, Actavis)
Throw body parts on my Murci√©lago, pull up like Go Go Gadget
Pull up in valet, David Blaine do magic
Dippin', dabbin' in the Phantom, lookin' at the roof and it's panoramic
Diamonds clear water like they from Atlantic
Dab daddy, I'm the king of the fashion!
Takeoff!
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy yeah
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy15Embed
