71 ContributorsNo Scratches Lyrics
It’s for the love
Cause we love you so much
Keep it real
I don’t feel what you feel though
You don’t feel what I feel so
It all started out

See first I had patience, and a nigga had energy
But now I'm weak, definitely
Pedi to the pedal, you finna speed
You remind me of, of my Jeep
But off in the future, and what it’s finna be
All your memories can become enemies
So let’s intercede I know you in the seat
But let’s get outta that, before it’s injuries
At first I had patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting my time, my time, my time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All around my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (No scratches)
See first they had patience
You might also like
But niggas start getting sick, niggas start getting ill
Niggas got cold feet, niggas start getting chills
Niggas start staying home cause niggas start getting bills
Building up an immunity, niggas stopped getting hurt
Niggas relied on faith
Hopin’ niggas get healed, it's hopeless nigga, get real
But ah, get back on the pill
We in it for the feel, but even winners turn sinners

Patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting your time, your time, your time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All inside your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (no stratches)
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (no scratches)
First we had patience

Mini bar raided, in the Indy car faded
500 miles, it’s pretty far, ain't it?
But it’s a pretty car, ain't it?
Pretty hard painted (but pretty darn dangerous)
But we ain't get the memo
Hangin’ out the window, they don’t care no more
Tryna take this mini to a limo...
Without a helmet then you can Thelma it
Louis, Louise, but we on the same thing
So I be James Dean
So your wreck and my wreck look like the same scene
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (no scratches)
First we had patience19Embed
