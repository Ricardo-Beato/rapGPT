Ha (Ha), it's Gucci (It's Gucci, uh)

I feel like Scarface, I'ma rob Frank and buy a Franck Muller (Damn)
They say I'm two-faceded, I fucked her then said I ain't do it (Ooh)
I'm in the kitchen whippin' up oil, bae said, "It ain't movin'"(Skrrt)
So I robbed the plug 'cause he keep losin' and I'm a sore loser (Bah)
My cousin Duke just rolled a joint longer than two rulers (True)
They call me "Two times" at all times, at least got two shooters

She playin' charades, tryna get attention, but I ain't lookin' (Nah)
Is it a parade or somethin'? 'Cause me and Dolph got the same Bentley (Dolph)
Wеnt to my grandma house, ten million in the samе kitchen (Ten)
I'm Kurt Cobain, I'm goin' insane, feel like my brain missin' (Mhm)
My nigga Fat keep servin' babies, he think he Wayne Williams (Yeah)
You tryna stack a billion dollars, we got the same mission, Wop

Chasin' commas, doin' numbers (Ha)
