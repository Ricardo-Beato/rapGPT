10 ContributorsI’m Scared (Insert) Lyrics
I was raised to be white-black, I was raised to be equal to anyone. Listening to you, you are so prejudiced, I just can't believe it! I am shocked! You're scaring me!
What is he saying that you have a problem with?
What is he saying that you have a problem with?

What scares us is I think we hear violence

I think you don't know what the fuck it is you talkin' about!

I'm so scared to go out in the world next year, because I was never a prejudice person until listening to you, it's really scary hearing what you're saying, I'm very scared!

What is he saying that you have a problem with?
What is he saying that you have a problem with?

What scares us is I think we hear violence

I think you don't know what the fuck it is you talkin' about!

They're saying questions about us fearing, white people fearing, you know, what will the black folks do and stuff, we should be running down the streets, screaming and ranting and raving cause when you look at the statistics, Who is the one dying? From the policemen? From the KKK? From the skinheads?

What scares us is I think we hear violence

What is he saying that you have a problem with? And why is it when a black man stands up to speak for his people, and all the people stand up to speak for their people, there's no problem with it?
But you saying he said "black", he said "Jew"
When people talk, they talk like that
But why is it, when a black man stands up to speak for his people, you feel so threatened? Everybody's paranoid?
And you talk about black segregation? We live in Harlem and we live in Watts. We live in Bedford–Stuyvesant. That's a form of segregation. We walk through Bensonhurst. We get killed. So what are you talking about?1Embed
