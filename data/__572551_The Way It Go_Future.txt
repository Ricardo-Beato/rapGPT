8 ContributorsThe Way It Go Lyrics
Smoke kush, fuck bitches, That's the way it go
Drink lean, sell dope, That's the way it go
Walk into Fifths and buy the store, That's the way it go
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
Buy some ice and ride foreign, That's the way it go
Hit the club and buy the bar, That's the way it go
VIP, we usually stars, That's the way it go
That's the way it go, that's the way it go

Either way it go, I'ma smoke a pound of kush
Got a redbone on my line, like to fuck wit crooks
She gotta brain on her, suck a good dick and read books
I'll take lil shawty shoppin, cause I like the way she look
I could put up wit her attitude, plus she ain't a stalker
Inside the cup pink, and I'm playing  wit them dolphins
Ridin' fresh as hell, money in the glove compartment
Goin' cross town, to meet the bitch in her apartment
Got my jewelery on monster, flexin in my Burberry
Saks Fifth shoppin', twenty bags I ain't carry em
Jumpin out the Porsche Cayenne, zippin thru traffic
Money, cars, clothes. Young Future living lavish

Smoke kush, fuck bitches, That's the way it go
Drink lean, sell dope, That's the way it go
Walk in Fifths and buy the store, That's the way it go
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
Buy some ice and ride foreign, That's the way it go
Hit the club and buy the bar, That's the way it go
VIP, we usually stars, That's the way it go
That's the way it go, that's the way it go

I rock red diamonds like a maxi pad
And yellow diamonds like a taxi cab
My closet look like a smash and grab
My driveway look like a launching pad
My English broke, so I'm slurring words
Imma zoo keeper, I'm holdin' birds
My swag absurd, can't be put in words
You old rappers, kicked to the curb
Now the way it go, about 3 or 4
I'mma probably leave wit bout 3 or 4
And they followin and they swallowin
I gotta house so big can't find em in
Or I could get a room and just pile em in
Gucci Mane switchin' up the style again
Gotta hunned mill on my mind again
I'm icey bitch, go blind again

Smoke kush, fuck bitches. That's the way it go
Drink lean, sell dope, That's the way it go
Walk in Fifths and buy the store, That's the way it go
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
Buy some ice and ride foreign, That's the way it go
Hit the club and buy the bar, That's the way it go
VIP, we usually stars, That's the way it go
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
Hit it wit the fork, Hit it, hit wit the fork
Ion drink unless it's dirty, and I'm higher than a hawk
White and red tiger stripes, I'm in the Aston Martin
I put the roof inside the trunk, the kush be stinkin' like a skunk
I'm the clouds, just what I want. Today I smoked a hundred blunts
I took this bad bitch to lunch, she been hittin' me for a month
Had to make some time for her, I been busy all this money
If I ain't outta town doing shows, you know what I be on
From Benihana to the Intercontinental draped in stones
Wit a pretty yellowbone, and she hold a nice tone
Got a call and a text, hope it's money on my phone
My bitch flying in from Cali, say her flight 3 hours long2Embed
