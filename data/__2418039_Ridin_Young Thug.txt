46 ContributorsRidin Lyrics
Hey, yeah, Thugger. I'm just gonna go all the way street with it, you know what I'm saying? 'Cause I got a real street nigga with me, you know what I'm saying? So answer my question

Is you riding for the case you know?
Is you dying by the case, you know?
Stay down with the case, you know
Bumping ashes in the face of folks
I'm riding for the cause you know
I'm riding with my dogs you know
If you don't want to go oh oh
Just know you a pussy ass nigga for sure
For sure
Pull up to the block and then wet it up
Pull up to your property, wet it up
My bitches said he down so he gon' wet it up
Your bitches need to come and get wetted up
These bitches seen this swag and they sweated up
These bitches see this ice, they get wetted up
Pussy bumbaclot, you know we not scared of you
You know just where we at on the regular

I was just chilling today
I was just relaxing today
I just made a bitty bitty k
I was just chilling today
I'm just tryna dodge the cops
Spent my last fifty bands on a watch
Nigga playing, I'ma laugh on the spot
Ho I can make you look like an amateur tonight
I can fuck a bitch on a bus like she Rosa Parks
Nigga's diamonds soaking wet, yours dark
Keep me out it baby, that between y'all
Fuck her bad like I'm tryna catch a charge
Fuck her fast like I'm tryna catch a charge
Yeah, play with me I'm Brian Nichols
I'ma shoot a motherfucker, yeah y'all
That nigga need a bird, call Tyrone
Yeah, I'ma fuck your bitch while you all gone
Yeah you all gone, but the dog home
And the panties that your daughter don't have on
She don't get what she wants, temper tantrum
Every freezin' diamond she got ain't no silicone
I'm a gangster, I was hanging at a killer's home
And my girl kinda crazy so tell me

Is you riding for the case you know?
Is you dying by the case, you know?
Stay down with the case, you know
Bumping ashes in the face of folks

If you don't want to go oh-oh
Just know you a pussy ass nigga for sure, for sure
Pull up to the block and then wet it up
Pull up to your property, wet it up

Your bitches need to come and get wetted up
These bitches seen that swag and they sweated up
These bitches see this ice, they get wetted up
Pussy bumbaclot, you know we not scared of you
You know just where we at on the regular

I just mixed some perc with some Act (I just mixed some perc with some Act)
Nigga I'm in back of the back (Nigga I'm in back of the back)
In your club and you show up strapped
Pussy, I ain't even know that you rap
Shooters gon' pull up in that whack shit, yeah
Drive by and star in an action, yeah
Dump the whole clip in my ex-bitch, yeah
Eat the pussy, dip on some fast shit, yeah
Put a case on that pussy 'cause I'ma smash it
If I eat it she gotta be a Kardashian
Police pulling us over, she gon' stash it, get it
And I know she ain't gon' say shit
Any rapper in the city I don't play with
Any time I pull up in broad day shit
Call my shooters from the go and they gon' spray shit
Now she want to fuck me now, I got a waitlist
Told the judge suck my dick, fuck probation
And I got to get this money on vacation
Verified in the streets, fuck a placement
Put this 40 in his face, rearrange shit
I ain't got time, I can't drop a dime
Me and Thug pulling up, I'm with Slime
That's a fake ass Rolex, boy you wasting time
I don't know about yours but I'm chasing mine
Is you riding for the case you know?
Is you dying by the case, you know?
Stay down with the case, you know
Bumping ashes in the face of folks
I'm riding for the cause you know
I'm riding with my dogs you know
If you don't want to go oh-oh
Just know you a pussy ass nigga for sure, for sure
Pull up to the block and then wet it up
Pull up to your property, wet it up
My bitches said he down so gon' wet it up
Your bitches need to come and get wetted up
These bitches seen that swag and they sweated up
These bitches see this ice, they get wetted up
Pussy bumbaclot, you know we not scared of you
