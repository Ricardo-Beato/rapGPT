62 ContributorsThey Don’t Like Me Lyrics
Somebody tell they people what the fuck is up
I'm grindin' like a doozer looking cool as fuck
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I sell the stage
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I'm gettin' paid

Eddy Scissorhands is workin' on my linin' (woo!)
Gettin' spiffy for these bitches I be eyeing
Fredward Mercury was playin' while I'm ridin' (oh!)
Down the Ryan, in a Scion (yeah)
And I'm flyin', but it's cool, I got insurance
On the run, because I got warrants (ayy)
But it's cool I got endurance
In school I got suspended, but in turn I got some earnings
Could've spent it all on Thursday, but I saved it for my parents
But I spent a bit on Friday, in the night I hang with Donald
And I'm tired of McDonald's, want a chick that cook Chicano
That can't speak a lick of English
And pronounce my name like "Chano"
She say "something, something" Spanish
I look back like, "Bitch, I-I know"
Toni-i-ight, I'mma make decisions for li-i-ife
Take some Lucys, Boomers
Dark liq' and lights, I might dri-i-ive
That's that shit right there that I don't li-i-ike
There, that shit, just had to say
Shouts to the niggas that passed away
And shouts for the niggas that's here right now
And shots at the niggas that got away
So sad to say, but it's all good
Niggas gon' celebrate, and wait for the day
And wait for the day shit detonate, with Alizé
Like live from the Chi', it's Saturday ni-i-ight
You might also like
Used to have some patience, now it's all gone
Force feed these motherfuckers eatin' foie gras
Force feed these motherfuckers not a rockstar
I'm a say my piece, these other rappers lockjaw
I don't think they like me (I don't think they like me)
I don't think I'm icy, I think I'm aight, B
Niggas wanna fight me? That's unnecessary
I don't quit for shit, that's my legendary
Oh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me
Oh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me
Oh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me
Oh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me34Embed
