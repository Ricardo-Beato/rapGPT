61 ContributorsCold Blooded Lyrics
I got my head on a swivel
Think it's time I open my mind where I left these niggas incompletely
Make sure that they can't delete me
I'm bout to rewire your whole fucking mainframe, sick of the same
Lame old same thing
I got some bubonic you might wanna mix with some whisk
I got a vendetta with showing niggas that I'm way better
Feeling way worthless, the lost black sheep of G.O.O.D. Music
Only good for a hook, huh? Let me show you flows
Intuitive when it comes to the many things I know
Cold, most winters I would dream of being a winner
Feeling like less than shit to the doubters
Pain I promise to all who oppose my knowledge
My reign, the fucking essence of pain, fuck rain
Standing in a monsoon of cool, time will tell
This is what it is when you're walking to hell

Cold
Bitch you know I'm cold, yeah
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh, so cold
Niggas know I'm cold, yeah
One cold blooded nigga

I love how I can make so many people feel uneasy
Walk right past, I know you hoes see me
Can't deny the shine of a Jedi
World-class almighty super Cudder the Godly
Burbon, divas just smoking 'tiva, those my hobbies
I love shittin' on these niggas, that is my fave
Can't fuck with an unstoppable force
That lives with no regrets and of course no remorse
One two, one two, assholes now please listen close
I live for the day to watch all you pussies roast
Whoosah whoosah, so I don't slit nobody throat
Aw, it ain't my fault, homie thought he had the juice
Bash a nigga face and watch the blood leak
Put my ear where his jaw was, tell a nigga to speak
Standing in a monsoon of cool, karma is my armor
Was only scared of my father, beyond that I'm

Cold
Bitch you know I'm cold, yeah
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh, so cold
Niggas know I'm cold, yeah
One cold blooded nigga
Cold
Bitch you know I'm cold, yeah
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh, so cold
Niggas know I'm cold, yeah
One cold blooded nigga
