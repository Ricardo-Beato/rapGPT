6 ContributorsI Know U Don’t Love Me LyricsVerse1: Slick Pulla
(Yeah mane, this for all the street talkin and bullshitin)
I thought I did good by shedding light to the hood
But yall niggas still hoes(a, I did what I could)
I heard some niggas looking for us yall so bogus(what)
I’m in the hood daily just in case you ain't notice
I stay dipped up, my shell is frozen
Yo baby momma love me so I guess I’m chosen
I keep the 40 Cal, my clip be pokin
Fresh out the gun shop, I’m dying to stroke it
And I ain't even talking bad about my own hood
It’s just these hatin ass niggas suckin on a playa wood
Mark ass nigga you ain't even seen money
Talkin slick about me, Ima young boss son
Chorus (Slick Pulla)
I know you don’t love me(I know you don’t love me)
You lookin all shady when I come around
I know you don’t love me (I know you don’t love me)
Talkin bad about me when I’m ouuta town
I know you don’t love me (I know you don’t love me)
You givin me hugs but wanna burn me down
But I ain't even trippn on that lil shit
You know I stayed toned up with an extra clip
I know you don’t love me
Verse 2: Jeezy
Oh hatin ass niggas just admit you was jealous
Clique of young rich niggas ain't shit you can tell us
You niggas part time hoes and full time bitches
Take everything so personal
You niggas part time hoes and full time bitches
Take everything so personal
You niggas part time hoes and full time bitches
Take everything so personal
Word on the street niggas got a hit on me
I’m in so many gangs I might kill myself
They ain’t stop making guns yours when they made yours nigga
Fuck around and make me green light your ass(ha ha)
Bunch of niggas with choppers like Black Hawk Down and I ain't gotta be there for that shit to go down
Is that yo chick
Yeah I know that bitch
Yeah I hit her form the back
Yeah I throw that dick (ha ha)
Chorus(Slick Pulla)
I know you don’t love me(I know you don’t love me)
You lookin all shady when I come around
I know you don’t love me (I know you don’t love me)
Talkin bad about me when I’m ouuta town
I know you don’t love me (I know you don’t love me)
You givin me hugs but wanna burn me down
But I ain't even trippn on that lil shit
You know I stayed toned up with an extra clip
I know you don’t love meYou might also likeEmbed
