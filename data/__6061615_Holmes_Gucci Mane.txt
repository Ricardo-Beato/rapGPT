18 ContributorsHolmes Lyrics
Huh
Guwop, brr, brr
Once again I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit (Go)

Walker Homes, Herndon Homes, hell, you can be from Bowen Homes
If you ain't bustin' fire, holmes, I'm tradin' yo' ass like Jerry Jones
Gone on and run along, run by myself, I come alone
Drop my nuts, I'll use my own, you borrow nuts, you took a loan
I'll be playin' naive but I know 'xactly what's goin' on
Chopsticks like I'm Chinese, I might dynamite a hater home
Judge lookin' down on me like he a king sittin' on the throne
Murder charge, I beat the case then beat my chest, I'm King Kong
Lavish home, gettin' super dome, head knocked me out like Larry Holmes
Money long, don't saw the barrel off, I like the barrel long
Gucci gone, you rats ain't really have no one to tattle on
Try me, nigga, Memphis killa, snake your watch and ride along
Pest control, we killin' rodents, that's what Gucci really on
Coronavirus got me itchin', clutchin', all these masks is on
Niggas think it's cool to be broke, that shit ain't in fashion, holmes
Ain't no hit and run, you can't insure it, I see you, we crashin', holmes

I'm from Mill Branch, but I got killers out of Cleaborn Homes
Play pussy, one to the dome, now you gotta create a stone
By myself with a few bales, ain't no stoppin' for jakes or law
Hood hero servin' cold, how he make it with eighty boulders?
My lil' brother, think he pop? Smooth dude and he keep the Glock
In the field with gloves on, swingin' steel, we play for the Sox
High-speed chase, we duckin' cops, I just got off on 70 North
Choppa Gang, So Icy Gang, me and Shiesty got matchin' watches
He a rat, I'll draw some cheese, try to eat, put his ass to sleep
No Draco, big .223, roll up and smoke his ass like weed
My niggas, they CGE, he ain't gang, he ain't shit to me
Two-hundred shots up in his SUV, shots out the AUG
You might also like
That shit wasn't no dream when I had slammed that man out in my sleep
And I did some shit I can't rap about, but may they rest in peace
Strapped up in this Phantom, ran though Bouldercrest, but from the Creek
Just young niggas from D.A.G. tryna leave bodies in the street
It's different type of smoke, if I gotta slide, bodies got to drop
Lil' slimy dude gon' stay on top, grab the Draco and shake the block
FN in my trench coat, I post by the door like Jamie Foxx
We got him and his cousin shot, give a fuck if they know or not
This brand-new Glock came out the box, my chop came with a forty, stock
MGU ran in my spot, took all my shit and broke the lock
I'm back at it again, I know them crackers wanna see me fall
I kept callin' my lawyer, he wouldn't answer, that shit had me hot, brr, brr (Brr)Embed
