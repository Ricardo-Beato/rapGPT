Hey yo, Nelly! This is fire
What you talkin' about, girl?
Let's make it hot for the clubs
Missy! Whoo!
(This is fire!)
(This is fire!)
(This is fire!)

Down South girls got them real big butts
Real big butts make ya man wanna look (Oh!)
Back it up, flip it up, skinny girls - eugh!
Love my guts, so fuck a tummy tuck
(Oh yeah?) Yeah! I shakes my butt
I shakes my gut like "yeah, bitch what?"
Yeah I likes it rough, tough
Ask your man how I'm good in handcuffs
Me and Nelly came to rock the club
Pack the place, don't push or shove
Out of the club, straight to the crib
I'll let you know if the sex was good
 + {Timbaland}
Pump it up! {Show me love, G}
Pump it up! {Let me see what you working wit'}
Pump it up! {Let me see those big-ass hips}
Pump it up! {Pump it up}
This is how me and Nelly pump it up
Pump it up! {Show me love, G}
Pump it up! {Let me see what you workin wit'}
Pump it up! {Let me see those big-ass hips}
Pump it up! {Pump it up}
C'mon

DOWN SOUTH PLAYERS! We got that fire made!
Get up on my booty, tutti-fruiti on the rooty
I'm a thick chick, skinny girls act snooty
No matter what your size, my big thighs'll do my duty
Look at the way my rump shake like a movie (Say what?)
See my tight jeans and the coochie
Spend a little looty, you gotta work for the booty (Yup)
Me and Nelly hot on the track (Track!)
Nelly, can't no one ever top that (Top that!)
Niggas we came to rock the club (C'mon!)
DJs better Pump It Up
Motherfuckers need to back it up
Cause we gon' tear the roof off the club

(*beat stops, needle crackling*)
 *talking*
You know, Down South chicks got big asses
And we a little heavy sometime
But when you're from the South
We don't call that "fat"
We call that "big-boned"
Fo' sho
(*scratching, beat starts again*)

Yeah, ma! I heard you like the magic stick
Me? I got the gadget stick, it's like "Go, go, gadget dick"
You know, make you climb the walls and shit
I make her wanna press pause and shit
Walk up in the party, girls swingin' they panties
They was doing that before I had them Grammys
I get a little freaky when I'm in my yammy
I may act a little fresh but I still got manners
It's Nelly, felony, and Missy Misdemeanor
Both going down, there's just to many heaters
Check the records, we got records that broke records in record time
I ain't talkin' about the records that they buyin'
Lyin', can a nigga keep up with me?
You see I, still standin VI stackin' the ride with me
You struggle to recoup
I struggle on which Coup' to ride in
 See how we be stylin'?

(*"This is fire!" cut and scratched to fade*)Embed
