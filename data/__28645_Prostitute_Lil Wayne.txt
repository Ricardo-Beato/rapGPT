21 ContributorsProstitute Lyrics
Young Moolah, baby (Yeah)
(Young money, alright, yeah)
Young Moolah baby (Young money)
(Alright, alright, alright)

I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it wouldn't make a difference
If that was way before me and you girl
See you don't ever have to worry about me
As long as you keep it real
Whatever is on your mind, speak on how you feel
Stay true to me and never lie to me
And don't ever keep no secrets no matter whatever
Girl you know what I mean (yeah)

Well if you don't then I'll explain
You can be my Mrs. Wayne
We can do the damn thing
You see I had to tell my nigga Lil' Boo I met a girl like you
Cause I ain't never met another girl like you
But I know what to do wit a girl like you
Three letters: "I do"
You might also like
I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it wouldn't make a difference
If that was way before me and you girl
See you don't ever have to worry about me
As long as you keep it real
Whatever is on your mind, speak on how you feel
Stay true to me and never lie to me
And don't ever keep no secrets no matter whatever
Girl you know what I mean (yeah)

Well if you don't then I'll explain, I'll give up the game
At the top of the arena there's my jersey wit my name
What's happening baby, what's happening baby
You know you need to roll wit a champion baby
Any time I see ya I get asthma baby
Like th th that's my baby

I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it wouldn't make a difference
If that was way before me and you girl
See you don't ever have to worry about me
As long as you keep it real
Whatever is on your mind, speak on how you feel
Stay true to me and never lie to me
And don't ever keep no secrets no matter whatever
Girl you know what I mean (yeah)
Like fo real though baby girl you ain't gotta keep no secrets it's just me and you
You gotta keep it real

I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it wouldn't make a difference
If that was way before me and you girl
See you don't ever have to worry about me
As long as you keep it real
Whatever is on your mind, speak on how you feel
Stay true to me and never lie to me
And don't ever keep no secrets no matter whatever
Girl you know what I mean (yeah)
See they can say what they want girl
But they'd never change my views
Cause they will never know you the way that I know you
You see I'm tryna spend the rest of my whole life with you girl
And if we gotta be alone so be it baby
And if ya friends can't understand you, you don't need them baby
