Bang, bang bang
Bang, bang, bang
Sosa, Sosa, it's Sosa
Haha, bang bang

That cash well, I gotta get it (I gotta get it)
I be kush smokin' and I admit it (And I admit it)
I was born with this shit, nigga (This shit, nigga)
So pussy nigga I'm dyin' with it (L's)
What's up with all these square niggas? (Fuck niggas)
And they wanna be L's now (Why they wanna be L's now?)
Keep ya head up, it's war time
And on your block, you can't settle down (Bang, bang, bang)
Guns sing like Kellz now (Bang)
Deliver bullets, that's mail time (That's mail time)
We got hang time and smoke time
We ain't got time for jail time (No jail time)
Start nailin' shit, that's nail time (Bang)
And with this hammer get nailed down (Bang bang)
And we took the connect down (Connect down)

I'm Sosa, I'm Sosa (I'm Sosa)
Bitch, I done told ya (Bitch, I done told ya)

And on her wall are my posters (On her wall are my posters)
I do drugs, period (Period)
Pop beans and sip lean (I pop beans and sip lean)
Smoke kush, no regg', dawg (Nah)
And Â¿'nemie well enties'?
I stay out in traffic (Traffic), bitch, I ain't no house nigga (Bitch, I ain't no house nigga)
Don't care 'bout no bitch, nigga (Nah)
Money be my spouse, nigga (That money be my spouse, nigga)
