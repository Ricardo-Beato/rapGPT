30, you a fool for this one (Oh-ohh)
Ayy, this that new edition
We ain't like none of these niggas, no cap (On God)

Ayy, had to learn from my wrong
90 thousand dollars, spent that shit on my thumb (My thumb)
I've been getting money give a fuck who done seen (Done seen)
I've been getting money give a fuck about the scene
I swear I knew this (I know), We got all these bitches choosing (they choose)
Come to the club and they gotta let my crew in
I swear I knew this, you know I'm going with my move thing
Don't need no help, I got myself 'cause I could do this (I can)

Lil' Boat, ayy
Fuck them other niggas, ayy
Talking down we gon' off them other niggas, ayy
Oh, you don't like my sound? 100 round, 100 round (Grr)
Empty out a fuck nigga town (Pew-pew-pew)
Bitch we was it, I ain't talking 'bout no clown (For real)
I just bought my momma a new house (For real)
You at your momma crib, bitch, you brought your spouse (Famn)
I cannot relate no, and I- (Ohh-oh)
You might also like
Ayy, had to learn from my wrong
90 thousand dollars spent that shit on my thumb (My thumb)
I've been getting money give a fuck who done seen (Done seen)
I've been getting money give a fuck about the scene
I swear I knew this (I know), we got all these bitches choosing (They choose)
Come to the club and they gotta let my crew in
I swear I knew this, you know I'm going with my move thing
Don't need no help I got myself cause I could do this (I can)

Cameras flicking when they see me, I'm not average, nigga
We really ride with them sticks, no, I'm not cappin', nigga
I got diamonds in my teeth, I keep it fancy, nigga (I keep it fancy)
Don't like to lose by any means, I make it happen, nigga (I make it happen)
Jumped out the porch when I was young, was tryna make a dollar
I always did the one to lead, I ain't never follow (Ain't ever follow)
Now they wanna come and fuck with me, they ain't had no option (They had no option)
Whole lotta money I ain't broke, no that won't be a problem (Won't be a problem never)
Easy come easy goes
The water raising, I'm just going with the flow
Versace on my ass, Versace on my toes (My toes)
Jumped out the porch to get it, I ain't ever fold (Yeah)

Ayy, had to learn from my wrong
90 thousand dollars spent that shit on my thumb (My thumb)
I've been getting money give a fuck who done seen (Done seen)
I've been getting money give a fuck about the scene
I swear I knew this (I know), we got all these bitches choosing (They choose)
Come to the club and they gotta let my crew in
I swear I knew this, you know I'm going with my move thing
(Ohh-oh-oh)
Don't need no help I got myself cause I could do this (I can)2Embed
