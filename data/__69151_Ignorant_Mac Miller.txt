Whoop!
Had to throw one of those in there, uh

Chyah

You can't believe it, this ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
A girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch (Whoop!)
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant (Let's go)
You can't believe it, this ridiculous, belligerent (Whoop!)
Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
And a girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant (Whoop!)

Hey, so I just bought another Rollie and that shit is Goldie Hawn (Hawn)
Better get it before it's gone 'cause my shop been open long (Long)
I stay smokin' on that strong (Strong), I'm smokin' on that strong (Strong)
Then go and take a handful of drugs, what the fuck is goin' on? (Whoop!)
Bein' rich? Well, that's fun as hell
These bitches come like they under spells
Yo, Mr. Jobs, you see I'm a Mac
But I'm rollin' deep like Adele (Dell)
I'm Robert Downey Jr., you more like Steve Carell (Whoop!)
So get smart, no head starts, put a lion on a gazelle
You tryna rhyme 'cause you idolize what I design for myself (Self)
But it's hard to find these bars of mine so Columbine yourself (Blaow)
I don't hate ya bitch, just fakin' rich
I get paper like grades at Cambridge
I'm best friends with my banker, shit
Gave fifty racks just to make a wish
Brand new crib, I'm paintin' it
Half a mil, just paid for it
No Thanksgiving Parade in this
But we marchin' like the Saint's came in
So run and hide, eyes open wide 'cause this gon' be your jam (Jam)
Just burn a Dutch, then turn it up as I pass it off to Cam, damn

Yo, we never met before but there'll be a mess for sure (Yep)
When I was a baby, my crib was Mom's dresser drawer (Yep)
Infrared, blastin' guns, duckin' shots
Another K, another tank, another Glock (Another Glock)
They smokin' weed, shippin' E, crushin' rocks (Crushin' rocks)
Forget the Porsche, they want your baby mother boxed (Mother boxed)
And you pamper honey (Pamper honey)
Word, he pamper honey (Pamper honey)
And she suckin' dick for formula and Pamper money (Damn)
And a real thug don't play that
Laid back where the Mac and the K at
Yayo turned to the straight crack
Maybach black with a gat, won't say jack
Say jack, say jack, say jack, say jack
Say jack, say jack, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me

Oh my bad, I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit (Whoop!)
And a girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant
Uh, I got that Mac with me
