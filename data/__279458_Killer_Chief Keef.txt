30 ContributorsKiller Lyrics
I’m 'bout my scrilla, smokin' on killer
I say that bitch already know that I'm that nigga
I hang with killers, her ass a killer
And she gon' wanna go 'cause I'm that nigga
These tracks I kill 'em, these racks I spend 'em
I make it rain on them 'cause I'm that nigga
Say I'm that nigga, say I'm that nigga (Sos' baby, Sos' baby)
I make it rain on them 'cause I'm that nigga (Huh)

I'm with my killers (Bang bang), smokin' killa (Dope)
I made it rain on 'em 'cause I'm that nigga (Fff beep)
O'Block afila (O'block), ain't it nigga (Bitch)

And she gon' wanna go 'cause I'm that nigga
