34 ContributorsIt’s A Man’s World LyricsIntro - 
Women, they're good for -
Wait wait wait wait, Cube, trip this
We gonna dedicate this to the pretty young ladies
You know, them pretty young ladies that wouldn't give us the play before the album, this is for you


Women, they're good for nothing, no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand
Cause after I do ya, huh, I never knew ya
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow
After we do it you can go home now (see ya!)
I'm a brother with a big long...
(Come on, wait, what the hell you think you talkin' about?)

First of all let me tell you my name, it's Yo-Yo
And downing a girl, first offense, and that's a no-no
Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in (yep)
No, Yo-Yo's not a ho or a whore
And if that's what you're here for, exit through the door, there's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0
(Wait, first of all  how you gon' come on my record and talk?)
I'm tryna say all women are superior over men
(Yeah yeah)
But wait how you gon rule the world when you broke as a joke?
(With yo county check baby)
You might also like
Ay what up, buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo (that's me)
I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl

What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
Cause you're a rerun and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails, I'll always get respect
And you lose, so take a rain check

Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me, you'd probably be pregnant
And barefoot, complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon

Well you're mistaken, it's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the backyard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another ho to cook it

Damn it lookit, cause you're talking a lot of bull
Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull
This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This is a man's world

Ah Miss Yo-Yo, so what gives?
I hear females always talking about Women's Lib
Well get your own crib, and stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy
Hell no, because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good, you don't look good

I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant

But you don't know how funky that I can get

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world

Man, women, I put a lot of fear in em
(Why is that?)
Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em? No way
Cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby

Well I guess, now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it

Yeah so what's the problem?

Well I think we solved it
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it

Yeah I admit you can flow

Well that's true

But you see I'm a pro with the bank too

Yeah I can see you got it good

Oh that I know

But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo
The brand-new intelligent black lady

You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me

So what up then?

Girl, what you tryna do?

To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

Or a big butt...

This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This, this is, this is a man's world
This is a man's world2Embed
