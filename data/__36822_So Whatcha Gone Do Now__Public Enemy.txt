5 ContributorsSo Whatcha Gone Do Now? Lyrics

Talkin' that drive-by shit
Everybody talkin' that gangsta shit
Talkin that drive-by shit
Everybody talking that gangsta shit
Slaves to the rhythm of the master
Buck boom buck, another neighborhood disaster
Drummer hit me one

A gun is a gun is a mothafuckin' gun
But an organized side keep a sellout nigga on the run
What you gonna do to get paid?
Step on the rest of the hood 'til the drug raid
See you runnin' like roaches
Black gangstas need track coaches
The white law set you up raw
When you have his trust in killin' us

Talkin' that gat talk, walkin' that catwalk
Talkin' that gat talk, walkin' that catwalk
Where you tryin' to go with that?
Don't even go there with that rap
Guns, drugs, and money, all you know how
So what'cha gonna do now?
You might also like
I'm 'bout ready to bounce
Trouble on the corner of Blunt Ave and forty ounce
Mad uncivilized lifestyles
Thirty years bids for kids, now that's wild
I'm raisin my child, I'm steppin' to the curb
With a sign, "Do not disturb!"
Too much don't give a fuck or a damn thing
But choose what the other man bring
I sing a song cause I see wrong
Ya goddamn right
I'm not down with the "Fee Fi Fo" where I come from
See, the brothers ain't dumb
Sense goes over nonsense
When it makes no sense, I'm throwin' up the fence
Now ask yourself cool
What good is the hood if ya actin' a fool?

So whatcha gone do now?
So whatcha gone do?
So whatcha gone do now?
So whatcha gone do?

Talkin' that gat talk, walkin' that catwalk
Talkin' that gat talk, walkin' that catwalk
Where you tryin' to go with that?
Don't even go there with that rap
Guns, drugs, and money, all you know how
So what'cha gonna do now?
"The only good nigga is a dead nigga"
That's what they used to say (What they used to say)
Can't understand why a man gotta use a trigger on his own
Supposed to act grown
Cracker in the back
Watch a brother pull a trigger on another brother (Damn)
Couldn't shoot and shot a mother
Four kids alone home
Ungrown and now they on they own

Talkin' that gangsta shit
Everybody talkin' that drive-by shit
Talkin that gangsta shit
Everybody talking that drive by shit

So whatcha gone do now?
So whatcha gone do?
So whatcha gone do now?
So whatcha gone do?1Embed
