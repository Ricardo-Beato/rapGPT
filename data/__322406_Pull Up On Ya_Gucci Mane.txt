8 ContributorsPull Up On Ya Lyrics
Niggas on the inside wishin' for the outside
Peanut butter inside, candy red outside
Hit you with the nine now your inside-outside
Pull up in that foreign that'll leave your bitch mouth wide
Niggas talkin shit, most 'em don't know that I got mob ties
Run up on the 'wop and you're gonna end up hog-tied
Catch me in the kitchen whippin chickens like it's popeye's
? leave your ass for some hot fries
Timbs on slip and slide, I'm a slick guy
I'm a black guy, give me five on the black side
I'm a trap god, leave your numbers by the black guy
He a live-wire, I'ma shut down his wi-fi

I'ma I'ma I'ma I'ma I'ma pull up on you
I'ma call my young niggas and have them pull up on you
You don't want no you don't want no niggas to pull up on you
I'ma call my young niggas and have them pull up on you
I'ma I'ma I'ma I'ma I'ma pull up on you
I'ma call my young niggas and have them pull up on you
You don't want no you don't want no niggas to pull up on you
I'ma call my young niggas and have them pull up on you

Playing with Gucci Mane is just like playing with a lighter
Playing games with Gucci Mane is just like touching fire
Got tattoos on my face my neck my arm but I'm not a biker
Got a 4-5-8 Ferrari, bitch i got the title
I'm from East Atlanta Georgia man that shit just like The Wire
You say you from Zone 6 but my nigga you know you lyin'
I'm a lover and a fighter and a motherfuckin striker
These lames keep comin' around me and they know that I don't like it
If I spit dead in this nigga face do you think that I tried him?
If I tell this bitch she ain't my girl then what the fuck is she crying
You would think I'm at the grocery store with the collard greens I'm buying
You would kno that i'm the plug cause of all these niggas i'm supplying
'Wop!
