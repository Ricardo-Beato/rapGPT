4 ContributorsThe Feeling (Interlude) Lyrics*Birds chirping*

I used to be all you loved
I used to be all you needed
And I used to be all you dreamed of (Dreamed of)
And I don't know what to do
And baby I'm falling down
And maybe I'm overthinking
And maybe I'm drunker now
Bitch I ain't fucking with you

Don't tell me you love me (Don't tell me you love me)
Girl I don't believe you now
'Cause I don't understand the feeling
(Don't understand it I don't want to be with you no no no)
Don't tell me you love me (Don't tell me you love me)
Girl I don't believe you now
'Cause I don't understand the feeling
(Don't understand it, I don't understand it now, now)
Don't tell me you love me

Give me a moment
And let me tell you how I feel on some grown shit
And I've been drinking Hennessy and seeing clear now
I'm finna tell you how a nigga fuckin' feel now
Bitch you brought me down when I was doing good
All you bring is drama you a drama queen
Don't tell me that you love me 'cause it sounds good
I don't need you're fucking money, wait
(Hold up, gimme that back)
