Back in the days on the Boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style, so step off the frankfurter
Ayo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
Okay, you on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
Ayo, so let me get down, and let me drop my lip
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an Energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then +Push it Along+
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect, have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah, that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile, plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um...
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty:
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum

I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got, got to get it

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said "Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?"
You might also like
Well, describe to me what the wallet looks like

Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: pay for lunch, so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
"Yo Tip man, you got what you need?"
I checked for keys and started to step
And what do you know, my wallet I forget

It was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
It had my jimmy hats, I gotta get it man

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts to scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, "all right, Tip, see you tomorrow
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said "Why?," I said "We gotta go
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo"
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got, got to get it

Come on, let's go
Come on, let's go

In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
She went lower than low, into limbo
A thought crossed her mind: her, a bimbo
She answered no, so she had to go...
On with the program
"Greetings, it seems that I've forgotten your name"
But it seems that she'd done the same
And now something has happened
Suddenly, she's been distracted
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Now, I think you understand
Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
Right then and there, she fainted
A really grim picture is painted
The brother who she acquainted
Was the enemy, scary, ain't it?
The pubic enemy
You might also likeQ-Tip:
Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Had a lady queen, married since 18
He protested, that he was infested
With thoughts of love and he couldn't digest it
All propaganda, one big fat lie
Cause I seen the king with my very own eye
Schemed the scheme like a crack fiend fiend
And poppin up on the teenage scene
And proppin and pimpin hunnies with moneys
Whole situation to Tip, was kinda funny
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
Saw the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
Caught the king scratchin, so she had to assume
That he got vicked by the enemy's tricks
The thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin
Threw a pot and his dome was beamin
You could hear him yellin in the motherland
"Baby, baby please. Baby, understand."
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate...
Of the enemy: the Pubic Enemy
Q-Tip:
Everybody get sweating, a deep is still a threaten
About the AIDS, they hate the AIDS, but still will be forgettin
About the Syph or Gony like the Rocky Picture Horror
Don't move tracks, cause the pubic had the hour
You can get it from sleepin' in nasty dirty sheets and
Wearin' nasty clothes for, oh, about a weekend
I suggest you do yourself a big favor
The press I keep questin, I'll be damned if I save ya
Please remember this: a kiss is just a kiss
A hug is just a hug, but a bug ain't just a bug
If you get the bug, oh boy, you'll be buggin'
You'll regrets your moments even when you started lovin'
....... Damn! After loving, just take it out
Don't get so far to Q, man
Inspect yourself, protect yourself
Respect yourself, then correct yourself
Make sure you don't get had by the man
Yo, Ali, man, damn
Give me some rubs, boo1Embed

Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real
Complicated with the skills over reel to reels
Brown skin is what I feel, my mind and body's appeal
Is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill
Constantly, I'm hearing Black Americans just sneering
Looking for a leader who can fill us up with ether
Heating us up with great emotional chat
About the fact that the black's constantly held back
Like 50 tracks back in a relay race
And the white team's ahead, so let's keep up the pace
And I be needing something that could feed my logical taste
At the end of the race is there a paradise place?
Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing
Material gains we put too much in pursuing
("Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party, man, word")
But we can all Mardi Gras-di minus that shit in our body
("Yo, what that got to do with that?")
'Cause, kid, that's the essence
Your physical presence embodies every lesson
You can't run the Rolls Royce if the engine is busted
Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard
What we need to do first
Now listen to this verse
Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate
Recognize your existence in this vast blue space
From a tiny cloud of blood to the human beings with taste Sight, touch, smell and sound, let's deem it profound
And prioritize this 'cause it was Allah's wish
("Allah? Yo, I'm God")
("I don't believe that. That's a mystery")
("If God is so good, yo, why this shit be happening to me?")
There's divinity within because we come from the divine
A force that's not seen but, yo, we feel it every time
When the wind blows, and the Earth turns
And the rain drops, and the babies cry
And the birds fly, and the grounds quake
And the stars gleam
Yo, so many things are evidence of His existence
What we need to do is link it with persistence
Hear me out
Yo, once we recognize then we can move ahead
Native Tongues, Common Sense, yo, he's Hip-Hop bred...

From the spiritual world my film of life has developed
First person I lost close to me was Stella
Some of my mellows lost their mothers and their brothers
For them I feel empathy
But I ain't pouring out no fuckin' Hennessy
I pour my heart out when I see Dot out on the deck
Knowing two weeks ago he slap-boxed with death
I hear of niggas dying in the wind and on the news
But when it's somebody you know it hits you
And emotions get bruised
I ain't been in your shoes
I won't judge or knock you
The spirit of the ghetto say you got to
That scratch you gettin' from rock flippin'
Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin'
Stickin' stores on the strip
I'm tired of Arabs giving me my change back
Devil bomb my yesterday, my tomorrow he never gave back
I lay back, looking at the ceiling, wondering what could I do
So my homies won't have to be dealing
Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better
Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life
That we have to put together, better ourselves
'Cause families we gotta raise
No matter how long the money, shorter become the days
Men become like wind, ain't no difference in the season
If you got popped five times, you breathing for a reason
Let's put this five-, ten-year come-up plan in progression
Before we count our papers, count our blessings
And there you have it
You know you got to grab it
It's all good, naw'mean?
Let's make it clear: the Native Tongues is in here
The JBs, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Common Sense
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode, naw'mean?
You got The Ummah, Beatnuts, Rah Digga
Consequence, Mos Def, naw'mean?
Black Sheep, Beatnuts, Queen La, Mo Love, naw'mean?
Native Tongues up in here, don't forget it

Before this did you really know what life was
Comprehend to the track for it's wide 'cause
Gettin' mentions on the tip of the vibe buzz
Rock 'n' roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afro-centric living is a big shrug
A life filled with *horn* that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives its a plus love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove...

Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

Ayo, Bo knows this (What?) And Bo knows that (What?)
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot, so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say, "The Tribe can't flow"
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here
My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (Yeah!)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meanin' from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

(Who's that?) Broooown!
So may I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
Contact!
Can I get a hit? (Hit!) Boom bip
With a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stompin', rippin', and rompin'
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down for the flex
Next it's the textbook, old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario?

(True, blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, an -eader! Simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see you later
Later (Later!) Later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her
So, yo, the D, what, the O
Incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight, laugh
Yo, how'd that sound? (Oooh!)
It's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left, 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime, so I ain't no criminal!
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did
I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked
Then they rebuked and you had to smack
Causin' rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear (You know I did it)
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not braggin', tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary when diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eatin' Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh, uh
Ugh, ugh, ugh! All over the track, man
Ugh, pardon me, ugh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers, 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smellin' rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kickin'
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!), the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo (Yeah, my man, motherfucker)
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo

"Fool" - defined in Webster's
Open up the book, read it, read it
Turn the page, see what it says
Read it to me will you, please
(One who acts dope doltishly
So what? What does it mean to me?)
That's you (How's that?)
'Cause of the way you act (Huh?!)
Standing on the corner sellin' jumbos (What you talkin' 'bout?)
Scaring your friends and also your foes
What's the matter wit'cha, boy? (Ain't nothin' wrong with me, mother...)
You big galoot (Huh?), you nincompoop (What?)
What's wrong with you? You can't compute (Yes, sure I can compute)
Don't fix your lips to tell me you can
Standing on the boulie playin' pusherman
What you got to do with yourself? (Oh what?)
Can't you be somebody else? (Sure)
Look at you, described to a tee (Huh)
You're a fool of many in society (Crazy)
I know some more, I shall go on
And continue in the song, fooled the fool

"Fool" - scratched by Ali Shaheed Muhammad
Man, I don't know what you're talkin' 'bout callin' me a fool
I've been out here for twenty-some-odd years
Doin' my thing, I ain't no fool, man
You crazy or something?
I'm gonna stick this, right up your...

Her crazy ex-boyfriend is really psychotic (Uh-huh)
Scares the girl by threatening her life (Word)
Says "Girl, you're dead if you're not my wife" (Oh man)
Beats in her public, beats her in private (Yeah)
Tried it 'round me, almost a riot (What you gonna do?)
Said "Forget him, don't you know he's a loser
Who would love a woman, turn around and abuse her?”
Only a fool as described by the Tribe
Here's another one who's on the fool vibe (Okay)
Gonna make it short, gonna make it quick (Why?)
For this situation makes me sick (Oh)
See your brother man, with a female (Yeah)
His crazy ego tried to show he'll prevail (Uh-huh)
In any situation, lady luck's on his side (Word)
Emotions run free, nothing he will hide
Why, I remember one sunny day (Yeah)
Took my cousin to the park so we can play (Yeah)
On the way, a couple resembled
The one I just described, everything assembled
Another young man walked in their direction (Yeah)
Bumped him a bit, excused his imperfection (Mhm)
But the man with the lady grabbed the other by the neck (Mhm)
Demanded an apology and also respect (Mhm, mhm)
The young man aggravated grabbed him back and smacked him
The girl just laughed and laughed and laughed at him (Oh, man)
He felt ashamed for what he had done
And looked like a fool to everyone (Oh)
These are three stories from the naked city (Yeah)
Reality, is sometimes saditty (Yeah, uh-huh)
Like Rod Serling from The Twilight Zone
Earth to your brain - is anyone home? (What you talkin' 'bout?)
I see you there, tryin' to make amends
Try to make some friends, but now my story ends (Oh, man)
On the note, that I just wrote
Stay afloat on the reality boat (Oh)
Slow down and think and take it cool
And try to avoid the description of a fool
Man, Tip, you think you all that now that you on wax
Or something that you can tell a brotha what to do?
You know I'm older than you? I'm your senior, brotha
Man, you better go someplace with that old fool nonsense
I'm gon' keep doin' what I gotta do
And survive the way I gotta survive, know'm'sayin'?

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was workin' at the club, you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got somethin' to say

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian (Uh)
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little somethin' on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talkin' 'bout you, yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Starin' at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the Ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood (What?)
But hun, you got the goods like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week?
She simply said, "No," labeled me a ho
I said, "How you figure?" "My friends told me so"
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hun, I don't get down like that
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep' in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture
Shaheed, Phife, and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ, and my man LG
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty, let me tell you 'bout my only vice
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice

Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothin' nice)

Woo, ha-ha-ha, grand groove, grand groove
It's the beat, ah yeah
Woo, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, grand groove, grand groove
It's the beat, here we go

Rough, rough, rugged
Tough like a nugget
Listen to The Abstract Poetic, don't snub it
The midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger
Don't front on my lyrics or the tool 'cause it's danger
Hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey
To the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because I'm funky
I get down, down like a fly hooker's panties
Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
I be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly
Upset when I rock, 'cause yo, they rhymes are smelly
See, I got it going on like a Forbes tax return
Listening to these lyrics when it's hot will make you burn
Baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens
The skies up above, the one you think of
Is the highly regarded, hell of a people
Your mic and my mic? Come on, yo, no equal (Word!)
So if ya wanna do it to yourself
That is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself
'Cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it
That's your shit on the floor, then go and play in it
I refuse to catch a "L" in a battle
'Cause yo, I got the jazz and I'll whup a rapper's ass
Into little next to nothin'
Test me if I'm frontin'
I'll pass with flying colors 'cause yo, I am that brotha that can rock

No need for introductions 'cause y'all know who I be (The Phife Dawg)
Yep, the one who loves to slaughter MC's
I got style, grace and razamatazz
I'm like my girl Patrice Rushen, yo, I add pizzazz, now
Most people remember Phife from the Phife-like smoothness
But now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness
I'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw
The first punk who tries to flex, I'll be cracking your jaw
I'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff
Don't ever try for test or else that ass will get whipped
I'm forever poppin' junk, it's like a phat invite
To any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight
Gel up my posse up on Linden and 1-9-2
Pull up my brothas from Sayers Ave., the Brooklyn Zoo
All my crew up in Strong Island, so yo, don't sleep
'Cause it only takes a beat to watch that ass get beat
Brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some
Wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none
Don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with
Why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?
I'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro, too?
But beatin' on a girl, is somethin' that a puss' would do
I love jazz, but that doesn't mean that I'm timid
Not really a gangsta rapper but I can swing it for a minute
Who got the jazz? We've got the jazz

Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, "Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael"
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that 
(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half

"Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—"

We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu 
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a , brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

"—time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night
Every time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out
Time is running and passing, passing and running, running and passing, passing and running—"

Linden Boulevard, represent, represent-sent
Tribe Called Quest, represent, represent-sent
When the mic is in my hand, I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was "Eric B. for President"

Rude boy composer, step to me, you're over
Brothers wanna flex, you're not Mad Cobra
MC short and Black, there ain't no other
Trini-born lad like Nia Long's grandmother
Tip and Sha, they all that, Phife Dawg, ditto
Honey, tell your man to chill or else you'll be a widow
Did not you know that my styles are top-dollar?
The Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar
Hip-hop scholar since being knee high to a duck
The height of Muggsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip

Queens is in the house, represent, represent-sent
A Tribe Called Quest, represent, represent-sent
No taming of the style 'cause it gets irreverent
A Tribe Called Quest, represent, represent-sent

Huh-huh, here we go, you know that I'm the rebel
Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil
Funky like your grandpa's drawers, don't test me
We in like that, you're dead like Presley
When we coming through, get tickets to see me
We work for the paper, so there'll never be a freebie
Lyrics are abundant 'cause we got it by the mass (Mass)
Egos are at idle 'cause the music is the task (Task)
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it
I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it
Right (Right), now I must move with the quickness
Here comes Shaheed, so we must bear the witness

Stir it up
Stir it up

New York City, represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest, represent, represent-sent
The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent
A Tribe Called Quest, represent, represent-sent
MCs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
I let my lyrics flow, and juxt' your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after (Hahaha)
Yo, Tip, settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?
I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying (Crying)
So much going on, people killing, people dying (Dying)
But I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental
Yo, I'll take it back, I'm the Indian giver
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver (Word)
Percussion isn't less (Uh), Ds wear the vest (What?)
Why they dodging bullets? (What?) You should be dodging Quest (Uh, uh)
Don't get me wrong, violence is not our forté
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pelé
Tip, educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo
Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo (Okay)

I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself, but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a statewide tear (Tear)
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all (All) as we mingle at the ball (Ball)
We welcome competition 'cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card (Card)
Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
Try to be the phattest, also to stay alive7Embed

People, give your ears, so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies, act like gems
Sit down Indian style as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the '80s, J.B.s on "The Promo"
In my never-endin' quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm takin' it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second, son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a Black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove, but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So who that, do that, do-do that, that, that (Come on)
Who that, do that, do-do that, that, that (Yeah, okay)
Do that, do that, do-do that, that, that
I'm buggin' out, but let me get back, 'cause I'm wettin' niggas
So run and tell the others, 'cause we are the brothers

Back in '89, I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was bustin' rhymes, but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So, Shaheed, come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy?
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch, baby, never comin' less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dance floor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Comin' with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Livin' mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make somethin' def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

Seven times out of ten, we listen to our music at night

Listen up, everybody, the bottom line
I'm a Black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just livin' like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick, ya wind up ya hip
Draftin' of the poets, I'm the number seven pick (Uh)
Licks, licks, licks, boy, pon your backside (Uh)
Licks, licks, licks, boy, pon your backside (Uh)
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, Heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy (Phife)

One for the treble, two for the bass
You know the style, Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eatin' booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case, I own more condoms than TLC
Now the formula is this, Me, Tip and Ali
For those who can't count, it goes one-two-three
The anti— (Damn, right I'm s—) big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do, but never me
Some brothers try to diss, but Malik, you see 'em bitchin'?
Me nah care about dem dibby MC, my shit is hittin'
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr. Energetic, who me sound pathetic?

The title MC means Master of Ceremony
Some people who emcee don't know what this term means13Embed
Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half-step cause I'm not a half-stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two-inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
"Oh yo he's acting stank," really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling an MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

I’mma deal with a bigger insult, man
The heat, the heat, the heat, the heat
It's comin' down hard
We’ve got to get our shit together

It’s time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s get it together, come on let’s make it
Gotta make it to make it, to make it, to make it, to make it
To make something happen, to make something happen
To make something happen, let’s make something happen

Word to Phifer
Gonna bring it to the overlord, drinkin' Cisco
Chilling with the gold microphone cords
And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour
'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war
We about our business, we not quitters
Not bullshitters, we deliver—we go-get it
Don’t be bitter 'cause we not just niggas
Jarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth
Ain’t nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off
Hardest spit in the city y’all niggas spitting kitten soft
Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost
They planning for our future, people
None of our people involved
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov
Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off
It always seems the poorest persons
Are people forsaken, dawg
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons
On the captain's log
They’d rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog
Mass un-blackening, it’s happening, you feel it y’all?
Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars
They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going
Reputation ain’t glowing, reparations ain’t flowing
If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing
Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in
And the car stereo where they would promote the show
Optimistic little brother with a hope you know

Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day
All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways
And the president's refined, in her wing she's confined
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine
Carolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can’t breathe
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone
Think the ones who got it
Would even think to throw you a bone?
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?
Nah cypher, probably no place to
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas

For Tyson types and Che figures

The danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
And they’re certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing!
"We’re there!"
"Where?"
"Here!"
A small step for mankind

Oompa, loompa, doopa dee doo

When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food

Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that

VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold

Girl, this motherfucker's got rhythm

Say am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison?
Just another dummy caught up in the system
Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford
Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard
Threatened by my work ethic, the way I speak, yo
Should I be mentally weak, verse being Malik? Yo
Should I be trapped in the trap? Would you prefer that?
Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap
Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?
The weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'?
The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement
Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement

Melanated shrouded in complexity
Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity
Mouth translate happens organically
The media relates it what it thinks it sees
Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked
Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk
Dark skinned, walk with a bot portrayed villain
I'm chillin', felon down to the DNA crime willin'
Subliminate their youth, hyper-sexualize their women
They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built the prisons
Pumping false religions to all of these niggas' systems
Every voice devoid of the truth

On the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz

You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, cuz
In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind
Yes, the government will fund, learning is free for everyone
And from that lie, young leaders will rise
In the eyes of despair and adversity
In some universe, this verse will be true

Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'

Every time I black for the record, the shit splatter
The whole batter, no bullshit, the boom bapper
I pull the gat up, whip the shit, cook the batter
When I pull up on niggas, even your momma gon' scatter

Yo, y'all ready?
Yo, Phife, you ready?
Cons, you got that part, right? A'ight
(I dunno but it don’t matter who choose to set it off
ATCQ, no doubt my niggas is boss
Little half-ass rappers, y’all pissin’ me off
Time to dead ‘em all off, yo, no matter the cost)

(Black) They don’t make thugs of this caliber
(Spasmodic) Who kept up the buzz the whole calendar

Now who want it with the Trini gladiator?
Mid finger to you haters, you biters not innovators
I take zero for granted, I honors my gift
Champion pen game, plus I’m freestyle equipped
You clowns be bum sauce, speak my name, it’s curtains
Hamdulillāh, my crew’s back to workin'
Trash rap the dead, pussy kill the chirping
No more fuck boys, sit down, shit can only get worse
And how do you touch mic with flows uncertain?
Speak game dry, boy, that flow ain’t workin'
Folks throwin' items, them vex and cursin'
Fuck made me wanna see these niggas in person?
Third song in, motherfuckers dispersin'
Only to realize Donald Juice in the buildin'
Big tune this for man, woman, and children
Back on my bullshit, Busta Bus' then we kill them

My nigga spirit be talkin' to me, let me explain
Not through evil mediums, tarot cards, and Ouija games
But through mixing chords and boards
And even drum machines—he be saying:
"Nigga fuck awards, keep reppin’ Queens"
And don’t be taking slack from these non-rapping niggas, man
That intellectual shit you spit, you better change your plan
Especially when you see 'em at the lobby of a label
And they don’t seem able to outstretch they hands
And admit they fans
You better flame 'em in the J's that they standing in
Ostracize they memory for not remembering
The articles reduce their body parts to particles
And dust the Dead Sea with their cremated molecules
I’m leaving, but nigga you still got the work to do
I expect the best from you, I’m watching from my heaven view
Don’t disappoint me, make sure that they anoint me
As the blue ribbon pedigree, the best of show, five-foot-three
Speak of the legacy for short people around the world
Napoleonic, bionic people who cause the world to twirl
Rip every stage with grace, look right dead in they face
Live the Tribe principle of havin' impeccable taste
Enjoy that breath like that one was your last one left
If you don’t believe me, Tip, there’s truly life after death
So refer to the Biggie covers and shoutout my Trini brothers
And please check in on my mother...

Winter in America, never knew white Christmas
'Cause L7 squares always making my shit list
Spring is in the air and all the flowers are blooming
The powers that be wanna devour the movement
Tears disappear when they fall on the summer rain
Bleedin' through this mic, but they call it entertainment
Running across stages is a drug
Is like a blunt that we crumble in raw papers
Call it the lord’s name 'cause we taking it in our veins
Like the feeding us intravenous
It’s war and we fighting for inches and millimeters
They try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders
If we don’t give them martyrs no more, they can’t defeat us
This lack of justice got us disgusted, look at our faces
All these soldiers hate but I saw military training
The false flags fly at a half mast this morning
Take a bow, this might be your last performance

They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya

Turn the pool party into the one from McKinney
Might've been racist like the waitresses up in Denny’s
Swore we had twelve gauges, automatics, and semis
Now they wanna condemn me for my freedom of speech
'Cause I see things in black and white like Lisa and Screech
Presidents get impeached and others fill in the throne
But veterans don’t get the benefit of feelin' at home
So maybe those projections out at Silicon
Are what drove her to get injections made of silicone
I swear it’s the killing season
'Cause killin' is still in season, yeah
Louder than a three pound, voices screaming mad to boot
It must be killing season, on the menu strangefruit
Whose juices fill the progress of this here very nation
Whose states has grown bitter through justice expiration
These fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment
Things haven’t really changed
Or they're dormant for the moment
Marks and scars, we own it, only makes for tougher skin
Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within
Been on the wrong team so much, can’t recognize a win
Seems like my only crime is having melanin
Connection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for
Causes men to suffocate, I can’t breathe no more
Settle the score sadly, need an abacus to tally
Through all the peaks and valleys, yo, I recognize it sadly
Black soul bold enough, inner city cold enough
Watch me get all my goons, watch us get soldiered up
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya

Yeah, Phife—for your life

Now, in the time when niggas wasn’t supposed to be born
Best of us are left for dead in cities that looks war-torn
Vietnam going wrong, heroin going strong
Neighbors would whoop that bad ass
Just for running through their lawn
Walt met Cheryl, Cheryl met Walt
Trinidadian love sprouting through the asphalt
Love was consummated and the angels registrated
Two were to be born but only one of 'em made it
Inside a cloud of sorrow, a silver lining and joy
It’s a bouncing baby boy, a king’s name they would employ
And before he even squeaks, it’s decided it’s Malik
Now give him hope, give him care
Raise him while his grandma there
Watch out momma, if you stare
Light brown eyes'll keep you there
Let’s progress the story just a little bit
Malik, I would treat you like little brother that would give you fits
Sometimes overbearing though I thought it was for your benefit
Despite all the spats and shits cinematically documented
The one thing I appreciate, you and I, we never pretended
Rhymes we would write it out, hard times fight it out
Gave grace face to face, made it right
And now you riding out, out, out, out, damn

Have you ever loved somebody?
(Phife dawg, man)
Way before you got to dream?
(Bow wow, woof woof)
No more crying, he’s in sunshine

Never thought that I would be ever writing this song
Hold friends tight, never know when those people are gone
So, so beautiful, opined indisputable
Heart of a largest lion trapped inside the little dude
Took me quick to granny house, now we eat the curry food
Talking hopes, dreams, plans, leak ice, never scared
Brand new pair of Nike Airs, avenue of sairs
Mailbox mayors, all our rhymes was written there
A nigga wanna battle, you know Phifey didn’t care
Jarobi with the beat, into new ass we tear
I’mma flash forward well, took a trip to ATL
Cooking in the kitchen making sure my nigga eating well
Wedding in Tobago, you know exactly where I’m at
Standing on the side of black Malik Izaak

Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?
No more crying, he’s in sunshine
He’s alright now, see his wings
Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?

I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
A-fixed to the Earth like my feet, they got cleats on
I'm moving backwards, never that was never the plan
Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand
Asphalt jumpin', junkie lyrical, concrete
My Jedi mind be moving me
Throughout the many dark streets
Backwoods, boondocks, whatever terrain
Auf Wiedersehen, Aloha, man our feet ain't the same
I won't abuse these shoes, these shoes ain't made for reversing
Then trudging through these motherfuckers' first album Footprinting, never ever ghostwritten, yo' shit free, bitten
Grab my shit with both hands, iron grip, steel mitten
Bloviated, Jarobi ate it and now it's gone
Closed mouths don't get fed or move ahead
To my hustlers with customers, scam my chicks just being petty
Trap lords with the fetty, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
Don't do it, nigga

I spun around without a care
When I stopped, I felt lost
I'm two heels from the top tier
Really want to be boss
I figured it out, figured it out somewhere
Maybe the answer's not out there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere
When I stopped, I felt lost
Do you ever feel lost?

Think I'm moving, I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Maybe why I feel lost, yeah
How I'm 'posed to know how home feels?
I ain’t even on my home field
And again I feel lost
Was not a cruise that brought us here, again I feel lost
And I refuse to be stuck right here, yeah
I don't want to move backwards, no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?
I don't want to move backwards, no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me directions?
I don't want to move backwards, no

Moving backwards never, that was never the plan
Can I vent? I was content being my own man
Up until that night ill-fated, walking home I was faded
Po puts braces on my wrist like he was clapping his hands
How demeaning, y'all? Who could be blind to racism?
Bring bro bro to me for the brotherly baptism
Instead of slaps, give him the dose of Ab wisdom
He'll make it out of the jungle some way
Hey, it's figurative, not a real place you stay
Ay, it's mind state filled with muck and malaise
Uh, I got direction without using Waze
Submitting myself to praying these days
Yeah, moonwalking backwards, it's only for stage
Feds lining up, in riot gear
And everybody's hands in the air
Four-five so get your ass found somewhere
Caught between hope and despair
Say it loud, what it take to make my niggas listen
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Cool out, chill out nigga, I'm cool
Cool out nigga, nah, nigga I'm through
Head down, ain't no tellin' what you gon' do
(Somebody just give me—
Somebody just give me—
Somebody just give me direction
I don't want to move backwards, no
Cops killing us niggas everywhere
Maybe we should get some guns too)
She come around every now and a few
(Man, I hope she really loves you)
Living high ain't hard to do
(She'll be in the clouds somewhere
Feeling fresh, I strut your bitches out of here
Might even take your broad too
Oops, I'm 'bout to get kicked out here
Tell mama I'mma slide through)
Stealer, I'm trying to get out of here
But stuck up in the same room

Sick of eating out at drive through)

Just done mash a show, Dawg is off on sabbatical
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
CNN and all this shit, gwaan yo, move with the fuckery
Trump and the SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy
Blood clot, you doing, bullshit you spewing
As if this country ain't already ruined
In lieu of these mumbling, fumbling
Swearing they're the greatest
Online they debate us, if we different, then we're haters
We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now (ooo)

Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy
Fumigate our economy, 'lluminate broken dreams
And manifest all insanity, look around

Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind
Ego, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Ego, ego
I got one, you got one, and now we equal
Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people
Sometimes it has connotations of evil
Sometimes niggas call on it when they need to
It's called the ego

Ay, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated
Some may hate it and some may overrate it
It's a top story and you rarely see a trend
So all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen
It's called the ego
Come up with an idea, and no one seems to get it
Then every time you mention it
They stare like you're two-headed
But one day, in your cubicle, your idea really comes to view
Your boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you
She put you on the aces of all the stripper places
And has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well
You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego
She knows you need the chicken
And you know that she's your people
They call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy
They photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy
And now that inner voice, that ego, making you get wavy
Change your diet, hit the gym
And say, "What were you saying to me?"
The ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music
Or run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis
It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest
Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest
It's the ego

You need it when you're balling, equally when you're falling
Or when those kids in school on your locker
They get to scrawling
Epithets that's racist is stupid and mean in nature
Something that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya
Ego make you violent or govern like a tyrant
Or switch a dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant
Fool the thirsty people, selling tap water in bottles
Fooled a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models
Ego has no ending, has people pretending
Religious zealots get jealous 'cause guys want their defending
This is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us
And closing for our ego, we know only God can help us

I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
(What's your name?)
Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?)
American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend
(Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream)
(Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember)
(Shaytan got you caught in the storms of December)
(And brothers on the block packing nines like September)
(Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender)
Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies
Yo we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at the Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it, 'til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo I know the feeling when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that

Dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lo, dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lee

Ever since me was small as a youth out in Queens
What did you mash on de dancehall (all a me)
Until my best friend caught two in him head (Right, scene)
And ever since that day (ya nah hear me?) things been a mess
R.I.P Ghosta Rock, true ting, God bless
So nowadays I go see wifey just to cure me from stress
Lay my head on her breast
Sugar dumpling knows best
Explaining all my problems to her getting things off my chest
A little hookup, squeeze up, and no more am I vexed
Ayo son, without my peeps I'd be truly assed out
Making sure I have my medication so I wouldn't pass out
Native Tongues for believing in me, when everyone was fessing
Most of all Jah Mighty for the guidance and the blessings

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so then picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El Segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said: "Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?"
When he said "Why?," I said, "We gotta go"
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo

Anyway, a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished, we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: "Pay for lunch," so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
"Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?"
I checked for keys and started to step
But what do you know, my wallet I forget
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Come on, let's go

A milli, billi, dilli bum
A milli, billi, dilli bum
A milli, billi, dilli bum
A milli, billi, dilli bum
A milli, billi, dilli bum
A milli, billi, dilli bum
Come in, Mister DJ

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts, we scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming, three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Shah
He said, "Alright, Tip, see you tomorrow"
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said "Why?," I said, "We gotta go
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo"
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like a Tribe does
Before this did you really know what life was
Comprehend to the track for it's wide 'cause
Gettin' mentions on the tip of the vibe buzz
Rock 'n' roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afro-centric living is a big shrug
A life filled with *horn* that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives its a plus love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove...

When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior

Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other
Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails
(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
It's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that
It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know!

- What? Oh Tip, man, why you do that to me, man?
I though he was a friend, bruh
Oh man, can't believe that
Oh, why you do that to me?
I wouldn't do it like this
I couldn't do it by myself
Yo, it's  it to my 


You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'
Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition
Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
With the French "savoir faire" and the sexy glance
But is she really fly, or is she a guy?
I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him, right?
A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown
I had to make the sound, his life is too profound
On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup
Young and naive, it's hard to believe
As long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know!
Oh Tip, everything, you gonna be alright, man
Thank you, I should listen to you, man
I think I'll going home, man
Bye-bye, I'll see you tonight
Oh Tip, , I'm outta here21Embed
Who that at the door? (Yo, Tip, it's her)
What you doin here, in front of my face? (repeat 3X)
You didn't want my...you didn't want it
So go somewhere where you are wanted
But if you want to, then you can come here
Come here, yo

Have you ever met a woman that just took your breath?
(yeah uh huh uh uh, yeah uh huh)
So deep inside her life, she contemplated death
(damn she deep, give a fella the creeps)
Can't help but get attached to a woman like that
(true that, true that, true that, true that)
The contact was quite immediate, I had good tact
(Because you the man, yo, you know you the man)
We related and debated over food and tunes
(*people talking* "No I'm Good)
Started out in September, now we entering June
(say word, say word, say word)
Simple night in the crib, no, it just won't do
(No, it just won't do, no, it just won't do)
Know why? Because she liable to start shit too wild for you
(wild for you, wild for...)
She wanna push my whip, buy diamond chips
And take on trips, conversin my flip
Gotta do her hair, take her out to the fair
Win a teddy bear, make sure you don't stare
At another one comin, don't be startin nuthin
Be a slave to her, don't be brave to her
Make sure that she's right, make sure that you're wrong
When she wants it, do it, make sure that it's long
If anyone wanna make it work it's me
(Phife Dawg, help me out, Phife Dawg, help me out)
But we gotta come to a common ground baby
(What you say, pop? What you say, pop? Help me out)
Any man, he can claim to be the one for you
(Say word, for you, say word, for you)
But put it straight to yourself and realize what's true

Youse my peoples, why it got to come down to this shit
Two people thinking as one so now he split
Remember what I said to you, you bleed, I bleed
C'mon, you know how we get down, if you're down, you need
And I'm supplying, the dynamic duo, electrifying
Everybody had to wet us, cuz no one will forget us
Son, I testify sure as God was my guide
Any petty little bullshit you did will slide
Same on my end, after all, what are we, friends
If niggas ran me this, too much grounds we defend
In the honor or brotherhood cuz it's all good
Get on some grown man shit and let's knock on wood
But now seeing you baby in this stall out position
Wondering who's the dime piece that you're kissing
You might as well take the jigger and take my life
Cuz the dime piece you happen to be kissing is my wife
Shit, I should have know not to let these crab asses
Get within the circle of my girl and make passes
Now you disrespected me and everything I stand for
(But I'm saying though, son) Shhh, say no more
Allah forgive me, my thoughts is traveling to low desires
Should I turn the other cheek or react and perspire
Don't wanna see myself in penitentiary attire

Drifting back... just... suddenly...

The deadly venom, let me start from the beginnin'
We always hittin', so, yo, there'll be no extra innings
As I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson
You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
The comin' attraction, what?! The main feature
And I'mma greet ya like a rhymin'-ass creature
Lurkin' all up in the dark, unknown parts
The brother well prepared is the brother who will start
And that's me, Akhi
As long as the ladies move they bodies
We'll have a forum to stand
'Cause that happens to be the nature of man
Sexuality — it is the format, baby
Ain't no ifs, no buts, no ands or maybes
But I praise the Lord of the worlds that's unseen
Respect me for that and let me do my thing
I said respect me for that and let me do my thing

Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit
Denouncin' my beliefs, well, then your wig get split
Lay your egos on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your clique
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
Don't try to play me, see, my name's not Dick
The Tribe is the crew that makes the mics get lit
Like the 4th of July on some fireworks shit
My record company be on some true jerk shit
But that's aight, now I'm on some true work shit
And I'mma make it happen for my whole outfit

(Just... drifting back...)
You know we got to get control
(Suddenly...)
Over the illest drum rolls
(Suddenly... drifting back... just...)
Third verse
Aiyo, we just gettin' started, gotta redirect this vision
Got the beauty of a flower, plus dimensions like a prism
Your minds are locked down like prison
Y'all really need to go lay down 'cause positivity has risen
We hittin', yo, bust how we too strong to be broken
Occasional malfunction, pressure time, we ain't jokin'
For security, yo, we on this Run like Logan
Kamaal's doin' the hustle, and you backstage voguein'
We all got faults, don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings, there's bullshit at the surface
Sometimes, I mean, we rhyme, damn! We ain't prophets
And if you think so, you need to stop it!
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel
But next man, don't get jel'
Playa hate that all carries weight that we don't need
We slim with disabilities, and thick with possibilities
'Cause then you can move with agility
Navigatin' with good visibility
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
And strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names, it still ring bells
There ain't no plan B's, yo, watch, we movin' through with plan A
Money market, doin' things the right way
You know we gotta get control
Over the illest drum rolls

Yo, bust it out

Section — Linden Boulevard
Section on Merrick
Section — the whole Jamaica

I swear you do it to me every time
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo, you got it goin' on (Say word)
On and on and on
On and on and on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on

This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great, ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely, simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic, making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day, you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik, my hobby's putting MCs to the test
And if you front, I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic and never will it ever stop
Your crew is his', you might just want to call the cops

Ayy, yo, I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog should've bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MCs and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga (WHAT?)
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fella's good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name, call me Slick Tip the Ruler

Ohhhh, you did it to me once again, my friend
I swear you do it to me every time
'Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo, you got it goin' on
On and on and on
On and on and on (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah-yeah

Yo, I've been treading on this globe, man, for twenty-five joints
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front, I'ma make more pay
'Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo, I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo, I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and—
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing, never biting, ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MCs ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MCs dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me, see, I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag-along
The freaking fame, someone tell 'em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart, meaning your inner soul
And if it's real, only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game, there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself
'Cause if you ain't yourself, you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang, yo

You on point, Tip?
Yo, once again, Phife
You on point, Tip?
Yo, once again, Phife
You on point, Tip?
Yo, once again, Phife
Ayy, yo, that kid is niiiiiiiice
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again, my friend
I swear you do it to me every time, yeahhh
'Cause you stay crazy on my mind, ohhhh
Yo, you got it goin' on, ohhhh-ohhhh
On and on and on, yeah

A-yo, it's just the same guy, swingin' on your block
You know how I get down like Heather B with them Glocks
I came to lead my team to victory like Hayden Fox
'Cause heads ain't ready for the willie I got
Yanahmean, slim? I does my Thing like Ben Grimm
Leavin' crews in shades of black and blue like Rakim
And if you don't know, you better ask another
It's like 1-9-2 when we rollin' Deep Cover
So don't shut down on the Razor
'Cause in the 9-Live we steppin' through hotter than the Trail Blazers
And in Queens, I be a legend like Richard Dean
Son, I got a scheme that Hakeem couldn't dream
While you be Sam Cassell'n, Queens keep it live
Who the hell you tellin'? (Can't front on the Tribe)

Let me tell you why I be the top dog in the industry (Why's that?)
Because all these so-called mutts are not seein' me (Say word)
They too busy eatin' cycles 1, 2 and 3
They can't MC, I'd rather be down with fuckin' Droopy D
My style is deadly, word bond, act like you fuckin' know
Been writin' rhymes ever since Ray Parker sang with Raydio
Your style is played out like a two-tone down goose
You couldn't Converse if you had fuckin' react juice
So hold your corner as I start to bless this mic in here
I'm eatin' through your crew like Stephen King's Langoliers
Try bite my steez, word to God, I'm gonna hurt you
(Will y'all fall off?) Will Laura fuck Urkel? Never
Here comes the funk, smell the aroma

Phony rappers, check it out, aight

Yo, I was ridin' the train
And this Puerto Rican kid said simple and plain: "Let's battle"
It kinda took me by surprise
'Cause the brother was movin' wit' his eyes on the prize
I said "Screw it, I ain't got nuttin to lose, but um
But I got to do this shit real quick, so um
Hurry up, kid, bust your joints and then I'll bust mine
And I'll be out 'cause I gotta see this hun", he said "OK"
"Yo, check it, check it out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"
That's what he said
Then I came back and just FUCKED up his head
'Cause yo, he thought an MC who was seen on TV
Couldn't hold his shit down in New York City
Aiyo, I showed his ass then I went off on my task
To bless her ass Uptown, real MC's will hold it down
Yeah, yeah, sonny, to the beat like that
You wanna bring it to me? Where you at?

Yes, dread, I had a similar situation
Where this kid tried to tell me I didn't deserve my occupation
He said I wasn't shit, that I was soon to fall
I looked him up and down, grabbed my crotch and said balls
Of course he tried to bring it on the battlin' tip
And you know me, you know I had to come out my shit
Tryin' to lounge at the mall, me, Skeff and Mr. Walt
And finally I banged his ass with the verbal assault
He said a rhyme about his .45 and his nickel bags of weed
That's when I proceeded to give him what he needed
Talkin' 'bout "I need a Phillie right before I get loose", poor excuse
Money, please, I get loose off of orange juice
Preferably Minute Maid
'Cause that's exactly what it takes to write a rhyme, huh
So screw your nickels and your dimes
Because an MC like me be on TV
Don't mean I can't hold my shit down in NYC

It seems there's a sanitation, y'all full of trash talker
Soundin' good, but money, can you be the dog walker?
Talkin' 'bout your mic days and your breakdancin'
Not enhancin', you sound tired and...
Oh, shit, I didn't know you like to play yourself in front'cha friends
Sittin' there, lyin' to no end
MC's for me make things happen
Talk about a world but in the form of rappin'
Who will be the captain of this ship?
If it goes down, don't you know you have to go wit' it?
Just because you rhyme for a couple of weeks
Doesn't mean that you've reached the MC's peak
Let me stop soundin' all bitter
Ghetto child, never be a quitter
But don't be a phony in the litter
Take it as a letter from the better
Take it from a man who used to rhyme in busted-ass Jettas

Yo, Phife, you need a condom?
Word to God
Mess around, I catch AIDS from MC's bein' on my nuts too hard
'Cause on my boulevard, you better bring your bodyguard
And what's your boulevard?
L.B., I represent naturally
So don't step on the boulie if you know that you're phony
Or else I'll bend that ass like elbow macaroni
'Cause I gotta keep it real (Gotta keep it real) Yep!
A Tribe Called Quest, you see, we never half step
So on your mark, get ready, MC's be jetty
Me and Phife be hangin' like Veronica and Betty, Archie, Jughead
Snuffin' MC's from Brainslane down to Hempstead
Yes 'Quence, see over
His rhyme style is older that a Chrysler Cordoba
I'm wilder than the cats from Arizona
Villanova, uh, uh, Kentucky
Who's the next MC steppin' up to try and bust me?
Bring him here and boy, will I ever let him have it
And when it comes to the microphone, don't even try to grab it
What?!?!
“This feeling of embarrassment
This shyness, this bashfulness…
If you take that out of the people
Then these people will do whatever they want to do
And that is the very definition of America
A people who have no shame
And therefore, they do whatever they want to do"9Embed
In this American metropolis filled with MC's
A Tribe Called Quest came to drop jewels wit' ease
Plus make you party, we do this music thing for everybody
Black, White, Latino and Asian, we cold raisin'
The stakes of hip-hop to a new plateau
To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations
A god-fearin' folk cos we all from the yolk
Of one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed
Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence
Even though not too long ago I was a truant
Now I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics
From man's obsession with money to holy prophets
Like Mohammed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky
Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me
Now I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats
Lex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat
But what about your contract, slick? Is you proper?
It's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable
I be strivin yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet
And fulfil it, think about these kids, we can't kill it

Now every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year
All you gat pullin' MC's could never come near
All that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest
It's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess
So I even start to (Rap) when you know you have no (Haps)
Wit' your simpleton (Lyrics), your light-hearted (Act)
Step back, me no have no time for dat
I'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots
In a world where you have like a zillion MC's
Ninety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs
Bitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know
I be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low
(His name is Phife Dawg) I label myself as The Boss (True dat)
Same height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross
Queens representation, son, you know how we do
While Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest
I be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat
Yo, what about about them biters? Errr! Me not like that
My motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop
Come on party people, you must give me my props
Cos y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered
So head for the border you peasy-haired bastards
Before I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya?

It was Friday afternoon in the middle of June
Heineken bottle caps and the aroma of boom
Around the time everybody just got home from class
Shootin' dice, talkin' shit, hopin' the cash would last
Yo, this was around the time when I didn't know no better
Juney rolled around in a tinted-out Jetta

Then he introduced me to that hydro smoke
And I took one toke, yo, I almost choked
See, I never smoked before, so my nerves got shot
Then he told me about the party at the spot Jamroc
It was guaranteed on, but I said "Son, chill"
There's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real, word

He said we got all day, so we gonna do it right
Hit your man's joint first and Jamrock in one night
Then I said "Aight", then I hopped inside the Jetty
Let me take a shower, I'm sweaty, and then I'll be ready
Tonight is the night I get my groove on steady
And get my drink on with that Ford named Betty
I went upstairs to get fly, smoke my Thai
Drunk some liquor, to meet my high quicker
Now, I'm type stimo, the party is the M.O
Me and my crew, we get it started like a demo
Eleven in the evenin', I'm feelin' like a heathen
This thing is goin' down and I highly doubt I'm leavin'
Booty cheeks are in motion and the kids was drinkin' potion
Word is bond, that Black Moon joint got me open
(Don't front)

Yo, the DJ flipped the script
Threw on the good shit that made the kid lose his grip
Blendin' Risin' to the Top and got these shorties hoppin'
Number coppin', ain't no stoppin' me now
Yo, I'm bound to win until that thing kicked in
The Alizé had me stuck, I don't know where to begin
Now I'm feelin' kinda jaded, wild incoherent
Me and the fellas started actin' irreverent
Butt grabbin', mad laughin', just assin'
Then that chick caught up, the shorty lookin' fed up
They said you jonesin' with this one, you gibbin' with that one
A-yo, I'm just doin' my thing, yo, I'm just havin' fun
You don't see me in here wildin', pullin' out no gun
Yo, I see some of that thing, girl, and I want some
So let's step inside this corner so that we can rap on
Over this bumpin' ass song, plus some Dom Perignon
I hit ya with the good lovin', plus fillet mignon
Yeah, yeah, scrammy scrams, that's that same old song
Aiyo, tell me why the hell your breath smells so strong?
Yo, put some brakes on your yappin' or you won't live long
Please, nigga, push on
Alright, scrams, see you later (Scrams?)
Can't mess with these street sharks or these alligators
I can't take it no more, yo, it's damn near four
I've been partyin' and drinkin' since I came out my door
Look at these kids about to mix it, damn, where's the exit?
Son jetted to the ride and got the burner out the Lexus
Yo, he cocked his joint back like he's about to let 'em have it
Kid, I kept it movin' like the Energizer rabbit
Yo, yo, a-yo, yo, it's time to skate, ain't no time to contemplate
(all: Whoops, looka there, there's Jake)

I can't have this no more. I've gotta find something new man8Embed
Sometimes men and women look at themselves and see bliss
Through experience, we tend to exist
That's through our past or our caretakers
The instance is in particular, so you need to recognize that
If you take all this away
And look at us at the end of the day
We stand great among creation
So baby take these words as a little inspiration
While I kick this shit get your ass motivation
MCs, you're walking a thin line
Get in your ranks and tighten up as we walk through mines
And plus vipers, phony rhymers, and biters
Money-grubbers, beat-dubbers, amongst a whole host of others
Who be fakin', fraudulatin', waitin' for your bacon
They'll be takin' and skatin' while you sit contemplatin'
Who's your peoples
Well let me tell you somethin' now paw
We're livin' a world that's R-A-double-raw
It's crazy but it's true, go for delly is the law
And if you cross the path then you dangerin' your jaw
And if you Glass Joe, don't go toe-for-toe
Yo all we wanna do is our thing and lay low
So brothers hold your heads high when you get down
Don't violate these women cuz we need them around

The madman Malik makes MCs run for Milk of Magnesia
Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone mackin', master as in great
I'll have your brain goin' in circles as my style tends to ovulate
I'm makin' moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so you're stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks'
While you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissin' around with wack rhymin'
You lose your grip from chalk climbin'
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cipher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin' any beef
Ain't nothin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street
Phife Dawg, swingin' it back and forth just like Aaliyah

Sucka MC in my path, hey man, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin'
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin'
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin'
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit
'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If you a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, every day all day, similar to water
Crushin' MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter

We're gonna make this thing work out eventually (Oh)

Yo, I ain't one to complain, but there's things in the game
(What's your name?) Consequence—I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?) American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend
Don't stress that, 'cause it's not in your bloodstream
Your whole being comes from greatness—d'you remember?
Shaytan got you caught in the storms of December
And brothers on the block packing nines, like September
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender (Check it)
Yo, I be on the avenue where they be actin brand-new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty-boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin' unruly
(Say word) Yo, word up! Yo, I was tight, caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies
Yo, we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at the Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot, so on my girls, I blow
Shook them shits in my palm, let 'em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs, po-po
I got to go on the ave'; see, my parole by four
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it 'til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo, I know the feeling—when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts, but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (No doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff

Niggas flash dancing, yo, I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I'll be trying to get star status like Shinobi
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's

I had a dream about my man last night
And my man came by the studio
And his name is...

Busta Rhymes in effect
Shaheed is in effect
Phife Did-awg is in effect
Check it out and give me my 'spect

I'm moving, yes I'm grooving cause my mouth is on the motor
Use the Coast in the morning to avoid the funky odor
Can't help being funky, I'm the funky Abstract brother
Funky in a sense, but I play the undercover
Once had a fetish, fetish for some booty
Now I'm getting funky in my rap and that's my duty
Brothers tend to jock on the style in particular
If you got the ego like some brothers then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck)
My motto in the 90's is be happy making bucks
Girls love the jim, cos it causes crazy friction
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I still understand the oomph cause that's what I met her for
I'm hooked on the swing, so just call me the music whore
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
Quest the people's choice, we driving for the spirit
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensil
Write my rhymes straight up, don't give it no fancy stencil
The rhymes be getting sweet, we stay away from tart
A perfectionist at work, perking up the art
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock
Your demise is coming up and I want your man to watch
Be the prime example, or deeper still the sample
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a Quaker
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker?
The crazy move faker, I use that to break her

Please don't be deceived by the ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action
Some women in the 90's want more than satisfaction
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring
I keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
My people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down
People tend to riff cause they don't know the mental
People tend to bug cause the beats are hard but gentle
Africano lurks through the body of this youngun'
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and you're coming to
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival
If flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival
The Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching
To Black and Puerto Ricans cause they're butt naked streaking
Through the ever murky streets of the urbanized areas
Blasting out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria
Craig is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)
Pete Rock is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)
CL is in the house (you got it going on)
Ultramag is in the house (and on and on and on)
Nice and Smooth is in the house
Big Daddy Kane is in the house
Beatnuts is in the house
Special Ed is in the house

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And this one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass
And check it out, going into the '91 decade
Up in until the 2000 decade
You gotta say the Quest is on
And goddamn it, yes the Quest is on
And we out!10Embed
Yeah, move your body, inside the party
We 'bout to bring it to you kid, like we never ever did
My nigga Al G in it, my nigga Shaheed in it
We got the girl Kristine in it, got my man Big G in it

A-yo, inside the ghetto or in a sunny meadow
I'ma make you move, whether woman or fellow
Yo, I got the medals in the Warfield of respect
Like an ill porno, make ya body get wet
Just a ghetto child trying to live a straight and narrow
Hoping that my shit will pierce your dome like an arrow
I'm sure it will, especially if it's God's will
MC's be ready to die 'cause I'ma kill
All your negative feelings standing on two feet
While I make the hotties move to the hip-hop beat
You know it's realer killer, realer than you can imagine
Using every source of pain in my range to make it happen
If I make it happen, that means I'm making motion
And I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion
Everybody do the hop, make it smooth like lotion
I lay up in the piece on a incognotion

You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Now everybody here, you do the hop
You going up to cop, Uptown for a brick, don't stop
You gotta come back and do the hop
Yo, fuck the cops, you gotta come back and do the hop
Move 'til your body won't stop
You gotta do the hop, non-stop motion, non-stop
You gotta come back and do the, do the...

I'm representing with my crew
Mess around, bite my rhymes, I'll beat that ass with my shoe
C'mon, you know I'm crazy nice
Brothers can't deal with the shorty named Phife
You must be mad in the head
I bust his ass and leave 'im blood clot for dead

If it ain't Das EFX then they sounding like Meth
You might as well do Megadeth
Y'all punk MCs better save your freaking breath
You's a corny motherfucker
You must be high smoking dust with Chris Tucker
Y'all faggot asses don't want this
I pull more peeps than the peeps at the premier of Pocohantas
Word is bond I am the baddest
And all you honeys out there, word is bond, you know my status
So come and pull your panties down
This ain't the Barnum Bailey show, I don't get down with the clowns
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
But don't bring your ass by and you ain't got no ends
Word is bond, it don't stop
Just ease your mind, come along and do the hop
You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Come on everybody, do the hop
Even if you cop, you gotta come back and do the hop
You move to the beat, you don't stop
You smoking jump rocks, you gotta just stop and do the hop
Then you come back and do the hop
You know we don't stop, we on the ghetto prize on the top
You know we come back and do the hop
Shorties in the place, all the shorty rocks, do the hop
You gotta come back and do the hop
We never go on pop, you know we come back, we do the hop
This is how it is, we do the hop
You move to the beat, then come on everybody, don't...4Embed

Movin' through every town off the fumes of ****

Yo, we 'bout to clap these joints so that these **** sound loud
Some kids be actin' stank like a baby pant

Yo, move your body maker and use your minds to break true
Yo, we gotta do the do
Son, we livin' in a time where mad folks talk ****
Representin' they crews or they East-West cliques
Let me tell everybody from coast to coast
About the lands we boast, but we don't own jack
How the **** we movin' through makin' moves like that?
How the **** we movin' through makin' moves like that?

We got jewels and Mo' and the life is type rowdy

Never ran my gibs for nothin' less than a dime
A few of my brothers did a **** for a time
Strivin' to survive sometimes is known as crime
The three twenty-five got that Windex shine
And when I shot skellies, I had boxes in lines
All I wanna do is live life and be fair
I used to stress girls with long legs and long hair
Now I want a woman with a spiritual flair
God will never make it too hard for me to bare
I'm hungry like a derelict who stays in deludes
Some could count me out, but yo, I doubt that I'll lose

Classic example of a (a date rape)

Listen to the rhyme, it's a black-ink fact
Percentile rate of date rape is fat
This is all due to the reason of the skeezin
You got the right pickin but you're in the wrong season
If you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break
Especially if a squaw tries to cry out rape
You be all vexed 'cause she got it goin' on
You don't wanna fight 'cause you know that you're wrong
So instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch
Envision in your head of a great sex bout
Worthy opponent, all you wanna do is bone it
You ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick it
This is the case, the situation is sticky
Should you try to kiss or hint towards a hickey?
Not even, you can ask Steven
If the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leavin
Hit the road Jack and all of that
But if she offers her abode, you'll drop ya load
Right smack dab in the middle
Get the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles
You might also like
Uh-huh, you know the science; you get buckwild
Runnin' mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles
Or better yet Magic or even Karl Malone
Regardless who it is, your aim is to bone
If she tries to front, that's when you start to diss her
If she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her
Might as well get to the point, no time to waste
Might as well break the ice, then set the pace
You start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone
Step out of the shower, throw on cologne
All of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho
She's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego
You listen to After 7, break fool after 10
Do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again
There goes round 1, ding, there goes round two
Now tell me what the (fuck) are you supposed to do? Huh
What do you know, when the meow is completed
Girly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it

Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that (Zulu)
We ain't goin' out like that (Zulu)
We ain't goin' out like that
Now baby bust it, if you wanna groove
Me and you can do it, it will be the move
I won't cry over spilled milk
If you won't let me take you to the Hilt
I don't wanna bone you that much
That I would go for the unforbidden touch
I'm not the type that would go for that
I'll have to fetch a brand new cat
Baby, baby, baby I don't wanna be rude
But I know the cause of your bloody attitude
I know why you act that way
It usually happens on the 28th day
I respect that crazily
When you're done with the pads can you come check me?
This ain't a joint to disrespect you
Because one head ain't better than two
Check it out, it's a-

Classic example of a (a date—)5Embed
Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs
At all of these industry shing-dings
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checking for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out!

Do you wanna be in the business? (The business)
The ups and downs with the hoes (The business)
(Always getting fronted on at shows) (The business)
People gotta stick their nose (In the business)

Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Ain't no one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the gains just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real
You might also like
They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say "Where's my loot?"
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg in a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cause you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, "More soup with your meal?"
Cause this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say...

Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'Bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Going out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Cause they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cause your lyrics is butt
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
(People can't walk a straight line in) (The Business)
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
(A-yo, I'm tryna get mine) (The Business)

The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
"Oh, he's a cutie", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs, I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game and I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefing ("Boy, get a job")
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
(For what?) That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild8Embed

Look at Miss Elaine who runs the fast lane
Barely knows her name, struck by fame
She just got a Benz, she rides with her friends
Gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
Rollin' down the block, checkin' out the spots
She winks at the cops, always give her props
She knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her
Hangs with the elite, makes her papes from the gutter
Tried to make my moves on Miss Elaine, she called me young boy
Told her not to diss me I just wants to be your love toy
You young boy? My love toy? I doubt that very highly
Just because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me
Business oriented, egos never dented
Always sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it
Distractions never hurt, always did the work
Always was alert, she never got jerked
Queen of the feats, thrive to compete
Love the funky beats while she drove down the street
She was justified, couldn't get a job
Had to feed her family, so she had to play the mob
Pullin' out the oowop, listenin' to doo-wop
(You don't have to say a word)

She's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner
Instead, I met her later, my love is much greater
Put me on her roster to rid her of imposters
And to sell the buddha for the sexy drug ruler
Love is my motive, now I'm drug promotive
Plus I needed ducats to fill up my buckets
Supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
Now I'm missing action for this fatal attraction
But don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
And don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
'Cause if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be
I'll be damned if I let a brotha try to gas me
I played my cards well, try to live swell
For the G, I would sell, 'cause I was deep in hell
But then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin
Who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
Elaine, she kinda knew, that I would do the do
But she didn't tear, I did my work with care
That's all that really mattered, her money never splattered
As long as she was paid, she was in the shade
You can't really blame her for holdin' on a flamer
Society taught her, but they didn't tame her
A ten clip salute, hunny here's a troop
She will never stop until she reach the top

Beeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks

A number of importance, I just put it on lock
You leave code '69", that means you want some ****

People tend to think that a pager's foul
Well it kinda is cause it makes me scowl
But it really hurts when you're on the prowl
Brothas know it hurts when you're on the prowl

Get paged by a G or a business pal

Let me flaunt the style, I think that the time's near
That we drop Scuds, there won't be no duds here
Rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip
But when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick
Now I'm not for the rock, I know the territory
Go ahead and try, that's a different story
Similar to Grimm, I could tell a better one
All about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run
Stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
Resorts to bagging Billy, asking could he have some
No never ever, go back and try again man
If you come back, I'll be the first to shake your hand
Competition's good, it brings out the vital parts
The Abstract Poetic, majors in recital arts
Do it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers
We know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers
Gotta feel the vibes, real from my creation
If the hands clap I'm filled with elation
Here I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam
Think I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream
Cause that's how good it feels child
Let your hair down, so we can get buckwild
Do your ill dance, don't think about the next man
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan
Division we will fall, we must stick together, see
I'd like to take this time to say what's up to Kool G
The name is Q-Tip, the Midnight Marauder
Giving nuff respects to Afrika Bambaataa
As a man in the world, I must do my job
Take care of Mama Duke, I won't resort to rob
Bob you'll get your dough, Mase is my witness
Obsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness
Like shooting Cee-lo, and always hitting head cracks
The industry is luck, winning with the fake raps
Peace to the crews who pump the real hip hop
Not selling out, from hardrock to disc jock

I don't know what to say, but here I go freak it
If the papes come, then you know I'll seek it
I'm just a short brother, dark skin face
Weigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist
Hair is crazy curly, flip like Mr. Furley
To this day I still believe that no MC can serve me
Brothers try to front, but everybody know
I get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show
Party animal I was, but now I chill at home
All I do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit, and bone
Found my thrill in Amityville, I'm always in the Island
Fudge and Lucky know the time, they know who keeps 'em smiling
Go out on my own, something that I gotta do
Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double
Yo, I'm out like Buster Douglas, I say peace to MC Trouble
Rest in peace

Word Up, rest in Peace, and you know what else?
We got, we got, we got the vibes
All the people in Long Island, we got the vibes
Brooklyn and Queens, we got the vibes
Uptown and Now Rule, we got the vibes
People Upstate, we got the vibes
If you're in DC, you got the vibes
Maryland, Virginia, Carolina vibes
Out West, we got the vibes
In the Bahamas, we got the vibes
Over in Europe, you know what, we got the vibes
And we gotta keep it alive, it goes um...
Of rap I'm a fan, I've seen a whole lot of slums
Good with the girls, I get a whole lot of 'em
From fat to skinny, Freda to Winnie
Emma to Cindy, Constance to Wendy
Cause I be real friendly, never on the snotty side
I don't brag to brothers about the little papes I got
My vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary
It's only legendary, my father well prepared me
My job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot
Better yet the long term, I don't have a perm
In a way I do, call 'em the perma-naps
I'm crazy slap-happy and I'm scrappy and I'm nappy
When I get the mic in my hand with the crowd in the stands
It's as good as grand like that

Yo, I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC Trouble
And to uh... Trouble T Roy
And to um... Scott La Rock
And to um... Cowboy, you know what I'm sayin?
This is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers, you know what I'm saying?
This is a special, special, special, special, special dedication
And also to my Pops and also to Vinia's Moms, you know what I'm saying?
You just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going

Cock is longer than the hat worn by Dr. Seuss
Love a girl in Daisy Dukes like them kids called Duice
Gets paid to sex the hoochie like my main man Luke
Control the mic like Denzel on the girls
Wack MCs be on the nuts like Rocket J. Squirrel
The worst thing in this world is a sucker MC
Favorite rap group in the world is EPMD
Can't forget the De La, due to originality
And if I ever went solo, my favorite MC would be me
Phife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy
Peace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies
Like, uh, Ralph Malph to Potsie, Brooklyn to Dodger
Laverne to Shirley, Rerun to Roger
Ren to the Stimpy, Laurel to Hardy
Q-Tip and Phife, they mash up the party

I can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey
Can't understand the underground, it gets deep
The Lo, the Nikes, the links, the Jeeps
The women, the lingo, and all the other goods
Peace to the hoods, keep my shit on play
Please don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke
Brothers know the angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner
I hook up the beats at the funk manor
If you want a roll, then the dough, I be raking
The scope is on the world 'cause it's mine for the taking
You know I'm gonna do it
My shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid
Chemists get confused of my ill composition
This is the third of the new Tribe addition
MCs be swinging, but a lot of them be missing
So shut your bloodclot and listen
'Cause I'm bringin' you the ill rendition
I'd like to send this out to the L.E.S
Got a lot of rhythm and style and finesse

Steady kickin' styles so I can reach that other level (Uh)

I'm not your average MC with the Joe Schmoe flow
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know
Steppin' on my critics, beatin' all my foes
The plan is to stay focused, only then I can grow
Straight from the heart, I represent hip-hop
I be three albums deep, but I don't wanna go pop
Too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
Too much candy is no good, so now I'm closin' the shop
Crushin' competition like Italians on grapes
My rhymes styles be blendin' like a Ron G tape
My man, where ya goin'? You can't escape
When the Tribe is in the house, that means nobody is safe
How can a reverend preach, when a rev' can't define
The music of our youth from 1979?
We rap 'bout what we see, meanin' reality
From people bustin' caps and like Mandela bein' free
Not every MC be with the negativity
We have a slew of rappers pushin' positivity
Hip-hop will never die, yo, it's all about the rap
So Mayor Barry smokin' crack, let's preach about that
The trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter
The more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter

I'm the nigga here with the mic in hand
Styles that we present are just a few
To do away with you and your humdrum crew
This is '93 and the shit is real
Black people, unite and put down your steel
Ladies, make a forum on your sexual drive
Devote it to your lover and make it thrive
The rhythm's in F, I'm a hip-hop body
Release my energy with the force of a shotty
Standin' on the wall with my Polo on
Talkin' to the girl with the Liz Claiborne
Keep the poetry in my black knapsack
Got my Timbo hooves and my Doublemint pack
Hit the city streets to enhance my soul
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
I can do a trick with the opposite breed
I used to down forties and smoke grade weed
Now I'm doin' shows with half loot down

The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But the night is on my mind
So parlay while I drop this rhyme

See, jake be gettin' illy when the sun get dark
He be comin' out for heads, but chill, don't let me start
There's activities a-plenty in the nighttime (Nighttime)
For the ghetto child, it seem to be the right time
See, kids be gettin' stuck with jewels or fly gimmicks
Shorty see the action and then start to mimic
Runnin' to the corner, the dice game is blazin'
Lookin' at the loot, it seems so amazin'
Puts the short down, to be exact, one pound
He shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down, uh
Scared money don't make none
He threw a trip on the ace, now he's out, son
Hits the local bodega to wolf down a gyro
Son is on a midnight run like De Niro
Spots a shorty rock standin' on his block
The fiends be houndin' him to pump, so he adds to his knot
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
Increased intensity, 'cause damn, she was a fly one
Took her to the crib, there she ran her jibs
About mind upliftment and bein' positive
He yawned and he sighed 'til 1:05
Then he finally realized the honey wasn't live
At least he didn't plan on buildin' for the evening
Threw the FILA on the dome and said, "Come on, yo, we leavin'"
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
Saw his man Stan with the blunt in his hand
(Aww, shh), you know the transaction
Brothers gettin' lost in the weed satisfaction
Comin' down the block, man, loud as—
You would swear Redman was inside the truck
As the night seemed darker, cops is on the hunt
They interrupt your cipher and crush your blunt
See, you left your work at home, so they pat you down for nothin'
Why in the hell does 10-4 keep frontin'?
You push to the park even though it's still dark
The kid is nice on the hoop, he said, "I'll spot you, troop"

As for me, I'm a nocturnal animal, dark concentrates
On a young Black man who makes the niggas' speakers shake
The nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy
It's the time we get down, yo, son, you know the sound
The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
The night makes the aura and the jake can't hack it
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
And the stars dance around, ayo, I think it's fly
Intensity, most rappers don't see it
Spirit-wise, musically, you gotta be it
Serenity and silence of the sounds and emotions
In the concrete jungle when the sun don't bungle
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel
I paid about a deuce-twenty for the Ampex steel
But let me slow down, I think I ran my jibs enough
Peace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough
The night is on my mind

My fist stands firm because I'm Black and solid
I open up your pores like a plate full of collards

Back to you MCs, this is what you gonna get
A first-degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette
I hope you like Marlboro

So respect yourself, son, and come and give me love
Once again, the Ab' is who you think of
So chill with the beef, money, we gotta dead it

Question
What is it that everybody has
And some pirates and thieves try to take?

(Da booty!) And if you is a crook then you takin' it
(Da booty!) And if you got money, you shakin' it
(Da booty!) C'mon everybody, just heed
That's word to Phife Dawg and my man Shaheed
(Da booty!) And if you is a crook then you takin' it
(Da booty!) And if you got money, you shakin' it
(Da booty!) C'mon everybody, just heed
That's word to Phife Dawg and my man Shaheed

I give my promise to all y'all to keep my shit hittin'
Half of y'all claim dog but meow like kitten
Flippin' on brothers just like Mary Lou Retton
Get off that ass and see what I'm settin'
Born with this inside, you just can't get it
This is the lethal pop and you have no weapon
Who is the native brother who keep asses steppin'
Make deep impressions and constantly be reppin'

When I was young I'd stretch gaucho
Now I'm on Letterman, on the couch, yo
The black thing with knives is called the back do'
Can't we be cool instead of being foul though
Ghetto child dreams of fast cars and fast dollars
Impressions of live sometimes makes ya holler
Scream all that devil shit and talk like a scholar
You dumb as a doorknob, and why do you bother

Rock to the beat, yo it's never the same
Good girls usually got good game
Hot cats tearin' that ass out the frills
Block ass, you had no skills, that's the reals
Make this money without the friction
Take this honey, there goes your diction
Rappers better retreat, fix your joints
My whole crew got bumps on they points
Rumors being spread 'bout me and my click
We can't rock shows and our rhymes ain't shhh
Might not've heard it, or maybe you have
Between me and you, they can kiss my ass
Used to get angry, used to get quite vexed
But say what you may, just cash my check
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is going on tour
Doing shows galore, and bringin' it raw

(Da booty!) And if you is a crook then you takin' it
(Da booty!) And if you got money, you shakin' it
(Da booty!) C'mon everybody, just heed

Back at you
Right back at you

Drove around the block, drove a lot
Lookin' all around, don't see no cops
Whisper in your ears, a ghetto star
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste
Taste yours too, rub your back
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes
Close your legs, I start to sigh
Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes
Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like
Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head
Put the thought away, think of you instead
Hot outside, it's hot in here
Roll down the window, the breeze in your hair
Your earrings shake, you a baby doll
You say you want me but did you want them all?
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Knew a girl named Shelley, six-pack belly
When we made love, she made it shake like jelly
Put her own video star on my tele'
Lived in the Bronx on the block named Fteley
Had to be jetty 'cause this other ho Netty
Kept blowing me up, her jonesing was steady
Told my man Louie that I really wasn't ready
Louie, when we did it, man, we both got sweaty
This girl from my past had ridiculous ass
She attended UMASS and she passed every class
Walked down the hall with her stuck up sass
Talked to basketball players, she liked how they passed
But when I use to hit it, the bullcat, she quit it
She wouldn't admit it, but shorty was addicted (Say word)
Word, nigga you heard
Like a fiend with a clean when he catches a bird
Knowing how we living, I'ma talk about Mayo
Sagittarian mami, her love was a K.O. 
We was on the under, had to stay on the lay-low
Used to go so deep that she used to say "ayo"
Rocked with her friend, but her friend drove both way
Asked her about it and she used to say "no way"
Just let it go, yo, I used to say okay
Just another day, but Phife, anyway

Met a shorty named Kenny from East Saint Louie
Body good and plenty, the finest in Missouri
If you had no money, you better hit the highway
Even in her own right, she had to do it her way
It was an ill situation when I met Dantanya
Worked in Saint Louis in her mother's hair parlor
Use to hit her man for cake to come see me
Her and her man from home, they sold heemy
We had it hemmed, locked, sold and shit
When I dug her, yo, she said I was the ultimate
Broke her up kid, driving the drill like Truck Turner
All other things, they did not concern her
People that we love, yo, we love with a passion
I'm the type of cat that brings forth the action
You feeling me, yo? I hope you hearing me, yo
One more thing before you start cheering me, yo

Now, you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way

Messing me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look at what you're starting
Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush
The whole world sees it but you can't (uh)
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant (come on)
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant
*heavy breathing*

Speakin' of which..
Got a leash and I wish just to rock you, Miss (C'mon)
Make a militant move, peep my strategy (What?)
End of the day, you're not mad at me (Ugh)
Not dealin' with nobody, now that's what you told me (What?)
I said, "Hey, yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly" (C'mon)
'Cause yo, picture me messin' it up
Her mind not corrupt, with the ill C-cups
Shit! I'm on my J.O. (C'mon)
Bullshittin', hopin' that the day goes slow (what?)
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though
Is kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal, yo?

Fuck the car-jacking, Phife Diggy is rapping
Got dawgs with love and plus dawgs that's packin
So what's the deal Captain? if it's time for some action
Watch me roll with hon, try to push her back
Which one of these niggas, think they fuckin wit dis?
Put your money on Queens, yo these cats is pissed
Meaning, hot, green and stinky—see shorty there, winking?
Hit her off so hard, that her eyes start blinking
Then massage her down, with the word serene
It's the Dawg For Pres, new star on the scene
And I'm here for the battle, right down to the letter
If it rains today, then it's a double-header
Range Beemaz and Benz, 1100's and Jettas
Phife Dawg for whatever, just get it together
(Just) get it together, (Just) get it together

Of confusion and glitter, nobody's a quitter

Gon' put it on harder than anyone did
It would benefit you to keep a wide open lid
Makin sho' shot shit, makin sure you shine
Takin shows for sure, takin hearts in time

Yo! We about to rock this joint, from the family. And
We want y'all all to know, that it's time...

To rock rock, y'all, freak freak, y'all
To the beat, y'all, it's unique, y'all
Rock rock, ya'll, freak freak y'all
To the beat, y'all, it's unique, y'all

A-yo, praise the master, make plans with your pastor
My rap'll blast ya, send you to the hereafter
I push a tractor, for horses grazin' in the pasture
Ya heard I was trickin', the whole room filled with laughter
In ciphers, I'm the one you don't rhyme after
You only know half of the math, it don't add up
The lead batter, my hits make ya frame shatter
(Watch me now!) Just begun like Jimmy Castor
I'm bad luck just like walkin' under ladders
Mad rappers, book of life, last chapter
Me and my squad build just like contractors
I break shit, you only give hairline fractures
Women flash us, don't know? Ya better ask us
A bastard, wit' more contacts than Lens Crafters
Tear down the rafters, venereals couldn't clap us
You need practice, hit chicks then I'm Casper

The Church of Scientology, feminine biology
Manic depressive psychologically, A.D.D. logically
Polluted by technology, the fumes in this ecology
While your thought you was out of copy, I get nastier than sodomy
Probably the odyssey started back on robbery
Was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty
Regarded as a prodigy, leery in sociology
Leather Wallabee's always conceal my gynecology
Rhymin' pathologically, that's how it gotta be!
Never makin' no apology, worshippin' my anthropology
Fuck the modesty! Studyin' microbiology
Causin' verbal lobotomy is in my genealogy
Six-months of sobriety, movin' very methodically
Like a unicorn, more ways than oceanography
Gods acknowledge me, rip shows anti-biotically
True thugs bionically give birth to criminology

Uh, yo, check it, yo, uh-huh, yo!
Now, as a youngin', I swear to God, y'all couldn't tell me nothin'
I swore I was gettin' somethin', clothes-on humpin'
For girls with the church, slacks with some shirts tucked in
I set it up for money, my mom worked when I was cuttin'
Unsigned strugglin', for the heat I lit the oven
One would buy the CD, the other would do the dubbin'
Before I met Tribe, I was in the clubs frontin'
Oh, yeah, I know Tip, when I see him I be duckin'
But now when I'm clubbin', those that used to dis me buggin'
Overweight chicks, spandex, they stomachs sucked in
Stay interruptin', dance and try to cut in
Told people you got in free when you really snuck in
We never get concerned about who's in the lead
We just stay workin' so no one will need
An unconcerned outsider givin' niggas feed
My niggas puff weed, but negotiate the seed
The family is granite, and you can't intercede
Or try to switch lanes at this operatin' speed
Cats in the game be gamblin' with greed
We the house, you the player and we gonna catch these
Who's the Sam Sneed makin' microphones bleed?
Poker-face creed while my mind just read
Shorty got rhythm, but her freak got freed
(That's) insignificant, but (this) take heed

They say I'm pretty like Clay is, bright like the day is
Beats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is
I'm swingin' this from Bay Ridge to where the Oakland Bay is
My game is tough to play, I'm tucked away like your safe is
The aim is to make you recognize what the name is
Mos Def gon' set it straight from where the 7-1-8 is
The place with the greats who originate the flavors
A All-Star block with some All-Star neighbors
(Turn the music down!) This is probably some haters
Achin' 'cause they hear us rotatin' on the playlist
From B-boy laces to Detroit gators
Yo, Tip, I gotta bail, where the scale? Help me weigh this
Yo! We want all y'all to know
That this is the family, right?
And what we want everybody out there to do
On the dance floor
Is get ready
Because now, we gonna

Brown eyed shorty, chocolate like Godiva

Get on up
Live your life right when you be corrupt
Volcano about to erupt
Get it up, Get it up, Get it up

Got the motivating joints that keep your ass jumping
Why when a nigga get on, you want something
Yo I got the poisonous traps for little rats that fiend
In come the bedroom, Dream
Kick it at a slow or at a quick tempo
A ladies' disposition won't fuck with the mental
I'm built for conflicts with chicks with issues
I can lick the wounds, bring ease when misused
Bringin' all the pain and makin' things shiver
The beat make you bite your nails and shit your liver
And we gonna give a encore performance
Haters seem dormant while my presence is enormous
Tarnations, I went Gold
Stressed Out with Faith but told cats to Get a Hold
Who is the nigga who's mic is stronger
Rock for an hour and he might rock longer
Kid you're perplexed, seems I better get to gongin'
The clean up man, hang you up like awning
Don't step in the arena, that's a stern warning
I'm the pops, I raise the sun like morning
Seems you're still sleeping, hey, stop the yawning
Open up the blinds and witness the dawning
The new application and I'm the applier
And I'm a set it off like fire
Yeah yeah, that's where it's at
Make it hot and phat and like Puff (I like that)
Now I got to urge you on to move ahead
Don't dread, 'cause I keep the stock in the shed
And if you need a boost, then I got the jump
Because we prone to make the party go bump bump bump bump bump bump bump where you is
If you the baby daddy then uplift the kids
Get back and plan, don't be on front flossin'
Incognito, you heard the name quite often
You dressed in black and been issued a coffin
I thrive on this plane, you off to the lost one
Like cayenne pepper, it gets hot, nothin' better
From each little dash it get the whole smash
It's tasty too, so satisfy your whole palate
Fake ID's are revoked and invalid
Infractin' bodies out on the dance floor
Is what I wanna see, not less but much more
The lyrics just spewed, he got good reviews
The kid made the news, how he left no clues
On how he just murdalized the whole damn jam
He just got results that's smiles and waved hands
The mission could never be accomplished, however
Until we bounce to an island with hot weather
And still we'll be able to rock and rip crowds
While other emcees say nuthin' and talk loud
While other emcees say nuthin' and talk loud
If you with the Tribe, chest out and be proud

Big up my little nigga Pedro
Make you after the L like turkey, cheese and to-ma-to ('-to)
Fuck is that? Especially for niggas that will pay no
Attention to instructions, like they still wan' disobey y'all
Wonder Twin powers activate real quick
So that I could grow about five feet more with an extra dick
One dick to hold in my hand when I'm rockin the mic
The extra dick to blow up the pussy for the rest of the night
Then I return with more lyrics like a bunch of rough niggas
They tough niggas that snuff niggas (Hah)
I know the club got enough niggas (Huh!)

Takin it, to the extremes, we breakin it
When we get, inside a zone then you feel that it's good
All you jelly cats stop marinatin my wood
Niggas, grab the mic with loads of malarky
I bring the knowledge and wield the anarchy
Put it on pooh-butts who's unsettled with ignorance
Give the last sentence with poignance and diligence
Eighteen wheelin through niggas like truckers
Breakin ankles, put it on like we at the ruckus
Guaranteein that shorty can move it around
In the place that gets you hot but leaves you here on the ground
Contenders don't you even think to challenge the crown
Of these brothers who so elequently hold the beat down
Fuck the rigamarole, we vyin for the control
We the musical equation of the whole entire nation

Oh yeah, throw the goggles on these engineers
Cause it might, get kinda wet when I spit this here
Yo, I'm six-foot-one with a big ass gun
To carry it you'd need a waistline the size of Big Pun
But I move crowds without a gun
Like if... (The New York State Lottery is ninety-nine million!!)
Hah-hah, yo, when it's time to flow, I suprise and blow
Five hundred thousand units off a dime a trow
Forty below, I'm thorough when it's time to throw

We was in the back of the joint cooling out
And I saw this girl, asked her if she like it like that (Ugh)
Nod her head yes, therefore I didn't stress
Let my beat keep knocking cause we rock it like that
Bust your ass slow, as if you didn't know
Put my mic inside your brain zone, don't dis, hold this
It's the rhyme, it's the beat that vibe all together
That makes the competitors sound like this
Rarely do I care yo, I let down my hair
When the music's up loud, man, I jones real bad
Lyric overload, in club, in the boat
In Jeep in America, Tribe goin' mad
Females ride when my niggas just ride
With the songs we creating and musically relating
Sex niggas talk, black bodies in chalk
Meanwhile they boot shaking on some punk shit, faking
Wait, I can't front, stick men
Who really gon' do what they say they come to do
What they say gonna do
Back at the ranch, there's no Carte Blanche
Everybody gonna move when we say move

Do you like it?
Say yeah if you like it like that (YEAH)
Do you like it?
Hell yeah if you like it like that (HELL YEAH)
Do you like it?

When you win, how you start, kid you gotta have heart
Niggas in my shit, move! Give a nigga room
Back it up, it's a grown man making on time (Making on time)
Plus you damn similar to Newport's
Smoking ain't a new sport
Smoke you since the invent of rhyme
Gotta spread love, no matter where you are
Where you at, where you went, 'cause nobody want beef
Fountain is good, just flows like a river
Just go with a nigga, kid, my stay ain't brief
Put your heart in the day, in the night, family

Love getting down and I love a cool breeze
Love seein' checks from record companies
Love lovin' love cause I love what I do
And we do our thing for the one nine two
And the rest of the country cause we from there too
Makin' sure love is givin' when I get it from you
Everybody, we regulate the party and shit
Love it when I get a little rugged wit' it
Love the circumstance to make my dough flow right
Love rockin' mics plus the ill style nights
She does it real good but love'll make it mo' better
Got me kind of open in the DK sweater
Love when my peoples come home from jail bids
Really love women and I really love kids
Love tight clubs where the music just bang
Camp-ass with gas women or shorty got bangs
Lovin' it, yo yo, I'm lovin' it
Love a woman when she got a tight outfit
Outfit meaning outlook and disposition
You love it when a nigga does a love composition
Love peanut butter and jelly on wheat
Wylin' out, makin' hot shit to hot beats

From Cali to DC

Let's be big about it, and realize the fact
Love it, when the underdog comes through
Ghetto rebel rise to overthrow these rules
Love it, when I get spared another day
Used to drink zay while my niggas weighed yay
Love it, when I gain control over this
Life is really bigger than the Roley on my wrist
Got a twist to this shit and the answer's inside
Sho as the world's small and the Mississippi's wide
Had to rock a vest over unchoosed stress
Now I see people rockin' theirs in jest
Love it when my loved one really hold me down
Brand new flight and I'm takin' off ground

Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?) Nope

A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?
Some veggie links and some fish that stinks
Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house
Smelled like she conjured up a mouse
Eggs was fryin', ham was smellin'
In ten minutes, she started yellin' (Come and get it!)
And the gettin's were good
I said, "I shouldn't eat it", she said, "I think you should"
But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians
No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian
Strictly collard greens and the occasional steak
Goes on my plate
Asparagus tips look yummy, yummy, yummy
Candied yams inside my tummy
A collage of good eats, some snacks or nice treats
Apple sauce and some nice red beets
This is what we snack on when we're questin'
(No second guessin')

Bridge!

Now drop the beat, so I can talk about my favorite tastings
The food that is the everlasting
See I'm not fasting
I'm gobbling, like a dog on turkey
Beef jerky, Slim Jims, I eat sometimes
I like lemons and limes
"And if not that, I get the Roti and the Soursop"
Sit back, relax, listen to some hip-hop

Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes
A sight for sore ones and some bore pies
And other goodies that are filled with goop
With fried apple roots
Delectable delights, control my appetites
Mines is for me, right, but I know what I like
Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner
Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin' winner
When breakfast time comes, I don't recognize
Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chides
Mixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes
Or anything with flair, cook it, I'm in there
Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose
This is how it goes
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol

Check this out, Kool DJ Red Alert
With my man, Q-Tip

In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
She went lower than low, into limbo
A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo
She answered no, so she had to go.. on with the program
Credence, it seems that I've forgotten your name
But it seems that she's done the same
And now something has happened
Suddenly, she's been distracted
By somethin' that has been attracted
She poked and poked, and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Now, I think you understand
Clinic — saw the doctor flex his biceps
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright!
Right then and there, she fainted
A really grim picture is painted
The brother who she acquainted
Was the enemy, scary ain't it?
The Pubic Enemy
You might also like
YEAH!
Let me tell you more about pubic enemy
Ay, Q-Tip...

Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Had a lady queen, married since 18
He protested, that he was infested
Get lots of love, and he couldn't digest it
All propaganda, one big fat lie
'Cause I see the king with my very own eye
Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king
And poppin' up on the teenage scene
And poppin and pimpin' on honeys with moneys
Whole situation to me was kinda funny
He hold the crown, but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown, and the jimmy hates that
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
Caught the king scratchin', so she had to assume
That he got vicked by the enemy's trick
The thought of cheatin' made the maiden so sick
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin'
Threw a pot and his dome was beamin'
You could hear him yellin' in the motherland
"Baby, baby, please, baby, understand"
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate.. of the enemy
The Pubic Enemy
Propmaster (Yeah?)
Please listen to me (What?)
Somethin' is lurkin' by the Jimbrowski
(Who? Jenny?)
No, not propulated
A horrible creature that must be penetrated
He gets all into ya, then he tries to do ya
You better run fast, he's gonna pursue the...
(What!? Yo! listen here, Propmaster whiz, no one fears...)
Okay, bro, just thought I'd let ya know
How he lives, and how he go
Watch yourself when you're out on the run
The enemy is missed, we'll have too much fun
There's four friends of mine that thought they were bad
And laid up this girl, so now they're sad
They scratched and scratched like it was Saturday and...

Listen here, this is Kool DJ Red Alert
Known as the true, the only, the very one, the Propmaster
There's only one thing I gotta tell ya
There's a whole lotta propmasters out there
You know what I mean?
Shaheed a propmaster
Q-Tip a propmaster
The Jungle Brothers a propmaster
BDP a propmaster
45 King a propmaster
I won't tell you nuthin' 'bout the ladies
They ain't no propmaster
But you know who's the main propmaster — ME!3Embed
Rain all day
Rain all day
Don't you worry

All I wanna do is get down y'all
Have a ball y'all and freak freak y'all
Lifeless ventures ain't new boo
So don't boo hoo, yeah, you too
Gotta get a grip like culture
Swoop down, swoop down like a vulture
The rhythms will lurk into people
All funk ain't created equal
Lookin for the beat to rupture
Like the rapture, gotta capture
Don't let the storm of life scare ya
Get funky, let me prepare ya
For the days of grimness and oppression
Aiyo bro, here's your lesson
Even though the rain starts pourin
Start reachin, start soarin
Don't stop, if you do, you're stallin
Rhythm savior, hear ya callin
Instrumental to be freaky
Go ahead in the rain and you'll see

Can't we make you see
I mean, the fact that is the key, I mean
Devoted to the arts of movin' butts, so get on up and...
Think about what's yours
I mean your culture and your laws
I mean, I label you a sucka
If you're dumber, just stay dumber
But stay in line and keep groovin'
If it's movin, if it's soothin
Don't let a little thing like rain keep you under
Or the thunder, look and wonder
Stomp til your soul is lifted
Get with it, rhythm's with it
Get inside the groove and get nasty
Funky nasty, crazy classy
Money is a first on the list here
It's the good time, it's the good cheer
If you got the ride then ride it
Don't hide it, provide it
Drop, drop, drop down the pants, shake your fanny
Cuz it's handy, not an Annie
Rock to the roll with the hair down
Get the lowdown, rhythm showdown
The simple explanation is nada
Make it hotter, thanks, de nada
If you wanna hear what I'm sayin
Clean your ears and just come on and groove5Embed
It's a new decade
The Native Tongues are about to proceed with the usual lingo
The usual rhythm

Devoted to, the art of moving butts
The rhythm's happening, and it's moving up
The Tribe has been on hold for much too long
Don't fear the rhythm because it's strong
On the corners, brothers bop their heads
From the high-tops to the natty dreads
I'm a nubian y'all, look what we did
Took the crust away from the third eyelid
Now it's kinda open, longs to see the sight
Rhythms of the Tribe which is passed outright
Night after night, day after day
Questing for the rhythms of the Native Tongue way
Rhythm is the key as we open up the door
Things a B-boy has never seen before
Poly-rhythm addict with a big fat boom
You have an eargasm as you start to consume
The ghetto beat with a ghetto poem
Yeah, it's from the heart, 'cause it's from the home
Jarobi, Phife, Ali Shaheed
Call me Koala, got what you need
You're a disc jock, then jock this
Rhythms can't lose, rhythms can't miss
If you feel uptight and you need to freak
It'll be alright once we drop this beat

Ma Massa-ya, Ma Makossa
Gets hectic, freak a bourgeois
We quest around for the musical heart
On avenues, streets and boulevards
Not selling out, that's a negative
Loving Hip Hop, loving heritage
Got the instinct to travel miles and miles
Gotta whole lot of rhythm, piles and piles
Now you're kinda with it, wanna get the funk
From the Zulu Nation, topping all the junk
Standing on the top like the Temptations said
Rhythms are obese, yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed
Read what I read, can't be better said
Tribe'll lick motions dabble in the head
Sweetback's bad, not as bad as a beat
It's a (stone groove baby)
Continue, on the windy road
But, I'm lugging, a crazy big load
Will we be on point for the ninety dec
Is it muscle bound and will it flex?
But trudging, we are used to
You don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew
We're four, once more, must make the tracks
You see four fronts, but now you see four backs
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm

Q-Tip is my title, I don't think that it's vital
For me to be your idol, but dig this recital
If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissing
Slinging this and that, 'cause this and that was missing
Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected
Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected
Afrocentric living, Africans be givin'
A lot to the cause, 'cause the cause has been risen
Some brothers, they be flamming, thinking we ain't slammin'
Coming off like the days when we used to wear the tans and
A blue-collar talker, hemisphere stalker
A glass of OJ and a ten mile walk-a
If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearing
Can I get a beep and a side order of cheering?
I am what I am, that's a tribal man
We all know the colors, we all must stand
As we start our travels, things they will unravel
"Que sera sera", for this unit is like gravel
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along

Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher
The ills of the world make the situation lighter
The clock is always ticking, the systems should be kickin'
Like Tip said in "Ham and Eggs", I eat chicken, chicken, chicken
Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever
Embellish on the funk as we start to endeavor?
The roots of the rap filling up the gap
With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap

The boom, the bip—the boom-bip
Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles
Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble
It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty
So I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
This ain't trial and error, more like tribin' era
Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
The street can't depart from the bloody heart
Repair the wear and tear, don't stop 'fore it starts
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Marching off the project, we hope that you will subject
It's good to be an object and never, ever reject
The tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda
Keep it in boom and never will we slander
Redeems should be handed, don't let me demand it
Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it
Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
Although she's flipping crazy, give my love to Gracie
God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey?
The pigs are wearing blue, and in a year or two
We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe
What we gonna do, save me and my brothers?
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that
We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?
This society of fake reality
Are nothing but a peg of informality
While I sing my song, sing it all day long
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along15Embed
Pertains to nuthin, this does somethin
Mom's got no back, says I'm frontin
Call me Smiley, cuz I'm wiley
Living life like the life of Riley
Smokin' blunts with a boy named Bud
We cough up your lungs, cough up your cud
Put out fires, with a 40, ounce of water
You know you oughta
Dance to this, the girl you kiss
I like fried foods, especially fish
Afrocentric, I'm electric
Socialistic and eccentric
Body's healthy, mind is wealthy
Thoughts, they flow, that will propel me
To be a Native, get creative
Original and designative
Listen to the line that's playin'
Listen hard to what Q's sayin'
Politicians are magicians
Make your vote, they hope you're wishin'
Ambiguous words, senseless verbs
They all amount to crap that's heard
Violent hip hop, money flip flops
Promoters won't book, but it still rocks
I'm a Zulu, yes, a true blue
Red Alert is with the poo-poo
Ozone layer, loses flava
Here's the edge that you will savor

Can't you see what lays inside babe
Makin mentions on this tension
Rhythmic lovin, my profession
Hips, they gyrate, scripts I narrate
No banana, I ain't a primate
Ain't no Soul Glo, just an afro
The head is bred to let the thoughts grow
Quest together, to lands of never
Sleet and snow and storms can't sever
Tribe is growin, never know when
For this time, six necks may show in
Dialogues have been accepted
Negatives have been rejected
That's the music, negro music
Is here for all, so you must choose it
Phonies fondle, watch it throttle
3-6-5 straight out the bottle
Bustin caps, finger snaps
I prefer the second for ghetto tracks
Phife, Jarobi, Ali told me
Get the force like Wan Kenobi
Force his teachin, beats are screechin
Poly plateaus, we aim for reachin
Tribalization, freaks the nation
A mass of peers in celebration
Hopes been real high, since the knee high
Days of youth, feelin good and real spry
Avid combos, hear those bongos
Boom cacka boom, that's how they go
We ain't nomads, but we real glad
Hip hop slams through the nineties, no fad
As a rhythm, have been given
Hurry up, become, we breakin out, out
With a rhythmic instinction to be able to travel
Beyond existing forces of life
Basically, that Tribal
And if you wanna get the rhythm
Then you have to join a Tribe
Word, peace5Embed

And if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe
Oops... my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me

Niggas, step back, it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paperback books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excellin' 'cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link in the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
See, I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that
I could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure that elevates my mind
Make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
My title is rock, the Abstract Poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, special for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear

Emcees ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body and the health make me wiser
The tantalizing wordplay, yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come with better compositions
I write and recite to make good position
In this rap game here we engineer
Stabbing up the jam, yeah son, shit's clear
And I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way
Beating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-73 and C-74
Do a little something when I'm out on tour
Coming through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flap a shorty's pockets to the space like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gas, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll cause we in control
Take you out on your hide less you paying a toll

Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks remove it
Put down the mic kid, cause you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg and I got nuff styles
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swinging when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last emcee what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's sleepless in Seattle
Rude bwoy official coming with the ill grammar
Coming back on kids like Joey Montana
We be the three emcees that make your mind go batty
Mad play on WKRP in Cincinatti
So lord send a hand and if you can't send a hand, send a man

Cause all these biting emcees, lord them something else
See I kick the styles that'll make your ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer ripping parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about filling one with lead
Never mind that, man, here come the dread!
We coming far far far
Busta Rhymes is coming far far far, you know you hear me, star
Bet your bottom dollar

Niggas become aggravating, sickening, you beat them like they father
Oh shit check out what I'm saying
A-ha a-ha oh a-ha a-ha you know my niggas don't be playing
Once upon a motherfucking time
I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Mama-so mama-sa mama makossa
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Eeeyah! Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings, delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings
But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Sit dog sit! Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit1Embed
As we start trudging
Me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
Vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
Searching for the virgins of life
That be shoving out the door that's crack
The valleys of time, are always on my feet
As least the beat will combine
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline
You don't need Underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
But can I get a level on the bass and on the treble?
Footing up and down like a UNLV Rebel
The answer be amongst us 'cause we really dig acoustics
Can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
Your feet will be infectious so at least realize the fact
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
This ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control
If you're a megastar, words will buy you a car
I'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting
All over the earth if we can get there first
Now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
So if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em
They'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying
All over the field, you won't have to yield
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield

It's rough and tough in this ghetto, a lot of funny stuff going down but you got to walk tall. Walk tall!

You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
But we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade
It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
See the levels peaking as the rhythms keep-a screeching
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preaching
The point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
The liveliness is mean as we scoot across the star
We are bulging, I'm indulging in a rat-a-tat-tat
Explanation for the line is that the rhythm is phat
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a Jeep
But dig it in the ground because the footprint now

Walk tall!
Walk tall!
Walk tall!
Walk tall!
Walk tall!
Walk tall!
Walk tall!
Walk tall!
If there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
Our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
Joy inside the domes as we hit the road to Rome
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that
Remember me, the brother who said "Black is black"
You can come while we Quest, I don't play, I don't jest
Get emotions off your chest, we are Black, we been blessed
Making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
The walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
The times that you have waited, more anticipated
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong6Embed
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown '83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift 'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go, it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath

Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems as Phife's my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tick-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

*sounds of frogs
The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
Like this

After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again how would I know
After all this time trying to be a super ho
She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter

It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, like the butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turned to freaks
All of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me, "Diane made it"
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
'Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers
Phife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter19Embed
Your new lesson is to realize the mission when you hear it
Emceein, see I got this in my spirit
I got verses like Mahalia singin' church hymns
So strap up because you skatin' on ice that's wild thin
A weak foundation doesn't make a good home
That's why mine is built on chrome microphones
We bout to do it theoretically, unsteadily, to the medley
Come on
It's the complete Kamaal, unique, Fareed, breed
That'll keep you broke down like a Ross 5 speed
So move buddy, a yo we got to get this money
In this land of dead and crummy, ain't a damn thing funny
A yo, shout out to Mobb Deep, the Extra P
Busta Rhymes, De La, the J Beez, and don't sleep
We got reality for the cabbage
Staying sincere to this, so I know we gonna manage
Give me, liberty in mass amounts and Swiss bank accounts
With the sustainer, it'll be real
So me and my brothas, we can sit down and build
Like Rampage with that Last Boy Scout appeal
We got that silk, satin, Manhattan intelligence feel
That keeps everything on even keels
So all you slow brothas talkin' yang, ya poo-tang
Now, we gonna show you how the real crew bang

A yo, I bring it to you live kid, Queens niggas love static

I get brains on Craftmatics and leave your wet dreams shattered
That's the same guy be skeetin' in your mugshot
I stay hot like summertime on LBQ and boo-boos
The love shack is 1-9-2, my joint's smooth
To watch y'all niggas fall like Lin Que
I keep it brand new like school shoppin', it's on and poppin'
The club peeps this nigga's steez like radars
You get laid off while I'll be gaming ghetto girl like 8-Off
The verdict's in, I be the Luke of Linden
Give up your goods cuz it's the start of your endin'

(Where ya at?) We seein' life for what it is
(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids
(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation
(Where ya at?)

Now, all that Glock totin' trash you talk will not prevail
It's stale, you'll either be dead or in jail
I keep it realer than the logo on milk
Denouncing tough guy wannabes that look smoother than silk
That's the sound of the man getting yanked off the stage
Trying to front like he mad paid
Sucking so bad, we threw his mama off the train (insane)
MCs are just givin' it all away (OK)
Who said him know about the Quest-like sound?
Mess around and get your ass knocked down (clown)
I dedicate this to the posers that play hard
You wanna hear some rhymes, well then bring your bodyguard
So he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display
Leaving all MCs in complete disarray
I beez a veteran MC, crushing crews for years
You frontin' hard when you softer than the Berenstain Bears
Yeah, chumps be like "Phife, that ain't fair"
'Fuck outta here, do I look like I care?
Come off my stage before I grab ya neck and handle ya
Wet ya like punani, then dry you like Canada
Shaheed Muhammad's on the Gemini mixer
Peace to Derrick Coleman, Mad Max and the Sixers
I'm cappin' hard cuz I got this rap shit sold
From Linden Boulevard down to Cascade Road
You know my steez, I treat hip-hop like a sport
Holdin' down fort up on Martinique Court like...
(Where ya at?) We seein' life for what it is
(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids
(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation
(Where ya at?) We gonna start the Zulu Nation
(Where ya at?) Come on, come on
(Where ya at?) We gonna put it all together

It's a fly love song

To the effect of nothing, effective fronting
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
I am a bonafide
Not too modest and not a lot of pride
Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my mama is sick I'm by her bedside
Used to watch the show on Channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in Tide cause it's too damn cold out-tide
That's how the runnings go
If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter (ass)
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest, you ask the Quest, you ask real fast
Cause I don't wanna see 'em, start bucking
Throwing chairs in the air while you be ducking
What what? Don't step to me with that
If you promoting a show make sure it ain't wack
Or else I'm leaving ("Let me tell you")
I'm leaving ("Let me tell you")
I'm leaving ("Let me tell you")
Your wack show

We don't need you, sorry!
And the Abstract rapper says

I want chicken and orange juice, that's what's on my rider
And my occasional potato by Ore-Ida
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Ain't taking no shorts no more, now
Please act proper 'fore I call the CrimeStoppers
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no
Make sure you count your money real slow
Be alert, look alive, and act like you know
It's, the 90s, time to make moves
Not, the 80s, do away witcha womb
So what? You got a crew
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zu
Don't break fool, let's be reserved and cool
We don't have to act like we in grade school
Just make sure that we're taken care of

Bonita Applebum, remember way back woo
When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail 'do
I used to be all on it like a fly to shit
Back in the days, Bonita was a hit
I flirted and I flirted 'til there was no end
But you kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
Honey, you was funny but I'm tired of that
It's three years later, I got a new rap
Got a little older, a titbit wiser
I gained twenty pounds, six inches higher
Speaking of high I saw you smoke a hootie mack
Your ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back
But I'm here to testify it'll be a hard try
Slapping my knees, letting out sighs
Want to keep it slamming like a hip-hop song
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

In the words of the immortal Sweet Daddy (Uh)

I'll never shed a tear but then again I won't steer
You wrong, I steer you strong, for affection steer here
I'll take you to a place that's farther than the Uno
What do you know, if we go to El Segundo
Your presence should be closer like on "Buddy" I'll toast
To the ever clever youth, to say the least, you're the most
Honey, you're my honey, a-yo, dip, you're my dip
Treasure and forever there'll be pleasure with Tip
As we glide and move
Cushioned like a pillow that's soft and smooth
Ricky D said we got to "show and prove"
Do it to the music, that's the raw butt groove
Intimidate the boy
Cupid that's his name
Picking all us suckers is his flipping game
But Tip don't fall for that
Instead I'll get the Natives and we rush to the latest
Lamston's store, get a six-pack of hats for

Here in 1992, we present the fabulous What's The Scenario remix
Whereas, there are seven MC's
Six which are in physical form, one which is in spiritual essence
And he goes by the name of, uh... HOOD!

Check your rhyme, punk that ass or get got, F it (Shiittt!)
I lick buckshots, Hood, madman, I rip up stages
Lay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis
Extra! Extra! Pick up a clip
I'll tear ass out the frame (Ha!), and grab my dick (Ohh!)
I'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot, kid, I drop bombs
I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty
I baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news
I'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews
Death on the phono, my skills are porno
You say "Oh, no!," you bitch-ass homo
I bag up waste, electrifyin', I'm prime-time
I slaughter slime, I'm the greatest of all time
Sick-ass brother, nasty-ass nigga
Pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it! Kick the can
(Say what?! Say what?!) I'm a bad, bad man!

Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip
Punchin' out hits like Gladys Knight and The Pips
The Five-Foot Assassin has just raided your area
Your booty rhymes are wack, and that's the reason I ain't hearin' ya
(So!) Roll out the red carpet 'cause I'm gettin' this
Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous
Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew
And to you other sellouts — oh yeah, F you too
And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to
You're better off callin' D-Nice to your rescue
Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around
As for corny MC's, like Chuck D, I Shut 'Em Down
The Artical Don of hip-hop, and I won't stop
The Five-Foot Assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop
So do like Michael Jackson and "Remember the Time"
(Do you remember?)
Put on your dancin' shoes or somethin', 'cause you sure can't rhyme

Next to say somethin' 'cause you pass it to me
What does it take to check a technique? (Many styles, many styles!)
Hostile heat brings bursts of energy
Milo In De Dance is the new identity
One-two mic check
Select for the ruffnecks that tend to wander, I come (Correct!)
In my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots
So I can grow dreadlocks
Maintain the rock! (Don't stop the rock!)
Maintain the rock! (Don't stop the rock!)
Kickin' right inna your what's it not
I could rock longer, but fair is fair
So C. Brown, are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)
C. Brown, are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)

Makin' moves, y'all (Moves, y'all!) On and on and on
(Check it, check it out!!) To the break of, break of dawn
(Who's that?!) Just one of the L.O.N.S
And A Tribe Called Quest (East Coast!) to West
Remix mad kick, more than Metallica
To all MC's fall like the Battlestar Galactica
Stampin', stompin', rompin' Compton
(People all over the world!) I'm promptin' (Style!)
Pick a style, any style, Strong Isle
Representation, sensationalization
"Scenario" for the radio, 'BLS and KISS, so
(Here we go, yo!) Yeaaah!
Force, Main Source LP on the rise
In livin' color, let's see through original eyes
And I'm out like shout, ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh!
(Ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh!) There it is, baby pah!
Flyin' in on a limb, slim trim, D I am
There I am (There I am!) Don't run from a grim
Sike! We be right, be polite for my mics
Like I'm like (See sick! See syke!)
And slip away, and off to the Poconos
Spot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose
Yamaha (Ay-Ha-May!)
Let's flip the funk, now it all spells (Hey!)
Enough, enough, Ms. Fitted, I'm wit' it
If I did it, I was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it
'Cause yo, my vocal status at Knight's like the Gladys
Bed rest, spread test, and yo, I'm like the maddest
Male, not female, hail from Uniondale
Bounce the b-ball, 'cause beats are bein' yelled
In the hallways, always ringin' with a (Ho!)
This is my two-times-nine on the Scenario

Check it out, everybody — rhymes and mics
Black mens gettin' loot (Doin' what they like!)
Eight black brothers in the public eye
If you listen very close, I will tell you why
(Hood!) Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown
Shaheed, myself, and Busta Bust Down
Will commence to rock (Rock!), so bring on the flocks (Flock!)
Interrogation for the knockin' of the box
The boom-box ruler controls the medulla
None come cooler, I win like Shula
So bust out the move as you start to pursue her
Intensified mind, non-blunt consumer
Tip will come booty (Well, it's only a rumor!)
The meaning's so deep that it starts brain tumors (Tumors!)
Peace to Hood, baby, from the midnight crooner
Smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner
Hey! What we gon' do (Dooo) in '92?
Even though we had fun (Fuuun) in '91
Wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down
Ponna ponna! New sound leavin' cracks in the ground
What's goin' on, my man? Goddamn! And now my brain is hurtin'
Listen up — Busta, rhythm will hit 'em then I get 'em
Flip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em
Open up your mouth if you want the food
To get rude, Flipmode, 'cause I'm in the mood
Ah-heh, ah-heh! Yeah, man, that's how it goes
Body drippin' with blood comin' out your nose
Give me a Band-Aid, what are you askin' for?
(More!) Only your sacred and pure
Adverse, Zig-Zag, check it and the Busta new rap
Rap, Busta Rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes
Yeah y'all, in '92, I'm packin' my roach spray (Anyway!)
Take a lick, Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School
Mad brother when stealthy
RRRAAAOW! RRAOW! RRAOW!
To my dragon, baby, stop whinin'
I see my influence still shinin'
More crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo
That's the Scenario!Embed
The name is Q-Tip, enterin' through the middle
From the left, dead all the jokes and the riddles
Comin' from the maximum gain, the octane
That's on the radio it made me feel so low
It seems we gotta, brighten, the damp prison
I'm Nintendo 64 and you Mattel Intellivision
Bustin' from no mo' trey-eights, now papi weight
This joint is like a ruger, watch it roar like a cougar
And we gotta, move on the dancefloor
And work it out all night that's what you came here for
Just chem', I fills it to the rim, your shine is lookin dim
Daddy shine the light on him, ahem it's me
Leader of the starfleet force
Guaranteed to knock your joint off course, we took the loss?
Damn right, sure as tina made ike
We gonna put it in your noggin all night, and all day
The trilateral commision we dissin'
Tellin citizens be straight, but like snakes they hissin'
I'll be damned if I let his song fall to the side
Goin' piggybackin shit, let's ride, c'mon

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda, or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah (huh), so whom shall I fear? (Word)
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare (uh)
So jet to the store, and buy the LP (yeah)
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged (huh?) by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too (ha-ha)
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers (Yeah)

Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask

Musically, we are the herb, so sit back and light me
Inhale
My style is kinda phat, reminiscent of a whale
Young girls' desires, older females' dreams
I be the Abstract Poetic representin' from Queens
Socially, I'm not inane, black and white, got game
If you came to the jam, well, I'm glad you came
See, "nigga" first was used back in the Deep South
Fallin' out between the dome of the white man's mouth
It means that we will never grow, you know the word, dummy
Upper niggas in the community think it's crummy
But I don't, neither does the youth 'cause we em-
​​brace adversity, it goes right with the race
And bein' that we use it as a term of endearment
Niggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went
Now the little shorties say it all of the time
And a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme
Yo, I start to flinch as I try not to say it
But my lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it

I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
It's the neo-nigga of the '90s, c'mon

Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are

I be hatin' sucka MCs and the sucka niggas (I be)
Posin' like they hard when we know they damn card (Hatin')
What ya figure? Rhyme-wise, I do the figure-eight so concisely
Musically, we are the herb so sit back and light me
Inhale (Inhale, inhale)
My style is kinda phat, reminiscent of a whale
Young girls' desires, older females' dreams
I be the Abstract Poetic representin' from Queens
Socially, I'm not inane, black and white, got game
If you came to the jam, well, I'm glad you came
See, "nigga" first was used down in the Deep South
Fallin' out between the dome of the white man's mouth
It means that we will never grow, you know the word, dummy
Upper niggas in the community think it's crummy
But I don't, neither does the youth 'cause we em-
​​brace adversity, it goes right with the race
Yo, I start to flinch as I try not to say it
But my lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop, yo, you know the rest
The sucka niggas, niggas-niggas
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
I throw the suckas in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
The sucka niggas, nigga-nigga
Ayo, Shaheed, take us the fuck outta here

Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey, sucka nigga, who— hey, sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are

You're not any less of a man if you don't pull the trigger
You're not necessarily a man if you do16Embed
