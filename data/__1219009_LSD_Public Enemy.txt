5 ContributorsLSD Lyrics
Told ya, buffalo soldier
Fell to the ground like Folgers, couldn't hold the boulder
Fancy dancer paralyzed for an answer
In the hip-hop game but the rap got cancer
Tumors poppin' from the middle of rumors
Generation X be the end of baby boomers
Is the next generation headed for doom
Control the soul and you got a got a
Truck full of fertilizer blowin' up the spot
Think it's terrorism, the border line's hot
Check the passport's tap the telephone
Surprised they homegrown and one of your fuckin own
It's that same old shit, that same old game
From that same old gang up to that same old thing
Now what I see say, you know me
I pour a metaphor of LSD

I don't know what y'all thinkin' about
But if you know like I know
You better strap on your seatbelt
Cause you in for a long ride

Now I be damned, I been a man
Figure I never call myself a nigga to get Benjamin's
What's love got to do with what you got
Not a whole lot, no forgot (Damn, this shit is hot)
Spendin' all the cheddar for clothes
With a sign foreclosed on the front mud, lost in dominoes
Now the heads tell tales, how the dead bled and fled
Now they livin up in the bed, instead they seize us like Jesus
Married to the mob did a sloppy job in hemp stead
Lord had mercy, wanna curse me
New World Order got my ass drownin' in the water
Now what you stuck to the West
That funk to the East is fat, ATL be crunk
Dirty South, thirty thou crankin trunks
Try to pass the test but to the rest they flunk
Now what be indebted, better get over it
Those times and raps ain't never comin' back
No future without a pass, I kick ass
Rock the socks off of Pandora's box
Is it any wonder why the clock's Flavor got
Between rehearsin' a verse my jaw locks
I set the bomb between the R'n'B scene
Go against the grain run up on the train
And so i parallel the brains of Cobain
As hip-hop brain made em spill the champagne
Make it plain the sound remains insane
Come the same no holes closin up the lane
Don't ask no questions on the simple level
Can the magic get Shaq back, Knicks get Van Exel?
Bold rap lyrics, fuck whatcha heard
Not no lost and found nouns or half ass words
Turnaround funk power moves ruffs
I ain't never been coo-koo for no coco puffs
LSD, set it free make em see the tricks
Rather try at 37 than die at 26
You might also likeLawyers no loyalties accountants no royalties
Lie for a lie i look em in the eye
History speaking lawyers should die
Kissed the companies and made them all cry
A new rap song and a real drive by
Why o why did the video die
The narcs and the feds got the pimp niggas afraid
Threat of the aids got the bitches afraid
The god damn white man got you afraid
Social service got your mama afraid
Scared of the fact before a niggas black
Some of you say nigga before you say crack
You got no back is what you lack
Just say black and iÂ¹ll see where your ass is atEmbed
