67 ContributorsLife Should Go On Lyrics
From the West but I'm heading to the Northside
That's the top, I need a crib on the shoreside
I need a backyard full court size
From where the judge is the only thing that's courtside
Chasing money in the city of crime
Cashback so then it's black bags under my eyes
Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep
To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats
Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone
They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!
I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on
Mama had two jobs I know that she was working for me
Ten years later, hired to working for me
Hired the whole family like mobsters
Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors
Grandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city
Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy
London or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney
Paris, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' man!
Texas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy
All the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me
Heading to the money, whole city coming with me
And I'mma rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!

And this is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Good people, good drinks, good smoke
Got me thinking this is how life should go
This is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Family all around, all highs no lows
Got me thinking this is how life should go

Sitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher
I keep it funky with my Mrs, fuck these other bitches
And this ain’t biblical but this sermon is spiritual
‘Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few
The upper percentile
Whipping whatever I, 460LS you
I probably go less miles, stay in a small circle
Know that it’s God working
Police got the swine flu and these niggas is reptiles
Yeah, Maybach poetic genius
You buying a seven jeans, keep mine in a 7 Bimmer
I’m trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it
A fly nigga, I keep having a gravity grievance
And while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features
That’s like a complacent atheist is asking for Jesus
Riding around without a fuck given
Behind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten
The best in my position, I’m passionate with lyrics
And they ain’t fucking with the kid like Chris Hansen in the kitchen
I’m handsome to these women, I’m envied by these no ones
That’s no Joakim Noah, nigga everybody know us
And even if you don’t drink everybody po’ up
‘Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon’ show up
Never hate on no one, your blessing’s getting closer
Even when I’m open, it's nothing to Ed Cota wassup
And this is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Good people, good drinks, good smoke
Got me thinking this is how life should go
This is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Family all around, all highs no lows
Got me thinking this is how life should go8Embed
