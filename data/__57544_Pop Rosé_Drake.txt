I can buy it all out
But this the only shit that I sip though
So tell 'em bring the waitress
And I won't even ask what it hit fo'
Just send her to the bar like (like)
Send her to the bar like (like)
Send her to the bar like (like)
Like them niggas over there wanna..

Pop Rosé (Hey... ay ay)
Pop Rosé (Hey... ay ay)
Pop Rosé (Hey... ay ay)

Uh
They say you get paid when you think ahead
Valentines day girl, all you see is pink and red (yup)
And everything is on me
Rosé Spade to the '96 Don P
Hang around us, and I bet you
We'll get to stunt on whoever ya sittin' next to
You put 'em all on, and watch 'em run wit' it
And then wait for whatever's next when I'm done with it
And niggas show hate, period
It's like they all pregnant, they late, period
Yeah and shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And some people pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person man I wish y'all would
Yeah I told you I partied with Azuka
I'll let them other niggas Grey Goose ya
And we about to (yup)

If your beat gets released then I'ma take it
If your girl is a freak, then I'm her favorite
Got my partner with me, this is a replacement
Who do it like I do? You tellin' a lie fool
Leave the beat dead, all red like Piru
Been around the world, all girls like fly dudes
You a herb, get on her nerves like flies do
You need more girls, go call my manager
Two, three, four more, sure, we can handle ya
Gimme e'rythang I want, don't mess my order up
And her ass on point so my homie brought her up
Ma passed me the blunt, then I told her pour it up
In a flash we was gone, and you know I tore it up
Breast, ass, silicone, sex hot as Florida
South Beach, mouthpiece could swallow a Porterhouse
Yup, it get nasty, then I get gully
Grab the coochie, then the Gucci skully
A whole pack of rubbers, then I burned rubber
You cuddle undercovers, tellin' her you love her
When it come to verses, swear that I'm perfect
Murder in the first it's chllin in the hearses
Worthless, singing off key on purpose
We gon' pop, fuck urban (Ooooh)
(Yup)
Pop Rosé (Ooooh)
Pop Rosé (Fa Sho... Ooooh)
Pop Rosé (Fa Sho... Ooooh)
(Yup)

Are you drunk? I'm faded too
When you get money they just hate on you
But, fuck them, there's all these ladies in my view
So I ball baby (Yup)
Ball baby
Ball baby
Ball babyEmbed
