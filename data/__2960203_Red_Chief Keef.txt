14 ContributorsRed Lyrics
I got 50 shots on me, I'ma blow it at ya, nigga
I'ma blow it at every fucking brick ass nigga that's with 'em
Where the hoes at? 'Cause I got some dope and some lean and some liquor
And you know that, I'm getting money, that's why my fingers always itching
Let a nigga try to take it, his ass gon' get 80
Shots all up in his ass, all up in his head
He tried to take my cash, he ended up dead
My gun was all black, it ended up red

I got 50 shots in my gun
Too much on my mind
Can't trust niggas in my eyes
They snakes ass niggas whole time, yeah
Hoes all on my line
This shit going too far
Gotta bulletproof my car
Might send shots at one of my opps, yeah
Hollows all up in my gun
Better hope they don't hit your spine
Your ass gon' be done
Heard you had a history, you can't run
They used to have you running with the gun
Now yo ass can't run
Bullets chase you for me 'cause I can't run
'Cause I got kush all in my lungs
Got so many guns, get shot, which one?
Knock a nigga hand off, now he can't hold no guns
Got shot, now his legs off, now that nigga can't run
Now that nigga can't run

I'ma blow it at every fucking brick ass nigga that's with 'em
Where the hoes at? 'Cause I got some dope and some lean and some liquor
And you know that, I'm getting money, that's why my fingers always itching
Let a nigga try to take it, his ass gon' get 80
Shots all up in his ass, all up in his head
He tried to take my cash, he ended up dead
My gun was all black, it ended up red1Embed
