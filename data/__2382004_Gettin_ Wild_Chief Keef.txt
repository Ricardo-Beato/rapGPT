9 ContributorsGettinâ€™ Wild Lyrics
This shit sound like the old 'wop
Just because of that I went and got a old drop
When ya come in the trap, keep that door locked
Dicks run up in here and you taking all the jobs
I ain't getting her no uber ,bitch pay for a cab
Yea, that old sosa gone bitch it's then and now
He ain't outside, then we gone spin around
I pop a flat pill and I'm gettin wild

I'm  come through with the tec and the mac
Knock ya head off fuck ya cat-in-the-hat
Rollin i8, got a mac in the back
30 on my hip and a accurate that
Don't got waste your money on a vest
4 come through and they blast at your neck
Where poonany, took a shower in that
Ima be done in about an hour with that
Damn chief sosa look at your wrist at your wrist
Got a fucking 50 cal with that
Shootin out a old ford truck
Come through eddy bauer with that
You see my chain got a hour with that
Tryna take my chicken no malcom with that
Hot sauce come with this shit nigga
Hit your ass very loud in the back
She suck me so good she wettin up the seats
Luckily i got a towel in the back
Fuck nigga don't you worry about me
Worry about where ima blast you at
Sound like a little ra rat with the mac
Always on the move, always got a strap
In the stu, I'm just trappin
Look at me, I'm just cappin
You might also like
This shit sound like the old 'wop
Just because of that I went and got a old drop
When ya come in the trap, keep that door locked
Dicks run up in here and you taking all the jobs
I ain't getting her no uber ,bitch pay for a cab
Yea, that old sosa gone bitch it's then and now
He ain't outside, then we gone spin around
I pop a flat pill and I'm gettin wild

I got a million baby mamas, all these niggas be my sons
Got a Steve Nash shot, like I'm with the phoenix suns
Treat your block like the bank, go get me my funds
Got that Vanessa and Angela bitch call me sosa run
You"ll pull up on me, money make you come
You still gone suck my dick and you still ain't gettin none
You say that you don't no, money make you dumb!
You talking out the side of your neck, they gone find your loved ones
Got dick for the low
Slang it on the road
I just bought a coat
I just want a boat
Got shots for the high
I give em out the hole
Niggas unofficial, got the whistle ima blow
I'm smoking on the skunky
Joko why so funky
I can't leave this shit alone, I think that I'm a junky
I got that horse power, like I be playing rugby
I'm a boss I can be nobody she still gone fuck me
Nigga getchu issue
My trigger finger itchin
K chop off your ear nigga I told you to listen
You act like you couldn't hear me now you really cannot hear me
Choppa same size omelly
I think he from phillie
This shit sound like the old 'wop
Just because of that I went and got a old drop
When ya come in the trap, keep that door locked
Dicks run up in here and you taking all the jobs
I ain't getting her no uber ,bitch pay for a cab
Yea, that old sosa gone bitch it's then and now
He ain't outside, then we gone spin around
I pop a flat pill and I'm gettin wildEmbed
