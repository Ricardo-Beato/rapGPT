20 ContributorsChase Down The Bully Lyrics
What the fuck is this shit?
Baby, you see this shit?
It's like some- it's like some walkin' dead motherfuckers
(You will not replace us)
(You will not replace us)
(You will not replace us)
Hand me that thang right there
(You will not replace us)
(You will not replace us)

Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Here they come though
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Here they come though
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Here they come though
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Here they come though
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)

We gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fully
Chase down the bully hit his ass with the fully
Then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
String his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
You might also like
If you stay ready, you ain't got to get ready
Blast like confetti, nigga, cut like a machete
You just spent your fetti on a mother fuckin' Chevy
I'm buyin' somethin' heavy, turn the ass into spaghetti
From another planet, no, it's not the Serengeti
More than an African, I am planetary
Bitches think this commentary is military
I kill you and I bury you with the steel that I carry
Now, if he a fascist, I'ma bash his head in
Cock it back, boy, and put the lead in
All you evil forces wit'cha tiki torches
Shove 'em up your ass, freaky intercourses
They try to lie, say I'm hearin' voices
Apocalypse Now, rollin' with the horses
Hit the alt-right with a fog light
See that red sheet? Used to be all white

Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)

We gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fully
Chase down the bully hit his ass with the fully
Then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
String his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
Fuck a Trump supporter talkin' 'bout law and order
But all you wanna do is go fuck up reporters
Build a damn wall then fuck up the borders
Hate to see a motherfuckin' nigga with a quarter
Hate to see a nigga wit'cha ugly ass daughter
They feed you bread and water, get you ready for the slaughter
That's why your homeboy just went out and bought a
AR-15, I can make the bitch sing
Ain't no nigga shit, it's some bigger shit
Who can give a shit about white privilege?
Throw your hands up
Pull your pants up
You can't fight in that tight shit, man up
Nigga, stand up
Have you forgotten? Have you pickin' cotton, better get the socket
And if you think Ice Cube give a shit about they statues cover them in pigeon shit

We gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fully
Chase down the bully hit his ass with the fully
Then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
String his ass up by his nuts with the pulley

On my way home, talkin' on my iPhone
Mother fuckers tried to kill me with a fuckin' drone
They think I'm Al Capone with a natural comb
You just a clone of the original chromosome
Me? I'm just a student of the Terrordome
You? You just recruitin' for the skull and bones
Me? I do karate on Illuminati
You can view the body
I'm at a pool party
Hah, yeah
I know you internet hoes been suckin' on a lot of shit
But don't worry 'bout me, cuz ain't part of they club

We gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fully
Chase down the bully hit his ass with the fully
Then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
String his ass up by his nuts with the pulley

Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)

Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)1Embed
