Laaaa...
Fastlane Youngstas, we fly till we die, heyyy
I said Fastlane Youngstas, fly till we die

We fly, we fly, we fly, go ahead just touch the sky with me
We high, we high, we high, go ahead just smoke some La with me
We fly, we fly, we fly, go ahead just touch the sky with me
I try to push the limits, meet me in the sky
Fastlane Youngstas, we fly or we die
We fly, we fly, we fly, go ahead just touch the sky with me
I try to push the limits, meet me in the sky
Fastlane Youngstas, we fly or we die

Look, I does my stuff, nigga that's a given
I came from nothin', look how I'm mother fuckin' livin'
It's fireplaces, flat screen televisions
But I'd trade it all back to break my brother outta prison
Wassup killer, baby bro really miss you but the champagne still poppin', duffle bag filled up
Success pays for niggas that wanna kill us
My best days is memories with my niggas
I talk money, don't I sound like the skrilla
I’m fly till I die, my S Dome’s my propeller
And come to California for the women and the weather
But it ain't no tellin' what these boys don't sell ya
And last year I was considered a failure, but this year I'm gettin' money by the millions
Bitch nigga remember what I tried to tell ya, I tried to tell ya, I tried to tell ya that

We fly, we fly, we fly, go ahead just touch the sky with me
We high, we high, we high, go ahead just smoke some La with me
We fly, we fly, we fly, go ahead just touch the sky with me
I try to push the limits, meet me in the sky
Fastlane Youngstas, we fly or we die
We fly, we fly, we fly, go ahead just touch the sky with me
I try to push the limits, meet me in the sky
Fastlane Youngstas, we fly or we die

We fly till we die, fresh to the death
They hate to see us shine so we don't show 'em nothin' less
Hate to see us fly, feelin' to go 'em by jet
And put blue Gucci seats in the cockpit
Rolly on my wrist and I dome check
New CL 6, nigga that's a nice whip
I pull up on your bitch and all I say is this
You can stay where you at or you can take a trip, let's go

We fly, we fly, we fly, go ahead just touch the sky with me
We high, we high, we high, go ahead just smoke some La with me
We fly, we fly, we fly, go ahead just touch the sky with me
I try to push the limits, meet me in the sky
Fastlane Youngstas, we fly or we die
We fly, we fly, we fly, go ahead just touch the sky with me
I try to push the limits, meet me in the sky
Fastlane Youngstas, we fly or we dieEmbed
