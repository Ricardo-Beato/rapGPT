9 ContributorsMOVE! Lyrics
See, the Black race can't afford you no more
Terminator X scratches
If you have fear in your heart, don't fret just get out the way

Signed, sealed, delivered it's yours
I pour it on the breaks, till it break laws
Givin' the gabbin', so the brothers be havin' it
Or else the five fingers of dope'll be grabbin' it
Wit' no complaints, givin' uppin' I ain't
On the mike, like Karl Malone in the paint
Why rip a rapper, when he flow like water
I rather rush a television reporter
The frauds that tried to front
Watch ya back, stop pullin' those little stunts
Assault and battery, cause I snatched the battery
Off his back, the TV pack
Why pop the rhyme on a rhymer when I kick it
I'd rather spend my time, spittin' on a bigot
Who pumped the pimp that fed the fiends
He got jumped by the brothers in Fort Green
They slapped the mack, that kept us back
Sucker suckin' the hood like Drac
So if ya draggin' us down with the wack attitude
Get up, lookout, get out the way
Move!
You might also like
Move!
Get out the way, move!
Move!
One! (heh)
Two!
Three!
Four!

Signed, sealed, definition of a set-up
Pourin' it on and won't let up
Cause f-a-l-l-i-n, never applied
To this brother that tried
To let ya know, the folk of the American joke
That kept us broke
Now I'm ready to rap, strong fax I swing
Like Bo Jax, I'm never calm on a bomb track
60 percent three-fifths, constituted
Huh prostituted
Why I'm mad, cause it's written on the paper, right now
The mother fuckers bow
I kicked the lyric about the tricks of the trade
And the money made
Who got the money betcha bottom, dollar bill gonna find
Some rich old bloodline
But the blood is in the mud
Take the whack an attack it like a SCUD
To the patriotic hater that got paid off my people
I'm rude
Lookout, get out the way
Move!
Move!
Get out the way, move!
Move!
Now we gonna count it down again, y'all ready c'mon count it down
One!
Two! (heh)
Three! (Come on!)
Four! (Terminator)
Heh!
Now now now now now
If you ain't with the program I'm set on, you're just going to get run over

Signed, and what I'm gettin' is mine
I bring the noise to town, so let's get down
I cranked the beats, tearin' up the streets and the park
And it ain't Mozart
Jack movin' out, cause the black movin' in, and its old
I said it in Who Stole The Soul?
But 92 brings an attitude, that say I don't give a DAMN!
About the old way
This is a new day
Tell Jack stay in the back
And all the other suckers that don't matter
You got somethin' to prove, scatter
Get out the way
Move!
That's right get out the way, move!
Move!
Get up look out c'mon move!
One more time we gonna count it down
One! (Y'all ready?)
Two! (Help me out come on!)
Three! (At four we gonna break it down, c'mon!)
Four! (Break down!)
Heh!
Cmon!
Now now now now now now now now NOW!

It's a Black Thing you gotsta understand
Welcome to the gotdamn TerrordomeEmbed
