Lil Boat!
Okay
I've got these strange voices inside my head
Keep a stack and .380 beside my bed
Not to be cool, but in case they run up on me
If y'all bet on my fam, clutch with double on me
Went to school on a dirt road with black hoes and potholes
This shit was just then, this was four months
Late nights with gang on them store hunts
Loitering Walmart for pure fun
Look at me now, all of my classmates like, "Wow"
My teachers like, "Damn"
I remember I didn't have not a fan
Now I step out and Lil Boat is the man
Woah, this shit is surreal
Pockets stuffed in with blue bills
So much people trying to ask how it feels
But, nigga, I don't know
Everyday I ball like finger roll (woo!)
How'd you do it? Only God knows (oh!)
I want to know who's real until the time folds
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause I'm wearing nicer clothes
I'ma stay down with the same niggas I came up with, that's the master plan
26 for a nigga hand, diamonds so cold you might need a fan (woo!)
I don't know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse, I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
'Cause I'm young as fuck and I'm rich as hell
Pants low like I'm fresh in jail
But I've been out, motherfuck 12 (woo!)

Still ride around with k$upreme sippin goop
And my managers know lots and lots of goons
So let me know if there's pressure in the room

I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done had sex with six different whores
At the same time on they grandmother's back porch
Yeah, I'd rather do it than say

Niggas say he wanted two verses but he was hella trash but he had cash on him
I'm remember TBT, used to have the CDG, shit was hella flee
Back when all my thoughts were accurate, in an Acura tryna chase a bill
Now I focus hard on closing deals so that when I sign a deal I gross a hundred mil'
Stuck between trying to find friends who want innovation but will still kill
Every day a nigga's mom's callin' a nigga up sayin' a nigga spend too much
Baby girl, I made more guap than the President did in several months
Fuck my annual taxes, coulda bought some land with several cactus
Just looked up in the mirror and I'm gettin' fat, fuck, it's time to practice
My side bitch from Sacramento didn't suck my dick 'til we hit Saks Fifth
But after that, she went 7:30
I knew she would from a little birdy
Head so good, got me unsturdy
Givin' free clout to the unworthy
Goggles on like I'm James Worthy
Couldn't get hard, told her lick it, make sure it's still workin'

Turned your mother into a pedophile
Bet she wanna fuck me

Forever mine, forever mine, forever mine
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah

Never will I leave from your side
I choose you, I know you gon' ride
I fuck on hoes on the side
But that's just for the neck, girl, no lie
Never had real love, I'm bad at trusting
I just fuck, then I move on, no cuffing
You held it down back when I was out hustling
Tryna turn nothing to something
I know you're special
And I hope you make it big one day
Let these niggas try you, I'm the first with the gunplay
'Member when your moms brought my dog on a Sunday
I've been trippin' lately, need to get out the sunken place
And you super fly, you could walk on a runway
You still mine although I know you hate me
I should have gave you the world, but I fucked up
Late nights on 14th Street givin' butt rubs
I tell myself in my mind that I need that
I see you and I'm scared what you see back
You come around when you want, I don't need that
I've had so much heartbreak that I bleed black
And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love...

Love me forever, girl
My mind racin', I'm with you, girl
Huh, yeah
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah
Forever mine, forever mine, forever mine
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah

And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love...12Embed

I left out of school without‚ÄÖmomma's‚ÄÖpermission
They wanted me‚ÄÖdead, they be hoping and wishing
I'm‚ÄÖstill in your bags when I'm put in position
I'm dressed in all white like a chef in the kitchen
Lil Sada boat baby, I rock then I work
All these Ks but I still would have joined the navy
Remember that shoot-out in my red Vans
Had to duck, loaded the bullet almost grazed me
I stand but now I'm the type of nigga
That aim so right, when I shoot I ain't gotta dump
Twelve o'clock in the whip looking for the trunk
And you can‚Äôt fake the funk
Pistol attached to a nigga like breast lumps
Lot on the black pump
Pumping on tank three
Three in the morning, I'm half sleep

And nigga I'm half woke
Still aware enough to tell your bitch I'm an asshole
I'm worried 'bout cash flow, income, and getting the bag though
I'm through the back door with my main bitch
Can't get caught with my side ho
I got Bape on, Baby Milo
Bring the bricks on the high low
This bitch only 5'4" but her throat feel like it's seven feet deep
She sucking dick with a blindfold
Made me disappear like my weed
I'm going in, bitch, its guaranteed
Left my momma house at seventeen
Met my first opp on Evergreen
He got dropped with guns he never seen
Had murder on my mind then, free YNW Melly
I don't know why you hating on me
Give me a reason to leave the Drac' on E
Got this bitch cooking steak for me
In the 'Rari running from the state police
Chopper hold a hundred, say the least
Lil nigga bout to die so say your peace
I know I gotta stay low-key
My granny said she pray for me
She know I keep a K on me
I was waiting on a nigga to play with me
Bitch I'm a lover and a fighter
Keep two sticks on me like striker
Custom vests, I ain't no biker
She could stay the night if I invite her

Kill 'em off like Chris in Stomp the Yard
This lil' bitch right here, she got me hard
She just want the last four  to my card
Drop her off right there on boulevard
Fucked her once and left the baby scarred

She was wearing Fendi leotards
I been cooking, whipping
Leonard DiCaprio, this white boy a star
Trapping out the house and in the car
I just served your spouse up at the bar
And you told like the mouse you are
Watch your mouth, you snitching from afar
Make no sense, you niggas work with law
Make no sense, you niggas need address
Left the nest, the team is still correct
Collect the bag, the bag I will collect
I'm the richer man, I won't contest
I'm the better rapper, I confess
Fucked her, now she setting up the desk
Fuck her, now she organize my clothes
Niggas mad I'm sending lower blows
Niggas mad I'm fucking better hoes
I'm a G, sucking ne‚Äôer toe
But I flipped the pussy like some dough
Freckles on her face like dominos

I‚ÄîI've seen, uh, well, I‚Äôve seen failure a few times
More recently than before actually, you know
It's quite interesting how much more complicated things get when you become, quote-unquote, "Rich and famous"
I say‚ÄîI say "quote-unquote" because, you know, one man's rich to the next can be a step from poverty
And it‚Äôs hard to explain that when you're so narrow-minded, seeing the world with two eyes shut
And I realize that, you know, some people can't feel what they haven't seen
So, there's no point in me trying to explain my troubles, huh
It's not that I don't think that anyone cares
But, I think, like, it's up to me to fix or deal with them, you know?
I kinda look at everything, like, "Well, no matter what, I mean, it could be worse, you know?"
Like, okay, say, say if I lost a finger, I‚Äôd be like, "Well, I still have nine"
Or‚Äîor even, like, when someone broke into my house I felt like, "Well, I‚Äôm certain they needed it more than I did, these things are replaceable, you know?"
It kinda just helps with stress levels to think that way, you know?
Kinda like, uh, "It could be worse, oh, well"
Easier said than done, I'm sure, huh
But, failure?
Oh, man, failure, that took time to understand, you know?
Like, failure doesn‚Äôt mean defeat, more so, like, "Try again, shit‚Äîshit, try even harder"
Revise your steps and rewrite your future
Failure to me isn't, like, always a negative thing, more so, more so, like, just a way to relook at things

African Rambo with more ammo
Can't be escaped, I'm on every channel

What's wrong? What's wrong, Mr. Man?
Your eyes are low
And you're walking with both hands on your head
His response, he's on a clean, clean high
Both feet up on the ground
But his head's way, way, way in the sky

The Black Seminole, a head general
Distant connections, a large interval
A black man with mouths to feed
Embracing equality throughout greed

No time to joke around, the kid is now a man
And the silence is filled with remarkable sounds
This part I've seen in my dreams
Love is not a lie, it just feels like a Tarantino movie scene
