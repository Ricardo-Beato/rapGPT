4 ContributorsNana Lyrics
Good morning nana, what's for breakfast?
Orange juice, scrambled eggs and some jelly bread
An Oscar Mayer bacon, that's a king's meal
At least compared to my friends that are really fed
You really know how to kill it with a black skillet
Energized by your love and these cats feel it
Not to be rude but my dude want a plate of food
You never exclude, that puts you in a greater mood
To give one of my dudes a little something to eat
So they stomach won't growl when they up in the street
The sounds of a bear, but this time a year
It's kind of cold so we home and we upping the heat
Project radiator hissing like a rattle snake
I'm in the front room playing my favorite battle tape
You in the back room watching Barbany Jones
These white folks living good and we trying to be clones
The ones you work for out in Bensonhurst
After Howard Beach, now the tension is worse
Watching over they kids while they earn a wage
Making 'em lunch, reading 'em books, now turn the page
I was only 10, I was younger then
Guess it must have been hard for me to understand it
House keys hanging on a string from my neck
Had to let myself in, make myself a sandwich, damn
You might also like
Beginning and the end of me, before I can even see
The man that I wanted to be, is what you came to know
You taking every step with me, taught me to take the lead
That's why you trusting me, you gone get what you owe
We played in the spring and summer time, learned lessons in the fall
The world is winter, but you was never cold
More than a doer than a talker, but I still live by your words
One day it'll all register, you never get too old
We grow, things change, but you will never go

Happy Thanksgiving, sweet potato pies
They was try'na ketchup on it like a plate of fries
Come in dude for the recipe
Uncle Marvin on the couch watching the game next to me
Talking smack, messing with me like an evil twin
It's the Playoffs and we just try to see who's in
Dallas bout to do it yet again
Number 31 breaks a long run and the Eagles win
Thank God, dinner's ready, this stuff is terrific
Family eats, family talks but nothing specific
No religion, no politics
Pudgy lemon at the table doing a couple politrics
I'm a teen now, the streets are mean now
High praise for the waste, you cook and clean wow
Let it be known you get paid but you're not a maid
Nana's here, family's home and I'm not afraid, nah
Beginning and the end of me, before I can even see
The man that I wanted to be, is what you came to know
You taking every step with me, taught me to take the lead
That's why you trusting me, you gone get what you owe
We played in the spring and summer time, learned lessons in the fall
The world is winter, but you was never cold
More than a doer than a talker, but I still live by your words
One day it'll all register, you never get too old
We grow, things change, but you will never go

—  Boy, what you doing up this late? I know you excited about graduating tomorrow
— I don't know, I'm just up, thinking about everything
— This radio show I like is about to come on
— Radio show? What kind of radio show on at 2 o'clock in the morning?
— They call it the World's Famous Supreme Team show and it's about that timeEmbed
