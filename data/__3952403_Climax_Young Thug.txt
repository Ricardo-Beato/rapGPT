You said no interest (Tsh-tsh-ah)
Said you found a better climax (Tsh-tsh-ah)
You said he's swagged out (Tsh-tsh-ah), you leave (Tsh-tsh-tsh)
It's like a shot to the back (Tsh-tsh-ah)
Through the nose of a barrel (Tsh-tsh-tsh)
For you don't want to go (Tsh-tsh)
But leave, like it's nothing (Tsh-tsh-ah)
You said no interest, said you found a better climax
You said he's swagged out, you leave
It's like a shot to the back
Through the nose of a barrel
For you don't want to go
But leave, like it's nothing
(We got London On Da Track)

I just be watching my words (Words)
You say whatever the fuck (Fuck)
I think I take what I get (Get)
And say whatever they love (Love)
This might hurt for days
Now I can't find my way (Aye)
Sike, know I'm just playin'
Onto the next like I'm okay
Ayy, this a pimpin' can't you tell? (Tell)
She like, "No I can't, what the hell?" (Hell)
I done put little baby in a spell
Came out new hair, new nails
She take my heart then drive back
One, two, three, four, five, damn (Yeah)
Deletin' pictures on the 'Gram
You forgot who I am
From the frontseats to the nosebleeds
That's for actin' like you don't know me
Damn, my new bitch, she a trophy
And she love me for the old me
Yeah, the cold me, yeah, the old me (Old me, yeah)
She the homie, cop her a rollie (Rollie, yeah, yeah)

Hu-uh, hu-uh, she r-i-i-ide

Bitch it's pimpin' can't you tell? (Yeah)
This is pimpin', can't you tell? (Yeah)
This shit look fishy, I don't wanna see
Emergency, I'm tryna go to sleep
Money cut down a load of trees
Sauvage Dior, this ain't no Creed
My dog got a deal, he back on the street
This bitch is so real, she as bad as can be
I had bitches around they was backstabbing me
I went straight to the racks like a hemi in me
Good energy, I invest in my queen
I can ride on this hoe like a new 12 speed
My bitch, bad, tragedy
Bitch, bad, tragedy
