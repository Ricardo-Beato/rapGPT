7 ContributorsFuck With It Lyrics
Ya, know what I'm saying brody
I'ma take that shit
Yeah you know your lil bro gonna take that shit nigga

I'm just too bad to be shy
Dropped up out of school in sixth grade
Got money like six ways
Now I cooked so many babies I need my tubes tied
Drinking on that pink lemonade
My wrist servin' parade
Then tell her if she like money then tell her to fuck with me
Let me know if she like money so I can fuck with her
Yeah, I'm droppin' them bands every time I slut with her
I got to fuck with her, you got to fuck with her
Okay cool

I bout to sign her brother
Her little sister adorable
Thats a big dog, real talk and I'm gonna all in bout her
And she never ever got high but I'm dancing with the stars
And she know every time I walk past I'm shitting on her boy
Oh my God, OMG I think this girl in to me, so is he
No Homo but I love Alicia but I hate Keys
So when they come in I give them bitches out by the 10's
ESPN, Molli just my den, bitch I am winnin'
I ain't worried bout no sin
I know God went in
Real Street Nigga, buy a  into a
Thousands unrecorded fuck yo pen
You might also like
I'm just too bad to be shy
Dropped up out of school in sixth grade
Got money like six ways
Now I cooked so many babies I need my tubes tied
Drinking on that pink lemonade
My wrist servin' parade
Then tell her if she like money then tell her to fuck with me
Let me know if she like money so I can fuck with her
Yeah, I'm droppin' them bands every time I slut with her
I got to fuck with her, you got to fuck with her
Okay cool

I'm Zone 6 raised
And ever since 6th grade
I've been on a mission to get paid
R-6, DMG, used to pay 1-5 for a 50 now I got keys
Now I speak 5 different languages, even guapanese
You wanna bring, they come and get it, they 20 a piece
You wanna split it, I can't serve you that, that's what problems be
You ain't a boss nigga, stay the fuck from round street
I was workin' backwoods back in middle school
I kept fallin' off, I couldn't find my groove
Scooter ain't got no money nigga you a fool
Plus I'm too bad to be shy, I always act a fool
I'm just too bad to be shy
Dropped up out of school in sixth grade
Got money like six ways
Now I cooked so many babies I need my tubes tied
Drinking on that pink lemonade
My wrist servin' parade
Then tell her if she like money then tell her to fuck with me
Let me know if she like money so I can fuck with her
Yeah, I'm droppin' them bands every time I slut with her
I got to fuck with her, you got to fuck with her
Okay coolEmbed
