22 ContributorsAdam and Eve Lyrics
Okay, I'm hearing some big things about this guy Chief Otto
He hits the lotto all the time, but I hear that he doesn't want me to say Otto or lotto in the same sentence because he doesn't take any L's you know what I mean?
I don't really know what to tell you guys

I'm smoking on some very very sticky shit man
It's reeking out the pack it's on some stinky shit man
Pull up and beat my pistol how you beat your dick man
Hold on what I'm saying that's some tweaky shit man
I be on that be freaky shit man
Hopped on the beat and I'm freaking like I'm Adam
Ask God was I sinning he said yes
I'm like that was Eve that wasn't me right there

Hop out these hoes kitty, meow
Mike Jones these hoes be feeling me now
Ain't no frisking they ain't feeling me down
Like a poster they be peeling me down
If you ain't high how could you eat now?
I done ate fifty things I'm still eating now
A rich nigga that's really me now
Hoes say since I'm a king they want to be my queen now
If I miss bet you won't get the rebound
Since Cap died I'm a Margiela fiend now
I'm Cappin on these niggas and they say that he foul
Foul for what? 'Cuz we knocked your ass out of the bound?
You might also like
I'm smoking on some very very sticky shit man
It's reeking out the pack it's on some stinky shit man
Pull up and beat my pistol how you beat your dick man
Hold on what I'm saying that's some tweaky shit man
I be on that be freaky shit man
Hopped on the beat and I'm freaking like I'm Adam
Ask God was I sinning he said yes
I'm like that was Eve that wasn't me right there

I'm smoking on a very big ass joint
I'm glowing harder I kill your satellite dish TV networks while you watch ESPN
I'm ballin' on these bitches I don't need ESPN
I ain't gonna shake that nigga hand he thought he was my friend
I'm only friends with bands I ain't no damn friends with man
Pussy ass nigga I can smell from over here
That bitch give me top then she hit it over here
I've been cappin' and boolin' since they told me foe nem dead
Imma stack this cheese up  go to the next
Level with my bezel, blinging like a bitch

I'm smoking on some very very sticky shit man
It's reeking out the pack it's on some stinky shit man
Pull up and beat my pistol how you beat your dick man
Hold on what I'm saying that's some tweaky shit man
I be on that be freaky shit man
Hopped on the beat and I'm freaking like I'm Adam
Ask God was I sinning he said yes
I'm like that was Eve that wasn't me right there1Embed
