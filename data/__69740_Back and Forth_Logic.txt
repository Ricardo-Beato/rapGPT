34 ContributorsBack and Forth Lyrics
You hear that, Phil? You not going to sleep
Fuck outta my room, man!
(Cha)
Oh, I'll go for it
Yeah this is Logic on the beat, yo
Yeah uh

Let me kick rhymes, let me do it slow
Gotta get it every time you ain't fuckin' know
See I'm half white and half negro
So I guess that's why I got a big ego
I got double the talent so I guess I'm too nice
Tryna eat like two dykes 'cause I'm famished (I'm famished)
Better yet I'm in the depths of Hungary like Budapest
And even when I'm fed I'ma keep going 'til the death
Call me the collar bomba 'cause I'm blowing minds
Like Osama, that's word to Obama
So much action within my words, there ain't no time for drama
Bringing wisdom like Dalai Lama, you ain't heard?

My name is Castro
Hotter than taking shots of Tabasco
I'm the shit, never constipated I got mad flow
Have you wondering why the fuck did he go do that for?
I don't know even my homies say I'm an asshole
My style is so defined 'cause I'm the definition
Of truth you want proof well then you better listen
I'm never dissin' that's a waste of time
Why waste an amazing rhyme
On them when I can take it and make it mine
I'll make it fine, homie I don't need no one's help
I stay on dimes so you can call me Roosevelt
Yeah, my flow is presidential
I rip it acapella I don't need the instrumental
So try to sleep on me, I leave you like Tom in Seattle
My wordplay is too vicious homie
So you don't wanna scrabble, you don't wanna battle
My shit will leave you without a paddle
Now they all riding me somebody give me a saddle
You might also like
My wifey livin' like Oprah
Matter of fact Princess Diana
'Cause my first name is S-I-R
And I don't live like no bama
See I execute my emotion through perpetual grammar
'Cause my stamina colder than Canada
And hotter than Hades
I spit more than babies infected with rabies
They can't get over the fact
That I'm under their skin like scabies, what it do
