I'm yawning while I wake up to the early morning gunfire
Another day another scar to acquire
Jumped out my bed, tried to break my alarm
Took a shower, and then I strapped on my firearm
Grabbed my Pelle Pelle cause I wanna look fly when I die
But it ain't my turn to say goodbye
How do I know? Some people call it instinct
I like to call it my luck, who gives a fuck
I'm stuck, in this environment and can't depart from it
And if I try I always end up back where I started
Plan A, square 1, there's no escapin'
So I've come to realize my truth
Tryna live my full life before my time is through
Clocks tickin', so I don't got no time for you
As I head outside, amongst the rest of the animals
Is where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand still
It's sorta like a family bond
We gather up all the soldiers and form into an invincible
Swarm of kids, now it's on again
Drinking straight from the bottle warm gin dripping down my chin
For the crippled children, you can't win against 25 niggas bent up with mac 10 semi-automatics, fully-addicted crime addicts
So long as there is cash involved, I gotta have it
There's many different levels to the criminal mind
Either you in it for the money or you wasting your time

My destiny will be the death of me
Forever loving my peoples
Hustling, It's only right, nigga we struggling to survive
It's only crime that provides for me
So I resort to puffing dimes and dreaming of pushing a ride
Negative thoughts fill my brain but it's the projects to blame
Niggas forever getting loot while standing out in the rain
So when the sun shine, nigga will be writing a rhyme
And if a nigga owing, blood is how I'm taking mine
As I climb the ladder, of success with TEC's
Though I rather not have to watch my back get threat
But it's like that, so I adjust, fuck getting touched
Your man wasn't aware, that's why that nigga got bucked
I realize open my eyes once this shit got real
There's mad drama on the Hill when niggas getting blue steel
I love my niggas for that, we keep it real, get loot
And our identity is Timbs and army certified suits
Most def, my people hold me down whenever in beef
Talking all that bullshit but it's the gats that rules the streets
Survival of the fittest automatics recommended
Given a life sentence to crime until my life is ended

Niggas wanna point guns in my face, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
Niggas forever talking shit, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
Try to jam me on pack, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
Niggas running out their mouth, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
How we do it, how we do it
We taking ours in blood. (x2)
This city got me trapped like an animal with criminal thoughts
I can't seem to turn away from this unknown force
If only I can lay my hands on the source of my trouble
And maybe I can heal my scar before it bubble
It's like a plague, and there ain't no cure
We absorb this world's filth, therefore we're un-pure
My life is like a bad dream I can't seem to shake
Only my peoples who are equal understand or relate
The way we live is never planned, it just happened that way
So until tomorrow I'll just be surviving today
It's just another man, on this planet living for delf
Pops gone, I had to learn to be a man myself
But I, don't stress that
He did his dirt, now he pays back waiting in a federal laid back
Pops, times is different and things ain't the same
It's worse than ever, to get paid we do whatever
See some rather achieve goals and be a scholar
I rather get locked like you, earning a 6-digit dollar
Making the desert bird holler
Doing white collar crimes, but the fed time is hard to swallow
And digest so I protest the pen
I rather die before the jail cell sucks me in
And my peoples we all share the same thinking
We in synch, on the same tempo, making cowards run petro
Pull out the TEC, automatic metro
My shots chase you 'round corners
Leaving your family a bunch of mourners
And my all-around point as that
If you feel me you're guaranteed something you can feel back
Kid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me
You tried to blow me your weak side just showed me
Stepped out my door on 41st Side at 12,
Didn't see my crew around so I got bent for self
I had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9
It was a Friday night  had it bad one time
Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son
D's like "Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,"
So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking
Niggas be ass talking then convict them of extortion
Hold myself down the only way I know
Niggas pumping packs for free, in debt cause they owe
Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow
The maximum is death son you know how that go
Lye got me on point, paranoid for life
That's why I walk the street with heat especially at night
I represent the North side I hold the title with pride
And when its on, I use the infra-red for guide
Aim it at your temple, with no remorse and never sentimental
My crew is cold-hearted from all the foul shit we been through
Surviving shootouts, bullets hitting the fence sparking
Fuck my fingers, with guns niggas I'm marking til the blocks darkened
Doing my thing, let my gun clap
It's like that!9Embed
Yeah
Uh
Uh-huh (yeah)
(Yeah)

We get that paper baby boy, it's easy
You want to be who? You can't be me
Shorty gave me that ass on GP
I'm rolling in a G-500 or the Porsche, roof open
And I know that you're hoping that I fall real soon
But I ain't going nowhere, hate to bust your balloon
And there ain't that much room for all us
Limited space, the game like a tour bus
I won't break, I just take, take and take
Rape and rape, the game 'til there's no more cake
Snitch ass niggas giving up identities
Ain't my fault they making pennies
They soft like ice cream, sweeter than Ben & Jerry's
Like Hoffa, leave him nowhere to be found, but buried
The gun won't fail me, the money won't leave me
Stop scheming on me, baby, cause it ain't that easy
Niggas leave prints cause their palms so greasy
Their mind read easy, I see right through 'em
The AK'll do 'em, like nobody do 'em, don't stop

Cause it about to get hectic
Cause we about to get hectic

The streets got a nigga stressed out of type, bugging
I'm struggling, digging my ways out of holes by hustling
So, what's a day's function? Pain reliever? Fever inducer?
And held a chocolate Thai Buddha, now I'm looser
I fantasize about this crew I took last week
And yo, that's me at the sympathy, to pass me
But I was brought to reality, a rude awakening
My man just got taken, it's mad time he's facing
Jetted upstairs, got a call from my cousin
Back in Brooklyn, only fifteen the kid is bugging
Told me about the spot that he hit that had a drop on the spot
But his man almost got shot
Now it's the talk of the block cause he's dead and in the cab
The Troy Ave laughed, then he started tumble (?)
Counted the cash, but one nigga tried to stash
Who wet the quills? niggas was up in his ass
As he kicked it, by the little story that he told
I was fickled in his hold, then off the old gold
Till I got to be on the other line, put him on hold
It was my shorty, told her call me back, kid you're too old
It was a quarter to one, Friday night
Loaded up my guns to blow the horns, called up my son
Son, you come through I got a proposition for you
Keep it on the low so the plan won't spoil
My crew's loyal, they came over in a minute
To kick it 'bout this nigga, who think he getting bigger
Pumping on our side, don't even know him from a hole
In the wall, tonight's going to be his downfall
So fuck him and everything he stand for
About this time, he be on the corner
Slinging with a crackhead, kept me bringing
Sales to the building, a bunch of bitches fiending
I figure we could get the goods, kill the nigga
And be it that we live right next to the river
We can catch him off guard, throw him in the water
Before the coastguards come on God this shit ain't hard
But think, the one you give a couple up's your fate
And keep your eyes open for the jakes, the snakes and the snitches
The ones you see, the nigga with the riches
Acting like a little bunch of bitches
Pointing me out in pictures
The Five-O's like "you know who is this"
It's Havoc, you better recognise it, realise

Shouting why I motherfucking blasted
Hectic, I can't believe the shit beneath my eyes
I cannot think straight, or I might get hypnotised
I don't stress shit, cause I'm out to get mines
So when you step to me, you will be surprised
The type of shit I kick is so you're leaking in the skies
So when you say the Mobb Deep time is a lie
You'll be swimming in a puddle of Death, and that's no threat
Hectic, hectic, hectic, hectic

When things get real, it ain't what you expected
Me and my peoples is known to get hectic
Only to wreck shit, many slugs in all directions
Make them see the light when my shots make connections
Niggas get they face split in sections
Shook using ice grill looks for they protection
We absorb everything you fear
And indulge in a crime-filled atmosphere
This shit ain't nothing new, it's only things that we used to
We used to stick niggas on the F through to the E train
When it's time to recruit, I humble on the D train
See my man D only to purchase my dope thang
Word to my unborn seed
A nigga got to make loot to support greed
On the wild side of the fence, the shit is on the verge of explosion
It's so cold you might get frozen
If you leave yourself vulnerable, in time lapsing
Fools collapsing, and caught up in gun clapping
Don't matter who you are, if you know many faces
I don't discriminate, my shots bleed all races
And cultures, we sort of like vultures
Eating your insides like ulcers
And pause niggas pulses, like

Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run
For a body - now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'mma put you on
It's all messed up somebody snitchin on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now just stay low
Once in a blue I check to see how you're doin
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin to find who they lookin for but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers, to get they thug on but oh well
Son they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
Oh you heard who did what, no I don't know who did shit!
So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin crazy
From windows, I see lights flashin and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures - you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up your sheet so everybody's pointin fingers
And lyin, aiyyo son, the pressure's risin

Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide somewhere along the lines your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminisce on how I used to pick you up in the Ac
Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin who snitched it got me losin lots of sleep
At night, you know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops cause that shit ain't right
Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn - why the situation go down like dat?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a - couple of years 'fore we see you around
Butt 'til then maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin for someone to blame
They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out, cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver - me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em

With the pressure and mixed up is how I feel
I walk the streets with a fuck you attitude
And when it comes to my peoples, you ain't half as rude
Follow the crowd or be a leader, take your pick
Now I'm smokin' Buddha, Phillie blunt style
A frustrated and confused young juvenile
Singin' the project blues, so I choose
To take a piece of the action
But my sober state of mind won't let it happen
So 24/7 is the number one stresser

Most don't understand how it is
In the world of today growin' up as a young black teen
I used to dream, of bein' an architect
Easier said than done, believe me it's hard to get
Out of the projects, without forgettin' where you came from
My parents told me from day one
Finish school and avoid all obstacles
But my environment makes it so impossible
For instance, build a strong social life (Uh-huh)
Without messin' up, still tryin' to live right
Like in junior high, I used to wonder why
Certain females went out with certain guys

Then one day, it all dawned on me, yo
You gotta be down and have it goin' on, see?
I wasn't down with the mainstream or should I say their team, huh
Now I'm gettin' steam
Gotta find a way to get accepted by my peers
So now I'm sippin' on beers
Buyin' new gear, nothin' but the best
Forget Levi's, strictly Polo and Guess
But how would I make the cash?
It gotta be easy and it gotta be fast
Thinkin' to myself "Does that make me lesser?"
Just, dealin' with the peer pressure

Around my way there's a kid that most don't understand
How he lives, is it negative or positive?
He has a grade A average
But when he's on the streets with his friends, he's a savage
A freshman in high school, daily attendant
He never got in trouble, never did he get suspended
Good little Kenny, who would believe?
He dropped out of school to start to smoke weed
I saw the signs but I didn't pay attention
Because he got offended every time that I would mention
The drinkin', the smokin', the low school grades
And sleepin' in class, laid back with his black shades
Nowadays, you catch Kenny hangin' in the hallways
With his crew, findin' more ways
To break out of school and hit the block and get buckwild
Stay out of the way of a mad child
'Cause he's a product of hell
Kenny never fell but he's gonna fall overall
So let's take a trip to the ghetto
Where Kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man, so
He pulled the trigger and the suicide note read:
"I'm glad it's finally over and I'm finally dead
And no more do I have to feel lesser
Or deal with the peer pressure"

Sometimes you know you gotta give back to the community
Gotta show these motherfuckers how to wipe them thangs off y'know?
Teach 'em a little somethin

Pick you up, off your feet like a forklift, but instead it's the four-fifth
Ragu red, your brain leakin them sauces
Like an, autopsy leavin 'em nauseous, when I aim at your bosses
Put a pep in that bop that you walk with
While my tec spittin at reinforcements
I could never be a victim of the streets: I endorsed it
Spittin that real, y'all cowards just coughed it
Like fluids in my lungs, motherfucker I'm more sick
You turn them hoes off, I put 'em on so they on this
You talk game grammar school, mines metamorphic
Dem fools ain't killin nuttin in the club, they all bent
My intent is to sober that ass up, leave 'em all drenched
See what a few cups of liquor can offset
Got a little paper, I ain't stressin, they all press
Ain't sellin records, they come at me for more press
When they realize it's real them dudes out coppin more vests
Better learn how to

Wipe, them guns off, get that money money
Wipe, a nigga smile, off ain't nuttin funny
Show, you motherfuckers, just how hungry you
Get, when your feet are touchin (kid a nigga hungry / yeah, he one of ours) *

Often above them cowards and them so called thugs
When we come through respect is there, cause we demand it
Know the mobb is in the building, we officially landed
Keep your eyes on the man with the hammers, they can't stand us
Try to raid us the faggots snitchin' and got the cameras
Cock the cannons but shorty just keep dancin' cuz it might

Gettin' our shine on, I think it's due for a storm, hurricane Mobb
Rain on your parade and you can thank god

Really it wasn't called for, and you don't want it
To call for it, don't play with my gun, it go off
Inside of your head, oops, niggas be dead

Out there like the concord
I show you how to get murdered, and the cops never catch on
I show you how to do songs, then after that
Show you how to do them contracts and get yours


We ain't finished yet c'mon baby bring it back c'mon
You know that thing in the stash box
Ready to pop bast in the spot you stunt, you know we gon lock ass

Flood the block with nothin but that gangsta shit
Y'all dead on that, now take ya miss, bitch
It's plain to see, that you could never snake me
I never let the grass grow past my Nikes

Yo, my life story - based on a true story
We popped MAC's all growin' up, while y'all played story
We were playin' hide the cracks, while y'all played tag
I was a young gun learin' how to fight back
A 'lil rock head fuck, who neva learned shit
Who picked up a habit for the block life kid
A few cases, sit on the bench, make conversation
Yo, there's party tonight, get the razors
"Dawg, but it's all goin' overboard"
I told 'em - "Dang god you tryin' to take a nigga arm"
We're like a brick, when we come smashin' through
A-C-D, M-O-B, nigga fuck it's you
We're straight thugs over here bo', what the deal y'all?
Up in the staircase, post-up, long chrome
With the .4 long, closest I could reach my arm
Who wanna play target, check out the name of the song
It goes...

Block - Life, what's the matter with your thugs
Block - Life, what's the matter with y'all's guns
Block - Life, everybody can't be on top
The Block - Life, can't stop, won't stop

Comin' up, I was a fuck up, burnin' blunts up
Playin' dice with the older crowd, puttin' dubs up
Some kids was into sports, I was into doe
You was mad cause you felt all I was stress
Cause the money was slow
Fractured my hand, I'm stashin' 'em
Before I'm bagged wit 'em, plus my son got the Magnum
Wyldin' out in these young gun days, young love days
New to the game, but was curious about the fees
And them thick rope chains, I'm stuck on how
Niggas blew up off cocaine, and opened wide
In '88, when I first heard Jane, we got all the --
But the hood still remains the same
Old fiends, same drugs, new thugs
Same slugs, new crews with MAC's
With thoughts to push it back, straight like that
Actin' up off Cognac, come through
Act hostile, but lay you flat, in the --

We off the hook as the jook style
Years went by pages turned onto calendar
Trade in my Tray .8, copped the .40 Caliber
Kept it on me in school, got shorty cuttin' out Algebra
Niggas always seemed cool, others tryna to challenge us
Retaliation, got me trapped with false accusation
Tossed cracks & graders, when the ambs' invaded, madd congregation

Yea we is rich thugs, that shoot up clubs
Make albums that click more than little drugs
Infamous, cause, or if you a blood

It was the freak in me, actually crossed my mind frequently
Finally and once again we bumped heads
A stank gesture suggested that I was dead
Like a crack-head, didn't even give a nigga rib
But fuck it, what can I say? I tried to put my little bid
And kept living, nigga move on, you a man
No matter what it take we're gonna hold the upper hand
Shuffling beats, six years later son it was done
The Infamous, Mobb Deep left you stuck off the Shook Ones
And then the funniest thing after a show backstage
I peeped chick who didn't give me play back in the day
It was all love, hold no grudge, gave her a hug
What's the drilly baby? She was like "you", nah what's up?
You know me, doing my thing tryna live
Asked if I was busy, could I chill with her in her crib
No days, but we can chill up in the Ramada
Payback is a bitch, once I get in there I got her
In the telly, E&J dick popped the cherry
Left the little hoe with no dough and got jetty
Bless the god boo, you know how we do, it's self-explainable
Un-domesticatable, but highly we capable
The turntables beat you in your own game, enough said
Another victim caught up in fame's web
Young love, young love2Embed
God damn, nigga left bleeding with his head in his hands
Wishing that he never crossed fam
And but still niggas like that get left slain
Found days later on the ave in a can
We used to dance all night my main man
We used to give each other pounds wit da webs of our hands
Its a click thing, yall niggas wouldn't understand
We used to get off loose cracks and bag grams
Hold each other down, duckin the blue van
The d's on the roof, plus the 6-Y cab
Who'd ever thought u was a snake in the grass
One of my stash whip and keys to my lab
You wanted me shot dead, some things you can't have
I pulled out the 8, when you almost got stabbed
We followed the same path, cryed and shared laughs
Now I can't wait, for the day to see your bloodbath
Plug dat, fill you up wit slugs rat take that...

They never think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan

That MOB nigga I think he platinum
Pulled to the next corner hopped out and asked them
If they knew directions to rhode island
We was in East New York, they thought I was wildin
Its a click thing they wouldn't understand
Meanwhile I looks to my left and see some niggas frownin
As if they was go flip now peep this
I'm writin shorties math on the trunk of the Six
The bitch wanna blow dick cause its deep dish
These niggas wanna twist me because of my necklace
I'm calm though you know I got the stash in the whip
I clap though, these niggas better blast very quick
They coming towards me, I sat in the passenger seat
Reached underneath, grabbed the big Fifth
Acting like I'm not knowing whats happenin
I'm still havin conversation with these hens
I'm bout to have a confratation with these mens
I know I'm going home wit my chain and my head
Yall won't dead me, I sleep in my own bed (pop pop pop pop pop)

When we beefin' we ain't speakin', feels like I'm dyin' inside
But it's alright
Forget the trials and tribulations you been through in your life
Come to me runnin', trust me baby, I make it right

You with me lil' mama, let's breeze lil' mama
We start with a lil' bit and take it to a lotta that
Love gettin' hotter, you can if you wanna
Have it all it's yours, just ask and you got it
The trillion cuts, the Audi and Porsche trucks
I do these things for you cuz you my dunn
Girl, feel special cause I don't spend
Nuttin' but time with certain other broads I rip
You belong in minks, bracelets and rings
Not handcuffs forget about that lock and chain
And just leave lil' mama, this P, lil' mama
I ain't them, I'm me, lil' mama
My baby, you crazy and I'm hooked
Your body right, your smile light up the room

When we first met on Saks Fifth, knew that you was that chick
Rollie sayin' holla at her, whip sayin' girl get in
Remind me of a women that, I can have without the stress
Asked if she had a man, couldn't tell if no or yes
Hell, I jus dipped her number, talked more
When I hit you one conversation, I knew that she had trust issues
Who the hell would do that, man cheated on her twice
Last one before that, found out homie had a wife
Looked so secure, but yet so delicate
Can't come back in the crib without a search for evidence
Baby girl, I ain't here to hurt you, here to protect and serve you
Ain't your fool model them other dudes don't deserve you
What you tryin' to do, scare me off and leave you low
Funny how you let it ring and never answer your phone
The accuser got me curious, I asked who it was
He like the "sold-a-soul" man, who the fuck you cuz?
I'm out...

Everytime I hurt you
It's because of what someone else has done to me
And I know its not really fair
Though I just can't trust you
Cause I just got outta something, I'm not runnin' (runnin', runnin')
Boy you know that I'm running scared
You treat me so good
That's its just too good to be true
And I don't think that I really deserve
To be treated like a woman should
Cause I been so hurtin' the past, I'm still carryin' bags

This is my way to live (it's alright)
But it's just the way it is (it's alright)
You got to understand (it's alright)

It seems like, ever since a nigga became multi
Every women on planet Earth got their eyes
On the kid; they all wanna touch
On a nigga skin, they love me so much
They all got P on they brain
At the show, do anything to get backstage
Just so they can hug 50 and kiss on Banks
After we all get a turn, the broads said "Thanks"
Shit, just last month a nigga wasn't shit
Now I finger pop dimes, with diamonds on my fists
Niggas bringing me they girl like, "You can have my bitch
Just help me get down with the G-Unit!"
Man, little groupies, they make me sick
You ain't getting in the after party unless you're a chick
And bitch, you ain't getting in the hotel, unless we grip
And you're gonna look fine, plus suck a mean dick

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before
Turn around, yeah I know, I recognize that ass

No games, baby girl, gotta do the damn thing
Let me see you back it up 'til you pull a hamstring
Face fuck, girl go for broke
So hard, leave stretch marks up in her throat
Then Havoc on the floor
I don't need to get her number, she'll be at the next show
Half-ass dress, smelling like sex
Dried up nutt on her neck
They don't call us the Massacre tour for nothing
We destroy good girls; send them home, pussy soft from fucking
Catch 'em in the morning in somebody white tee
And that's the kind of bitch that you call wifey
She'll do it anywhere from the telly to the tour bus
Here's the hotline bitch, call us

Daydreamin' of dirt bikes, and four wheelers
Shoppin' sprees at the diamond dealer
Hats and jackets, shirts, pants and sneakers
That brand new car smell, we schemin'
Daydreamin' of penthouses in L.A
The illest yachts, the hottest broads they make
Can't wait 'til it's my turn to get dough
So I don't gotta fuckin' daydream no more

Coming up we ain't have much, a lot of canned food
Cereal in the white box, with powdered milk too
My moms couldn't buy me the shoes I want
We put lay-away on shit that only cost a few bucks
At school, they had Shell Toes, I had Olympians
With the weak ass velcro, looking ridiculous
I knew, way back then, we had to step it up
Cause waiting for the bus in the snow wasn't us
Me and Hav' took the train from Manhattan to Coney
Every day and night, just so we can get our songs done
We had guns, weed, and a couple of fourties
If we got lucky on the way, we could jook someone
We used to watch Video Music Box
And pray maybe one day, we could get a shot
Outside, my niggas had all that shit you see on TV
From money that they made off the block

Or will I have to get at niggas cause they sayin' I changed
Will everybody wanna ball, be my friend and leech
When niggas put me to the test, have me clapping the heat
I used to think bein' rich, ain't all that bad
A far cry from what a dream, was all I had
Do I got the right team, or they riding for cash
Would they jump in front of me, when them cameras flash
Is the 'pop police, gon' be up my ass

Holes in my sneakers and shirt
I turned 13, now lil' niggas selling coke
50 for 11's, yeah, I copped 'em for them hoes
But you left without warning, I guess it was a lesson
Had you but you showed me no affection
Got withdrawals, took you to the malls
The more I got of you, the more I got spoiled
Now my toes curl, let's have a baby boy or girl
Had you in Switzerland, half across the world
You a good investment and you, can you double?
Came back around when I bubbled
Now I'm in trouble, took the wrong turn
Let my homie borrow you, now he won't pick up his phone

For a bitch again, I'd put that on my organs
Got these other niggas jealous cause you all over me

You know Sometimes people can be awfully cruel
If you happen to care for somebody more than yourself
They consider you a fool
They mistake love for weakness and play on your mind
And at your expense they amuse themself just to pass the time

Eh-huh, eh-huh, we don't love 'em, yea, yo

Uh-huh, yea

The bitch don't want to feel love, she want to feel sleazy
Bitch wanna have fun, yo ass is dough
That's why she ride with us to all the weekend shows
When I have first met the ho, she was real timid
She ain't know if it was aiight for her to live it
DAMN! look at her now, with many Pastel, Polo skirts
You see it all when she sit down
She keep it real easy for me to be in and out
All I gotta do is open 'em legs and bang it out
Without the struggle, or gettin' them panties off
Fuck her like I'm tryin' to kill her
Then I tell her "get lost"

Is it true what the good book say
Concerning the Judgement Day?
If I don't kneel down and pray
Will I be a sinner for—

Yeah, homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good
Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood

Now if you followed my footsteps and walked in my shoes
You wouldn't go against me cause you know you would lose
It's been a long time coming, I done paid my dues
Now every time I turn around, it's like I'm back in the news
I know a lotta niggas want me wearing cement shoes
And Uncle Tom niggas wanna see me locked up too
Around the same time KRS was writing Black Cop
I was busy tryna pump cracks in the back blocks
Popping shit to my homies about how my gat pop
Got rid of that chrome thing and got a black Glock
P-90 held ten but I had six shots
I used to walk around with it and risk gettin' knocked
I bought a fresh box of bullets from Old Man Sam
Wanted to shoot a nigga so bad, it was itching my hand
Some shot it out with me, and some of 'em ran
And some of the gats worked good and some of 'em jammed

Now if you take a good look and look into my face
A nigga wouldn't even dare to violate my space
Son, I did so much dirt, I'm tryna clean my slate
And ate so many niggas' food and now they want mines ate
The dogs bark when I walk and sense the souls I took
Moms pray for me with her right hand on the good book
Saw shots fly by me, know I should've been dripping
The pulp fiction musta been God's divine intervention
Wouldn't thought then from that I've learned my lesson
And clean my act up and go straight to confession
Uncle Lyle got knocked, the Feds hit him with seven
And left me with the 50 cal. and a MAC-11
Stuck everything from everything, from heads to the workers
And had half the hood damn near wanting to murk us
Found myself asking God, "What the fuck is my purpose?"
You go to heaven, know I'm foul but put a good word in

Tell (the boss man) we got beef
And tell (his only son) I'ma see him when I see him
And when I see him, I'ma (beat him like the movie)
For leaving us out to dry in straight poverty
For not showing me no signs they watching over me
Look, we a new breed in 2006
We don't give a fuck about that (religious bullshit)
Nigga show me where the cash at, the nice whips
With the three car garage to fit them shits
Man my life is painful, you pray to angels
I'm praying to myself hoping I ain't gotta spank you
My bullets'll shank you
And when my gun start cutting, ain't nobody gon' save you
In the Bible times, they ain't had to deal with the shit
We been dealing with, these survival times

I'm hot-blooded, don't have me with the snub
All at you with the bullets that spray pellets, you fucked
And I'm back up on shorty with the hourglass cut
We got mountains and we gon' have a smokefest son
C'mon, feel like Vegas, we bringin home used paper
Ain't it amazin I'll stretch how we keep bangin
We got thousands to spend on them drinks gangsta
Queensbridge, Mobb Deep like terrorists
We come through, blow shit up, America's
Nightmares right here live in the flesh
Our blood and bone be sittin in Ferraris and better
We out in L.A. we drive our own cars, they not renters
And take flights back home to hop up in some next shit
While you tryin to get your hand on some cash
We never gotta touch money again, we got plas-tic


Feel that nigga, yeah
Okay yo, aiyyo
Aiyyo we ain't gotta lay, we can bang it out neighbor
Shit, 'til them fuckin flamers empty out player
Cause boy I thought you knew, don't confuse me with the music
I'm on loadin nines up, ridin up, shootin it
I'm hotter than the corner on the ave out in Newark
I'm grimy, you find me where the loot is with Lugers
The bodies, the hotties, the hustlers and the shooters
With dudes that'll cut ya, that's what eatin your food is
Fools know the rules pull out your tools better buck it
Cause niggas be flaggin and braggin when they cut up your nugget
Knee deep in the grind like "fuck it"
We gotta keep it real son that's only how the people gon' love it
And learn to respect the Infamous to the death kid
We on another level, yeah we really on some next shit
Got the techs spittin and makin more connections
Makin more cash and blastin more weapons

And here we go again
Y'all callin in reinforcements
The Mobb come through, stop up the shit
P'll come through and shot up your vest
Shoot at your head, not-a-leg eh?
Nigga I will kill your bitch
Then fuck her and make you watch
We do thangs, like raid spots
Probably catch you on the Hummer, just give you my Glock
(Here) Or most likely in the club, we gon' give you them knots
This is what gangsters dance to, or turn to a thug party
Once we step foot in the bitch, it's on again
Outside we got them boxy trucks
Hoes wanna jump, cause of that Benz emblem
The ho say she wanna ride in the shit with the horse logo
I got her out of her panties and boom boom
And I done left bitches out in the boonies
Frontin on that pussy, leave bodies wherever
Niggas tryin to kill me?

Yo, we livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit - nigga we still alive
We livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fittest nigga, and we still alive
We livin this 'til the day that we die

Went from, ridin these trains to coppin expensive cars
And even so, all this shit don't make me better than y'all
It only means that I work harder than the average nigga
Never sat around for handouts, I watched and observed
Then quickly rubbed my eyes, if my vision got blurred
I coulda sold drugs (yea yea) 'til I got bagged and jailed
Out of sight, out of mind, niggas locked feel me like braille
(Feel me) While everybody was chillin'
I was broke like a motherfucker, loyal to my vision
Knowin' that I'd be on top or somewhere close to it
Nigga, my livin' quarters'll be the thing to prove it
And vowed once I got there to never ever lose it
Let my head, get big and slack off on my music
I'm the illest

Yo, you know you ill when you can kill two birds (yea)
With one stone alone and slowly emerge

Won't catch me with the police without cuffs
Can't press me into no threatenin position
Probably spot me, steppin out the tree spot tough
Catch P fixin his pants, it's cause of his gun
You see the God, big ol' chains, but can't stick him
Cause they know I shoot niggas like Slick Rick and them
Source at the thug events, y'know we hittin them
Caught him spendin fake hundreds at the bar, we was gettin them
Drugs in my system, all types of shit
Keeps me where I wanna be, don't get me started on that
Just peep how aggressive my niggas is with this
And check how we set up shop to get our chips
Niggas study our verse like college kids (word)

For anything worth somethin, we beat 'em out of that
But fuck all that, we grown men, we need Porsches
We need Porsche endorsements and more shit

I don't need to diss rappers for recognition
You better check the files: Infamous, Hell on Earth, Murda Muzik
You can't be SE-RIOUS
We created this drama shit, we set the trend
We taught you niggas bout diamonds and guns
And numerous ways we choose to earn funds
We veterans, we got a decade of albums
Niggas done came and went, and we still poppin
Our name is carved in stone
Even the new blood know, we ain't no joke so

Let us solidify this - what's that?
We been solidified this - but of course!
Lot of new rappers and young kids - uh-huh
They all love +The Infamous+ - but of course!
We been for this music Dunn - c'mon man!
Who do it better than us? - c'mon man!
Who continue to bang and bump? That's right

I ride around the crib 'fore I get out twice
Without the headlights, case niggas know my whereabouts
Wanna, snuff me out, I ain't finished with life
I'ma, thug it out, front you payin the price
And I'm a nigga who can roll the dice, put up the crib
Won't sweat if I lose, bet your ass won't live
To collect this splurge of mines, never that
I'm a sore loser the (?), reverse with hammers
Hit your mans up if they press the issue
Some dead, the other half crippled, and I'm a monster with led
Lodge a slug in your abdomen, puts in the 7
Knowin in the stash box a rapper's best friend
Get it twisted and you WILL get twisted with chrome biscuits
Make no difference my nigga, we handle business
So please with the questions they right in, front of your face
Homey stunt he gettin to' from the gate, so


Nigga that you used to click with turned on you
Idiots you used to rap with hatin on you
Did you really get juxed for half a mill' in jewels
At the video shoot? I tell you this boo-boo:
My stick-o's still my stick-o
My stick man be my stick man 'til the tombstone (mmm, mmm)
You got rhymes? You got stomach for the Mobb?
You got stomach for P? I get my rocks off
Believe nothin that you hear and only half of what you see
Niggas never cooked in the kitchen and never clapped heat
Niggas wanna be thugs but on the inside so sweet
Niggas butchers on they records, but they never handle beef
Know nothin bout golden seal, seein your P.O
Gave a dirty urine now you're snuffin a C.O
Fuckin right, I'm a man of the people but I will kill you
If you cock-blockin the paper the shit'll get real dude (so)

I ain't a sucka ass nigga
I don't talk on the pillow
Like most of these faggot ass niggas
Write a rap, make a beat
Occasional beef, no doubt, I'mma squeeze that trigga
Now P', that's my doggy, got drama I'm co-signin'
The new times, shovin' a fork in your nose linin'
In no time, when you catch the gaurd nappin'
Thats a dog standin' next to him
Get shot and cut your frag in
I'm a bastard, from the cradle to the casket
Leave a bitch stuck like traffic
When I come through, king me and this mine's
Got a problem? See me and step aside
Beef never let it slide, I forever for ride
Always analyze a nigga when he cut his eyes
Not for nuttin' though these slugs love a tough guy
Nigga's wann' brawl, I'll be much obliged
Chorus (X2): Havoc (Prodigy)
Watch that nigga (Better watch that nigga)
Watch that bitch (Better watch that bitch)
Watch my clique (Better watch my clique)

No matter if a dime bitch, my nigga bitch ain't fuckin her
Loyalty to the click, forever Mobb 'til I die BITCH

Take your bitch like, Tony Montana or Goldie

You can feel me if you don't, you don't
I'll feed you to the dogs like a bitch I boned
My only concern is for the cash I gross
A nigga more deadly up against the ropes
Problem dead on tacking tours to throats
Eyes, ears open you can try to get close
Approach me then
Get on the floor soldier like you owe me ten
Spread it, never say it
Action speaks louder than words
Get bodied because you doubted the word
Never fucked your bird, stop askin her
It's not that serious, keep backin up
She'll get curious, and delirious
Send that bitch home on her period
To stop Havoc got to kill me bro
These cats listening but don't hear me bro

Pull strings have you gettin clapped and things
My gat is freaky to lick more than any shorty's tongue ring
Any nigga threatenin my life's a done deal
Watch the bitch get revealed then she snitch and squeal
Blow a nigga have em leakin to the court of appeal
Searchin for Hav is like a search through fog
How you like to make a last pit stop at the morgue

When I surface, if not chips, the vengeance the purpose
On your team I'll pull the curtain, a beautiful hurtin'
'Til my eyes see the blood, that mean the creep start workin'
Niggas never learnin', let they eyes keep lurkin'
Have ya janitor pumpin' your X5 murkin'
Skid marks the street, heart skips a beat
Beef? Nigga, overcook that meat!
Get no sleep, only rest is in between the blink
My life story was written in blood, permanent ink
Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that 'cause forever I be needin' 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes never repeatin' 'em
Some love me, some hate me, bitches in the head beatin' 'em
Niggas wanna ride by the crib all slow
We clap, motherfucker! Want a real rap show?
Fiends are rushin' when the MAC blow, dead in my castle
And in the blink, watch how quick life pass you

What's wrong with motherfuckers? When will they ever learn?

Stop niggas from frontin', leave 'em real fucked up
I drop niggas thats runnin', shoot 'em in they back dun
Coward ass nigga poppin' all that shit

And let a nigga find out where you live at
And then blow that mothafuckin' piece of shit off the map
Verse 3 (Prodigy)
Whattup son, dun, surprise nigga, thats how we pop up on 'em
You off point you die in your sleep, thats the moral

And it's a cold world, your man don't understand your pain
And I know you gettin tired of the same ol' same
He expect to keep you locked with that five karat ring?
Let's cop that old real while 112 sing

Anything you want, and anything you need
Just pick up the phone, and call me
Oooh anything, anything you want (anything you want)
And anything you need
Ooooh.. I'll come running!
So many things that I wanna do
Wanna kiss, wanna touch, wanna taste, never teasing you
Oooh baby, cause I only wanna be with you; girl you know
Anything that you need, I got it
Million dollar shopping spree, I got it
Anything that you want, I got it
You know, I got it, ask me, I got it

So many things that I wanna do
Wanna kiss, wanna touch, wanna taste, never teasing you
Oooh baby, cause I only wanna be with you; girl you know

Yo, It's like this man, It's real simple

If my nigga was my nigga like I thought he was
Would he have snitched, hung me out the dry to fuck?
Guess you don't know a nigga 'till you catch a case with 'em
It ain't all gravy just because you make cake with 'em
It's real, niggas scared to death of state prison
To the end when a nigga get caught start snitchin'
Imagine the eyes of a nigga that you knew
For about 20 joints with the nerve to point
Hurt worser than that physical pain
You fetish nigga roll with the sorry fuck, now he switchin' to lame
Niggas in the box could relate to my pain
All I got is my word and I'mma get you thats my word
Through family friends or even fuckin' your bird
Fuck it anything long as your death occur
Whatever happened to death before dishonor?
It's time for your end and it's my honor

(Kill that nigga)
Never wish death, only if I have to, if it's my last option left
(Kill that nigga)
Should've kept your mouth tight he's losin' his life
Be locked up or sending out kites

Ay yo this nigga runnin' 'round runnin' his mouth speakin' on the wrong shit

Creep on they talk show ass
Rap asses get shot in they throat, speak on that
Girlie mouth nigga you worse than a bitch
I done shot niggas for you, put my life at risk
How you gonna go behind me and knife my back?
Must be insane and I got a cure for that
My hammer will knock sense in the nigga real quick
Nail a nigga tongue with the four fifth
Nigga you in violation of that code of silence
Niggas like you get real niggas indicted!
We can't have that! Kidnap that bitch!
Torture and torment that snitch!
We gotta make examples out these hummingbird fucks
Matter fact pull 'em out the trunk, I'm bout to
Chorus (repeat 2x)
Never wish death
Kill that nigga (3x)
I'm sendin' out kites
Kill that nigga (4x)2Embed

So niggas get money bounce from the hood you shitted
So bitches fuck niggas, they man best dog

You gotta watch those broads
To die over that is totally against the grain and against street laws
I respect paper and every minute thats spent gettin that shit

Some things when I look how they never gonna change
It ain't a thing, niggas wild, then I'm cockin' that thing
Cuz you know with every action there's a reaction
And there's no known cure when I'm sick with the clappin'
How many times it have to happen
Niggas talkin' like they generals but just mere captains
The streets there's rules, slugs hit 'em with infractions
And then there's Hollywood if you want some fuckin' acting
You got these niggas out mis-representin' they hood
Give 'em heart now they icin', I'm like nigga what's good?
Cuz you know how I get with these MACs and these techs
Blaze 'em down gives a fuck about the next nigga rep
Play around find yourself getting' cheated by death
Man gone and believe me dog it happened to the best

Now you got me on the phone, straight talkin' to the cops
Tryna verify your government, they got you now, they lovin' it
They wanna hang that ass, couldn't get you in the past
Though I can't say your prime, you was still young at the time
Did a lot of older things, you was ahead of your time
Never told you to slow down, Residual Crown Heights was wild
All I could say was be careful, give you a dap then bounce
Shit that you went through, watched the drama amount
Gave a fuck long as you wasn't part of the body count
Now I feel guilty, half the blame for your incarceration
Should've intervened when you first started catching cases
Fuck it, it's done, now you in there

Just so you can live and keep your little cosmetics
And that five years was worth the little dough we made
Out of sight, out of mind, naw dawg, it's not me
I miss you, you on my mind daily
Even though I scribe to a nigga, really, you feel me
Trying to get my shit together, so you could be proud
When you touch down, We got businesses to run now
Peep it back how we used to run up in a nigga's house
On some petty crime shit, boy we was not playin'
On occassion, I still check ya brotha 'tll the end
Black, and Bone crazy ass
Reading ya letters, I see you ain't lose ya sense of humour
Talkin' to you on the phone made my day cooler
Tellin' me, how you duff the COs out
You need to bring your black ass home and cut that bullshit out

Wealth, health, and happiness nigga
Will Keep me from runnin' 'round clappin' these niggas
Sometimes you gotta just handle your business
Fuck it, it's on me, rounds of shots for niggas
Punk, I wake up everyday to cathedral ceilings
Jumpin' out my bed, wall to wall marble and pillars
Livin' like the pharaoah Tut, I'm blessed with life
So I breathe deep and give praise to the most high
Then I, get fresh for a new day
I eat broccoli for breakfast and smoke my trees
Turn on the flat screen to C-Span, see the elite strength
Attorney general slowly gettin' bills passed
Prophecies comin' to pass
We gotta survive this shit dunn, it's nothin' to laugh at
I hops in the V, grabs the heat and I stash that
I'm in tune with Doc, Pac, and Huey, it's a rap

I traveled the world, and been alot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself
You got drama, who's gonna clap that chrome?
Nobody like you, somebody like me
When death, I'm ready for it in Threes

Is like dice, then I rolled that 456
And never lost ever since, though I took that big pinch
Brother passed away, 24/7 I was bent
Drunk in my pain, a lot of friends went and then came
And those that stayed understood a nigga pain
And for a nigga's problems had no one to point the blame
I was my own worst enemy goin' against the grain
Somewhere along the line, them pieces had to get grabbed
All this money plus family, shit wasn't that bad
All you little shorties runnin' 'round like shits sweet
Just remember these words from the M-O-double-B
And it's real

I traveled the world, and been alot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself

I kiss my finger, cross my heart, I'mma make it out these dark days
Whether together or we part ways
I got a promise to that boy tatted on my arm
Three strong, man, the heat's still lukewarm
Who can you trust when your friends wanna pop your safe?
You let him stash in your place, now you watch his waist
Vision the days, hear the ghost whisper
Dogs we left in the past, brought back now here with us
Cross my heart, let the haze linger
Pour out a little liquor, knowin' God took a good nigga
Thousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker
Dawg, you were his every dream
I kissed his face like I never knew 'em
It was me, once upon a time when life was ruined
Now the mink rope chain sparklin', jumpin' out of bed
Thousand dollar slippers slidin' huggin' the carpets

I traveled the world, and been alot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself
You got drama, who's gonna clap that chrome?

Bitch-ass nigga, yo, it's time to pull the trigga
I might be small, but fuck with bein' bigga
Niggas wanna throw with that bullshit, but step aside
Pull out the four-five, and kill him motherfuckin' dead
Pump his ass with lead
Never fakin' moves, motherfucker, run the jewels
Buck wild, blowin' niggas out the frame
Matter fact, don't call me shorty, kid, you know my name
So next time, you see me, you better duck me

Catch wreck with the TEC, then I'm out like quick sex

You say your shorty's trauma, what's all the drama?
I shoot 'em up like their last name is Farmer
Shorty got the death wish, I wish to die
But when I try, it just goes by
You couldn't kill me because I can't kill myself
And if I got beef, then I got it for self
And if I catch a body, I catch it for self
To me, murder is good for the health
Little man paranoid, Mr. Schizophrenic
Thirty-five niggas wanna funk, don't panic
Just shoot a head up, or take your beatin' like a man
Or pull a burner if you want a longer lifespan
That's how I see it, if I gotta die, so be it
But maybe one day, my luck'll run out, though
Until then, I couldn't give a fuck, yo
Little shorty one time, I'm goin' all out for mines
'Cause there won't be a next time
So what you wanna do, punk? Back up a little
Gimme some space, I'm hittin' hearts, street sweeper
A little crazed nigga from the streets
Raised in the ghetto, I'm puttin' out heads, yo
I'm open, time to catch wreck, put 'em in check
Snap his neck, grab his loot, then jet
Who's next to be a victim? Easily ripped up
Get ready to run when I ripped 'em
Drop to the floor, feel the wrath of the drug war
Call me a thug who gets buck when I want more
Maniac with a TEC-9
Hit me up now, 'cause there won't be a next time

Chalk on the ground where the motherfucker died
Niggas know who did it, but ain't nobody snitchin'
No word of to myself, if they do, I'm flippin' the script
Settin' it off, yo, put 'em in a dope fiend
And cut 'em up like protein
The lord of criminal juvenile crimes committed
Set it some bitch-ass nigga, I'm with it
You couldn't fuck with the skills of the five foot
And all it takes is a set to get your crew shook

Yo

This is flavor for the non believes
Sit back, take a seat, and don't forget to pass the weed
And by the way, this is all the way live
And the way that I survive is pumpin' nickels and dimes
Pumpin' rocks on the corner, pumpin' rocks 'cause I wanna
The little Don Ho drug dealer, plus performer
At my height, I'm described as a midget
But it ain't about height, it's about, "Can I Kick It?"
Some say I'm too little, but yo, I'm too ill
I hit skins, light up, and then I smoke a Phil'
You don't wanna beef with this juvenile delinquent
I'm not good, I'm livin' like a hood
And when I kick, MC's abandon ship
'Cause my brain is the sun of a solar eclipse
Yo, Havoc is the man that you have to bring
'Cause I'm flippin' like pages in a Word Up! Magazine
Sweet like candy, the poetic vigilante
So explicit, even porno flicks ban me
And girls gel me like Jheri curl activate
The forty dog drinkin', money grip, you're dead and stinkin'
Brain cells overload when I'm thinkin'
This is a rap rape and I leave a fat taste
Get off the microphone, kid, stay in a child's place
I cook you up like Uptown raw base
And leave you open like if you just saw Scarface
Like I said it before, shorty scores
I get raw for the cause
Battle me, take a loss
I steal shows like Bell Biv DeVoe's
And put on my latex when I hit up the hoes
You know the flavor, kid, give me my props
'Cause it's 1992 and all the bullshit stops

Mr. Soul, trunk jewels, sippin' Old Gold
Roll up my nickel pack of weed, lick it up, and stroll
Prodigy, verbally tragic and I'm toxic
Check out the way, check out the way, the way that I drop it
You know my style, step back 'cause I'm buckwild
All it takes is a mic, forty dog, and a smile
Baby Grand Puba, little Rick the Ruler
And in my pocket is a crazy fat bag of Buddha
MCs can't get with Mister Mister
Money don't fake moves 'cause I probably hit your sister
I'm on a mission, word is bond
Word to God, I goes on, the little Don
Smooth and fantastic as I get drastic
Shake your brain mentally and psychopathic
I murder with the brain of Hitler, black
And me bein' weak, even Kodak couldn't picture that

You thought I couldn't, wish I wouldn't do what I did
I did it so I done, kill another fuckin' kid
'Cause I don't give a motherfuck
And you do, that's why your stupid ass got bucked
Out of luck, never took the time to wish
Took a bitch down, then I'm out like quick
Nestlé chocolate, munch like it's buffet
That was then, this is now, I'm goin' for the gold
Thirty-yard touchdown, Mr. Short
Fuckin' niggas' bitches just for the sport
But not without the jimmy
'Cause bitches nowadays know magic tricks
And that I ain't with
Oh shit, time to move, time to move
Here we go with another fly groove, 'cause I'm so smooth
Never like to brag, but I do it still
Sip on a forty, smoke on the Phil'
So next time, kid, you wanna beef, just chill
Before I break your ass up to bits
How many licks would it take?
Check it out, one, two, three bitch-ass nigga lace

Niggas catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways

Step in to my highrise hell, you gots to be on the up and up
Watch your back, pump your crack, but don't forget to re-up
A burner's your God and you pray to it all day
Then at night, you catch a body
But it's just the shit you got to do
'Cause if you wasn't watchin', they'd catch your ass too
You gotta go all out if you want props
Or you can just kill a man and it's the same for cops
Now you want a little fame from the drug game
Whether you shoot 'em up or pump cracks, it's all the same
But fuck it, you're in it to win it
Fat Uptown, cookies in the rocks, your spot's hot
Now you're livin' the life of a project sad song
Makin' your loot from all the right wrongs
But that's the way it goes when you choose your path
And you might just feel the pain of a TEC-22 blast
All out war with niggas from the next block
You're pullin' out the Glock to shut 'em down
Now you're Mr. Big Shot in your ride
Niggas know your name from Mt. Vernon to Southside
Comin' from the streets of fright
Where the only thing you learned was how to roll it up right
And load it up tight, you're startin' a block war
Nigga, pull the trigger if you want a little more
Frank Nitty style, buckwild
Thirty-eight slugs from Uptown thugs
No question, you're true to the game
Since the age of a little Brand Nubian
From skelly tops to props of all that
Now you're puttin' your block on the map
A role model to the petty drug dealers
Banana clip style, my neighborhood's buckwild
You can't forget where you came from
See you later, maybe sooner in the project hallways

Pull the trigger, pass the forty in the project hallways
Runnin' through the doorways, back in the days
Just a little snot-nosed bastard
Always causin' havoc with a blade
But now it's a burner, used for murder
Step a little closer and your ass is grass
You better move fast 'fore I kick that ass
'Cause I'm sharp like glass, but I won't break
Walk into the project hallways is your big mistake
You little bitch-ass nigga, you should've known better
You'll get done did, a kid from the 'Bridge
Who gets buck, and couldn't give a fuck about your daze
I'm talkin' 'bout the project hallways

Catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, chillin' in the project hallways
To survive around my way
You gotta play a knuckle game every day
Lost in the shuffle of hard rocks
And knocks on the streets of the uptown blocks
Load the Glocks, who got the Mott's?
A little gun-bangin' badass project thug
You're in the wrong part of town, kid
Mr. Buddha on the thirteenth floor, give me some more
Sess, bag it up real quick, kid
Tap the snooze, hit the brew, pass the Phil'
What's my name? Niggas call me Little Shorty Gets Ill
And bag 'em up on the street corner
And bust 'em open in the project hallways

Check it out, yo
Around my way, kid, the sun don't shine
Phillie blunts, kid, I got what you want and it's time
My dialogue with the project cause motivate
Move, what? I never lose
Freestyle project hallway style
But the shit ain't real unless you got that Buddha filled
Charm keeps me goin' on when I perform
Charge the brain, lick 'em up, that's the name of the game
So it's the move when I move little smooth
On the motherfuckin' mission and I just improve
Upstairs, niggas dyin' on the sixth floor
'Cause in the projects, shit is mad rough
So take a puff and relax your mind
J.V. crimes, most of the time
You might catch my crew with a sixty-four brew
Watch your back 'cause we're comin' through
With a fat sack of 1-2-1, son
And the shit ain't fun unless I get some
Of the action, little shorty execute
I'm killin' niggas in the hallways 'til there ain't no more left to shoot
So if you can't take the heat, stay out of the ways
Before you 'come a victim of the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggas catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggas catchin' bodies in the project hallways

They got me locked in Spofford, the lil' juvenile criminal
Two kids approach to put blades to my throat
They like my coat and ask me what I'm gonna do for that
Give it up? Huh, you don't believe that
So I threw on my hood, pulled out the banger
Swung it at the kids that put me in danger
They put away them blades and said, "Why it gotta be like that?"
'Cause you get a little ox and don't know how to act
Yeah, now I got props and I'm runnin' shit
And when it comes to phone time, you don't get none of it
So sit back and just chill
Before you make a lil' nigga have to get ill
Only got a month left, so I gotta be on my best
But yet and still herb niggas wanna put me to the test
So I wild with a blade and a Kool-Aid smile
Let the juvenile catch wreck for a sec
Damn, I wish I could put my hands on a
Nice-ass Tec and blow a nigga to Babylon
But if you don't got a knuckle game, that's a damn shame
Nigga I feel for, they got you washin' drawers
But I refuse, 'cause I got nothin' to lose
Props I gotta earn, plus I gotta pay my dues
So in the meantime, I got a ox in my pocket
They got me locked in Spofford

Adolescents that ball hardcore

The real lil' niggas step out of the piles
And I'm not takin' no shorts while I'm up here
Spit 'em up, gem stars, but ain't no scars here
Protective custody's got mines
No type of help, I'm in here for self
And so I got locked up on a one to two
On the bus catchin' beef with mad crews
Run my shoes, fuck that, I'm goin' out, kid
But not too buck wild, 'cause I gotta finish my bid
Four times for my peoples up from the 'Bridge
Here it takes a lot of heart to live
Behind bars, child correction
Trapped in the buck wild dorm E section
They got me smokin' the death sticks
Niggas got me fightin' for my life 'cause shit is real
Shorty kill a man, got locked down
You want a buck sixty? You betta, betta back down
On the streets a hood, but in here
You're up to no damn good, nigga, I wish you would
Try to take mines and try to shank mines
Shorty corrupt, there's no stoppin' me, even in jail, I tear shit up
And when I get out, it's gonna get worse
The devil in the flesh, I'm puttin' hammers on a hearse
So while I'm in here, don't forget my name
Ain't shit changed, I'm still the motherfuckin' same
I didn't bitch up when I got here
Cell rep, I got shit locked here
One more month I'm goin' Uptown
To the big pen and I'ma still win
'Cause jail is my life and I like it here
Ain't no rules, you can do what you like in here
Jailhouse blues, I miss the ghetto
C.O.s think they're five-Os with no heat
So what am I to do when they step
Put 'em in check, and throw hands with a redneck
And now I got a little crew to watch my back
Lunchtime comes, huh, you ain't gettin' none of that
'Cause I got shit sewn up real tight
Not one bit of fright, while I'm locked in Spofford
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down

Girl I know you love a thug be wildin'
Smack flames out a nigga and I got you smilin'
The way I cut a nigga every which way but loose
A blood stained Gucci suit will be the proof
Laid back cat but I love to chill
Love a freak in a thong with a freak full of yarn
Said you went to catholic school and that's cool
Let me see you throw the suit on
With no interruptions, ma turn the cell off
Start for the touchin'
And I'm sick with the candle
A fatty, ain't nothin' that a nigga can't handle
I been through it
It's a first time for everything, settin you free
And I feel you your man ain't lettin' you breathe
You a dime from your face to your navel
Your man better wake the fuck up and let you out of that stable
Used to think like that until I thought
Man, the shoe on the other foot and I got thoughts
Stay home, cook and clean like she the boss
Hell no nigga, not while I'm up in New York
She gonna do what she want, flirt when she want, fuck who she want
Then nigga It's a wrap
You like 'No she won't', but yes she will

It's 3 in the mornin', why you think you came
Should've stayed where you was, I don't play those games
Ring on the finger, fatty off the meter
There's only one thing that this shit could lead to
The reaction, your mind'll crack
And put my mans on if it's poppin'
Bitch you laughin'?
Everything that I spit is real
And everything on your inside you scared to tell
The word creep, "no" ring a bell
Girl I know the situation all too well
I'mma keep it gangsta, rep the 'bout
Lady caught on, so I had to bounce
With bleach in the crib, all my clothes got doused
That's when a nigga knew I had to get out
Know what you're goin' through, been there before
Relationships now, it's like they got these laws
Girl all you wanna do is just be free
And that's why a nigga like me got these keys

Yo, you got these niggas runnin' around like they head cut off
Like they gully, then switch when I'm spittin' those dummies
I creep in the cold 'till my nose get runny
Then I'm layin' for a nigga like I'm waitin' on money
I ask these hoes what the fuck they want from me
From the gate I keep it real that's why they gon' love me
I got a shorty if she get down for me, when I'm out of town
You know she holdin' down the crown for me
Dog, god forbid if i die, don't worry kid
Take you with me shit pussy don't want me
My life's story was the Henny, had to stop that
And now I'm focusin' clear when I cop that
Fuck gettin' clapped, it be more like applause
Since they tellin' like broads, might as well get 'em all
The H-, the A- the V- the O- the C
I'm the man, the myth pushin' shit to the White League

You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying

You can try to set me up and all that

The pressure... (You gotta find a way to deal with)
You're dealin' with the peer pressure

As a young black teen, everyday I, deal
With the pressure, and mixed up is how I feel
I walk the streets with a 'Fuck you!' attitude
And when it comes to my peoples, you ain't half as rude
Follow the crowd or be a leader, take your pick
Now I'm smokin' buddha Philly blunt style
A frustrated and confused young juvenile
King of the project blues, so I choose
To take a piece of the action
But my sober state of mind won't let it happen
The 24/7 is the number one stresser
Dealin' with the peer pressure


Most don't understand how it is in the world of today
Growin' up as a young black teen
I used to dream, of bein' a architect
Easier said than done, believe me, it's hard to get
Outta the projects, without forgettin' where you came from
My parents told me from day one:
Finish school and avoid all obstacles
But my environment makes it so impossible
For instance, build a strong social life
Without messin' up, still tryin' to live right
Like in junior high, I used to wonder why
Certain females went out with certain guys
You might also like
Then one day, it all dawned on me, yo
You gotta be down, and have it goin' on, see?
I wasn't down with the mainstream, or should I say their team?
Ha! Now I'm gettin' steamed
Gotta find a way to get accepted by my peers
So now I'm sippin' on beers
Buyin' new gear, nuthin' but the best
Forget Levi's, strictly Polo and Guess
But how would I make the cash?
It gotta be easy and it gotta be fast
Thinkin' to myself "Does that make me lesser?"
Just, dealin' with the peer pressure


Around my way, there's a kid that most don't understand
How he lives; is it negative or positive?
He has a grade A average
But when he's on the streets with his friends, he's a savage
A freshman of high school, daily attendant
He never got in trouble, never did he get suspended
Good little Kenny, who would believe?
He dropped out of school and started to smoke weed
I saw the signs, but I didn't pay attention
Because he got offended every time that I would mention
The drinkin', the smokin', the low school grades
And sleepin' in class, laid back with his black shades
Nowadays, you catch Kenny hangin' in the hallways
With his crew, findin' more ways
To break outta school, and hit the block and get buckwild
Stay out of the way of a mad child
'Cause he's a product of hell
Kenny never fell, but he's gonna fall overall
So let's take a trip to the ghetto
Where Kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man, so
He pulled the trigger and the suicide note read:
"I'm glad it's finally over and I'm finally dead
And no more do I have to feel lesser
Or deal with the peer pressure"

You want a freestyle, kid? I'm wilder than the penile
Back up off me, gimme room to breathe
And you takin' up my spot? Nigga, please

Around the way, all the fake niggas fear this
Paragraphs bust your membrane
On and on I bust through like Teflon
The Little P is not to be stepped upon
And if you think so, kid, then you're dead wrong
Little, far from big, yo, a type small kid
P, I represent the brothers from Queensbridge
To make a long rhyme short, I smoke weed
Sip a forty, yo, fuck the court
So bad they tried to lock me in a group home
Prodigy's hard, but fuck it, I can rip a smooth tone
I catch wreck with the Einstein's intellect
And get stupid like a Stimulated Dummies mix
Feel the wrath, feel the aftermath
Even if you took thn notes, kid, you couldn't pass the class
I keep a loosie in the chamber 'cause beef got me shook down
Paranoid, ain't got no time to fuck around
So bypass the clock when it's time to go at it

Buckwild, rockin' with much style
Check it as I wreck it, strip ya butt-naked
Pause and stand still while I just split a Phil'
And double up on ki's and make somethin' like a half-mil'
Shorty's in it to get paid
No doubt, I got clout with the females
Put it in detail and write it
And if you ain't givin' pussy, then bitch, you ain't invited
I'm on some other shit that you couldn't fuck with
Destructive and couldn't give a fuck kid

I got the shit that make you wanna catch a body quick
Fuck 'em up, bust 'em down Queensbridge style
Street corner thug my title
Neighborhood partygoer, Noriega was my idol (Yeah)
So what you wanna do, nigga?
My knuckle game brought me fame in the project hallways
I got mad props for killing cops
Little shorty hood, a little nigga no good
My twenty-five weighs a ton, so run
I'll cock it back on your black ass, B, and it's like that

Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out
Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out
Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out
Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out

Throw on my hoodie, when niggas lit the fully

Fakin' jacks, I'ma call your motherfuckin bluff
Niggas that violate get me vexed
Son got the MAC, Noyd got the TEC
I catch a body, baggin' niggas like deez
Uptown cooking keys, flippin' twenty G's
Around the way, bustin' Phils by the fuckin pack
 Yeah, kid, you know I got that
Jump in the hoopty, countin' up my looty
Throw on my vest in case niggas wanna shoot me
Niggas blazin' at my ride
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I retaliate with the bullshit two-five
It's only right that I represent
Sip on the E&J straight, fuck around and get mega bent
Me and my crew wild for days
Burn up the stage like a motherfuckin' heatwave
Learn to maintain, less stress on the brain
Niggas try to front, but they know my motherfuckin' name

Ghetto representer, there ain't a motherfucker better
While you be catchin' feelings like a love letter
I gotta hold down my fort and won't lose
Niggas die because I got the TEC-9 blues
Bulletproof Polo, I'm goin' out solo
Whoever wanna come better step like they know, 'cause
I'ma survive, more rougher than a certified
Around the way, parlay and get high
My mega blast'll last in days to pass
Niggas shoot too fast to pull out your gun last
That's why I like to spark first and shoot your
Bitch-ass down your next ride'll be a fuckin' hearse
'Cause little niggas don't die, son
Half-step and get that ass lit up like a flare gun
Cops, they want static, whatever, they can have it
My name is Prodigy and I'm known to cause havoc
And when I flip, I be on some ill shit
I walk the street like a real super trooper
The block shit proper, who once got had
Mad beef with the dread who sold me that dirt bag
Mad props to the bad little niggas in the neighborhood
Long live the short, gotta hold down the fort

Step the fuck back, nigga, attack with the MAC
'Cause word is bond, it's on
Shit is real around the way, so sit back and take notes
Dead you on your coat, then cut your motherfuckin' throat
Takin' life like a thief in the motherfuckin' night
While I write-write, you bite-bite-bite
Niggas wanna step to my business
But I just parlay and sip on my Guinness
'Cause I'm the ripper, Mr. Flip the Scripture
Niggas can't fuck with the flow of a real little nigga
I wreck shop, in fact, get the MAC, this is real
Shit is real, how the fuck you figure? Nigga nil
So, son, hold me down while I pull out the Glock
Gotta hold down the block, that's word to my pops
So once again it's on, light up the charm

To all the niggas that's live or real
You gotta hold down your block, cock back the Glock
Fuck the cops 'cause your neighborhood yours
If they beef, make 'em bleed on the project floors
I get my kicks from loadin' up gun clips
Don't fuck with suburb chicks, I need a gangsta bitch
Don't need a crew, I can bust you down solo fast
And after that, dip into the weed stash
I'm quick to blast, enemies won't last the fate
I kill 'em fast so they can't retaliate
'Cause when I'm not alive, who takes my place?
To hold down the fort, we move on
My man got my back

Take shit back to trip who fat Goose
Queensbridge representative, ghetto entrepeneur, stay on tour
Dick-riders wanna get abortions
The same law, same day contract, different clause
Don't run red lights, I never caught the blue balls
Gold medalist spit, doin' this ever since
Third time felon, nigga, who you tellin'?

I count on one finger all y'all rap niggas that excite me
Y'all niggas is trash rap - wanna fight me?
You shook to death, take breaths and step lightly
Y'all Little League niggas is so bald they might be
Spent too much time with wifey, come out to play
With the hard-headed, Infamous song torture
Crack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight
Pull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights
My spiral book, hold the world's most lethal
There's no cure, for what my pen do neither
Bring the fever, y'all niggas is the rap jesters
While we was gone for a moment, y'all kept the crowd goin' now
Move over bacon, time for some'in meatier
Your shit's weak, your best song was mediocre
Fuck a penis, how dare you entertain the thought
That you could come out to challenge me in blood talk?
Take a walk jerk, this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill
This is rap for real, somethin' you feel
You catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo
It's heavy metal for the black people, rock'n'roll
But it's hip-hop though, my drug music
It's thereapeutic to the user, you slam dance to it
Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes 'til death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
It's a must we burst ours first

Yo.. crack the Henny bottle while I drop this jewel on your dome
My shit'll touch home, straight to the core you ain't alone
Play the unknown type dunn, mysterious stars
Concealin them slugs, if it go down, remember that mug
Cause ain't no love when a nigga shit is touchin' his ribs
Hungrier than a hostage, shit, we blitz
In formation pack the lead up in shit
The better you get, the better we get, and that's it
Yo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom
Stop 'em in they tracks, goin at 'em when you send 'em
Imperial dogs, creepin' through fog
Carved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal
We roll Mobb D-iezel, the whole Q.U. double-E, N-S
And when you spot us, play low-key
Dunn these niggas is actresses
And they tryin' to play the man's role
Can't they see us wildin' out on the video?
Don't they see us in the club swingin' elbows?
Or on the street with our jewels on the cell phone?
Hoppin' the sidewalk with Benzes and Jeeps
I ran through more cars than it's sand on the beach
I'm pleased to meet you, now here's a word to the smart
Don't ever let your peoples boost up your heart
Cause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart
Challengin' the Mobb in the arts
Our literature stands colossal, compared to y'alls
Way ahead of your time, you're strugglin' to keep up
Your style's limited, your rap's primitive
Go 'head with that bullshit you kicked dunn

Y'all niggas minor league in my eyes for real
Y'all niggas wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal

Yo, if I sat at wrote a verse for all the niggas I hated
Most definitely, if not you, kill somebody belated
Sound foul with a subject, dunn, no women or kids
Dump you up under a bridge in a cardboard box
I'm like nothin to do wit it, believe it or not
I'm washin my hands to get bent with Henney or rock
Up in the rep bangin my chest off, pealin my socks
Niggas do it to death, I sleep with my 6 cocked
Like Henney rock, one sip, ya love it a lot
While you sleepin, I'm creapin wit the intricate plot
Cuz picture me up in the morgue, way before my time
Picture you tryin to get my while I'm still tryin to get mines

Razors, lazers, bulletproof blazers
Yo, remind what the team chanted
They bought the jewel from a don wit a king-sized hat on, slanted
Kangol wit Bentol, ya mental, mid-war
Spill Hen' in the store, that's for the own'
Blaze wit a bent 4, yo these laws is your's
When we pour gasoline all in ya pours and draws
So decievin, flow speed change, lay him down, empty breathin
Instead of these leaks, we leave the weak weapin
Operation: apparatus, spray shots through ya grey Stratus
Straight up status for maggots


Soldier boys stay on ya toes, be on ya P's and Q's
Keep ya eyes bright comin out ya buildin, duke
You might bump into a bullet or stumble on ya death
Niggas slumber, I put 'em in a deep coma
I keep guns cuz it's like that, you figure it out
I got an arson for niggas tryin to figure me out
You ain't a killa, you just talk more, runnin ya mouth
The type of nigga, we'll stomp out and bloody down
Look, we a Mobb for real, don't let the LP's twist it
Cut me a cheque cuz I don't talk business
Drop anthems worth millions and spend millions
Take trips with my niggas to the Keys on the weekends
Serious jewels, pissy off the fruits
Dunn, we move like the marines, move when we come through
Seduce bitches dizzy, half they friends and they moms wanna hit me
Y'all know my stiggity

Going out nigga
Big guns and sharp knifes
Revolvers cause automatics jam at the wrong time(I'm going out)

Swinging belts catching niggas with the buckle now fuck it(I'm going out)
Like I ain't got nothing to live
Like as if u had guns to my kids fuck it (going all out)

Yo you know the type that style and shit that rise my dick
Pop me a nigga quicker than police
Leave more wombs than a whole room full of chicks
You running while I'm gunning cause you a bitch
I heard niggas talking like they going to dead mines
I got enough guns we can make the headlines
I'm from a place where the realeast niggas get murdered
And the illest niggas try to avoid it
But can't call it
It's a cold world bundle up
Keep your heat on at all times
And never freeze up
And your eyes blink you could catch a hole in your tank
Have you leaking all over the place
Watch how you speak
And watch how you move through the streets
I got a mob with niggas with heat
We liable to squeeze 'fore we think
Breath 'fore is too late

And my duns would do the same for me

I'm going out like a nigga that ain't never have nothing
Fuck it I ain't frontin'
If I want to know I got to go out like a navy seal
Label me ill you sling thrills
Meet you on top of the hills screaming dollar bill
Going out like a nigga you just smacked
His moms in the cut plotting patient and calm
Putting on everything that I love and stand for
Getting bent up in the pub 'till five in the morn
Going out like a nigga with six days to live
And like a single parents raising a kid now that's a bid
Going out like a nigga with shit touching his rib
You got more than nesessary dun a nigga went dead
Going out for my niggas see this gat in my hand
You better back the fuck up what part didn't you understand
Have a nine aimed straight at your thyroid glands
Must've not been really your men them niggas that ran (I'm going out)

We do it well, clip niggas like nails
Catch cases, skip bails
I lie before I ti-dell, die in a ci-del
Pop guns with the shi-dell, fuck a bitch 'til she yi-zell
Rap style Smoother than C.L., in the K on the DL
Line for line you can detail, choked more niggas than Sprewell
Rap style P.L.O., watch me blow, like tornadoes
Clear the block out with just an echo
Trust me, niggas don't want me see let go
Niggas don't want to see the tech blow
Watch me move the crowd like techno music, nigga
When it come to murder, you know we do it for the cause
Fuck relyin' on the law, ain't worth dyin' for
I rather die fucking raw
Or walkin' on a mine in the cold war
My dogs got my shoulders, fatigued up machine guns
All my niggas soldiers
With big grenades, throw them in your rover
Send Prodigy to check the scene when it's over
Niggas animals comin' back for leftovers (all out nigga)

It's that war shit
It's that war shit
And you know what dun

It makes you sick to hear the Mobb bang like this
Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock with this
My duns heads bop to this
We stand out like a terrace
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks
Just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics incredible beats
Don't mean to rub it in
But your small time beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin
For ass whippings
Guns kick like Pelé
My big shit be jumping like Jordan
Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds
So you can run back actin like you a vet
And swearin' you dead
You survived some real shit
Now what's this it's not going down like this
Ground that nigga like punishment
Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out
Niggas always gonna think something sweet
Until they least expect you bringing action exactly

Stay charged, niggas gettin' amped off the mobb shit
Have you wildin' out on some club shit
Shit to make them dance at the same time
Stop and glance
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young niggas young minds but that's quite contrar'
Young niggas smart niggas

Regulate with the rest of my establishment
Blast out the pockets of coats
Make the cops boat

Irons, a permanent flesh your clothes soakin'
You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting
Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting

Pick your heat up
Let's do it like the crematory
Make it hot make the temperature rise like mercury
When I feel like gettin' bent

I'mma drink away the pain until the brain get numb
Can't take all my dogs gettin' lost in the fog
Never, to return I guess they heard God's call
And naythin' don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst, and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds
My surroundings
Get suspect we start four-poundin' shit
Picture me up in the mix
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear
I just be another problem that he feenin' to fix
But I, can't have that

Lets do it, dunn...
I mean, that's why I keep my mouth tight
Ain't got no words for y'all niggas, man...y'all niggas is crazy

Hey yo, it's hell on earth down here the pavement scorching
It's molten rock when the Mobb walks in
Shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you
I understood, you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too, damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until I made things right
Pull out guns, exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines, ignite the pipes...
And never let the daylight decieve
During the sun's hours niggas do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggas can't shoot, never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop
Fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrell when it's bolt-locked, nigga

Have you ever lost a loved one?
Or never understood love 'til you lost one?
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at?
Strength missing, to take losses is the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest
Strive regardless. Where your heart at? Brave-hearted
Now lets find out where niggas hearts' at

This is to my physical, you gone, to me you still here
I be buggin' thinking how you doin' up there
Probably watching over me, calling out my fouls
Fuck with mad chicks but I take care of my child
I miss that ass, tell God I said "Pardon me"
If you're real; He'll forgive me 
But I ain't crying no more about how you're gone
Used to hold me down; niggas front, it's on
Ain't sweating going to jail, you better shoot me
Just lost my heart-If I die, you comin' wit' me
Quickly, while I'm pissy
They're just bitches that's a little too frisky, risky
On point, hope these cats is getting the point
Whisper out my name, stare but please don't point
Call me paranoid
But I'm on point, close by the stash joint
Got you in my mind, I guess that's why the say love is blind

Strength missing, we take losses, be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave-hearted
You better finish what you started, dunn
If you ever lost a loved one
You'll never understand love 'til you lost one
Where your heart at?
I left mine behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at?
Strength missing, to take losses be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave-hearted
Now let's find out where niggas' hearts at
Have you ever lost a loved one?
You'll never understand love 'til you lost one
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind wit' my dearly departed
Now where your heart at?
I find myself dozing off with it 
Waking up every forty minutes 
Soaking wet, dripped to death in it
On top of rules, big barrels and tools get tested
And hittin' off makes my dick get erected
We all strive for a better tomorrow
But as far as today, your ass gots to pay
And ain't no time better than the present one at hand
And never keep your shit too far from your hand

Think about this are you with your hands on who you running with
Some timers, player haters and dick riders
Bent niggas that be crashin' into dividers
Gettin' you into shit, got that ass tied up
Got them la'd up, got you comin' out of your vault
With no plans of giving back, live in serious debt
Your lady fucking other niggas, you a fool for her
Talking 'bout you got money, you just using her
Actually losin' her...3Embed
Record this right here
Man I want niggas to hear this shit right here
Knahmsayin? Cause these niggas be forgettin son
Knahmsayin? .. Can't blame niggas doe (we here son)
Y'know? Truth always reveal itself though
That's what we here for
But umm.. we gon' take this little intermission
To say what the fuck we got to say, y'know?
(Let me, let me here something then)
It's like this Dunn

Infamous 'til the name wear out, time and again without doubt
I take the murder one route, where clowns pulled out and copped out
Poppin they, little heads out they hole
Stickin they chest out, actin like they in control
But hold up, I've been doin' this since we was kids
And all you other niggas gotta ask if you could live
Your projects is on our dicks, you need to quit
And let us rep that for them, your raps ain't shit
Your background's incorrect, your song push no effect
On the people, don't try to play my part
Don't try to say my words that I lived and survived
Y'all niggas got some nerve, be careful at night
You might bump into a true to life nigga like P
Get beat over your head wit gun handles
Check the manual you went about it all wrong
We put you on the life, taught you how to drink right
And how to speak like a nigga livin' street life
How to chase down liquor wit more liquor
As a youth I was over proof, now I'm sober than your hoa
But still pound on a nigga 'til he throw up
Straighten up there's too much to lose
Get your head on right, we got the world to gain
And I'ma take mines while you sit around and complain
And I innovate raps while your song is playin'
Looks tastes and feels to me like no frills
Take that bullshit back to the two inch reel
Hit the studio hard, crash the track board like a smashed car
Then maybe next rhyme you could fuck with the God
P wit a capital "P"
And don't ever in your life try to rock with me
On no days there's no rap page I can't top
I, splash the half ass trash you dropped
You get chopped in half, your little raff ain't last long
My shit came out and you got escorted to the door
You just a fuckin' clown here to entertain us all
I bring the gravity Dunn you're gonna fall
Anytime y'all niggas wanna mic brawl
Don't forget to me it's Bloodsport bring your dogs
Nigga
(Yea nigga, it's like that y'all niggas, what)

First of all, we the one and only Infamous
Everybody wanna use the name soundin' all lame
We come up in the party with them shanks and things
Have you curled up on the floor feelin' the pain
And nine times out ten we ain't even start the shit
We finish it then they wanna press charges
Plus everybody and their mother wanna act tough
'til they discover how fast a nigga leave them under white covers
Was a thumper 'til he met the 40 thunder
Now I feel strange when I walk by his mother, it's fucked up
That's how the ball bounce, The cookie crumbles
That's what the guns do, dead you on the humble
But God forgive me niggas tryna hit me, what I'm supposed to do
You talk about my life and a nigga got a lot to lose
So I tuck the heaters then proceed to move
We a mob for real, you an example

You should spread love not war
Cause my shit is popping and I'd be goddamned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war
Cause you won't feel safe comin' out your crib, knowin' that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids how they need you alive for your guidance

Cause I be right back to my brother say word
You got to drive, no doubt, I cock it bein tougher for herbs
Cause the plot is power and I do it for hours
Won't save me for a minute 'til I move on you cowards

Plus we got guns, to blow your brains
Niggas learn when they feel the pain, know I'm saying?
Straight like that, standin ovation with max
We clap niggas for less, splash niggas for laughs
Shift the game, raise your odds
I need 93 thousand for 16 bars
Put out the movie, the hoods rush the stores

No matter what you think, a ho gonna be a ho, and a nigga definitely gonna be a nigga, 'cause I'm a nigga!

M, O, double B
I don't know why they wanna trouble me
Is it because they bitch be suckin me
Or just mad cause they shitted wit the family?
We be bubbling, up in the Navigator huddlin
While you frontin in that rental, cuddling
With that weak ass bitch, damn right she snitch
And if I had in my misdt, she'd be biting shit

Cause a ho gonna be a ho
A nigga gonna be a nigga
No matter what the fuck you think
Got cash in my escrow, never gonna let it go
(Hell motherfucking no!)
Cause a ho gonna be a ho
A nigga gonna be a nigga
No matter what the fuck you think
Got cash in my escrow, never gonna let it go
(Hell motherfucking no!)

Chillin at the crib layin in my boxers
While shorty got bent spittin tha latest gossip
Didn't want to hear it in the middle cut her off
Lit a stog, smacked her ass, grabbed her by the draws
Bugged in the head but her looks turned me on
She tried to turn me on with edible thongs
Plus I like the way she sounded when repeatin my songs
From Queens to get to her crib didn't take long
Said she had a man but was locked up in Attica
Freak off with the VCR to my camera
After that shit that happened to 2Pac
Yell rape? Show 'em the tape jus playin my part
Opposed to being on tape but the G that I ran
Had her tongue in my ear and my dick in her hand
When I thought I knew I shoulda brought my fam
Bring her to the lowest level and shared it with my mans

Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, that true shit
That shit to make you feel shit
To all my niggas and my bitches
Yo, check it, uh huh

It's kinda bug how I dose sometimes; know they staring
Brain feels like a wheel lost without the ball bearing
Stuck, contemplating who I can trust
But like llello in a bill my feelings just get crushed
But thats why I stick with my duns, like I stick with the guns
Don't get mad, rip your hun, concentrate on my funds
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist
Never get patted down when I step in the place
Jiggied up, scope the spot, confirm beef, if it's not
Bally up, after this get followed straight to the crib
Gem star, double edge apply pressure
Shave 'em down, blow marks intruding through your mecca
Wanna be a thug, now you got the thug look
Stick 'em up, leave Medicaid with the bill to foot
God-Body, with a rubber grip black shottie
Pump one in that ass make a nigga switch hobbies
A dosage, hand delivered, without postage
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice
Niggas get sniped like, clog your bronchite
Show 'em how to rock right, when bitches are holdin mics

This is real, this is ill street news
How he gone, and left his moms mind struck
And now his brother not giving a fuck
Little sister giving up the butt now, dun don't wet that
I want you to rest black, 'cause you can believe that Noyd gon' handle that
Cause when I get 'em, I'm gonna have 'em
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at 'em
I'm no killer, you know me
But I'll be damned if I don't ride for my co-D
And then this OG, scold me, and told me, coldly
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homie
But I, gotta redeem, get this cream by any means
I never been clean
Nigga, my whole click got dirty
From the vials, to the trials and the bloodied up syrtie
Nigga you heard me, it's gangsta (and to the block)

Vision the canvas I paint a picture
Similar to Ernies Barnes, nigga
But mines is more ghetto more guns
More drugs, mostly thugs
All my dunns, their baby moms daughter and sons
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out
Park benches is broke, a nigga stretched out
Jumped off the roof and fell to his death, it's real
Hand Ball walls displayed with R-I-P murals
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building
Devil's Spring, keep 'em going while the snows blowing
Grams get dipped, 50's is moked, cookies is broke
And Spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off, don't get clipped off

Run like a faggot and take the whole shit
That's it, I had to pass here with the shit
It's time for showtime, let's see how deep things get
You wanna talk tough and act all delinquent
You find yourself all bloodied up and shamed-ed
Me and my man pioneered this violent nigga rap shit
Bust a gat, kid, me no fear that, I'm laughin'
What's up then? Let's take it there and touch somethin'
I'm a maniac, brainiac, fanatic for that
Capable of combat, P counterattack
In some hot wheels sendin' shots out from the back
It was a foul way to go, Kicko
You know the ropes so (Bloodsport, motherfucker)
Ayo, the rottweiler
Chewin' chihuahua-ass niggas, pull 'em by the collar
And let the lights dim it
And you'll be swimmin' in a puddle of reality juice
Fatality too, this rap shit is the bitch you shouldn't married into
To the set of prenuptial, got paid and too comfortable
It's all good, read 'em on the humble
And while you shinin' in the spotlight
I got this dot right to aim right and stop life
The trife life, ain't no part twos (Hell no)
When it's over, it's over, you hit
Now send your soldierlys through

For them other niggas, though (What's goin' on? What?)
You know what I'm sayin'

I got my clique ready, ready for hand-to-hand combo
Palms break him down, Rapper Noyd cut his throat
Don scoop him up, ah, Gotti stomp him out
Each twin grab an arm, pick this nigga up
Nitty turn his face to me and let me wake him up
I throw him up against the wall and put a hole in his face so big
It almost took his whole face off
We got the team positioned, ready for faceoff
We blitz like Dallas in the Super Bowl faceoff
We form like niggas in the yard up north
With long swords, ready for war, who paid cost
To take your life lost, never found again, boss
A job well done, relax, throw back fifths
Of Bacardi Limon, fifteenths of hash get lit (Light it up, son)
Fuckin' with the fabulous Mobb, yeah, you a sick
Lunatic, nigga jump up, but got hit
With MACs and TECs and silencers spit
Shots whiz past your earlobe and shit
That's the sound of a nigga almost felt it
Got you runnin', dodgin', coverin', shelterin'
Bullets rippin' through the fabric of your shirt, it's meltin' in
You bleed again, you just another nigga dealt with
Intruder alert, our house is nothin' like the Covenant
We hold big shit like a bitch hold one in the oven

Paranoid on point and now I see who's who
Distinguish fake ones outta the immediate crew
Life, I take one if you jeopardize mine, duke
You're small, minute, got a deck to deal with aces up
You overbidded and in the Bridge, you got stuck
This ain't a card game, but in perspective, it's the same
Put two and two together, Mobb Deep with one name
Contain drama like Outbreak
You order drama, we outtake, then take you out
Keep it real and throw the fake out
Raise the stakes up, hit you up from the waist up
That's how it is and how it is is kinda fucked up
But our beats bangin', got your whole clique singin'
On a corner while it's rainin', four pound left ya ears ringin'
Delete those and keep my shit discrete
Niggas is trash rhymin', totally offbeat
And outta sync with they life, E&J been tight
Nigga, slow your roll
You're speedin', now you bleedin' tonight for no reason
Wanna be macks and thugs, get smacked, show no love
Crush your team like a bear hug
The Infamous'll do dirt that'll smear like mud
New York, New Yitty, Queens, I feel no pity, no remorse
Takin' it to the source of course
Where that ass, thug real, kid, it's only your mask
That you wear, take off, cop out, feel the blast
Who on top of boom, gat-for-gat
And all the wolves got the drop on you
And let the nickel-nine pop on you
Yo, my crew in the front got it locked
My live niggas in the back got the gats blowing outta your back
What the deal with them tough looks and eye contact?
Starin' all up in your cornea, your cornea lack
The look of a true-to-life, crime niggas attack
Go at the first nigga that front and overreact
You get dealt with, dealt with quick
Opposition get melted by hot shit, he felt it
You get dealt with, dealt with quick

Alright now, pay attention to the crime rhyme Houdini P
Keeping you niggas in perspective
Mobb representative, call me the specialist
Professional, professor at this rap science
Up in the laboratory, that's why your small rhyme bore me
Your store-bought rap ain't shit, my category
Is that of an insane man who strike back (What?)
I draw first blood, it's over with and that's that
You wanna square off, I'm sayin', "Slice that cat"
You get splashed from back of your head to asscrack
Searching for signs of the end, well, I am that
Which bring apocalypse to this game called rap
Not a game, but quite serious and yo, in fact
You'll be running for dear life, so far you might fall off the map
Fuckin' with P, you need the gat
At least you had a opportunity to bust back
Fresh out the motherfuckin' pack, a rare world premiere
Shook individuals bounce in blind fear
Scared-to-death niggas fall to they worst fear
Horror tales in Braille for vision-impaired
You lookin' for P, well, you can find him everywhere
In a project near you, I'll be right there

Hennessy raps, we like the Phantom
Running you up out of the spot in which you standin'
Never second-guess a cat who hold gat
Concealed, but easily revealed if that's
Body casting raps to get your back snapped in half and severed
Impossible pain beyond measure
Shiesty living brought him to his last prayer (Prayer)
Life changed around quick with one stare (Stare)
Face full of fear, conquering your ice grill (Grill)
Drowsiness, put him to sleep like NyQuil (NyQuil)

Got out the airport, the Mobb picked me up in the truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck, I ain't scared to get stuck
So what's the deal, papi? You heard the feds almost got me?
I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating like Illuminati
Network with catch-a-body experts
In retrospect to the foul connect
When I lost, but that then was my fault
Now it's time to floss, eye for a eye, what's mine is yours
I need a suite with the flowers complimentary at Trump Towers
Sit at the table, we can build for hours
On getting rich, it's a cinch, take a glimpse
"The World Is Yours" written all over the blimps
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning
With Quaaludes and cream and loads of women rockin' linen
I got a plan to blow to Hiroshima, Japan
Moving niggas out the hood and just divide it with fam
And yo, the bitches, like Gee Money said to his man
Will ride the dick like a horse with the cowboy brand

Give it up fast, quick, and not slow
Not goin' to the tables if it's not about dough

Ran his mouth like a bitch, now he's laying in the ditch
That he dug for himself, on his grave, I had to piss
Scud missile, never miss you, hit you
Scratch you off my list, Gemstar rip through
Your mental, deeper, you ain't havin' it, me neither
It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers
Rapper Noyd, make these niggas into believers

Yo, Noyd, what up with this cat right here, man? Word up

The tough guy screwing me? I guess he got plans to ruin me
He want to do me
Slowly but surely, I peeped his fast ass a bit early
Grabbed him by his wig, his shit was curly
Put the chrome to his dome, let him know it's never early
You can slide, before I snatch the heat from his side
Saw the devil in despise by the look in his eyes
He was surprised how I snatched him up
Regulated his gat and backed him up
Stepped to the side, P, blast him up
Yeah, yo, cannons erupt, you got strucked up abstrusely
Some rapper nigga playin' thug tried to approach me (Yo, kill that nigga, man)
Alls I remember was I shot for his throat, G
You see big guns in 3D, it's haunting
It gets deep, fucking with these Chinese
Thai weed burnin' my hip from hot gats
Burning my lip from roach clips
Catch me on the 40th and Bootlegger in the AM
These ante meridian cats, insomniacs
Four in the morning, we throwing back some cognac juice
Lettin' gats loose, the blue van blitz through
D's pissed too, couldn't find the pistol, ayo
Hopped out the Lexus holdin' my necklace
I'm bent off some next shit, gasoline with a kerosene twist
Stumbling, placing my gun right, it slipped down its caliber
Lookin' for chicks that he can stab now
Numbed up from a fiery cup of hell juice
It's sin's nectar, Satan's fountain of youth
Mega action, bitches all around ready to fuck
Big asses, you raw-dogging shit, pressing your luck
My pipe game's like a night train
Top speed through your womb-piece
Rated X to say the least, ayo

Give up the pussy fast, quick, and not slow (Give it up, shawty, word up)
Not goin' to the 'tel if it ain't a freak show (Show)

Dunn, this shit real, riddle in a life appeal
And losing again for real like Armageddon
Tec sweating your direction, your face change complexion
My whole life been destined, as sure as the moon shaped crescent
Caressing these raps like back rubs in bathtubs
I'm blessin', mics of all types, learn a lesson
The Infamous strike deadly like gas chambers and bangers in jail
You know the drill, QB on the hill where I chill
41 side still real, it ain't gone change
My niggas think long range, crack a skull frame
Simple and plain, fake niggas want claim fame
Real niggas up north, the Rock, Sing Sing

Character ass, amateur ass, damage your ass
With a touch of class, handle that ass
Two aluminum bats, ruin them cats, two exclusive gats
Doing them cats, my crew's in the back, losing it, black

As I sit back, dunn, I think about my past
When my moms had no cash, and my first time catching crabs
Or at the time when my brother got splashed
It hurt my ass, to see him pass
But now I gotta keep it moving to get this cash
You better kill his ass, if you wanna pass
These premises full of menaces, kid
Called The Infamous; forgive but we never forget
All that fake snake shit, kid, I never regret

Take a number and get on line for drama
You whiling like you was one of my own
That shit don't mix, we clashing
Make moves, handle your biz
Gun pose, take action, reach for those
Long chrome noses up, my gun blows
Your legs turn noodles, you shot a few going down
I give you that much, you went out
Close but no ci-gar, you must be a fucking retard
Extending your arm in my direction, you better squeeze hard
My rank is that of utmost respect
Y'all niggas only know what you heard on cassette
Manifest words in the flesh
Niggas always see the light after they bleed a few pints
Take your most VP dunn, leave them like the letter T
You won't see me run, unless it's police
Now, take these words home and think it through
'Fore the next rhyme we write might be about you, dunn

Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send .22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures

Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
P.O.W. niggas is found M.I.A.
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long 'cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet is kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb when they see us
I tell you what, black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four-pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds (Nigga)
Live up to my words, if I got beef, niggas comin' in herds (Nigga)
We flush through, your clique get purged (Word up)31Embed

Perhaps, kid, make it happen, start the flipping
You fuckin' comic, who you kidding?

Infamous crimes heinous
To interfere would be dangerous
Plain and simp', stand clear, save your strength
You couldn't go the length if you was coked up

Who gives a fuck? You get fucked
My coalition specialize in collision
The clash of the cliques
The duel of the iron, MAC spit

Live at the main event, may I present
And scream it out loud for any Squad that's Def

Sharp like the GemStar

But low profile, peep style, thirsty prowess
Catchin' court cases, paid lawyer, legal aid
Son, that's money wasted, I ain't got time for that
Invest, don't place all my bets on rap
On the strength of the ignorant cats
It'll be dead in a few, just like that
Could've bust his gat right (Yo, you know what?)
But now you bucked your own man, amateur ass
Homeroom, take that ass to class
But you cuttin', duckin' a reality blast
You catch a D-minus fuckin' with New York's finest

The only way you weaken this is if you peekin' this
Sneak thievin' niggas mischievous
Knowledgin' the God behind the scene on some snake shit
With vultures, water from the mouth 'cause we can taste it

Special deliver, sendin' shots through your Ac' Vigor
My Infamous Mobb get on they job
The truth gets revealed like we W Fard
Some shiesty New York niggas thirsty for cheddar
You shinin'? You get your jewels taken with your Hill sweater
Keepin' these rap fans like crack fiends
Until we re-up and put more Infamous up on the rap scene
Mix the coke rhymes with beats just like baking soda
Albums is G-packs selling across foreign waters
My Mobb picks is like dime bricks
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit
Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top, kid
And once we all on top, ain't no stoppin' it
I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam
Stupid, a hundred niggas form around me
Like forcefield, pull out and use the gun like shield
The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the hill
Beware of quiet niggas laying in the cut (For what?)
Patiently watching, waiting for a come-up
Get your spot took, we rob land like white man
Plans to overthrow your whole shit while shakin' your hand (Motherfucker)

Yo
Pussy will bring you in this motherfucker
Damn sure take you out too, kid
Check this shit out

A rainy day laid up thinkin', sittin', gettin' bent
Watchin' old '70s flicks
Mind's on the slouch back in the couch, heard the phone ring
It was a shorty from Uptown I met back day
Long time no hear from, no doubt, long time no see
I heard you had a seed, a baby girl and now she's three
What's up with that cat, you know who, your baby pops
Slung rocks up top, then heard he got knocked
"He home, fuck that nigga, I'm on my own
Matter fact, got my own crib, plus I'm all alone"
Word? The bitch is bad, chill, son, she got me tempted
Reminiscing the fatty, jumped in the ride I rented
Fresh Timbs, Mecca dice well presented
Sippin E&J straight, was bent when I entered
Gave her a hug, stared her straight into her mug
See, ain't seen the bitch since back then and that was bug
Turned the VCR on, Friday, my favorite flick
Offered me a drink, Alizé, I take a sip (No doubt)
Got into convo, "How you been over the years?"
"Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear"
"What you mean? I thought you left that cat," which was true
"I'm not talkin' about him, another dude
Been with him for a year and had a baby by him
Matter fact, you saw him downstairs, you walked by him"
Now I'm thinking setup, could it be? Or maybe not
She said, "Don't sweat it, he don't got the top lock"
Tried to play it cool, but in my head, shorty's wildin'
Usin' me to get the next nigga jealous, called up the fellas
Ty Nitty line was busy, so I beeped Gotti
Gotti was with Trip and two other grimeys
The Twins, "Let me begin, then explain
I'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed
Stuck without a gat, not prepared for combat"
Gave the address, told my son there's more cats
Be there in a second, big gats, no half steppin'
They flippin' on me, talkin' 'bout I never learn my lesson
I laugh in additional, hit them with the math
Hung up the jack while shorty soaked in the bath
Played the living room, dozed off for a second
When I woke up, shorty was standing ass-naked
Make moves, all this bullshit, pussy better be good
Stepped to the room, threw off my Champion hood
Slow motion, all along, bent off the potion
Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open
It was over, laid up in the cut, I heard a thump
Jumped up, threw on my boxers, yo, what the fuck?
All the sudden, I saw this Black motherfucker
With this big-ass gat and two other motherfuckers (What the fuck?)
Black masks, clutching duct tape, no escape
Tied me up, smacked me all in my face
Shorty wasn't even screamin', looked up, saw 'em schemin'
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this"
All bloodied up, shook the fuck up, held for ransom
They yelled, "Got the bones," smiled, then started dancin' (Yeah)
The phone rung, it was my sons, they let 'em know they had me hostage
Threw me on the phone, said, "Son, don't worry, yo, we got this"
Regardless what the outcome all this bullshit
Take a nigga word, don't ever go see a bitch, wordYou might also like5Embed
Forever wild from the cradle to the grave
Kid, watch your back! One-time's comin' always (Yeah!)
They locked me up for 12 days, I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin' St. Ides down with some Seagram's Gin
Life is like a dice game, and I'm in to win

On the scene, from the 41st side of Queens (Yeah!)
We get the C.R.E.A.M., laid up, love-love redeem
'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim king
Doin' my thing, throughout states my name'll ring

To all my peoples locked down, comin' back to life
In the world once again, though ya bid was trife
While you was gone, we was goin' to war
And even more, saw my man layin' dead on the floor
Kid, I swore that our crew'd live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (Yeah)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?)
Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' 'cross 12th Street
Just as I approached the block
I spotted Jake on the creep down by Vic's weed spot (Say word?)
Made a U-ey up the hill, plus a change of plans
I had to.. hurry back so I could warn my mans

It had me stressed a little somethin', had my heart rapidly pumpin'
Niggas started cuttin', behind the bushes duckin'
My ears rung, I plunged a clip into the guns
Got grazed in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin' from the head, I couldn't believe it
We was defeated, if it was a case, I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin' (The temperature's risin'!)
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'
So to P I passed the iron

Kid, you ain't lyin'
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin'
On a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap!
Police buckin' at me, they tried to twist my dome back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reach behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Lock the door, police grab me up and try to break my jaw
Said, "Where's the gun we saw?" (I don't know)
"We know you was there at the homicide scene"
(I don't know nothin')
"And if it wasn't you, it was somebody from ya team"

From the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave

(Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave!)
Yo, it's the reals, drama kills
Nobody move, stand still
Body you, drop that ass off in the landfills
Son blessed me with the iron, I got beef with
Some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clique, my crew strictly body shit!
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up North, son, I'm bent up!
Doin' my dirt on the low
Fuckin' with the Mobb is like a trial, no doubt you gonna blow
You never know, he didn't even have to go
There, unprepared, now he's six below
Y'know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings
Get that money I want, some brothers wanna act funny
But it's all good! I still die for the hood
(For my peoples!) Yeah, knock on wood!

Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama, what I gotta say is short, not long
This nigga that I'm beginnin' to dislike, he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit, he might be dead!
You know him well, and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I'll screw him
He shitted on my man, and we got plans to do him
Lets get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin'
Ain’t no fear over here, dear, we just debatin'
On when and how, later or right now
Spoke to Killa yesterday, he said to chill for a while
But it's hard actin' like everythin' is alright
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my eyesight
A dead man walkin', not only that, he's still talkin'
(About what?) About how and what he did very often
You don't know how much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day — my man, and the next — he's not
Didn't know him long anyway, so fuck it!
It's funny how things change (Word up!)

Niggas drunk all that shit (Ayo)

41st Side convention, Queens connection
The Bridge we reppin'
Any party that we step in, get the Henny up
VSOP immediately, extra bent
Wildin' out, son, is evident
We stash cream, mansions fulfill my dream
Ice rings gleam, spread love throughout the whole team
Dominate the game, let's have a rule, combinations
No conversation, bring on your good confrontation
You hesitatin', ass bettin', that's bad business
For the game, nigga, get out the business
You waste of space, substitute, here's a replace

Taint the taste, send you home back to vacate

And put you on to the whole game of this planet
But I gotta survive in order to follow through
Plans to live lotto, me and my little kicko
Any man tryin' to stop us, he get wet, though
You couldn't withstand the snake bite, there is no antidote
You put your hands too close and try to approach
I won't snap at you, I'm goin' for throats
And when you feel my bite, you sing high notes
I peeped you from deep and then you got cut close
My formulae, I live life do or die
Stare into the eyes of a deep wiseguy
Prodigy, turnin' niggas to protegés
My protegé, I advise your ass to make way, make way
For fully-auto gun spray
You're small prey, I'll easily bait and trap game
This man is half mad scientist, half sane
Create a rhyme labyrinth like poisonous cannabis

Overpower y'all, tiny noise like locusts
Like sunlight through a magnifying glass, I'll focus and burn
A hole straight through your brain and leave you open (Oh, shit)
And let the venom soak in
You start sweatin' and goin' through convulsions from dope shit I writ
Leavin' niggas stuck, I let stick
Trapped up in a web of a nigga that's sick

Uh
The nighttime comin', niggas, yeah (Yeah, son)
Without question
No doubt, my man took this shit to the grave, nigga
Understand?

Yo, I rose early mornin', spread my wings, yawnin'
Vague memory of last night, now it's all dawnin'
Looked down and see dried blood on all my garment
It stained on my Guess formers, kevlared enormous
I hopped up outta my bed holdin' my head
Flashbacks of gunshots shot past my head
I can recall an eight-man brawl, three men fall
Bullets flew, had to drug my man behind the wall
Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail
Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill
An eye for an eye, you know my science of life
Is you man or mice, thugs or the cowardly type?
I kick that '98 shit for your ears to list'
Nigga, P way ahead of his time, surpassed kids
(Fuck them kids be doin', yo?)
Kickin' rhymes that's true lies
Let me break 'em down to size, minimize they airtime
After this, you never will go back to that which
Sit back and write half-ass shit
The last official, taking out the artificial
Let me relieve you, replace that shit with some lethal
Mobb, remember the name, it's been along
Got niggas shook to death from the first fuckin' song
Fluidly, my mind flooded with jewels infinite
The chronic rap bandits, the addicts stuck on some live shit
Bear witness to this diligent street cat
I carry myself, hold myself down in fact
This one dedicated to my niggas on run
Holdin' big gats, go for your gun
Prepare to crush one, we trust none
Man who ain't down with the clan
The Mobb dynasty, apparently, you thought I was some other type
Nigga you could fuck with, you shit outta luck, boss
I break your compass, throw you way off course
We built this from ground up, started from ground zero
Mafia Onda, see the name up on the mural
Durable, physically fit, raps articulate
You get your whole skeleton cracked somethin' ridiculous

I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as a man
And learned to use my hands for protection in scuffles
Throwin' my blows in doubles
I'm comin' from Queens, motherfucker, carryin' guns in couples
And wildin', a Q-U soldier
From Lefrak to Rockaway, back to Queensbridge, black
It's only crack sales makin' niggas act like that
Back in the days we would scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time, I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime
With my Bed-Stuy connection connectin' in two
It's liable to start shit too wild for you
Peace to, Baisley, Forty-P get down

But wildin' ain't the way to be livin'
You're only gonna end up bloody on the floor shiverin'
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile, on the streets, ain't no more peace
My man, Stobo, kid, hold your own
In a cell locked down, not far from home
And at the same time on the outside, I'm representin'
Still packin' heat, make you cowards keep steppin'
Gettin' high, it's 'cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin' slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here?
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear
On the real, for real, but wait, it gets realer
Real like an innocent child that turned killer
It's things like that that only makes things iller
Makin' cream, doin' sticks if you ain't a drug dealer
(It's) only facts coming out of my mouth piece
As far as I can see, these streets is gettin' sour
Q-U, too much drama to get into
And niggas regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think, duke
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy, I'm livin' in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin' through life at a high speed
Watchin' all the slow runners pass by me

My little thug's sellin' drugs and he's strugglin'
The game got him buggin'
I tried to tell him, "Slow down, cousin"
But he vexed, and niggas gettin' wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorty's out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smokin' that 118 tiny Thai
Why? A nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that! My crew pump cracks and we pack MAC
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed, and he need to be blessed with a firepack
Don't even go there 'cause it ain't like that
Slow down, baby
He said, "What? You tryna play me? You must be crazy!"
Pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must've dazed me
Thug sellin' drugs, bustin' slugs, but he ain't crazy27Embed
Hell yeah! About to get my thug on
The 41st side of things

I used to be in love with this bitch named E&J
Don't fuck with her no more, now I fuck with Tanqueray
Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold (Yeah, that bitch)
Last name was English, and the first name Olde
But Gold couldn't take the dick, it made me lazy
We split apart, and now I met this new trick Dainy
Now me and Dainy, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this?
I bust her cherry, took her virginity in '91 (Word)
Now that she's open, everybody want to tap somethin'
Go get your own, don't make me have to fuckin' clap somethin'
I love my shorty more than life, now ain't that somethin'?
To love you, Dainy, more than livin' itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up, they tell me, "Put her back on the shelf"
They say, "Yo, P! She only wants you for one thing — that's your wealth"
But I don't pay attention, 'cause she's my baby, the Dainy
You know she drive me crazy, she's my number one lady
Met her back in '89, now she's 22, actin' like she 40 (Word)
She said "All I need is a man to support me
Besides, you from the 41st side of things (Uhh)
And Queensbridge niggas be actin' like they kings
Pushin' Lexuses, wearin' fat diamond rings"
My cellular phone reigns supreme, international, think rational
The 12th Street crew — move back when we come through!

Tommy Hil' was my nigga, and others couldn't figure
How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor
Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said a Brinks is comin' through, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Of motherfuckers, who ain't goin' out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
"Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers"
Diesel drove the the Bimmer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's actin' bolo, tryin' to say he the Boss
I said shut the fuck up! (Nahmean?) The kid is out with the loot sack (Word)
Got a big trey pound, itchin' just to swoop back
Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
Scope is on the top, so you know he livin' Eiffel
Took the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the Face!
All them other kids, they had they tools aimed at space
Levi had the snub, so you know they gettin' laced
Donna Karan was cryin' 'cause mad shells was flyin'
Damn, all we want is a piece of the pie and
Nike scooped the sacks 'cause he moves like Air
Threw them shits up in the trunk, now we up out here
Got back to the mansion to divvy up the paper
Helly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not! And Guess was hot, so guess what? (What?)
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut!
When you play with crime, sometimes it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceivin' to the eye
The end situation could leave your ass fried (Yo, a-yo)
That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by
(Yo, bring that Dainy home)

My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now, Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip, I thought the bitch was a fuckin' warlock
The more she started givin' me, the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew, then she started gettin' jealous
Steamed 'cause I spent more C.R.E.A.M. with the fellas
"Fuck them niggas! Spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy"
Then I thought to myself, "Yo, this trick is right!"
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggas started riffin', "Why you trickin'? Yo, this shit must stop!"
Moms like "You need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day"
But never that, I got the shakes so I need that
Son call me stressed out, I just be that
But when it comes to Henn Rock, dunn, I need that
She's my shorty for life, so fuck the feedback
I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's lost its brain
I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain

To all the brothers who ain't here
Pour a little somethin' on the floor
Time to get a little bent, do our thing
Word up! The 41st side of Queens gettin' bent, know what I mean?
It's an everyday thing
Henny got my mind in a headlock, Dainy got me goin' crazy
Dainy take me away, Dainy take me away28Embed

Yo, son, word is bond, dunn
Sometimes, I wish I had three different faces
I'm goin' to court for three cases in three places
One in Queens, Manhattan, one in Brooklyn
The way things is lookin', I'ma see central bookings
Facin' three 3-to-9's is mad time
After ran concurrent for assault and 2-9's
I gotta maintain, 'cause stress on the brain
Can lead to a motherfuckin' suicide thang
And plus my probation, a ill violation
How the fuck did I get in this tight situation?
I'm goin' all out, you know? Moves I never fake
And fuck the jake! They can catch me at my wake
And if I die, burn a bag of blade
Put the lye in the air, sometimes I just don't care

Son, I got plans, power movements, get on some rude shit
I keep livin' like this, I might lose it
My man's comin' home from doin' long-ass bids
What up, Kiko? I ain't seen your ass since we was kids
It's all strange; my niggas locked down thinkin' long range
And see their names in the Daily News, third page
They sent a kite to my nigga Killa
It only took one sword to put seven holes in his squealer
A 3-to-9 spendin' most of his time inside the bing
Reclined, and still came home with his shineYou might also like13Embed

(Shit is definitely real, boy!)
Yeah! We tryna get this loot any way, man!

A-yo, Queens get the money, long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle where the guns go blast!
The fool retaliated, so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now, who the fuck you think is livin' to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said, "Queens niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine, kid, stay outta my way"
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
But can't stop 'til I'm eatin' off a platinum plate
Po-po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever, but they can't deflate me
'Cause havin' cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to have no money to live with
I pause, step back, look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love, it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helpin' ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, plus a cellular

To the death of me, come and test me
Trust me, nigga can't touch me if he snuffed me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, 'cause I'mma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born wit' it, I'm gettin' on wit' it
And I'mma have it 'til I'm fuckin' dead and gone wit' it!
'Cause I'm a what?! Composer of hardcore, a lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, 'cause I'm a wild motherfucker!
You know I flow, you know my steelo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my P.O
Jump out my hooptie
Pass my gat and my lucci to my shorty, in case my P.O. try to troop me
To the Island, and if I start wildin'
Flippin' on niggas walkin' around with the nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped, see?
Back to Queens, pumpin' the fiends, makin' more C.R.E.A.M
Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya! Pull out my fo'-fo' and bust ya!

Yo, ain't no time for fakin' jax
'Cause brothers that fake jax get laid on they backs
The streets is real, can't roll without steel
I feel how I feel 'cause I was born to kill
Do what I gotta to eat a decent meal, brothers is starvin'
Don't try to find a job, son, it's all about robbin'
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown, dude!
Off the map, 'cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealin', only mess with shorties that's appealin'
I'm frontin' on the world once I start 4-wheelin'
'Cause back on the 41st Side, we do it right
Sippin' E&J, gettin' bent all night
Yo, who that?! I never seen him in my whole life
Step to his business 'cause it's only right
Po-po ain't around, so I grab my pound
Money retaliated, so I hit the ground
My life is on the line, gotta hold my projects down
Can't see myself gettin' bodied by a clown
Ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest, now he's layin' man down
Jetted up from under the benches, I started hearin' sirens
I stopped firin', to cut ass like a diamond
Jetted to the crib piece, what a relief
Stashed the heat, then proceeded to peep
Out the window, called my son, "Yo, son, we got beef!"
But no question, money had a problem so I solved him
I got my mind on a stick-up, now it's time to get paid
Thinkin' of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Gimme yours or get laid!
Give up the goods or get sprayed!

I got lots of love, for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them outta-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up!
Caught up in the crossfire, get theyself hurt up
While I be sippin' gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th Street, my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real, but you nameless
First of all, slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nothin' to play with
No jokes, no games, kid
For years, I been doin' the same shit
Just, drinkin' liquor, doin' bids
Extortin' crack heads, and stickin' up the stick-up kids!26Embed
You know what I'm sayin'?
I wanna say what's up to my man Louie — you know he's still here
Drop this one for you, you know?
And for those who don't know — The 41st Side

I keep it real, pack steel like my man YG
When a fool try to play me, wet him up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy, kid
Ran? I never did
Forever wildin', that's how we live up in the 'Bridge
You just sit scared
Cock back the Gat, then hit a nigga like a bid
25? Nah, kid, you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell, niggas is trife!
It's the semi-auto, you can bring it on, yo
I'm pullin' out, strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick, the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique, and get vic!
I'm on some bullshit, that's how I was raised, G
Each level is a stage
Have you slidin' down blazin', pools of alcohol
Walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this, you gonna take a fall
The Infamous Queensbridge — we on the scene, kid!
Creepin' on those who caught sleepin' — don't ever do that
I run with two MAC's, and plus my crew backs my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Dainy
Obey me, or get sprayed with the sweeper
'Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters and big heaters
Blow you three times, leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you, I know how to fix you
Pretty-boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue!
Word to my unborn — you get scolded, old and molded
When I get bent, you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get 'cross
Put you right on your back, take it to the source
No doubt, I'm stuck and I can't get out of this lifestyle
The 41st Side — get bent, run wild!
The 41st Side, too, you know how we do
Violate, motherfucker, I'mma see you
With the Linden, it's the start of your endin'
Settin' it again and again!

Every day of my life, since 11-2-74
On the street, makin' non-stop C.R.E.A.M. galore
Packin' heat, stickin' up weed stores and more
Collectin' interest off of extortions to settle my score
It gets deeper, when things get real
I'm down to stick a NatWest Bank for my meal
And I'm from Hempstead, it's close to the shacks of Park Side
While I be outside slingin', you always hide
And don't come around to the crossroads of life
Where to the death of you and me, there's beef for eternity
I'm goin' out to the fullest extent
So far into my troubles, it's hard for me to get back
To my everyday self and composure
Catch you when you open, then I bring you to a closure
Put ice on a razor, and freeze you in ya shoulder
I went for ya grill, but you dipped from my boulder
I know this kid who says he knows ya
Because of that, now I know where you lay your head at, and that's that!
Say no more, I put it on you while you was yawnin'
Murder without warnin' the very next mornin'

Don't try to cop pleas now, son, it's dead and done
(I gave you fair warnin') So run and get your guns!
It's on! Time to show 'em how I perform
My attitude will transform, leave you dead plus wrong
Gettin' the flow of things, representin' for Queens
Shit is real while you hopin' that it's all a dream
But you can't wake up, one in the chest, you blessed
Chokin' off your own blood

My beeper kept beepin', the other numbers started leakin'
"Who is this?" on my mind I was thinkin'
Then I realized it was my dunn playin' 9-1-1
Once I seen the numbers, I ran for the fuckin' guns
My dunn in trouble, I be there on the double
I jumped up in the bubble, "Yo, kid, where are you?!"
("114 — between Manhattan and Morningside Avenue")
"This happened just right out the blue?
A-yo, dunn, fuck that bitch! Tell her get off your dick!"
("But she's cryin' and she says she has feelings and shit")
Yo, it's a set-up! Them niggas got me fed up
"Ty, stay in the building
If they move — fuck 'em! Buck 'em! Get up!
Off the scene, you know what I mean?
And hold yourself down with the motherfuckin' 16-Glock
And get off they block"
Then I hung up the cellular, ready to rock!
And it's on!

Yo, you get deaded in the streets, kid, set it
You gots no credit, fool, you get wetted
Up with the semi-auto MAC double numbered
"Did he shoot eleven or twelve?" is what he wondered
Nigga, I got one more shot, you must be drinkin'
Put the heater to his head, watch him start blinkin'
"Am I goin' to heaven or hell?" is what he's thinkin'
Switch to a bitch as his life start sinkin'
Down to a level of no return
Call it the heat 'cause when the slugs hit, it definitely burns
Now chill, and think about your life for real
Every member of my crew is livin' life for real
Got yourself fucked into somethin' that you couldn't finish
Up against the fulliest squad and get diminished

It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookings, the way things is lookin'
It's Friday, you in for a long stay
Gettin' shackled on the bus first thing come Monday
Hopin' in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowin', home is a place you're not goin' for a long while
Now you're up on the Isle
And the position that you in got you refusin' to smile
But keep in mind, there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requestin' PC
You fragile, it ain't hard to see
Niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
'Cause the war in population's on infinitely
If this was the street, my razor would be a MAC demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screamin'
What you in for, kid? Bustin' nuts?
Cats heard of me in street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that?
Wisen up, young blood, before you make things escalate
And I would hate to set your crooked ass straight

Make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

All that gossip, motherfucker, don't you know my Glock kicks
Hollow tips, to your body, mad toxic?
I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I graze you
Pop goes the Glock when there's beef on the block
Chill for a while, make them think the beef stop
Then I creep like a thief in the night, it's only right
Ain't no turnin' back, it's on tonight
And if I get caught, then my ass is up north
Straight on a course for Upstate New York
Stressed, smokin' back to back cigarettes
In pop', dawg, on-point in the mess hall
But to avoid that, from head-to-toe dipped in all-black
Hit them niggas where they pump they cracks at
Havoc, with the murder master plan
Keep my 9 up to par so my shit won't jam
God forbid if my shit do
Run behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you
Slugs in your body, mainly in your brain tissue
Ditch from the scene, get ghost, stash the pistol
So simple, then watch my back, lay up and relax
Roll a sack K-A, black, find a shorty to tap
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

I got the powder, combine wit' the powder, and water
It oughta, drop in a half and hour
In the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil
Then I pause.. and ask God why
Did he put me on this Earth just so I could die
I sit back and build on all the things I did wrong
Why I'm still breathin', and all my friends gone
I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle
But my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries
And I can't turn it back, it's a part of me
Too late for cryin', I'm a grown man strugglin'
To reach the next level of life without fumblin' down or foldin'
I got no shoulder to lean on but my own
All alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse
Fuck the whole world, kid, my money comes first
'Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me
'Cause niggas will have you locked up
The snitch be your man
Givin' police the run down on your plans
But never goin' down like that
So I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
Illegal business, forever mines, fuck payin' taxes
The last kid that shitted and gave police access
To my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out
A lesson that you can't live without
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night

Now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped, so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'ma put you on
It's all messed up, somebody snitchin' on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now, just stay low
Once in a blue, I check to see how you're doin'
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They'd probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin' to find who they lookin' for, but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word, son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers to get they thug on, but oh, well
Son, they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
"Oh, you heard who did what?" — No, I don't know who did shit!
So stop askin', and I know I'm not goin' crazy
From windows, I see lights flashin' and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures, you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up a G, so everybody's pointin' fingers, and lyin'
A-yo, son! The temp is risin'

What up, black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops with wings on your back
That snitch nigga gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killa, listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around, tryna be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home, they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme, you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide, somewhere along the lines, your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminiscin' how I used to pick you up in the Ac'
Years ago, when we was younger
Seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin' who snitchin' got me losin lots of sleep at night
You know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops 'cause that shit ain't right!
Sometimes, I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn! Why the situation go down like that?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a couple of years 'fore we see you around
But 'til then, maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbin' wrong niggas, lookin' for someone to blame
They harassin', strugglin' to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out 'cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em!
But still.. (But still.., but still..)
The temperature's risin', no, there's nothin' surprisin' (Oh)
The temperature's risin', and ain't nothin' surprisin' (Yeah)

Yo, however do u want, however do you need P

You walk a fine line playin' wit mine, the greatest story ever told in rhyme
We climax in ninety-five, wit demo raw raps is knives
To skin all ya’ll cats alive
Take your time don’t rush the clock, Infamous rock for good now
Pass like my duns on lock holdin' the pot down slow
But assuringly, spoon-feeding these
Starvin' ass heads catchin' shakes, feenishly
I ball in this, word assortin' this, probably recording this
Of course kids keepin' they sights upon this
Exclusiveness, like some new type of kicks
We got them things fixed, passed the wrong man in my click
You get charged wit intent to kick that bullshhh
Welcome to the ledge of this whole shhh

My kind of dunns'll be the ones that'll clap at you
Yeah, that's how it's going down, so what's the drill now, do it
We'll reach out and touch anyone tryna act brand-new
Don't even go that route, throw on your running shoes and make moves

Yo, for my QBC duns, it’s all real, we hold it down
You bust yours, we bust ours and stand on firm ground
Pass the dutchie while I, handle the Henny thinkin'
You never catch me sleepin', stay on top of this properly
I know they watchin' me, if not they probably waitin' for a downfall
Scheming on my property, we got the remedy
Let em get a little cold, let em smell the tree smoke
Hit 'em where we blow and don’t let nobody know
Theres snakes in the grass, you gotta watch where you movin', son
Shots get loaded, don’t ever run wit' the crowd, son
Stick and move, you hear me?
And that’s the way we rock it
The only way to live, if you really think about it
Every move is humble wit' precision, careful thought decisions
And my whole cli-tique the same vision
41st till I dearly depart
'Til then, I’ll be somewhere gettin' bent up in a den
Sippin' gin, while you shook cats just pretend to be
Something that your not, and that’s not good my friend
On a personal, I ain’t even feelin' you cats
Don’t even acknowledge the fact that you weak raps
We bust gats at, on the reg' laugh at
Son, you know we passed that
Get 'em outta here, 'cause you could have that

Four pounds, stumbled off grounds
Fire off many a rounds, I heard return fire 3% of the time
Your dogs was wives actin like girls, get feminine when handlin' guns
You could run or take the window, son
Or feel this hot one, we rip all strifes dun dun
Without a fight' thump, we keep the house dope like piefienies
We twist and pop Henny, gettin' wet on the daily, and
Peers get chilly, turnin' macks fully
Now they bandin', court rehanded and got remanded, faught
A one to three degree from V-O-P and N-C-C-V
And send me up a hub to a state facilities
What could I do but sneak, burn a tree, or tobacco leaf
Or wait until my time served and get released
Cool, back on the streets I seen some old drama
I still hold heat to send your ass straight to trauma
These kids started to drilling like they ready and willing
I gave em exactly no time to switch feelings
Pulled out, told my man, "look out"
Commits to warfare, and rock these to sleep like this here
Seventy-two like as if I was back on the top
Hours of thinkin' about how I'mma tip they ass up out the basket
Belligerent glass heads, I’m bashing
No knowledge of the man nor his action
Class now is in session, “Soldiers boys, today’s aim is: Never show your heat
And don’t flame it”
You playin' life, wit a man who lives by the sword
And dies naturally against all karma and laws
What, speed on and get peed on
You wanna take the chance
I see it on your face
Do you think dunn hold it down son?
Boy don't be afraid
You made a sudden move
And my crew backed yours right down
41st side got the got the answer
We the most Infamous Mobb around
The heat goes up, the heat dies down
It's hot like Hell On Earth over here on this side of town
QBC in it, be in it
The jakes ride up, the D's just bounce
And in between we gotta get to screamin' at fiends all around
My money y'all, word up, word up

And my kind of dunns'll be the ones that'll clap at you
Blastin' at you son, what up?
We'll reach out and touch anyone tryna act brand-new
Get splashed too, what, what
And my kind of dunns'll be the ones that'll clap at you1Embed
Yeah, sendin' this one out to my man Killa B
No doubt, indeed
Where that weed? Nahmsayin'?
That old real shit

There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady!
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together — it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me, the Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say, so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

I'm trapped in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low, the juice go
But never that! As long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-O's lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin, when he got bagged, that fucked me up, God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're Upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two-to-four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get, I'm stayin' in the projects forever!
Jakes on the blocks — we out-clever
If beef, we never separate, roll together
When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin' cute! I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin' L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the 'Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines

Let me start from the beginnin', at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav? Situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya
And leave your corpse for the cops to discover
While I be pimpin' in the Range Rover, all jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryna knock me and lock me
But I be on the low sippin' Asti Spumante
Niggas tried to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack — it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep lettin' them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm outta town, one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours, and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps? I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children, make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile, but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus, the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket, hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter-soft leather upholstery
But mostly, keep the gat closely 'cause niggas wanna toast me
You might also like
A-yo, I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my 9 serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organize fiend servants
Tryna make a mill is stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, 'cause everythin' is real
Cuz, I wanna chill, laid up in a Jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly, with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught, dead up in New York
My brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost, never found again, my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last restin' place'll be a ditch, kid!
No one can stop me — try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me? You're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably

As time goes by, an eye for an eye

So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
A drug dealer's dream:
Stash C.R.E.A.M., ki's on a triple beam
500 SL green, '95 nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor-made ostrich, Chanel for my woman friend
Murderin', numbers on your head while I'm burglarin'
Shank is servin' 'em
What's up to all my niggas swervin' in New York metropolis
The 'Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watchin' us
Mad man, my sanity is goin' like a hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced tryna bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you
Niggas who could've killed you is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar movin' on your weak production
Pumpin' corruption in the third world, we just bustin'!

Hold up and analyze — the wild cats sling cracks, they swing in Ac's
The new routines be my eyes
Blacks playin' corners, glancin' all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane, right?
Word, yo, I wanna get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front, you go
Sip beers — the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin and Queensbridge — we robbin' niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale, but the real, we still kill!
WHAT!
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye

I feel the blessin' even when it's all disguised up
Even when the stress try to pile up
Paper in my hand give me wild rush
Reminiscin' on wild us and rollin' the miles up
So if I wager, I'm never putting the pound up
Let 'em hate, bitch, I built it from ground up
I hold the fort down, nigga, now what?
You could see it in the lives that my sound touched
I make money, take money, my aim hungry
Spit a verse, it ain't nothing short of a green loogie
Bucket list complete, I did a song with Bun B
And Juicy J, who the fuck fuckin' wit' me? I think nada
Lame rappers you Lady Gaga
The part you dear depart these niggas like I'm shootin' commas
State your business or forever hold your peace
Go 'head with that bullshit, motherfucker, I'm sweet

Got damn, who would've thought it would've been me?
Street legend that came up with a pen, G
16 bars to get me out the ghetto
And I always kept it real with the people, I never settle
There's a lot of folks dependin' on me to lead 'em the right way
Instead of listenin' to what the radio might play
Some real game for somebody that did it
Who could break it all the way down so everyone could get it
And I gotta admit it, the road was bumpy
Hand-to-hand combat, sometimes I live lumpy
You can't win every fight, but you gotta fight though
Just make sure when you on the side of right, bro
You don't go in thinkin' you makin' history
But lookin' back in retrospect it ain't no mystery
Nobody ain't ever did what we did then

And make them niggas hate in back with brand new waitin' tissue
They sick to they stomachs, fuck 'em, I ain't never loved 'em
Peace to my niece, they ain't never pulled no dumb shit
Peace to the youth
The young soldiers in the street who gettin' to the money, they remindin' me of me
When you get that, better keep that, better not let that drop
'Cause someone gon' be right there and they'll take yo spot
We got our lane mastered, yeah, we got it locked
My haters wanna blast, man, you better stop
'Fore shit get good, you could see his guts
And it's too late for surgery, they can't patch 'em up

You see these gold chains of slavers, never had that to make payments
Yeah, I came from the basement, but now I vacate in Vegas
I come sell out in your state, nigga, just to make a statement
Nah, nigga, stay high, the bitch I'm with is high maintance
Homie, play me if you wanna, I got all my goons on
We gon' catch a body, but you gon' catch a tombstone

We still comin' up, that's what my dollar say
Ain't about no guap then stop, homie, we can't conversate

Uh, jumped up from sleep, soaked in sweat
Heart beatin' crazy from a dream I had
We was doing it up, cash flowin'
I know you hear me, nigga, but you not knowin'
Champagne bottles and honeys floatin' in the pool
So much poppin', the jacuzzi was full
Mad hoes for the bro
And everybody rollin' up, we could all smoke
Pure Molly, good golly, that turned up the whole party a few notches
Hold up, it's all comin' back now
Cocaine buffet, mini mountains of that pretty white girl
The DJ played all the right songs, we was all faded
Bottles on the house, half naked broads on the couch
Gettin' poked up, warmin' up

Then I woke up and I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it

Weed in the air, these hatin' niggas still on my dick
I had a dream that my niggas came home
Celebratin' life, then I woke up, my shit was blown
Tragic, I had a dream I had floor seats
In L.A. watchin' Bird and Magic
Exotic cars, money off-shore
Good weed, my niggas with me on tour

Coke on the scale, money for the bail
Lookin' is the rear view, feds on the tail
Used to mix E&J with Ginger Ale
Sold crack when my moms drank pink champale
Now I'm in Anguilla on a ship that sails
Out the St. Maarten, got them bricks in them mail
I don't play with the money 'cause the bread get stale
Rather sleep in a box 'fore I sit in a cell
Raisin' a wine glass, spliff in the air
I'm a gangsta, shoot me in the head if I tell
Kingpin, rap nigga dreams at twelve

Last night watched TV but it watched me
Know what that mean, motherfucker fell asleep
Then I fell into a dream, it was so real
I was out in Vegas, blew about a half mil
Rode the strip, Rodeo we was club hoppin'
Finger poppin', had drugs droppin'
Hangover three, had bottles non-stoppin'
Top of her lungs, "World is ours!" need a lozenge
In the Luxor caused the up-roar
Celebration time lift up your cups for
If it ain't us, who the fuck you come for?
Jumped on the G5s, back to the East Coast
Rich ass nigga still keepin' the heat close
Landed, bitches on deck to deepthroat
To scavenge for liquor and c-notes
They woke up to a bed full of freak shows
And I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it

I had a dream that my first contract was a good one
When I get in I'ma let the whole hood come
Visualizin' all the things that could come
I did a lot of bad shit, I'm the good son
Everything paid for, we don't lease shit
My niggas still wit' me, that's G-shit
Four chandeliers, Master P shit
In the middle of the ocean, sea sick
Gorgeous, top of the Forbes list
No such as thing as, 'I can't afford this'
Pinky ring, sky dweller, iced out Choca
Money talks so I spoke up, then I woke up

And I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream

This the killa's shit, dunn

For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night

Yo, when the gat's revealed, you cats get peeled, and that's the deal
Fuck a bitch-ass that switch fast, niggas that lack the real
When the slugs burst, G Rap be aimin' at your mug first
Niggas is blood-thirst, we'll see who get plugged worst
We dug earth, the place we put the nickel-plate is to your facial
Bullets ain't racial, kid, they only hate you
My nine'll seem like it's a time machine — B.C. date you
Jackin' you more than Ripper
My fifth's a organ shifter
The human organism lifter
You'll be hearin' organs if ya leavin' orphans, if ya
Let these fours hit ya where the Lord split ya
I forbid ya to bump heads with those that dump lead
Accurate shots in back of your knot, leavin' one dead

When the gat spits, some niggas get blown off the atlas
The half is — unsolved mystery re-enactments get practiced
What you lack is — you think like the average
Jakes dumbfound and leavin' crime scenes entangled
Nothin' but cannons, gat conspicuous
Like a laminate, or branded, with the serial scratched
Bad apple outta the batch, dunn, they made me like that

Draw blood for my niggas G.O.D, Ty Nitty and Twin
And Twin is not here, plus my kin

The more shots they hold, the better they feel it
What be the deal is? Some killers like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespect, and the rest
Are so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be burstin' off guns like a Vietnam vet
On the steps, sittin' in the staircase bent
Thinkin' on ways to take another man head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth
Change clips, switch clothes after I spit
Place niggas back in they space, fuck is on your mind, kid?

Catch a rec with the what what (nickel-plated tec)
Guns are blasting, bodies dropping to the floor faster
Than years are passing and I'm gasping for air I swear
'94 kick it raw. The B-I-G N-O-Y-D kick it hardcore
Escalate, elevate my rhymes to another level
Huh, Im I share my feelings with the devil

Ayo it's the hard times that got me generating hard rhymes
I'm confined to the projects running from one time
Confide in my peoples they confide in me
'Cus if It's alright with them if it's all right with me
So we be, upstairs at the tables planning
Thinking of ways we can make this happen
On this planet, I'm struggling
Wanna be hustling
So I'm ready to face any kind of repercussion
If its Jail or death, crippled up or broke
The only thing I'm thinking is slinging that Coke
To get on son, hitting niggas off for packs
Only niggas from my block 'cus we get down like that
As I combat the snakes and rats, watch my back
Don't wanna be the one caught swallowing cracks
Looking reazy, before it goes down I be ready on point
Jump on my bike and get deady
It's a family thing. I got love for my crew
Pour some beer for the niggas that ain't here (True)
Yeah my man Richie Lou, rest in Peace

Don't ask why It's just like that. I was brought up to live the wrong way
At night to God I pray
Will he let me breathe another 24 hours of air?
I really don't deserve it
But really I don't care
From what I see, whatever is, it's meant to be
So untill I drop, its the crime life for me
Some say I need help, because the way i'm living's sick
I reply, "Mind your own 'fore you be another vic"
Many years of corruption, what will I end up with?
Nothing but a pocket full of memories of foul shit committed as a youngster
Grand larcenist/petty thief
Yo imma make this brief
In my early years, I was living fouler than most
Smile all up in your face take your money and get ghost
Shit ain't right
And I might regret it later that night
While I be laying in bed holding my thoughts tight
Waking up early in the me-our
Do my thing correct so it don't lead to the pe-nal
'Cus fuck that shit, I'll rather roam the streets freely
Plan a box to get
Send you home hurt, crying, broke feeling upset
Don't take it personal, I'm only tryna live
Tonight we taking donations so what you got to give?
The dirt underneath my fingernails got a story to tell of they own
All things is shown, ain't nothing to hide. I speak the raw truth
Uncut
Rewind my whole verse if there is anything you overlooked
'Cus I don't got time for your bullshit talk
'cus niggas getting murdered in the streets of New York
So at the same time, I'm outside taking mine

Wanna be celebrity thugs, a lot of mouth, yeah
Oh my god, we could not be fucked with

We under the microscope, they all watchin' us
We have no choice but to keep it trill, they sizin' us
And if they wasn't, God always pay attention, don't he?
I couldn't live with myself bein' phony
Look, if life was a game, then I guess we winnin'
'Cause this life we made for ourselves is bitchin', uh

Didn't want to do it but the voices tug and pullin'
On my eardrums, something that I knew I shouldn't
Got me wildin' with the ratchet out like shit is legal
Lookin' for a victim, put 'em in the fetal
Fuck is going on? When it's on, I know it's on
But shit not really poppin' and I'm lookin' for a war
Lookin' out my window, pointin' shit at police
To make matters worse, I'm sippin' on some OE
Shit got me buzzin', I'm already buggin' though
With mad other bottles that I drank about a month ago
Fuck is on my mind? I'm feelin' bipolar
Plus paranoid, lookin' over both shoulders

I have nightmares, nightmares, all the time
I wake up, I look up, shook up
Say fuck, put my hands on my nine
Niggas I cut, or we stuck, and they move
So we buck, they come back
In my dreams at night I have nightmares
Nightmares, all the time

Last night I had a vision of my dead friends in my sleep
They showed my things, I ain't really wanna see
They showed me flashbacks of murder
Scenes, bodies bubblin', in acid tubs
With they feet head and hands cut off
Oh shit, I had woke up buggin', sweatin' bullets
Checkin' for my gun, I gotta
Stop smoking that haze or something
I know I ain't crazy, I'll go outside for
Some fresh air maybe, it's 3 o'clock in the night
The block is on fire, took
My nigga bottle for a swig oh the fire
He told he just had seen the bitch ass
Nigga, must be god that's keeping me from seein' this nigga
Wanna crawl on me, and creep on me
Cause they know better then to let me see him in front
Of me, outside the car, away from the police
I'll turn him into dreams, demons in my sleep

Every time I go to sleep its like I stroll down memory lane
And see the dirt I've done before I acquired the fame
If you can see what I see, you see me
Poppin' the chain, or you see me scrappin'
I pull out and pop off that thang
I'm usually hustlin', bubblin', slingin' that 'caine
No matter the weather its sun
Snow sleet or it's rain, see fiends got a habit
It hurts so they feedin' they
Vein, and I gotta habit of havin' grams of it man
I'm chasin' the paper, it' simple i'm bout my bread
I cock it and pop it your white tee will turn red
See niggas that know me, who owe me, they see me
They run, they know
If I catch em I cut em for feed em my gun
It's real in the field, nigga front
And get yo cap peeled, with that nina, that tech
That ooo wop or that mac mill,  unload then reload, I live by the streets code
And pray to lord have mercy on my soul

I wake up in sweat, my girl think i'm sniffin' that 'caine
I try to remember, but none of
Them ever the same, I dream of my brother
But never since he passed away
He talk to me, and I can't hear nothing he say
Fuck it, go along with it, just be happy to see him
I think that nigga tryna tell me something
Though, when I see him I forget to ask him
Fuck I wanna know
Probably tryna to tell me, your gun , it better blow
When you in the street
Can't react slow, cause niggas in this rap game, think shit sweet
Getting disrespectful like I won't push meat
Should be poppin' off in my dream but then I get caught
Is he tryin' to tell me so my soldiers cause you a bust
Niggas wanna see my down, I ain't 'fraid of getting poked
Damn if I ever go broke
I have nightmares, nightmares, all the time

Thank god for the Mobb, we keep it alive
Respect to the newcomers but respect mines
I'm young spitfire like a flamethrower
H the reason I'm dope now, I told him
My brother I got this, we got this
Sealed in the bag my bro, It's in the pocket
Fresh from the era of big terror
Yeah we made it bitch, most niggas never
Now look us now, we like a mirage
Of the day everything sought a boss
Captain Hooks, I front you at sixteen
Lend niggas a few lines, yeah thats mine
This groundbreaking fresh, there is no blueprint
Set a few trends then move on to new shit
All praise is due to Infamous too
Fuck is that shit you rap, It's not truth

In a sober tongue, spit it so deep
Lock at the bottom, I'm lowkey
Don't want you anymore, she chose me
Fuck outta here kissing on the rosery

Can you blame me, I was raised from a cold street
Makes for a better story what they told me
Sad part this shit is real life
Pressure on me 'nuff to break a fuckin' steel pipe

Wipe blood on my razor blade
Teach niggas how to chill out and make way
When you see me take it easy, best believe me
Its the real world nigga not TV

(Get bent, keep wilding)
Stop smilin', and still don't nothin' move but the money

Stop smilin', but still don't nothin' move but the money
(Gimme yours, or get your manhood taken)
Stop smilin', and still don't nothin' move but the money
(Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin')
(Yo what you wanna do with that black deuce deuce)

Hit you up, take that cash, you ain't slug proof dude
Takin' yours to survive, it's only matter of time
I'm snatchin, livin' grimy, runnin', never look back
The root of evil got me actin' like that
Life ain't a game, the streets is mortal combat
I wasn't blessed with the silver spoon
Since my born, I was doomed, confined to one room
Now you's a customer
Cop it from natural born hustlas (that's what he thought kid)
Stupid son, you get extorted

Open your eyes, get wise, and look alive, pay attention
I'm manifestin', my slugs be leavin' niggas guessing
You tried to graduate, but didn't know enough lessons
Time is of the essence, and yours is runnin' out
Fast, you won't last, livin' out your life like that
You shoulda got down with my crew, slingin' cracks international
But instead, you wanna merge with the rivals
And moves like that could end up homicidal
You suicidal, and I'm (alive on arrival)
Play the drug game with precision, and never with division
I'm tryna see addition, food to fill my kitchen
Some faggot niggas snitchin' givin' info
We'll do a drive by, in a stolen black pinto
With tinted windows, bullets will flurry through your system
Your man ran, lucky for him, because we missed him
We'll catch him on the rebound, but see now
I'm tryna make this money and you tryna stop me, what's it gonna be now?
You stand up to my crew and get laid down
On the ground with the big four pound
You hear the sound on the other side of town
Where caps get peeled
Break you off, love, love, give you somethin' to feel

You don't have to tell me twice
I know when to chill when I have to
But if I have to, I'll still clap you
I'll crack through your fortress
You couldn't hold it down, so you lost it
No crew could withstand the forces
Never second guess me, just bless me
Stop smilin', bodies stackin', dead presidents pilin'
We wildin', lifted, terror three sixes
They got a petition, for my conviction
Rise to the occasion
When it's time for blazin', on the 41st side
Niggas is cravin' for beef, we can handle it
It ain't nothin' cause we use to it
It's all good, the hood we ran through it since young
It used to be candy, but now it's guns
Stickin' niggas son, my job ain't done

My life is all about riches, and bitches
Snitches get stitches
Want me to put you on? Keep wishin'
You need to learn the rules and conditions
There's facts that you missin'
Sit back and take notes man, listen
First of all, the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The C.R.E.A.M. will have you shittin' on your people
Livin' like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothin' changed but the clothes that my money bring
I'm makin' figures that I never thought possible
You tryna slow me down, you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of Tecs, and Amacuras
Kid, you get your cap peeled backward
For years, I been tryna blow for years
Gettin' bent off my wet, spend a G on beers
Livin' life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet
'Til the coke oil drops to the bottom of the pot
My invincible  crew will never stop
If you lookin', you can find me risin' to the top, I'm a classic
Approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floatin' in the river witchya body wrapped in plastic
I'm tryna make a half a million, triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I could still hear his voice while he up in the skies
While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love, and I can't give it up

I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the nine, let my heat serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organized fiend service
Tryna make a mil, it's stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills,  get your cap peeled, cause everything is real
But I wanna chill, laid up, in a jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
You get your life lost, never found again my friend
Mission completed, watch you droppin' less than 10
On the road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place will be your ditch kid
No one can stop me, try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me, you're just an imitation copy
The theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' fat whips and livin' comfortably

My life is all about riches, and bitches
Snitches get stitches

Word up, dunn

Yo, my rap taste good in my mouth like Deer Park
For your ears to list-this
You don't wanna miss this, dunn
Don't be a statistic
Keep your rhymes to yourself, we make fools out of niggas
And write shit that certainly'll move y'all niggas
Peace, to my Sumner villains in pink houses
From Red Hook, to QB, y'all know the routine
We need a movie to show how our life so ill
Every summer in the projects we partied on the benches
A few gallons of gin and Pepsi
Remember party balls (I remember that shit)
That was back in like '90
We used to roll oo-wees, now we stuff Dutches
Bing bust it, what's your discussion
Y'all niggas talk a lot of shit heard you on the tape frontin'
I fakes nothin', ya fuck around and push the wrong button
I dedicate my days to seein' you drip blood
Will always love Gambo and Scarface
Killa Black, no man can fill your shoes
Now what's bad news
It couldn't get no worse, so what y'all niggas know about the turmoil
What y'all know about the blood, soil, clothes and little hoes
And the legs of pants, slugs that crack the shin bone
The other shots blast through your left clavicle
Melt switch suits and paint the avenues

Revoke situation that you couldn't last through
If I can't have it all, then I don't want it at all
Off top serious dog, I'm out for the brawl
Battle the world, shit I kick'll dazzle your girl
Handle the bitch
Can't? Then take this referral
Hit 'em with the pink slip, get 'em bent to earl
Hennessy got my mind locked, tight in a curl
Hold it down like Saddam, you can't search my crib
Even with dirty worms I'ma still appear

How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?

Yo, yo, my pen is sick like a heroin addict, whenever Mega spits
I exhale preciseness, drug dealer ghetto shit
Sweat in my hand, plus the finger numb from measuring grams
Gun on my waist, in case I see son, who wetted my man
I be Gore-Texing to death, rockin' ice with special effects
It's obvious that I was destined to rep
Yo my persona is the drama, my Infamous conglomerates
Considered mad real, niggas feel the Montana shit
Born official, my niggas that's gone I miss you
I shed a tear, see y'all niggas when I get there
Yo my dunn did six years and still didn't hit the strip
I'm waiting on the day, when Rikers Island ciphers incomplete
When I can sleep with no heat, hidden beneath the sheet
And I can relax with my Air Max, appearing on my feet
When I rhyme you enter my mind
Seein' niggas need the excellence
I represent is manifested in the beat
Respect this, like a Lexus Jeep
My technique, leaves my enemies stressed for weeks, vexed at me
Especially knowin' my destiny is near
They scared to death of me, they fear
To even question me, I serve 'em like I'm stretchin' keys, please

The Infamous got PC for days
We runnin' through townships, fuckin' shit

Hustle mad bricks, Queensbridge, no doubt, rep the clique
9-6, droppin' wild on some Benzes
Some next shit, crash bar, ask the God
I remember when loadin' up the gats, beef settlin'
Ghetto peddling the Sonder, shorty dead again
Songs about we all around the NC
Cop the E series, jealous ones envy
Hate to see me but got the nerve to wanna be me
I bleach blind 'em, you can't see like Stevie
I'm on TV, Vidbox and all that

Straight thugs on this side, it's do or die to the death
Like the terminal ill takin' they last breath
Read your last rites, God, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit, takin' a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin' my will, you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin' noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids
Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggas love to see when
Niggas slippin' off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin' your ice, appraisin' it like the Diamond District
Jeweler with they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, wanna get caught lifted
Or sober, so you can react quick?

Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way, we came a long way
From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, Nextel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home

Under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
Nastradamus, last one to blast when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin' and flee with the murder weapon

Let me put you on to what happened, son
You ain't gonna believe this shit
Kick that shit

It's just another day, drowning my troubles wit' a forty
That's when I got a call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, "Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower"
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
'Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
(Check it out, son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus, this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe, I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, 'Fuck the world' is my mental
We put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed-Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity to reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle, outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs didn't froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, "Eyes open 'cause it might go down"
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see
We jetted through Marcy 'cause D's ain't bagging me

On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck

Kid, you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide? No days
Son, get the heat, 'cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo, if that nigga front, yo, hit him!)
Aight, bet, so just hold it down
While I cock back the long three pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time, kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprise
"What's going on?" as I reply
"Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide"
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects, keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that, we juxing
If you got what we like, it gets tooken

Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessy, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me, but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's
But all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure

A lot of money got made, drugs got sold
Lives got took on these corners so cold, oh
Imagine if these street lights, could talk and tell the story of the street life
Every ghetto in America is all the same
Chasing after money got us all insane, oh
Imagine if these street lights, could talk and tell the story of the street life

Ah, I look back and reflect doing a hundred pass
Thinking about it got me heavy on the gas
Vivid is the picture coded in my DNA
Mammy bless her heart, as we walked out the door she would pray for us
Knew that Jake was on us, deck stacked against us
Same shit different toilet, uh
Another life flushed down the commode
Left the house without saying goodbye and didn't come home
It's all too common, and prolly me if it wasn't for rhyming
I put that on my brother who was wildin with the iron
The hood is full of life but inside niggas dying
Instead of prosperity, only jealousy's thriving
Street lights... made as makeshift memorials
Know how the story goes, I ain't trying to bore you though
I'm just trying to shed a little light
Job done, even if I save only one life, listen

Missing dark tunnel vision, the light at the end, damn is anybody listening
I'm talking to myself again, we so close but yet it seems so far
It's like 10 steps back and just one step forward
Just one more push and sixteen more bars
Closer to the dreams we have, the life we want
If these blood sweat and tears could talk, they'd be arguing
With the look in our eyes saying all, listen
That bone in your head, get shattered like a windshield
Now how that shit feel?
Yeah you got a lot of nerve, you deserve
Every drop of that pain, when you playing with the Mobb
Can't you see we concentrating on this baking
Lot of lives got taken, lot of time spent in the cages
So we spend our days just
Doing whatever must be done to become
The ones that steady burn like the sun because
A lot of money got made, drugs got sold
Lives got took on these corners so cold, oh

So many disappear out here
One time I saw a man with a gun
Chasing another nigga trying to run
And even know they grew up on the same block
He ain't hesitate to gun him down in the same spot
The nigga that you knew from elementary
Will make your ass an unsolved mystery

A lot of money got made, drugs got sold
Lives got took on these corners so cold, oh

All shook, now he the crook son

Aw fuck it, let the little nigga live!
Yeah right, then have these other niggas up my wig
No mercy, shit left me about
Years ago, I let him in, I'll see him out
And now he on the floor just bleeding out
You know it's on when you see me and my team out

We conquer, overpower and crush
Come and get washed up

E's back, easy man, move before we seep that
Lame ass team that you got off of the mat
Weak cat, pull it back, please do repeat that
Queens rep: we got more than a little of that
We used to daydream on the bench how we could cease this
And conquer like the British in snapbacks and fitteds
Getting soaked up, no love, the boy's back, he showed up
Soldier up, you know it up, come and get folded up
Your bitch is attracted to all of this madness
She want a felon, she ain't fuckin with no graduates
Bad hood, bitch magnet, I'm a savage
They just wanna fuck, niggas wanna talk marriage
Baby carriage, sittin in a tree
While I be pipin em down inside of hoopties
Like, longer, harder, this mobb shit stronger
Than all of y'all weak music, we conquer

Niggas know, and if they don't
I shoot 'em in the head, whatever rock his fucking boat
Niggas in my face, you better leave before you can't
I lick shots like stamps, no FedEx
I'm hot, check the critics, call the paramedics
Your man was talking reckless so you know he had to get it
Me and money's magnetic, and you the polar opposite
Come through, bitch start dropping it, getting low
I don't gotta trick, the only Magic I know
Wore the number 32 and retired some time ago
So check the liner notes and miss me with the bullshit
Miss me with it or get hit with a full clip
I'm back on it, you could bet your ass on it
I'm so sure that I could put my fucking last on it
And if I didn't sell it then you know I rapped on it
Beat so ugly, gotta put a fucking mask on it

We get it forever
It's on forever
Calm down, never
Slow it down, never
We get it forever
We do this forever

Calm down, never

Looking through my eyes' view I see nothing but
Success for us, non-stop nothing but
Long money, long jab I stretch
Wrap around the Earth, 80 times 10
Warm breezes and Barbado' nights
Living sweet, yeah, but it's a cold life
You know we strapped in, best you buckle up
I did my little bit of years, yeah, what's up, what's up
Dare a nigga trouble us, make my niggas risk all of this
Infamous good shit, so quick
I'll be back inside the cage, my rage is unchanged
For this change, yeah, this bank, for Hav' is worth the pain
Change and pinky rings, estates for the kings
A Queens-bred gentlemen, she know how we bang
You tamper with this plush lifestyle, may you lay
In a hole 'til you ferment and bones decay

We come from where murders occur often on late nights
Niggas is high and they eyes be red as two brakelights
Medical marijuana, Henny bottles, and Grey Goose
Semis and shotties on deck, everybody's face screwed
But you know this already, my hood the coldest and deadly
Soldiers is ready, I am boastful, forgive me
Bitches talking to cops, cry when they nigga get washed
Beef could've been squashed, go finish that shit that you start
No clip in your Glock, you ain't prepared to fire
We call that riding with no air in your tire
You're flattened, it's a pattern after scrapping
What usually happen, death on arrival
Survival of the Fittest, ain't nothing like that Queensbridge shit
Y'all niggas finished, your only chances are diminished
And we don't need no fucking witness
Ain't what you know, it's what you live and we live it

We get it forever

Calm down, never

America's public enemy number one, is drug abuse

Pay attention, everything I mention's a jewel
All I gotta do is whisper to make the fetti move
The Constitution I go by, cash rules
Everything around me, through movements' grass roots
Started from the bottom, bottom of the pyrex
Hand in hand until that money went high tech
Keep a ledger in the macbook
The crystal ball to us was watchin’ the crack cook
Forseen undisclosed amounts
Bentleys, Ferraris, overseas accounts
Major assets, forgot my address
Got too many of 'em, I don't believe I can have stress
And I’m straight from the projects
Niggas gotta heart, but we don't got a conscience
But I gotta complex, I don’t ever wanna be a bum
So I’m counting money 'til my fingers go numb

Leave a burn like the alien blood in this age of Aquarius
Fear me not, I’m here to guide you through the various stages of changes and consciousness
High of the life and haze, am I a hypocrite?
Chunky black with cat piss, call it Wiz Khalifa
Swinging trees like Tarzan and Latifah
Got me hide in sun, moon, stars and wheezy
All the hash smell, hoes in ya clothes be easy and
Close ya eyes while I rhyme these lines
These black cocaine lines
Now picture me in ya mind
At the concert live
We well worth the ticket
A 120 minutes of ya favorite P lyrics
Yeah that dirty New York, reality rap, that Mobb shit
Classic like Biggie, but we fresh like Minaj is
Now who you know got a flow so timeless?
Who write about more than just cars and diamonds?
It’s more than just whatever new gun's in style is
Prodigy the brainiac kid
Word to baby Jesus
This baby faced genius is lasted so far for 80 seasons
What makes you believe that I will stop now
And allow Mobb Deep to collapse to the ground?
You crazy? I even make that thought get up?

Don't want to leave it, you already know
We so in love but what can we do?
My wife is your best friend
How the fuck did we let this thing get so far gone?
There's no way we could fix it
Baby boy on the way, if she only knew that's mines
Shit is like a daytime soap or movie on Lifetime
But nah, nigga, this real life and it hurts
Missin' you or lyin' to her I don't know what make it feel worse
And me puttin' her first makes me feel like shit
I hate seein' you cry, wipe away your tears
Fuck it, I'ma just leave her but what about our kids?
Don't wanna break they little hearts, let's wait a few more years
Oh God, I swear to God I wish that we could just bounce
Don't even pack no bag, just break the fuck out

How can we love when we love

Came around to check up on y'all, I know my homie do the same
Guilty like a motherfucker, how we get into this thing?
That love shit is real, is all that wrong?
People lookin' at us like we crazy
Now we spend nights on the phone all night long
Got so much in common, this shit is crazy
It's more than just physical 'cause mentally you stimulate me
And if I ain't up on it, baby, you just educate me
And vice-versa, that's what we both in search of
Want to love and get it, somebody that we could nurture
Is it wrong?

Since we was nineteen, damn, she still fine as shit
Remember at the card tables feelin' on my dick?
Got pregnant by that nigga, I ain't seen her since then
It ain't nothin' like the hood, sittin' on top the benches
You terrified where I'm comfortable in the trenches
Most of my friends is in projects, nigga
Brooklyn, Queens, the whole NY, nigga
Nigga, pull your card like a ATM
Mistook me for fool, found out that I'm poison on the block

A staple in the hood like the liquor store
In the church, I'm cut from a different cloth
The fabric of life in every Hav verse
Pull your cabbage wig worm, I did mad dirt
Deserve this groove so you fear to lose
Have your whole team rockin' R-I-P tattoos, rested and hooked to IVs
N-Y-C, city of the crime scene
Paint a better picture, call me ace Banksy
They scoop you off the floor like fall raked leaves
Nigga, take a knee 'cause this one over

Where do he sleep and how can we break in
Is he in his Jeep or maybe it's the Porsche
Naw, let's catch him in the V and tear the nigga all up
No, I don't think so

So why do you wanna end your little life like this?
Cause now you've bump heads with kids that's lifeless

Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion

Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'm a test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way you beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30, Cause I'm -

Straight up and down, Imma let you know now
You feel the gunshot bloaw from the Red Eye style
Now pass the owl and let me roll the method
Shit’s hectic while I’m cested, where’s the mic? Let me wreck it, check it
My rugged rhyme, lyrical design hit your spine
Every time that the Red Eye shine
Blinds the naked eye cause they can’t see through
The smoked screen behind the scene stands the Red Eye crew
Now it’s true, my spiritual comes through my physical
Both connected by the method, therefore I’m lyrical
So what you gonna down I come to pursue
With my Tec 22 and infra red on you?
For real, my laser beam likes to see when I squeeze
I’m like a sniper when I strike you, steady busting from trees
MCs, you know my steez, I’m living trifle with the rifle
Punks I make them stifle feed they ass to my disciples

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I trying to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shortie's out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that one eighteen tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
And it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack macs
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and I need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze...You might also like1Embed
It's just another day, drowning my troubles with a forty
That's when I got the call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, "Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower"
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
Cause this bitch ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
So we take the gats for precautions
Plus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental
I put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity to reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs then froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, "Eyes open cause it might go down"
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see, we
Jetted thru Marcy cause D's ain't bagging me
Word Son, they got us on the run, dun, see yo
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
The trife life got me livin' like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt so
What can kill you is what you don't know

OK check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the Bridge
You ain't really sweating it, cause little do you know
The niggas in the Bridge be setting it
You thought you was safe and tried to walk the back streets without heat
On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck
The side where if you come through fronting, kid you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide, no days
Son get the heat, cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo if that nigga front, yo hit him!)
Aight bet, so just hold me down
While I cock back the long three-pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprised
"What's goin' on?", as I reply
"Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide"
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that we're juxing, if you got what we like you gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making cheese by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessey, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me but never ever find shit
It's the every day, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, move ki's
But all the bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger if the drama appears
Cause a nigga's worst enemy is fear
So yo....
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
The trife life got me thinkin' like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt so
What can kill you is what you don't know
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
The trife life got me thinkin' like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt so
What can kill you is what you don't know
(don't know don't know)
(what you don't, what you don't know, shiit)
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)

I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as a man
And learned to use my hands for protection
In scuffles, throw all my blows in doubles
I'm coming from Queens motherfucker carrying guns in couples
And wilding, a Q-U soldier
From Lefrak to Rockaway back to Queensbridge
Black it's only crack sales makin niggas act like that
Back in the days we could scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime
With my Bed-Stuy connection connected in two
It's live Boo start shit too wild for you
Peace to, Baisley, Forty-P get down
And when you outta town represent your ground
Them niggas bleed just like us so show em where we come from
Queens; leavin niggas done Son
To all my peoples locked up from Queens doing time, we still (keeping it real, packing steel, getting high)
Playing the street game, the only way to get by is (keeping it real, packing steel, getting high) (x2)
As we sling on the corners like we always do
Son get that loot quick, spending dough like I never had shit
I'm living large pushin luxury cars
Though that shit is outta reach, anybody in my wake gets scarred
Permanently bed-ridden
And if you're pussy, then motherfucker get in where you fit in
As I walk around the streets
Son I got mad beef, I'mma blast you before you blast me
That's my philosophy cause nowadays you gotta be relentless
Grab my Mac and slap a nigga senseless
Don't try to play me if you do you better D.O.A. me
Son I got em shook grab a little baby for shields
You got drama run for shelter for real
Pour some beer for the ill ain't no time to chill
Hit em up cause I'm quick to erupt like this
Wet 'em up with the MAC scratch em off my list
Show em, the real meaning of drama you never had it
Til you bumped heads with the Havoc
Ain't nuttin' soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat

Everything is real inside my mind; these days
You can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
A lifetime of street living
Throughout the beef I've accumulated many slugs have been given
But wilding ain't the way to be living
You're only gonna end up bloody on a floor shivering
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile on the street saying no more peace
My man, Sto-Bo, kid hold your own
In a cell locked down not far from home
And at the same time on the outside I'm representing
Still packin heat make you cowards keep stepping
Getting high, it's cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear
It's only facts coming out of my mouth piece
As far as I can see these streets is getting sour
Q, U, too much drama to get into
And niggas regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think dude
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy I'm leaving in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin through life at a high speed
Watchin all the slow runners pass by me
I can see through you, due to, my Queens education
Speaking in behalf of this drug-game nation
The Foundation, the Queens nation

Living in this hell hole, a place that I call home
But check my dough and nine, ain’t nobody taking mine
It’s a high price trying to live a full life
Yo it’s a struggle invite, living through these trife nights
Drama everywhere I turn, kid watch your back
It’s the liquor talking to him making him act like that
In this year of the 9-4, it’s more real than ever
Ain’t nobody safe in the land of  terror
Niggas catching strays, you’ll be lucky if you get grazed
I’m out to get paid, making loot in quick ways
Access the sex, pushing Acs across state
And Buddha make it on time to my court date
My destiny’ll be the death of me, to walk the light
To a slug that moves niggas, so put that in your pipe
Don’t ever get caught dozing in the mist of the action
Stuck without hoes and broken down to a fraction
Cause times a change, got to endure the pain
So I’m (keeping it real, packing steel, getting high)1Embed
You were my angel

Girl I need you to fly
Oh you don’t want to fly
Fuck you then
I thought they would be happy to see me do good
Now they wonder why I’m steady screaming fuck that hood
Niggas talk crazy because I ain’t there, they ain’t crazy
They know me for beefing until I let off that 80
Even my baby mamma, we don’t even talk no more
She like you Hollywood ass nigga, your ass done changed
Im like child support, welfare, your ass the same
When its you against the world, tell me who do you trust
Some punk bitch that want to be in love on a bus
Yeah my hustle done changed but I got the same ambition
Same mentality, the same intuition
Besides a little money, man ain’t much difference
Still got the same bob when I walk with the Ruger
Nigga stunt if you want and I’ll put one threw ya
Not when I drive by, I’ll walk up to ya
Not from across the street, I’ll walk up to ya

Homie, you frown when you see me up
Then got the nerve to smile when you see me down
I don’t understand niggas fuck it

Hav so cool, but now I want to rob and blow your mother fucking head off
Nigga won’t die from starving
The rate of niggas turning on each other is alarming
My lady’s my ex-lady, yeah she got the same problem

A nigga eating good, my stomach so full
Now niggas want to stick me, oh this world is so cruel
Fuck y’all niggas

You ain’t got to pretend, we ain’t got to be friends

To what the fuck I got to say, you know?
I been doing this shit for years:
Holdin' heat, sellin'
Usin', abusin' all kinds of drugs;
Robbin' niggas, runnin' up in niggas' cribs
You know, the whole shit
So don't ever in your life get me confused
With some of them other niggas that you might see
On TV, or hear on the radio and such
Know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, this is me: P
I'm speakin' for my fuckin' self
When you see me.. at the show, or on stage or on the street
I DEFINITELY got the gat on me
You know what I'm sayin'?
Nahmean?
And it ain't like I'm tryin' to be a tough guy
Or tryin' to make people think I'm crazy by sayin' all this shit
But what it is, dat.. I know how niggas gets down, alright?
I used to be in the clubs: The Muse, The Tunnel, whatever the fuck
Niggas get they little drink on
Havin' fun with they little crew, you know what I'm sayin'?
Start cuttin', shootin', whatever
Things like that
A lot of these so-called "rap niggas"
Ain't never seen no parts of that shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
You dig where I'm comin' from?
Word up, yo
And I know a lot of y'all niggas— matter of fact, all y'all niggas
Is right now listenin' to this shit like...
"Yeah, yeah, we gon' see them Mobb Deep niggas
We gon' see what they about, know what I'm sayin'?
Touch them niggas, we gon' see what level they head is at"
But, yo!
I'll let y'all niggas know right now, you know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't gotta waste your time, or your money on your hospital bills
And if you step to me on a personal level
I don't back down easy! You know what I'm sayin'?
There's a good chance your ass either gon' get
Shot, stabbed or knuckled down
One out of the three
So don't gamble with your life, duke, word up!
And believe me:
I know very well I could get shot, stabbed or fucked up too, whatever
I ain't "Super Nigga", I'm a little skinny motherfucker
It's all about who gets who first, though
You know what I'm sayin?
So therefore, say no more
To all my niggas — get the money!
Frontin' niggas — get deceased!
And, oh, yeah!
To all the rap-ass niggas with your half-assed rhymes
Talkin' about how much you get high, how much weed you smoke
And that crazy space shit that don't even make no sense
Don't ever speak to me when you see me, know what I'm sayin'? Word
I'ma have to get on some ol' high-school shit
Start punchin' niggas in they face just for livin'!
Yo, I'm finished what I had to say
Y'all can continue on11Embed
Word up son, word
Yeah, to all the killers and a hundred dollar billers
Yo I got the phone thing, know I'm sayin', keep your eyes open
For real niggas who ain't got no feelings
Keep your eyes open
No doubt, no doubt son, I got this, I got this
Just watch my back, I got the front, yo
Check it out now
Word up, say it to them niggas, check this out it's a murder

I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got 'nough shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really, ayo Dun, spark the Philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation now
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look

There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

For every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects—my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
(We live the life that of diamonds)
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks

To real brothers who ain't got no feelings
