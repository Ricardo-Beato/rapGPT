67 ContributorsMaybach Lyrics
I ain't about to play with these niggas feel me?
I'm 'bout to get these bags ya dig?
Future, hold up, wassup
Good drink, good drink
We ain't playing with these
Freebandz, Freebandz
I just be, I just be getting it
I just be getting it
I just be getting it
You know what I'm saying?
Showing improvement
Getting fetti ya dig?
808 Mafia

Riding low in a Maybach
Spraying at you like an Arab
Streets having you going crazy
I got my young niggas going crazy
Masked up nigga everyday
Got the sharp stick with me everyday
Half a pound in the ash tray
Burn it down nigga, why wait?
Burn it down on good drink
On good drink, on good drink
Money long get your money long
Get these yellow diamonds like a honeycomb
Riding low like an esé
Getting doped up that's everyday
Hermès on me every day
Keep some Cartier on me every day
You might also like
Fuck a bitch in a big way
And I hit her right on the staircase
Hit that mouth I go bareface
When I'm in that mouth I go bareface
Pain pills took a double dose
Gotta bank roll with some iron on me
They told you I was real, real nigga
They wasn't lying on me
I get better and better with time don't I?
Drinking codeine like wine don't I?
Step on the scene, got dimes on me
It's a dirty game, niggas dying in it
The black Range got her riding it
Hit her throat then dive in it
Flip her over, switch sides in it
Niggas switching sides, they some pie niggas
Thank God they ain't my niggas
Stacked tall I can hide in it
Steal a car, used to ride in it
Had to hotbox, had to ride in it
Foreign coupes now I ride in it
Jimmy Choo I just vibe in 'em
I don't dab in 'em I just vibe in 'em
Boss nigga win a fight with her
I ain't never tryna be a side nigga
Never tryna be a crab nigga
Take a champagne bath nigga
Take a real champagne bath nigga
You can hit him with that yopper now
I'mma gon' head and pay the tab nigga
You the one talking down
When a nigga turn around, tryna stab niggas

Riding low in a Maybach
Spraying at you like an Arab
Streets having you going crazy
I got my young niggas going crazy
Masked up nigga everyday
Got the sharp stick with me everyday
Half a pound in the ash tray
Burn it down nigga, why wait?
Burn it down on good drink
On good drink, on good drink
Money long get your money long
Get these yellow diamonds like a honeycomb
Riding low like an esé
Getting doped up that's everyday
Hermès on me every day
Keep some Cartier on me every day
Styrofoams and a Fanta on me
Few racks with a hammer on me
Gotta move around cause them cameras on me
Gotta keep it cool when them cameras on me
Live and learn and I'm still going
Money burn and I'm still going
Count it up and I'm still going
I just count it up and I'm still going
High-Tech and I'm still pouring
Got High-Tech and I'm still pouring
Designer-signer man it's all on me
I got flawless diamonds and they all on me
Real cash nigga ball with it
Gotta bend over in the stall wit it
I'mma rich nigga so I fall in it
Really it ain't none of y'all business
Thick shit, stand tall in it
Flip her on her stomach then crawl in it
Vicodins have a ball with 'em
Percocets have a ball with 'em
Pouring up, act a dog with it
Taliban game AK, big rings like MJ
Audemar with a big face

Riding low in a Maybach
Spraying at you like an Arab
Streets having you going crazy
I got my young niggas going crazy
Masked up nigga everyday
Got the sharp stick with me everyday
Half a pound in the ash tray
Burn it down nigga, why wait?
Burn it down on good drink
On good drink, on good drink
Money long get your money long
Get these yellow diamonds like a honeycomb
Riding low like an esé
Getting doped up that's everyday
Hermès on me every day
Keep some Cartier on me every day

Never tryna be a side nigga
Never tryna be a crap nigga
Take a champagne bath nigga
Take a real champagne bath nigga
You can hit him with that yopper now
I'mma go ahead and pay the tab nigga
You the one talking down with 'em
When a nigga turn around, tryna stab niggas22Embed
