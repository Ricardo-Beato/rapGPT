33 ContributorsIllusions Lyrics

Some people tell me that I need help
Some people can fuck off and go to hell
God damn, why they criticize me
Now shit is on the rise so my family despise me
Fuck 'em! And feed 'em, cause I don't need 'em
I won't join 'em if I can beat 'em
They don't understand my logic
To my gat to my money and I'm hooked on chronic
I never wanted to hurt a nigga
Unless ya come flexin' that trigga, I dig ya
That grave on the east side of towwwwn
Lay ya six feet undergrounnnnd
From man, to the dust to the ashes
All I remember tell me where the cash is
Click-clack, barrel at my dome
Give all your loot or you ain't goin' home
But I ain't goin' out with a bang
Wa da da dang, wa dada daa dang

I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind
You might also like
Motherfuckers be drivin' me up the walls
Hopin' that I fall but they can lick my balls
Straight jacket, strap it
In a padded room when some punk niggas can't hack it
Distracted from all reality
Now I'm let out on a minor technicality
(Ahhh) They all fucked up now
Cause they let a nigga back on the streets somehow
I'm lookin' for someone like me
Livin' in my own world to my own degree
On the loose in the city lookin' at the ho wit' the big titties
Lookin' at me and I feel shitty
A little tensed up gettin' hot
Cause she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot
I'm tryin' to find ways to cope
But I ain't fuckin' round with the gauge or a rope

I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind

I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
