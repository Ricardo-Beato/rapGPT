I'm a chickenhawk huntin' for a chicken
Get paranoid when you hear my Glock clickin'
Speakin' to the punk that's tweakin'
With the bitch-ass styles I hit you like Deacon Jones
House call for Dr. Bones
I'll roll ya up and smoke you like cones
Split the seed and grow you like clones
Don't start me up 'cause I'm not the Rolling Stones
But I get stoned with a little help from my friends
With the good blend, then I passed it 'round back to me again
I can make you famous like Amos
Same as the last punk when I stuck the gat up his anus
Hear me growl (Grrah, howl)
I got the night vision just like the wise old owl
I'm comin' to fetch ya, yeah holmes, I'll wet ya
Bury them bones under my home and

Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action
Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action

 run the massive, men the gun talk, rah-rah
 Cypress massive, make the gun talk
You might also like
Take my weapon, step into a whole new realm
And step back as I take up the helm
On the pirate ship I'm steerin', drop into gear and
Just realize what you're hearin'
The cannon soundin', that's my companion
Surroundin' as my crew comes poundin'
As the captain, Afro-America
Whole lotta gattin' with the loc'ed out Latin
Busted, you're a red beard with a musket
Better duck quick 'cause ya might get dusted
Your gat looks rusted, disgusted
Oh, look away, look away, boy, as I rush it
Yes, I know that you can't withstand it
Watch that ass, 'cause punk, I'll brand it
With a steel toe, how you feel though
When my boot's stuck in that ass like a dildo?
Cry on a pillow, weepin'-ass willow
The Hill got the steel for the static like Brillo
Hmm, what you talkin' `bout, punk?
Gimme room as I light up the boom
Cock the hammer, wave the white banner
Ever heard a Glock go click like a camera?

Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action
Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action ()
Cock the hammer ()
Cock the hammer, it's time for action ()
Cock the hammer ()
Cock the hammer, it's time for action ()
(Pump-pump) 
(Pump-pump) 
(Pump-pump) Cypress 
(Pump-pump) Soul Assassins
