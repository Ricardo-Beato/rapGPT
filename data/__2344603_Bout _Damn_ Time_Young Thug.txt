22 ContributorsBout (Damn) Time Lyrics
We came a long way and that's why I say

'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time
'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time
'Bout damn time, I swear to God
God damn time, ayy

I done ran that money up, 'bout time
I used to stack a five, now I'm stacking dimes
I don't care if none of y'all ain't my kind
Your watch cost 5000, you wasted your time
And I'm finished, why you still at the line?
If you ain't Damu nigga, you must be blind
And I ain't turning down, turn down for what?
I'ma turn up every time, every time
Every time, every time
I cop a ten thousand pimp belt
I told the bitch she gotta suck and fuck
Ooh, in front and back and make her double nut
Wrapped up in towel, got out my cat plug
I swear to God she wetter than a tub
I supply real niggas and they show me love
I fuck three, four hoes every time I'm in club
Crack pack count, I gotta see these fucks
Mommy wassup? No gives, I got kilos
She'll cook up a four
I wanna be that nigga, my Denali truck stand tall
I can't even see these niggas
If I wanted to I still couldnâ€™t see these niggas

'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time
'Bout damn time, I swear to God
God damn time, ayy

I came from the bottom, 'bout time, yeah
I know these niggas want fuck with me, 'bout time
I'm a footballer bitch, for a long time
Came from smoke in the cup, quite a long time, yeah

These bitches know I wanna fuck 'em all
Young Money shit
These bitches know they come round me with no drawers
('Cause what?) I'm on that horny shit
This that horny shit, I don't care, I got horns bitch
A capella now, I'ma beat your fucking clique
I might mail this shit, I won't never tell no bitch
All my bitches thin and brown, this that pretzel shit
Miss Chelle, Miss Chelle
She got bumps and rumps all over BB
I buy her CC, then I turn that shit to BB
I'm like feed me, feed me, feed me
I don't wanna eat ye
'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time
'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time
'Bout damn time, I swear to God
God damn time, ayy

It's 'bout time bitch
He ain't have nothing to say nigga
Ain't going back, nigga
I drank pints a day, bitch
Loaded, ayy6Embed
