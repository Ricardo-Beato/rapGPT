5 ContributorsWorthy & Erving Lyrics
(Real trap shit)

You got them birds, I want a few, first I'ma drop a deuce
Homeboy want twelve, I want thirty boy, that's forty-two
Call that pack that James Worthy, Zone 6 Julius Erving (DJ motherfuckin' Rell)
Set my dunk on Julius Erving, flying through the six like George Gervin
You got them birds, I want a few, first I'ma drop a deuce
Homeboy want twelve, I want thirty boy, that's forty-two
Call that pack that James Worthy Zone 6 Julius Erving
Set my dunk on Julius Erving, flying through the six like George Gervin

You see the feet on the fleet, like cleats on a athlete (Go)
Tell 'em paper-tag me, damn, that thing look nasty (Go)
Damn, this thing a classic, everybody starin'
Pull up in a Chevy, put your cutlass in a casket (Yeah)
Simple dunk can't catch me, on Davin's twistin' backwards (Huh)
Candy painted sixes like the rims just did a back flip (Goddamn)
My rims just did a back flip
The lips on my rims so big they fucked 'round and did a front flip (It's Gucci)
The way I got my dunk built (Huh)
Way I got the motor built (Huh)
Punch it then the front lift (Huh)
Wammin' at the light, pimp (Go, go)
Slammin' at the light symbol
Pull up in a white dunk, white guts, white rims

Call that pack that James Worthy, Zone 6 Julius Erving
Set my dunk on Julius Erving, flying through the six like George Gervin
You got them birds, I want a few, first I'ma drop a deuce
Homeboy want twelve, I want thirty boy, that's forty-two
