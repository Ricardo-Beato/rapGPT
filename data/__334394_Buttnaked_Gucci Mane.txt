6 ContributorsButtnaked Lyrics(Hook: Guwop)
I drop the top and now I got it buttnaked
I flash a couple ones and now she buttnaked!
I took the diamonds out and now it’s buttnaked
It’s worth a hundred thousand and it’s buttnaked!
(Verse 1: Guwop)
My money doin' cartwheels and summersaults
Don’t blame it on my car, it’s the summer fault
I’m poppin' out the sunroof, peek-a-boo
Your swag was last seen on the local news
And I’m a nice guy but my wrist rude
Bitches wanna tie me up like new shoes
The necklace on my chest cost me 300 bonds
200 thousand dollars, plus another one
50 thou, I blew that shit
Look how quick I ran through that shit
Walkin' in the club like, "Who that clique?"
Look how far I threw that shit
Baby girl, let’s do it quick
Damn I forgot I knew that chick
Pound of weed, I blew that shit
With the niggas that I make music with
Lil' mama come slide through
Tell your girlfriend she can ride too
I live in a igloo, a condo with a side view
Don't get it confused, ain’t no regular dude
Them 21’s and 22’s
It’s a Transformer, it’s a robot
It do everything I tell it to

(Verse 2: Guwop)
It’s codeine mixed with Sprite but still we call it juice
Isn’t it ironic that I’m smoking fruits?
I’m coolin' in my cutlass, the guts baby blue
Them 24’s look like it got on Daisy Duke’s
And even though these bitches say I’m brand new
I fuck 'em then I go get something brand new
I cut it off the top like a barber do
And every day my crew gon' throw a barbecue
Open up the door, you get a better view
I make it look real good but that’s what cheddar do
I’m bankin' out on purpose like I’m shootin' pool
I’m fresher than a lil' kid on the first day of school
And cash rules everything around me
If you ain’t getting money get from 'round me
Yellow black forgislike a bumblebee
And if she ain’t a dime she ain’t my cup of tea!
