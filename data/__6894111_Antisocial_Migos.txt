I been on drugs for a minute (Oh-oh)
I ain't hit my plug in a minute (Oh-oh)
Lately, I been drownin' in my feelings (Oh-oh, Takeoff)

When I'm in my feelings, I pour me some codeine just so I can feel it (Drank, lean)
No doctor, nurse, or pharmacy needed, the way I prescrip' it (Sip it)
Pray I don't get cursed, rebukin' the demons with the Holy Spirit (God)
And I was makin' it work, before I had fame, I had to go get it (Did it)

The cash, the rack, thе bags, a few synonyms, my niggas, you get it? (Cheese)

For my dawgs, give me a call, I'ma follow through
