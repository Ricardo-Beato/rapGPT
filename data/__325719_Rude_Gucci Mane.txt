5 ContributorsRude Lyrics(Intro)
Im so rude
Drive nothing but new schools
Forgies
Its Guwop
Drumma Boy
Brick Squad
Say Im rude
Its Guwop
(Bridge)
Bitches tell me that Im being rude (so)
Baby tell me how Im being rude (ho)
I only talk to bad bitches, thats how I do (I got money bitch)
Thats how I feel
(Hook)
I dont talk to broke niggas, Im so rude
I dont talk to ugly bitches, Im so rude
Got the loudest diamonds on, i know i’m rude
And my car just painted loud, I know its rude
I dont talk to broke ass bitches, Im so rude
I dont talk to monkey niggas, Im too rude
I dont drive no old schools, new schools
And Im pullin my new schools on tennis shoes
Forgies

Bitches say Im rude, yet in the worst way
I wouldn't  bought yo ass a drink ho on yo birthday
This H aint Hilfiger, bitch this H stand for Hermes
Ya lay down with these dogs ass hoes they'll give you herpes
These bitches passin pussy out, I say no thank you
Like my lil brother Nate, I give they ass Nathan
Codeine so thick, this shit look just like its Jack Daniels
Im not no liquor drinker, I prefer champagne
Call me the black Hugh Hefner right in East Atlanta
Niggas handcuffin hoes and dont read their miranda
Five hoes wearing Gucci Gucci leading by example
So inflicted, my M6 Im back, I love to gamble
(Hook)
I dont talk to broke niggas, Im so rude
I dont talk to ugly bitches, Im so rude
Got this loud its down my zone, I know Im rude
And my car just painted loud, I know its rude
I dont talk to broke ass bitches, Im so rude
I dont talk to monkey niggas, Im too rude
I dont drive no old schools, new schools
And Im pullin my new schools on tennis shoes
Forgies
(Verse)
Im so rude, Im so motherfuckin rude
If you had this check then you would be rude too
I dont have to talk to you, dont want to talk to you
Aint no need to talk to you, no need to talk to you
Go get some motherfuckin money  what you ought to do
No after thoughts cuz baby I no longer thought of you
Say shes a soccer mom, I guess she tricked some college dude
And it aint bout him man, its all bout his wallet do
She tryin to fight it, but my money I overpower you
Bitch dont deny it, you know you like the way that bottles move
My charger sittin on 6, it crawled down like a crawler do
Im not no bugga boo, bitch thats that shit that stalkers do
Its Gucci
