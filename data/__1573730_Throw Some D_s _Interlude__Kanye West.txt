6 ContributorsThrow Some Dâ€™s (Interlude) Lyrics
We gon' throw some D's
We just decide to do the video, you know
Ya'll ain't see the video yet
Just go, just type "Kanye West - Throw Some D's", go to the video. Look, I-I-I don't know who hasn't seen the video but you gotta see the video
They was gon' play it on BET but you know the Don, I ain't know shit happen and I don't know, they said the song was disrespectful and misogynistic. I don't know what they're talking about. I-I don't, I don't get it, but uh, hmm. Go-go nigga, I mean, go figure, my bad. Yeah, there we go, alright
(Plain Pat, what up?)
