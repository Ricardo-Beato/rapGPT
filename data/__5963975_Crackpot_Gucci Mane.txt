5 ContributorsCrackpot Lyrics
My same old crack pot, my same old crack pot
This stupid ass not, came from that lil crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
Retarded ass watch, from that same old crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
I'm lying in the drop, with my same old crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
I skrt skrt skrt, with that same old crack pot

So Icy boy homie, you know your bitch want me
Give the tattoo man ten, nigga, write that shit on me
You know the ice on me, please put that light on me
He asking for a brick, like I got the shit on me
The  army, the Zone 6 navy
 Boldercrest  niggas daily
See I'm a soldier , so I'm down with my niggas
Fuck falling back, shawty, Imma ride with you
And I don't fuck with  they be tryna get ya
My bitch so bad, I got your girlfriend wanna kiss her
I'm shitting on the industry,  bring the tissues
And  brought the  and Gucci brought the pistols

My same old crack pot, my same old crack pot
This stupid ass not, came from that lil crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
Retarded ass watch, from that same old crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
I'm lying in the drop, with my same old crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
I skrt skrt skrt, with that same old crack pot

20 for them chains,  for the watch
Anybody know Fiend, I got it all from the crack pot
Used to stash rocks in socks, yeah, I cook that
 coming right on back, cause I woop that
Took that  and I'm pitchen
Get money, all 
Listen, my stomach is ggrowling like the speaker do
Drop it in the pot, bust your back with the heater, fool
 just think, it came from the 
Gucci Gucci, my thug and my red top
You ever seen a  with the stash spot?

My same old crack pot, my same old crack pot
This stupid ass not, came from that lil crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
Retarded ass watch, from that same old crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
I'm lying in the drop, with my same old crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
I skrt skrt skrt, with that same old crack pot

Corner boy hit the block,  rapped in rubber bands
Stupid ass not, needed eight rubber bands
Yes the watch is stupid, it's something 'bout the 
Wave so much,  me off like 
 watching grams turn to 
 20 dimes, 
The chopper on the sofa, shawty by the speaker
Pots under the cabenets,  top of the freezer
Mama same lil rice pot, was my old crack pot
Seen niggas make a killing off the same lil crack spot
Niggas been done from killings, in the same lil crack spots
I'm in and out the coupe, with the same old black Glock
My same old crack pot, my same old crack pot
This stupid ass not, came from that lil crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
Retarded ass watch, from that same old crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
I'm lying in the drop, with my same old crack pot
That same old crack pot, that same old crack pot
I skrt skrt skrt, with that same old crack potEmbed
