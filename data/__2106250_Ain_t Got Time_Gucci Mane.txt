11 ContributorsAin’t Got Time Lyrics
I'm drankin', fuck, I'm 'bout to throw up
I woke up with a bad bitch, took her to Thumbs Up
Chevy so hard, haters give it thumbs up
Said it's a bomb threat when they seen my Charger
I ain't sayin' I'm hard, I ain't sayin' I'm god
But I'm moonwalkin' on water
I guess it run through your family
Cause you suck dick like your mama
Lil mama got an ass so big that shit just look ridiculous
They say folks consider  so I put it on 6s
 bad bitches in my section, that's just how I kick it
I can buy 200 bottles, bitch, to me that's only pennies
Don't want your foamposites, my coupe is on them skinnies
Got a blue and black Franck Muller watch the same color the Pennys

Ain't got time for wishin', I ain't got time for wishin'
And on this 30 days I'm tryna fuck like 80 bitches
Ain't got time for wishin', ain't got time for wishin'
30 thousand, hit the club with a lot, 80 niggas
Ain't got time for wishin', ain't got time for wishin'
2013 Caddy pickup truck on 30 inches
I ain't got time for wishin', I ain't got time for wishin'
We rolled like 80 blunts but smoked 'em all in 30 minutes
You might also like
I done told you niggas, I done showed you niggas
I don't wanna have to expose these niggas
Unload, reload, explode these niggas
None of you niggas be actin' like hoes, my niggas
Think I'm playin' games, no joke, my nigga
I ain't finna let shit go, my nigga
Gucci Mane a pro and I bought a Lambo
Cause back in the day I was a low down nigga
 cutthroat niggas
I advise you, don't trust that nigga
You don't know him like I know that nigga
He'll steal your weed then smoke one with you
I don't give a damn if it's your lil sister
Hell no, I ain't finna leave my pistols
Jokes on you and I got one too
Wish a nigga would come through my front window
My esé’s a heavy sender
Middle of July I'll make it winter
Trappin' so hard, been up two days
It's 6 A.M. and I'm eatin' dinner
Mile runner, tint the window
Countin' up cash, that's my agenda
Crammin' bricks in bumpers, fenders
Bitch you fuckin' with a winner
Ain't got time for wishin', I ain't got time for wishin'
And on this 30 days I'm tryna fuck like 80 bitches
Ain't got time for wishin', ain't got time for wishin'
30 thousand, hit the club with a lot, 80 niggas
Ain't got time for wishin', ain't got time for wishin'
2013 Caddy pickup truck on 30 inches
I ain't got time for wishin', I ain't got time for wishin'
We rolled like 80 blunts but smoked 'em all in 30 minutesEmbed
