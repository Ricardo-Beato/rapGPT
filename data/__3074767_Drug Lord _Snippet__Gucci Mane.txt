Ridin' around with these ballers
Got a white girl that don't charge
She work it up, how poor
Got a baby dad and they in love
Put about 50 pounds of his dope

Heard the damn with his dog
Got some kilos under their arm
With my brig squad and my broads
Kiddy pants in my car
I have money no story
And I've heard this shit and I'm boss
Got a truck hop with no air see
But we're squashed up, no good
To the street life I'm in HD
Nuff said, a nigga so hood
Got a pentagram, no camera
I swear I'm 'bout the hood
Ain't 'bout her, maybe them 2
Maybe cool with these then more
I'm a rich sloppy you sure
The city's there, on tour
Got a little fucker we ball
You might also like
Ridin' around with these ballers
Got a white girl that don't charge
She work it up, how poor
Got a baby dad and they in love
Put about 50 pounds of his dopeEmbed
