34 ContributorsWake Up Lyrics
Uh, haha (Hey, hey, hey)
Go and ride with me, get high with me
You lookin' fly with me, go and ride with me (Uh, uh, uh)
Just vibe with me, get high with me (And it's the best day ever)
In the sky with me, come and ride with me (Aha)
Get high with me,  with me, hey (We just havin' fun, man)

They tell me I'm the shit, I'm like, duh?
Girls on my dick, I'm like, duh?
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Young, rich, and famous, thanks for askin', how are you?
Party every night, that's exactly what I do
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up

Hey, they say, "It's so funny, you're nobody with more money"
And the hoes love me, yeah, these other kids don't touch me
Full contact rap, no rugby
Pretty boy flow, why your girl so ugly?
My bitches don't want anybody but me
They puff trees, sip liquor, and suck D
Got a lot of people worried about the things I say
And a lot of different haters that they bring my way
I let 'em grill though, they can watch the money pile
While these groupie hoes run and try to hunt me down
Now every day feelin' like the best day ever
Heard it's a long road, but it get way better
A little money in my pocket, but my eyes on a million
Got these doubters listenin', surprised when they feel him
Ballin' like Jordan, you ballin' like Wilson
Feelin' like a kid again, chillin' watchin' Gilligan

I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night
They tell me I'm the shit, I'm like, duh?
Girls on my dick, I'm like, duh?
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Young, rich, and famous, thanks for askin', how are you?
Party every night, that's exactly what I do
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up

Hey, hear the alarm, time to start the day
Rub my eyes, light some weed, send my mind on its way
I'm gone, somewhere to my own dimension
I, show these hoes no affection
Just party every night, gettin' so demented
At that time, I'm lookin' in the mirror, seein' no reflection
Got me wonderin', why don't they get it?
Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it
Got some liquor on the way, the weed is twistin', you should stay
You still listen when they say the kid is spittin', gettin' paid
But my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage
'Cause what's written on the page straight sicker than some AIDS
I came to get fucked up (Fucked up), I, I came to act wild (Wild)
You, you came to prepare for the future, I live for right now (Now)
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night

They tell me I'm the shit, I'm like, duh?
Girls on my dick, I'm like, duh?
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Young, rich, and famous, thanks for askin', how are you?
Party every night, that's exactly what I do
Gettin' stupid in this bitch, so wassup?
Wake the whole damn world, homie, I don't give a fuck
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up
Wake up, up-up-up-up (Oh)
Wake up, up-up-up-up
