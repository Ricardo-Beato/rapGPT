2 ContributorsSay So Lyrics
808 Mafia
Uh, uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh-uh-uh

Look
Bentley skrrt off, I light up then hit my cup
Came from nothin', I'm still tryna run it up
All these diamonds, you know that my .40 tucked
All me money, quit playin', just give it up
If you seen out with me, guarantee we fuck
I like threesomes and stuff, baby, call up
Real hustler, he never sold, double up
Servin' fiends, strapped up 'till the sun up
I pull up, foreign broad in my passenger
She keep laughin', my ex is harassin' her
Choke, choke, it's the diamonds from Eliannte
I can't answer my phone, you irrelevant
Gave the pussy up swearin' she a celibate
Gave her coke and a lil' bit of ecstasy
You know that's the muhfuckin' recipe
Lawyer textin' he stressin' me

Rock a AP, it's Plain Jane
Yeah, we fucked then I changed name
Know if you playin' the mud games
Never trust what a bitch say
Four-one, Forgiato, swervin', switchin' up lanes
Pourin' lean straight out the bottle, mix the Henny with the drank
She like to mix designer drugs
She text me, she wanna fuck
Come pick her friends up from the club
Take a chance and try your luck
I'm off the Adderall, I'm so glad she brought her girlfriends
Know I'ma fuck 'em all, wake up, do it all over again
Think it's the bankroll, make 'em do what I say so
They never say no, turn up soon as I say, "Go"
