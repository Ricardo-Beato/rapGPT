Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly motherfucker

You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says "Crack dealin' trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You-hoo! I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you "beastie," boy
You can't match a killer with that, wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey roll
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You a bully's best day ever, with them Nike's on your feet
Comin' through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga, give me that shit!
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps

Can you turn the beat up?
A little louder
There you go

People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me

I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you

Havin' dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walkin', I'm Steven Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preachin' just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah, he's a goner, fuck these prima-donnas (Woah)
I'll always wonder what happened three thousand years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me, we are kings

I'm wearin' a blindfold, like, "Where did the time go?"
I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Baby, I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Take me away, girl, somewhere they won't be
Hold me closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind go?
Said, will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?

I'm just tryin' to make it all make sense
Uh

As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium (Gone)
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have, the curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meanings of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes (Uh-huh)
We all in search for substance (Substance)
That drugs your pain and numbness (Numbness)
Circumstances advancin' the second chance for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this comin' (Comin')
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrow's trend (Not again)
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days (Forgotten days)
Life, it works in such mysterious ways (Ways)
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say, ayy
I'm wearin' a blindfold, like, "Where did the time go?"
I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go

Fresh off a steroid swisher
Pistol at the peephole, that's a paranoid nigga
One of a kind though, ain't nobody close to me
Your ass is straight over D, I'll bag it like groceries
It's whatever though, whatever cross my mind
Haters got no watch, I ain't got the time
Vinny got more flow than a box of wine
Rare as a copper dime, I got an awkward mind
But it's beautiful like Russel Crowe
Fire at the fingertips, can't extinguish it
Shorty gave me tight head without shrinkin' it

Don't get much sleep, two minutes to get a dream in
Is all you need, it's crazy
The colony was lost at sea gettin' wavy
The rawest rapper, baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn, I'm sendin' shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me, this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope, we holier than all of Jesus' kids
But we speakin' to heathens and all of these Even Stevens
Who don't need a reason, just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleepin', cheeba gon' keep me dreamin', I'm faded
Been in Cali a lil' too long, it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm Instagrammin' camera-shy Samurais
Fuckin' up a Jerm beat, teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom rides
My pockets fat, I'm still lookin' for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime
Girl, you could come a little closer, put your hand in mine
This life a prison, it's time to set you free
Watchin' movies in silence, describin' what I see

Young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer
Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina like I want kids
My head continues to be haunted
I burn a city down while I'm unconscious
Maybe go and take some Quaaludes, conversate with Jesús
Batting practice with the motherfuckin' ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
The devil on my trails, I'm tryna find the Holy Grail
(Right there)
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target
Then I don't know why I even started
I'm sick of bein' too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, "Fuck the world, kid, just do what you like
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life
You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity
But all those big words ain't gon' get you paid
And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid
You got it made in that mad house
What the fuck you got to be sad 'bout? Go 'head and rap now
Do what you do best
I mean, that's what you do best
Matter fact, motherfucker, you a suit vest, you need to buy a new dress

How Auntie Em was next of kin but not her mother, real
Her face was careworn
I suspect she migrated from Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginnin' of year one

The poetry's like the poems and psalms of Ecclesiastes
Lightnin' should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell, "Hear, hear," finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant

The room is filled with smoke but the blunt still goin' 'round
We blowin' pounds, I'll admit I'm just a weed head
My mom say by age 40 I'ma be dead
But I live free in a world that's make-believe
To say the least, I be goin' like I'm off the leash
I'm pretty chief, roll another four-a-piece
Hit the crib, get it Jerm, have him sendin' me some heat
The beats I speak on, I'm spittin' like my teeth gone
Off an L a couple hundred feet long
Cop it by the pound, smoke until the weed gone
That's when you'll find me goin'
I'm so gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, feelin' like I can't go

I pull my hoodie down and take a look around
Sounds that shook a town, man, it feel good to smile
So I shouldn't frown when the night is lookin' down
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the smoothest crook around?
Takin' some dollars and makin' away from Impalas
Shakin' the Jakes 'cause they chasin' the face of a robber
Actin' goofy, absolutely
'Cause my passion suits me, so blast the tunes, please
I see the world with four eyes, hip-hop tour guide
Hear the war cries, rap or die
Wanna get signed, drive a four-door ride
Be more fly, 'til then I'll just soar by with a wave
I'm a bat in the cave
Sit back in the shade when I'm passin' the haze
Misbehave, I'm a trouble-makin' teenager
 to please haters
Seat taker, three-term mayor
Gettin' re-elected just three terms later, uh
I've seen greater days, so let the haters play their game
Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey
The ace of spades can make it's way to save the day
But from the start a club of heart was diamond
Now I'm in Zion flyin' through the skyline
The game on my back, I got five spines
Black cat with nine lives, time flies by
So I got one life to lose it, but how will I use it? Uh
I put it all in the music, 'cause y'all pussy
Fold away before they hand you cards
Broke-ass rapper, now you dancin' with the stars
I'm handlin' these bars like a simple situation
Bassin' on them cats who don't fit in the equation
Patience is a virtue, but fuck it, I want it now
Get my record deal ready, get Diddy up on the dial
Hello. what's up, Puffy? I'm on my grind and hungry
Throw me to the people, they gon' love me, trust me, ha
'Cause these older cats is gettin' a little rusty
It's time for a change like Barack said
And I don't care, hip-hop is not dead
Spit hot lead, but none of these haters get shot dead
They don't bother me, I'll even play 'em for my wife
Kick back, have a laugh while you complain about your life
Grr, you hate Mac and you say you gon' fight
It's all good, bro, you entertainment for tonight
Like I'ma be mad you hatin' 'cause I'm white
Do a lot of cryin', lettin' pain out on the mic
'Cause overall I'm iller than most of y'all, y'all pussy
Never ever goin' for it all, you scared of a little risky coachin' call
What happened? I thought you was a know-it-all?
I stay smokin' well, haze got a potent smell
It take me back to kickin' raps back in show-and-tell
I wanted to show people, all of my bro's peoples
Have a dude come up like "Yo, I know people"
The need for Dead Presidents, this dough evil
So lethal, police'll always try to beat you
Seat you down, try and have you run your mouth
Bring your mother out, "Look what your son is now," haha
See, my mom, she know her son is well
The youngest child, she been through it for a while
9-1-1 on the dial with a smile
'Cause I'm wild, foul child style, haha
Too focused on my grind to ever catch an "F"
My heart in it, down eight with five seconds left
I want the best, won't settle for nothin' less
And I always stay dressed in somethin' fresh
So keep your head on straight and show respect to the game
And that's what this beat messaged my brainYou might also like4Embed

No stress, runnin' suicides, don't even break a sweat
I'm a threat, code red when your line get pressed
You gettin' fucked by your contract, what the fine print says
Told you once; I told you twice; I get the lamb; it's over rice
I whip the Lamb, it's overpriced, the life is good—the hoes are dykes
This type of shit don't happen overnight (God damn)
I'm a motherfuckin' fool

I'm way too young to be this rich

Time flies, time flies
As we keep livin' and as we keep bein' positive
All we can do is hold onto these memories (Yeah)
Mac Miller, I love you

All of my homies used to get on my case like, "When you 'bout to kill 'em?"
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprout some children
But I've been murderin' the game, I'm almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half-man and half-amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man
My mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get, that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram, goddamn

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...

I am time, we are time and we have control
One thing we need to remember
Is that we are all in this together

Yeah
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams I manifested
From my head into reality, they seem a bit excessive, but
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with a ego big as Texas
Thinkin', "I'm the man"
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk the path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit, I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone
On the road, even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control
From a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own
Punches like this prolly beat up Stallone
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride (Yeah)
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...

(Time flies)
One day, we will
(Time flies)
We will find
(Try to catch it, time flies)
We will conquer, conquer with love
(Time flies, try to catch it)
While time is on our side
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories
They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on

When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

In my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long-term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swang like Pootie Tang (Uh)
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade (I have a dream)
But can't we all just get along? (That one day)
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say, "Soulo, you so crazy and deranged", I say, "I know"
Roll that weed, nigga! (Shake that ass, ho!)
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash, Sounwave on the beat
(Wizzo!) And our key is anarchy
Your confidence is caca to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia

My home run derby shit (Derby shit), was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest minds will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to right my wrongs, the days short, the nights is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion, divide and conquer
Walk on water, won't be long 'til I'm flyin', that's my departure (Jesus)
I'm a goner
Shoot you down from the sky with eyes of a archer (Ah, yeah)
Better find that thing you die for (Ah, yeah)

I'm a problem and as hard as I try, no hidin' from karma

Been killin' that shit since row the boat
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest
One more drink, I'ma be an alcoholic
I don't wanna think like better unconscious
Need fresh air, everything so toxic
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war
Told my mama, "You ain't need no drama

We just did our work, but we were in it for a lot more
We would try to change the world, but we got bored
When I rip this show, got a encore
Back when we were still in school
We didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies, "The top so lonely
But we ain't gonna die, not now" (Now)
You gon' make it here, live free tonight 'til the day appear

Told me, "Money has changed ya"

Yeah, man, I wish you were here, happy holidays
Um, I love ya
And I hope you have a good night/weekend/I hope I talk to you soon
Alright, godspeed

Ah, yeah
I thought I'd have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sittin' on millions
Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I'd have it in the bag by now
I thought that we'd be kickin' back by now
I know that life is a bitch
I know that life is a bitch, I thought we'd put her in a cab by now

Swallowin' my pride and I'm hidin' what's makin' me mad
Everybody sayin' I need rehab
'Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on
It won't be long until they watchin' me crash
And they don't wanna see that
They don't want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Tell her they coulda done more to help me
And she'd just be cryin'
Sayin' that she'd do anything to have me back
All the nights I'm losin' sleep
It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbin' them dark times
The pills that I'm poppin', I need to man up
Admit it's a problem, I need to wake up
Before one mornin' I don't wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I'm too obsessed with goin' down as a great one
But if you wait too long they gon' find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter
To all my brothers, Most Dope, that's forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start cryin' if he ain't already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there's a place
Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight
Every devil don't got horns, every hero ain't got capes
Open up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake, good mornin'

To buy Patrón for you and all your friends (Hey)
Baby, I be on my grind, rain, sleet, snow
Rollin' up good every place we go
'Cause we tryin' get high (Get high), get high (Get high), get high
Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give 'em what they need
Just wakin' up, then gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup left in my bottle, damn
Well, it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs, ayy
Gotta work with what you got, ayy (What?)
Gotta work with what you got

Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?
Can you stay a while?
'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around

Ain't tryna get out of my bed 'til noon
Neighbors smell the perfume, smoke in my room
And I got the door closed, can't be sure, though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euros
Get the herb rolled, let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escape the world, escape the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
'Cause we gon' handle that later, we gon' handle that later
Right now, let's get this paper and smile for all them haters
Ayy, cream cheese and a bagel
Have a glass of milk and an Eggo
I'm rockin' PJs and no shirt
I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Enjoy the best things in your life
'Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice (Twice)
They say you waste time asleep, but I'm just tryin' to dream

Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?

'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy

Hardcore pound fucking, that's the shit right there
Hell yeah, yo, that's the only way to do it, man
It's that boom-boom-boom, man
Yeah
I know, but there's a difference between making love, having sex, and then fucking
Right, right25Embed
Uh, look
Good evening
Yeah

When I party in New York, take the late night subway
Goin' out Friday to comin' home Monday
From all directions never find me on the one way flavor
The rhyme just the icin' on the cupcake fuck face
My fans notice these other rappers is bogus
I'm supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
And the boy stay, kickin' incredibly dope shit
Make my mama proud 'cause my clothes fit
Travel round the globe bitch, on my Lewis Clark shit
Don't matter where I live, 'cause I can tell you where my heart is
I just stay on my side, fuck where everybody at
Tell the planet, "Peace", 'cause I'm gone I ain't comin' back
Had the whole regular life I can tell you that I'm done with that
Try to build a mil' off a couple stacks
Own my own business, investin' all I got into these fuckin' raps
Willie Parker money, hand it off then it's runnin' back

Ayo you fuck wit' dat
Uh you gotta fuck wit' dat
You in love wit' dat
Look, uh, Mac Miller

Takin' sips from the fountain of youth
If you ain't heard about the kid then you out of the loop
As I'm sittin' back starin' at this world in my eyes
See out the window in my room that I’m hidden inside
I'm just a kid who stays speakin' his thoughts, talkin' his mind
Life a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride
Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry
There’s logic behind the way stayin' caught in a lie, boy
Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion
Muhfuckers want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't
They give a little love like everyone does
In reality, they stoned off that competitive drug
And I don't blame 'em, 'cause those who above me, I'm gunnin' for
Try and make my way to the top, startin' from the floor
And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war
'Cause I be on some shit that they ain't never done before
Takin' over piece by piece, startin' from the core
It's only been a year, I can stick around a hundred more

Said I could stick around a hundred more
I ain't goin' nowhere
Young and so much time to go
Jerm, you might as well keep this one rollin'
I got like one more verse I haven't spit three verses on a song in a minute
See if I can remember this one
Aight look
You can find me in the lab workin' overtime
Smell the weed when you going by, global grind
And I ain't just a local guy
When you feelin' stressed out, have an L
Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanel
Live fast when I die better wish me well
Huh, I just hope they servin' beer in hell
Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell
So please, stick around for the epilogue
For anyone who ever blog, probably heard my name
Hip-Hop's underdog, you wanna win the game
I'm sick of hearin' how music change never be the same
And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane
Call yourself a vet, but haven't won a single game
Mad, every girl got my name imprinted in her brain
Boy, I'm a beast, match the style in bars
Find me smokin' weed where the wild things are

Yessir
So I mean, I had to take this time
Real quickly, to just go in
I don't know man I feel like you should never stop goin' in on your shit

Um, well

Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, goddamn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, "All you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your lovely ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world

Put in work, turn that pussy to the office
Be on top of your game, this here a goddess

And I ain't here to break a promise

Your pussy a ride better than Six Flags, I'm in that
No takeaways, no givebacks
No question, we've been through adolescence
And changin' direction, yeah, I paid attention to it
It's never been easy but now it's gettin' ruthless
A little more pain, that's just better music
Girl, what's on your brain? 'Cause that head is stupid
Lotta people suck a dick, but you can execute it
Perfect timin', don't you add another second to it
Don't you ever-ever-ever-ever-ever do it

Do you feel like you're alone, Will? Do you have a soulmate?
Somebody who challenges you
I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you—touches your soul
You can't give back to them, you know
You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where
You're always afraid to take the first step
Because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road
But you can do anything you want, you are bound by nothing

Yeah, are you my soulmate?
My angel, what do you want with me?
Too high (Too high), slow pace (Slow pace)
My eyes closed, your body all I see
I think you're too divine for my human mind
When I'm with you, what do you do? Bring me to life
No matter what, one day everyone dies (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh)
You think you a God 'til you run out of time (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh)
Yeah, said, when you're gone (Gone), what will you leave behind?
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon? Where goes my mind? (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh)

You the one to show me
Divine love (Love), love (Love), love (Love), love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love (Love), love (Love), love (Love), love?
When the stereo plays our song, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here

Yeah, why do you stay on my case?

Do you know (Do you know) I'm in pain?

It's like you forgot my face
I just wanna taste of everything you made of
We ain't (Nothing)
Cut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly
Yeah, said, when are you comin' through to free my mind?
Are you happy with your life?
Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside
When you take off all your clothes, I am under your control
Rollin' up, you get me high (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh; alright)

You the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely

Yeah, you know I love havin' a studio at home
Because right when I walk in the booth
You know I, I take a sip of my drink
You know like, light a cigarette and walk up to the mic
And it's exactly the correct height for me
That really just makes me feel comfortable
You know, lets the mind be at ease
And I, I noticed that, that uh, sometimes I, I rap with my rollie on
And sometimes I take it off

Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all

Hi, I'm sitting in the clouds
Everything around seems different to me now
And this could be a change for the both of us
Get away from the world that's controllin' us
It's only just me, I hope you trust me
You look a little nervous, keep adjusting
Your blouse that you got on
The buttons come undone
Let me know if you need me to put a fan on
I stand on the floor, 'bout to collapse
The bliss turns to war, heart turns to ash
Fun turns to drugs, the idea of cash
Has taken away my mind
And I think that it's a sign that
Your beauty handed me my mind back
My conscious will attempt to dissolve

Smile with my chest out
Shit, I've been stressed out, they thinkin' I'm depressed now
I just wanna go and chill at Kanye West's guest house
Bitch pull her breasts out, I forget about my ex now
Feelin' fresh out, chillin' in a penthouse
Been here for so long 'bout to start payin' rent now
She used to cook me breakfast 'til I turned her to a pen pal
I'm at the grocery store, lost in the eggs aisle
Ten-point takedown, Alabama shakedown
Used to rapid eye movement, beautifully awake now
Think I ain't a superhero, need to check my cape out

Dripped up and draped out
It's all good, you safe now

Be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya
So, be safe, homie, be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya

Yeah
And everything will be cooler
Maneuver away from evildoers
If Gene Hackman is captain, no one can beat the Hoosiers
See the future, no crystal ball that I'm starin' at
Ancient Egypt pharaoh rap starrin' Jack Kerouac
A half-a-ton of cattle dung, this shit I sadly have become
Ashin' blunts 'til I'm left with only half a lung (Half a lung)
Yeah, I'm here, self-proclaimed deity
Cryin' durin' the Lion King, that's just the G in me
Highly offensive, been on both sides of the fences
Hence the confusion when I stare at my reflection
Man's duality, life and its formalities
We're born as potential, then leave as a casualty
I'm in the lab, suited up, performing alchemy
Meditating 'til I'm levitating out my seat

*Gunshot, woman screaming*

I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
But now she’s dead and there ain't no comin' back once you there
I hope she knew that I loved her, I hope she knew that I cared
Your food gettin' cold, why don’t you come sit down in this chair?
We can talk about all the things we should have done
All the arguments that you probably would have won
But I'm stubborn, baby, you knew that
When you told me you loved me and I told you I loved you back
But now you layin' on the tile, I’m waitin' for a smile
So I’ll stay here for a while

When the cops come in, they're gonna have to take me away

And I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it"
I guess I'm just emotional and maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close, so why'd I have to give you away?
*Gunshot, woman screaming*
I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I'm not a bad person"
I couldn't take your pain away, I guess I'm undeservin'
But if I can't have you to myself, then you're gone

I'm sure I've never seen you look more heavenly
Now I'm rubbin' on your back, whisperin', "Rest in peace"
It's okay, baby, go to sleep
I'll keep you safe, you alone with me
Say I wouldn't hurt you, I lied
I don't deserve you, I tried
So I'ma stay by your side

On that black bush, smoke a bunch of Backwoods
My mind numb, I'm high as high come
I'm somewhat of a fuck up, put it in her guts 'til the cum bust
Combustion, at the function, drunk and actin' as prophets would
When Pac rocked with Suge, smokin' blunts at Hollywood
I was a youngin who didn't know shit 'bout nothin'
But now I'm twenty-one and I feel like I'm onto somethin'
Gettin' emphysema, madder than Ebenezer

Um, she say she love me for these cold-ass raps
Wanna be involved but no strings attached
Listen, honey, I'm feelin' kinda hungry
Go to dinner with ya girls, can you bring somethin' back?
It's unusual that I would feel so strong
The party upstairs, you waitin' in the lobby
Fuck cares, valet the Ferrari
Bright Vegas lights get alarming, I'm sorry
Too drunk for sex, I might pass out early
Just keep it wet and I'll hit it in the morning
Glory, free-fallin' forty-three stories, cordially sippin' forties
Hooked up to morphine, for sure clean like bald heads
I kinda wish that we would fuck more and talk less
Except me and you a little far-fetched
Reach for the stars, got my arms stretched, God bless

I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the light
Hope you'll be there in the morning
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
Just hop off for the night
Know I'll be there in the morning

And I, I need a cool bitch, conversation skills
Roll blunts and in love with Darth Vader films
Love to sit there and chill when I play the keys
When it turn to fall, she love to go and rake the leaves
Make-believe, used to dream of bein' Ann Marie
Or a model for Maybelline
But fantasies tend to die off when you grow up quickly
Her walls the exact same color as a Tiffany box
Make her waffles, solvin' riddles on her Popsicle stick
If she could, she would leave in a rocket ship
The way she feel got her nervous like a doctor's trip
Mom said she should see a psychologist
Say she love me for my cold-ass raps
Never tell me where the cocaine stashed
She up late worried, tell me, "Hurry up home"
Eleven missed calls on my phone, woah

This ain't the main course, I'm just givin' you a snack
But soon you'll be ready for a meal
But I ain't ready, so y'all can just chill
'Cause I know that I ain't ready for a deal yet

Just started, I need to break a real sweat
But I haven't spit somethin' they ain't feel yet
Well, hold up, everybody got some haters
They hatin' on the Steelers and in love with the Raiders
Angry at the top from the bottom
Try and pull ya leg, hopin' that you'll fall and break
But I ain't makin' that mistake
I had to do this beat when I heard my man Drake
For goodness sake, this shit just sets me in a trance
Some people wanna listen, and the rest just dance
That's cool with me 'cause I like to get my groove on
I'm comin' with some new songs, tryin' not to do wrong
But lately it's been kinda hard
'Cause money on my mind
And the only time I'm stuck behind the bar
Is when I'm thinkin' of the next line to rhyme
But this shit, I ain't even have to think about
Picked up the pen and the ink started spillin' out
I'm so high, I believe that I can feel the clouds
So I hope y'all feel me now
The way these haters grillin', it kinda tickles
'Cause they think that they got me in a pickle
But in reality, I'm chess moves ahead of 'em
And I ain't sick of people comparin' me to Eminem
Funny to me, the more money I see
The more places to go, different countries to see

Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin', so hot I'm turnin' hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial
I been poppin' like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal
Treat you like a urinal
'Cause everybody got dead homies

Once a day, I fall asleep with you
Once a day, I try but I can't find a single word
I wonder what they know
I wonder if they ever even cared at all
I wonder, do they see their own reflection in the rain
And look away?

Everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby, I get high

Don't ask me what I think
It never really mattered what I had to say
I just keep waiting for another open door
To come up soon
Don't keep it all in your head
The only place that you know nobody ever can see
You're running low on regret
No tears, that's keeping you wet
I think you gettin' it now

Will you wash your sins with me?
Shallow soul, shallow soul

Writin' on writer's block, haven't slept in days
They wanna put me in the psycho watch, everyone's afraid
Of what I do inside my studio, worried I'ma lose control
They rufflin' my feathers and they shufflin' the Yu-Gi-Oh!
Execution flow, at your neck like new cologne
Uno, dos, bitch, I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger though
My brain fried, always chasin' the same high
I'm too fucked up to function, do nothin' but waste time
Woke up annihilated, lyin' on the pavement
Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape
And I know that it's Friday, 'cause every Friday they have a parade
In-front of city hall, hear 'em celebrate, they havin' a ball
My pupils dilated, highly dehydrated, I'm lost inside a giant matrix
Isolate myself from eyes I find contagious

"Have I answered the question, 'Who am I'?"
"Mm-hmm"
"Well, I confront it all the time. We're teaching people how to use their head. The, uh... point is, that in order to use your head, you have to go out of your mind. You have to go out of all of the, uh, static symbolic ways in which you think."

If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary
'Stead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks with your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean, I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me, "How do you do?''
I told him, "I'm losin' my grip"
He told me, ''Son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''

Your grandson is everything I say that I am
And maybe I am a little bit over my head
But I'm feeling so alone tryna cope with your death
Holding my breath, wishing I had one more day
Wishing you could be there when I graduate
Ugh, and it's sad to say
That no one in this room understand me
I know you had to leave, so rest in peace
But please, can you watch over Nanny?

So, how they treating you up there?

Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"

Sour Hour, TreeJay
Most Dope, what's good?

I'm calm, cool, got a blunt, gonna roll up two
Don't panic, 'cause I'ma take over this planet  cut like a bandage
On the net, all up in your bandwidth, no beaver
But God damn it, this sour I smoke enhance it, got a helicopter, where should I land it?
Been searching but can't find it, the things I do is timeless
Where the fuck did this kid find this rhyme shit? Hit lime piff
Always see me chilling with a fine bitch, let her show me where her mind is
Then silence, it's private, so silence
Want a Bentley and a big backyard, friendly but a big rap star
Still show love, more bud to roll up, smoke duds so much to toke up
On a big cigar or maybe in the mood for a doob
If I roll one of these G's up, boy, you gotta roll one too
See, I'm high but I'm stuck in school, don't know what the fuck to do
Uh, self-made, designed my own mind like a pair of custom shoes
So keep 'em fresh please, finna ball, 'bout to win an ESPY
Gretzky,  your spitting doesn't impress me
You walk but you got two left feet, drink vodka with my Pepsi
I'm drunk, you sober, I'm starting, it's over
Red Rover, Red Rover, you can't break down my wall
My hour is so sour so I ain't gonna answer calls, I'm lostYou might also likeEmbed
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy (Nothin' easy)
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe me

Hey
From the outside lookin' in, it seems that I'm fine
But they don't know shit about the everyday grind
Time is money, money is time
They tell me get there at five but I'm runnin' behind
I try and live a little, go and have a little fun
You only young once, all the hatin', that be dumb
If life a joke, then I'm waitin' for the pun
You all about the beef but me, I'm 'bout the bun, the bread
'Cause I was just a little knucklehead
Now I got my shit together, spittin' what they fuckin' with
If they ain't, it's great, no attention to the hate
Nothin' changed, still cuttin' up, Henny's still my drink
I'm still the same old dude, now I'm makin' moves
It's like everything I do front-page news
I ain't playin' in this game to lose
I want it all, no secret, the change, they can keep it

My grandpa told me one day I'll be everything and more
It's better never to question every lesson that's in store
See, it's a blessin' that I'm gettin' through the door
The money gon' fall, when it rain, it pour
Dear music, you're everything I have now
When there's an army comin' for me, I won't back down
'Cause I never was a kid in the background
Just a class clown, but who's laughin' now?
My moms cried when she saw me in a cap and gown
It feel great to see my family proud, but
I make mistakes too
My people always tell me, "Mac, please don't ever let the fame change you"
They say I'm so different, but it ain't true
Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew
I'm just doin' what it takes for me to make do
And everyone around me gettin' paid too

Shinin' like my high beams, cooler than some iced tea
Yeah, I got a female who like to send some pictures to my email
Professional with shoppin', you would think she worked in retail
Snapbacks make 'em look so cute
And that girl know how to blow somethin' like she play the flute, ha

Thinkin' that they players, but I'm coachin', call me Popovich
Baby, I ain't doctor rich, but I'll probably show you a good night
When girls come out with me, they make sure that they look right
She used to be so grounded, all the sudden she took flight

I'm the type to bring you right back down to Earth
And for what it's worth, I'll put that Louis on your purse
She like to wear my hat, make me laugh, so I'm guessin' she a keeper

Stare at death in the face, like I'm under a car (Uh-huh)
It ain't everybody hatin', but enough of you are
Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin' so high
Got me feelin' so, feelin' so, with this blunt of my mind

Dealin' with everybody's opinion, tryna do me
Only down one, I'm in the final, shootin' threes like I don't give a fuck
Music, we fuck and switch the position up
We love the things that keep on bringin' out the kids in us
Been workin' all my life to do some different stuff
And people have the nerve to say I'm young and haven't lived enough
I'm on the road, my girl so sad I'm gone
It's hard when I can't even find the time to call my mom
And she thinks I'm goin' Hollywood, I guess she probably should
It seems like people see the bad and don't acknowledge good
I feel the shade, but I can see the sun, I'm cool
I've got the time, but feel the need to run, a fool
Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb
Been spendin' cake to get some bump in the trunk
Drums with a pump like some Reeboks, see me from the treetops
They worry, but they need not, heatin' like a teapot
Now I think I'm cool 'cause I got a pair of shoes
And mo' dough, a jacket with a Polo logo
My cup always filled with Henny, so no Fo' Loko
But they should know, so, ha
I could go slow, you see that I'm smooth now
Used to ignore me, they study what I do now
With some help from Kweli, and it's Like on the Beat
It's cool to say that my cypher complete

I'm so sick with the verbs I use, the words that heal us
They love how we kill it on stage, man, Murder theaters
No wonder they call it a bunk, I sleep in a coffin
Dead tired, exhausted from how often I be tourin'
So gangsta, like the occupation of Made Men
Creatin' chaos, my operation is Mayhem
The movie never stopped, the frame change over
We added Mac to the wolfpack, Hangover
That Hen is not a friend, I'm on that Lagavulin
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man
You not a kid no more, no one to hold your hand
And Four Loko make your shoulder lean like a Dro fan
Go ham, like Abraham readin' all the Psalms
Oh yeah, and don't forget to call your moms
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year
Take care of the fam, 'cause it's all we really have here4Embed
Outside is cloudy, but I like that better (Better, better)
Behind the wheel, but still ain't on my way
Some people say they want to live forever
That's way too long, I'll just get through today

Without any complications (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old

And all I wanna do is look, but I can't see, baby
Who you talkin' to while you talkin' to me, baby?
Let me, let me know if I can see you later
We could make it easy

Inside my head is getting pretty cluttered (Cluttered, cluttered)
I try, but can't clean up this mess I made
'Fore I start to think about the future
First, can I please get through a day?

You be complainin', and I can't explain it, I guess
Nothin' compare to the feelin', the feelin' amazin'
Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy

Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock

I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you
Oh, baby, I should buy you another round
'Cause you care, and I swear that I'm here, but I'm there
It's gettin' harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place with a lake, such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it, I break it
That might just break me down

And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember, I've been keepin' it together, but I'm feelin' strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...

You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design

Walkin', droppin' change inside your empty guitar case

When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you hadn't ate
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed

Get the fuck out of my car, this ain't a taxi
They love to see me lonely, hate to see me happy
Call me what you want, she call me "daddy"
Got a knack for gettin' nasty, every day we keepin' tally, yeah
Ooh, it's true I want it badly
Hit the zoom, I be movin' like a athlete
(Now concentrate) No reason to be that upset
I'm busy trippin' 'bout some shit that still ain't even happen yet
I keep it honest as honesty gets
Don't know why I'm always talkin' if I'm not makin' sense
I've spent my life livin' with a lot of regrets
You throw me off my high horse, I'd probably fall to my death

No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie, I'll be sure

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile

Lately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much, heh-heh

As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too (Swishers too)
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm (Aha)
I'm just a regular kid (At my crib)
Doin' regular shit (Burnin' five spliffs)
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'ma pour another cup and roll another zone (Roll another zone)
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back (Bring me back)
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at (Aha)
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me? Hit me on Twitter, heh-heh
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name (Uh)

I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say, now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue

Money gon' be green, I guarantee you that my slide stay blue

Sour Hour

I'm flyin' away
Here I go, here I go
Got a little bit of drink in my cup
Little something to smoke, a little something to smoke
Call me later, call me later
I ain't comin' back around
Call me later, call me later
'Cause I don't think I'm comin' down

Haha, uh
You can find me way up in the clouds, flyin' through the stratosphere
Don't need three strikes to know I'm outta here
, boy, I ain't even on your radar
Learned to play every single game like it's the playoffs
I ain't got a day job, chillin' for the moment
Blowin' potent, my schedule's pretty open
Eat, chief, grind and sleep
And if I'm in the mood go and find a freak
I am above and beyond, puffin' 'til the weed gone
Eons and eons, I'm tryna get my cheese long
Cup of tea and some china plates to eat on
Tempur-Pedic mattress that I count my sheep and sleep on
Flyer than a helicopter, homie, you a kamikaze
Feelin' good like I popped a molly
Drivin' slow, I ain't gettin' stopped by no cops
Speakers keep punchin' like a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot (Aha)

Get ya ass up, go and get a job, shit
I'm on the road, puttin' money in my pockets
Plus the kid got the finest ho to go to prom wit'
To be honest, I'm the illest now
For real, I'm feelin' like killin' it up in Tinseltown
Ask the bitches I'm hittin', they know I get around
You? Another face in the crowd
I'm stayin' on your girls mind
She screamin' out like it's her first time, ha
"Hey, man, we're out of papers."
"All right. Then get me a toilet paper roll, a corkscrew and some tin foil."
"We don't have a corkscrew."
"All right. Then get me an avocado, an ice pick and my snorkel. Trust me, bro. I've made bongs with less. Hurry up!"Embed

You playin' politician, you Martin Sheen on The West Wing
Guessing the best thing for me to do is spit it
This shit is never a gimmick, you listen more than a minute
I been spittin' flows since the kid was six-years-old
And if you listen close, I do this like some mismatched clothes
It's whatever, put it together, you never could be this clever
I'm rockin' the mic forever, you gonna stop me never
I'm cocky because I love it, you Rocky without the punches
Hockey without the ice and boxes without the lunches
Flowin' like me, no one, and that got you mad, bitch
Saw your boys are nothin' but just a-verage
I ain't tellin' nobody how they should live they life
I got my own shit to deal with, so that just isn't right
I'm just tryna leave the crib, go out and live tonight
Shit, fuck that, I'm locked in the lab, workin'
Droppin' a track, beats get bodied and bagged, certain
See the world through first, second, and third-person
Omniscient, listenin' so efficient
Trapped in my own goal line, ready to go the distance
Consider it a privilege that you get to witness
History in the makin', you fuckin' bitches

Hit you with a dub for ya bubbla, it's nothin', bruh
On the road with a dollar and a dream
'Cause anything is possible, believe bitch, please

Stayin' stuck up on my dreams like they rubber cement
No one ever see a legend when he stuck on the bench
And my screw's so loose it'll fuck up your wrench
My head can't contain all these dreams of mine
When I'm rich there's some shit I'm gonna leave behind
For now, it's food for thought, here to feed your mind

Without you here, your family feel lonely
But it's all good cousin, we gone carry on
Although it seems so unfair you're gone
People nowadays never focus on the positives
Cause life now only good when the guap is big
They talkin' shit, hatin' for no reason
And haters is stupid
Baby my flow, leave 'em
So confused cause they all up 'bout this dumb shit
Lisa said she love it and the other shit is rubbish
So I'ma make my time here worth it, real good for you
Lookin' back like there's nothin' I couldn't do
And there's nothin' that I wouldn't do to bring you back
Poetry, heart and soul singin' rap
I've been thinkin' that I found my passion
Rappin' 'bout the future in an old-school fashion

What up cousin, how're you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?

They say my style ain't different
I'm just like e'ry body else
They say my pitches gotta change up
But all those people is just hatin' cause they don't know how to love they-self
Mad when someone bring my name up
And it's unfortunate cause I'm just here comin' from the heart, shit
I'm just tryna find somethin' for the market
And I ain't sayin' that I'm from the worst hardships
But my life ain't no walk in the park
It's been a shark pit, dark with no harvest
Drivin' in a car but can't find a place to park it
I got some people that I really need to ball with
That musta been what got this shit started
There's been some people that I hadn't said goodbye to
But my life gotta go on, and it don't mean that we forget
Because we dedicate our lives to, that's why I wrote this fuckin' song

What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?
Shit's real out there, ain't nobody playin' round
I got some bangers and some druggies that I hang around
E'ry body do they own thing
And you can find me on the corner makin' money when it's snowing
I sell a lil' weed, get my pockets fat
But I talk to cats who be movin' lots of crack
It ain't the good life, it ain't the bad, it's just makin' the best of what we have
I'll put the dollars down and move into the lab
That's how much I want this music shit to last
And some days I feel it's movin' too fast
Schools gone pass, not remembering a class
Suddenly before you know it's time to grow up
Focus on the real, try not to get ya' hopes up
So far I've had some hard work and a lil' luck
Once I make it to the money, I ain't gon' give it up

What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?Embed

Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh), I'll be there (That's how it's always gon' be)
For the good times or bad (That's how it's always gon' be), I'll be there

Hey, hey
See, I was six years old with a dream
When my moms told me I could do anything
Said she'd be there forever, no matter what's the weather
She'd always have my back even when we weren't together
And I took her for granted, thought I had a plan
This a different generation, I don't think you'd understand
In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family
It wasn't for them, I'd be way closer to insanity
It ain't about the vanity, think about what's important
The reason I was six years old rockin' some Jordans
The reason I had food, my own damn room
A TV in the livin' room to watch my cartoons
I just hope she know I love her, the world's best mother
Yeah, it ain't fair, so I'ma take care of her in her gray hair
When I get rich, I'll have her livin' like she should be
No stress, no worries, you can call me 'cause it's

Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh), I'll be there (I know you feel me)
For the good times or bad (I know you feel me like), I'll be there (Hey, hey)

Had my back before I had my own
I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home
I just want to bring you out on stage to get a standin' ovation
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
If you have your moms, you better treat her right
Call her up, say "Wassup?" before you sleep tonight
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
You may be grown now, but remember bein' a kid
When she fed you in a bib, shit, you were her baby
So find out what she doin' lately
Uh, I wanna tell you, momma

Have every single thing I can name
Thank God everyday I don't sleep in the rain
Blessed with some success, so I'ma try my best to
Live my life right, when I see God, he'll be impressed 'cause
I've been on my grind, thinkin' I'll be fine if I take my time

They gon' put me in a flight, no Priceline
Used to want to be in Marvel, fightin' crimes
'Til I realized the boy had the nicest rhymes

Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just tryna ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road

Don't even know my schedule, levels reachin' several
Rose petals deliver, make you feel special
They thought the money should've changed it
Slide's still blue, why the world keep tryin' to paint it?
When the life around you changes, try to keep your sameness
Try to keep your brain maintainin' through the lameness (Lameness)

Sometimes I just wanna go

Hey, I got these Ray-Ban shades
Kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louis shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varyin' from politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper
I'm nuttin' in her mouth, you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on they cooter
Have the music soundin' better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doin' shows daily, call me Jon Stewart
So who you know that's iller than Mac Miller and company?
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred G's, so none of y'all can fuck with me
Yeah, I said it publicly, so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker

If you talkin' shit, you gon' see me smirk
While the DJ be scratchin' 'til the needles burst
A couple screws probably loose in my head
Holler at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy with an irregular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racin' a bike
Who knew that I can turn-turn sound into somethin' so cool?
Fresh kids, see me, I'm bustin' the moves
Comin' in soon to a theater near you
Creep in your kitchen, start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck, I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when money in the room
Ooh, I switch flows, switch rhythm
Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition, hey

Hey, hey
Been around the world and back, yeah, I did that
Still kick raps that cause impact, so where my kids at?
These mu'fuckers hatin', soundin' funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the assholes that she warned you about
We just storm in your house, open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of style, just be sure that it's wild
6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted, so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you, man

Hey, ten thousand dollar hands, million dollar plan
My fam's still the only people that really know me for who I am
Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mu'fucka
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like we boys

Ayo, Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)

Hey, hey, I bet it must be nice, chillin' every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break
But fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I gotta be goin' in
A part of me wanna chill, but a part of me wanna win
No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel
'Cause haters be lookin' stupid, when you just keepin' it real
I got too much on my mind, to care about the internet bullshit
Or them people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am
Just because they random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin' with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs, I'm tryna get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything'll be okay, like...

Hmm

Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of all the drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops, "Suck dog nuts," haha
Arrivin' to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes, very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carrey feel
At the amusement park, scared of heights, Ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

Always rock a smile, never a distraction
Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in
Fuck with Single Ladies, yeah, I did a little actin'
Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'

Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial?
If you lookin' for a answer, you probably gon' find it now
And to the man in the hat standin' lookin' at his watch:
Motherfucker, well, the time is now
Go and clap your hands, let me hear you say, "That's the jam"
See, I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down, kids, you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, I have them sayin', "Mac's the man"
The maximum, comin' through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money, better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door, yellin', "Fuck a list"
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this, hey

All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands

We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What? What? Goin' hard tonight
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, drivin' 'round in my car tonight
Makin' music that ain't hard to like
I got the heart to write

Everybody wanna ask where I came from
Young kid who bang drums, money, don't you worry, I'ma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dummies robbin' people with some fake guns
Make mistakes, young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure out what you don't wonder first
I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts
A hundred words, comin' up with what'll have your bubble burst
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, but nothin' worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin', kid
Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah, my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park 'cause I'm out somewhere travelin'?
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mac has been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him, "Oh, he's just so talented"
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, askin' what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah, I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class you was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention to him spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, try gettin' inside
No, hell no
Haha, I wanna go back home

With a drink getting drunk, having one night flings
This is Pittsburgh, home of the six rings

Hey, hey

Every now and again you gotta just
Just say somethin', somethin' real
'Cause, you know, you plan on changin' the world, that's—
When it's all said and done, it's more than just
More than just rap, it's deeper than that, let's do it

The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that

I got that money on my mind, the grind, and the ability
The knowledge and the know-how, stamina and the agility (Agility)
Soon as I step in the facility, these haters start testin' my civility
I'm tellin' ya, they killin' me (They killin' me)
Some of 'em feelin' me and some of 'em be grillin' me
But I just blow my kush smoke up to the ceilin', G (G)
Yeah, and take a toke of the Swisher smoke (Smoke)
They got the paint and the brush, but not the picture, loc (Loc)
What is an emcee if he can't rap? (Rap)
Just a monkey with a mic just waitin' to get slapped (Slapped)
And what is a DJ if he can't scratch? (Scratch)
The one rotten apple that's spolin' the whole batch (The whole batch)
What is a B-Boy if he can't break? (Break)

No homophobia, but he's a fag

One time for the world 'cause we do it for y'all
Bat logo light up in the sky when the studio call
Movin' the crowd, get 'em loud without a gimmick
Spit with a golden ticket, I'm whippin' it up in minutes
My feet up in this game, you haven't even made a divot
Worried 'bout the critics, what's happenin' now, forget it
From my heart is where I give it, stay thinkin' 'bout the future
When I'm rich, I'ma call my mom before I call the movers
These haters just losers, hate to see you winnin'
Gave my all from the beginnin', I'm in it for extra innings
Here to change the world like I change clothes
Wouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos, but I'm right here for way more
What is somebody if they can't love? A hater, someone give 'em a hug, aha

This, that, the other, I'ma make it happen
Travel all around the country in a station wagon
Take it back, you reminisce on all your favorite classics
My words play more than Mad Libs
I got plenty lyrics, they got plenty ad-libs
Warn the holy spirit, my father's on some rap shit
Listenin' to Tribe, gettin' high, puffin' lye
See some people ridin' by, come outside, say what up
I ain't nothin' like a star, I’m chillin', layin' back
Travel round the whole world, enjoyin' everywhere I'm at
Meetin' different people, eatin' different food
No one like a gourmet meal more than Q though

And everything free, so everyone cool
Look out any window, it's an incredible view
Everyone you speak to always tellin' you the truth
And it's only good shit when you gettin' all your news
Ooh, I imagine that
Just a place that we can kick it, be happy at
Satisfaction or maybe I'm dreamin'
Tell you what it's like when I see it

Give a fuck 'bout what you sayin' after platinum-plated plaques
Take it back, cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything all factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call it Adderall
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work
Black shirt, Rellim Cam, that's my name said backwards
Ask first, hell nah, treat 'em like a bellhop
Let 'em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy

Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract

I bring some color to a world that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectatin' 'til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an all-star, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini, speedin', you a golf cart
California dreams, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me

Drip phlegm from the pen so they can feel me

What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

What if I never get the chance tell the world what I gotta say?
And when I die, all I do is just ride away
I try and talk about my life in every song
So you have a little somethin' to remember when I'm gone
I tell it like it is, I ain't pretendin' that I'm on
But I tell you that I'm workin' and I'm gettin' very strong
It won't be long 'til you hear me on the radio
But in my head, I got ways to go
But I'ma take it slow, businesses is the way to blow
So any place I go, I know my bank can roll
The old heads are schoolin' me, I'm takin' notes
I am hip-hop, it replaced my soul
If I sink to the bottom, then I'ma make a float
I heard the real world's cold, I'ma take a coat
Be prepared, and be aware 'cause failure ain't really even there

But do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to misfit in an instant

It drive me crazy, and money is the fuel
Insomniac, awake, findin' somethin' I can do to put the work in
And I'm certain that I'm flirtin' with the fame
Failure gettin' jealous, throwin' dirt upon my name
Burnin' up my brain, but I'm workin' through my pain
'Cause life's hard 'til you learn it's just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your Scrabble board
If you small, put your heart into your rappin' more

Uh, glance at her when she walkin' by
The type that never stop to talk to guys
She alone and you not surprised
'Cause she ain't fit for no other man
So you approach as a gentleman
"Hello, ma'am, today you lookin' pretty damn elegant"
I think she get the message like a telegram
I'ma be your cab or your yellow van
Tell me where, I'll take you where you wanna go
To the top, she perfect and she oughta know
When she walkin' by the studio
You can see my heart beatin' through my clothes
She ain't around, time movin' slow
I wanna be wherever you gon' go
And I wonder if she know my name
She shine like she ain't know what rain is
The game is the same as it was as some lame kids
You wanna hang with her every single day, it's funny
'Cause your friends say you whipped
Every late night, you gotta go and dip
To pick her up, and I've been sick of sluts
And this girl? She ain't gon' give it up
She want me puttin' in work like school
And I be smitten when she here, like a fool
But keep my cool, gotta be smooth
Eyes like Elmer, got me glued

Tryna do business, mind on my dough

Bring it back with my dogs like I'm playin' fetch
I'm tryna be the future, moldin' the CD
Somethin' bumpin' out the system on repeat
My mind's elevated like E.T
Work hard in quick sand, knee deep
You know I'm always doin' double like a re-read
It's like I play the whole game with a cheat sheet
Dollar signs to my name like Too Short
Gonna go broke with this taxin' on Newports
I'm unhealthy, workin' to succeed
Tryna spit out more words than I can read
Stayin' up late, keep burnin' through this weed
My grandma probably turnin' in her G-R-A-V-E, grave, that's right

Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up

If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up

The wheels stay spinnin' on the Civic, boy, I'm always on the move
When you grindin' all the time, there's a lot of shit to do
That's why I got Q, 'cause he keep me on the routine
I be too skeed, trying to kick it like Bruce Lee
Clean shoes, boy, new feet
And I'm never in the car with only two seats
I got a whip full of people, all fresh, call 'em 10 Deep
Motherfucker, we the future like next week
Young people don't see you as an equal
They just see you as deceitful, tryna send you back to preschool
You only gettin' one shot, no redo
Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue
Bitch, who the fuck you think you playing with?
I'm Justin Bieber meets Jadakiss
Here to take what's theirs, treat 'em all like Taylor Swift
Leave 'em in a daze, all like, "What day is it?"
Yeah, the boy got class, no Cambridge
Fresher than your man, girl, but whiter than a plate of grits
They keep wantin' more, I'm their favorite dish
This me, motherfucker, I ain't changing shit

Leaving every single party with a brand new ho
Yeah, I've done a little travelin', circlin' the globe
Always keep it movin', inertia on these hoes
Boy, I'm an asshole, girls call him a douchebag
This some old-school shit, but no boom bap
This ain't new swag, it's the same old me
The youngin get respect from the game's OGs
Cameras flashin' when we passin', so we stay low-key
Go to Mexico to party where the pesos be
On the turnpike, bitch, and your tank on E
With my head out the window screaming, "Get like me"
Ho, you should know the way I roll
Take a couple shots all to Superman these hoes
You ain't nothin' with your wack rap
Used to be the class clown, but now I get the last laugh

Sour Hour
DJ Shef
Man, I hit the weed way too much, shit, let me get to the song
A lotta y'all probably know this
Had to put my own little twist on it
Ahem
Aight, Jerm, ya ready?

Uh
Well, it's the motherfuckin' M to the A-C, M to the I
Double-L, E-R, fallin' from the sky 'til I land
Crash into this planet, skippin' through the universe, I vanish
And disappear, wise beyond my years
Ridin' through the streets but too high to even steer, so I hover
Three hundred feet from the ground
And I don't plan on comin' down
You run around like a chicken with his head cut off
I'm havin' chickens, give me head, no special 
I'm on my pimp shit, swimmin' through 
Let a thick bitch give me brains, watch a chick-flick
Somethin' About Mary, nut in her hair
Her mom hear us, but I don't give a fuck if she there
Learned that life's a bitch, and nothin' is fair
So I focus on my money, get enough I can share
And get me drunk, I don't care, I pass the money to my team
'Cause they all be by my side while I'm huntin' for this dream
Nothin' what it seem in a dreamland
And I ain't growin' up, call me Peter Pan
Givin' you the news like C-SPAN
Tryna ball, ESPN, and
Haha, I'm way over my limit
Cracked a Dutchie down the middle, throw some haze in it
I'm gone, and I might be back to visit
Add a ho, subtract the clothes, Mac the mathematician, haha
So what the fun in that?
When my liver shriveled up and my lungs is black
But, livin' free, I ain't done with that
'Cause I'ma keep chiefin' 'til my lungs collapse, ayy
So what's the matter with that? Uh
What's the matter with that?
And everybody boyfriend is a sissy, so the bitches heard she kiss me
She wanna stick around like a hickey but I'm busy
Just makin' music, hittin' sticky 'cause it lift me
Bitch, I got more talents than the homie Mr. Ripley
As a youngin, knew that hip-hop was in me
At fifteen, dropped a mixtape and it was iffy
Worked to get better, took my time when I was sixteen
So now you say my name at any party and you in free
Still a youngin, in discussion like a grown man
Lil' munchkins got a hunch that I'm a gold ham
I'ma blow, damn, time to be my own man
Bunch of fine hoes chillin', feelin' up the whole van
I don't fuck 'em just 'cause they supportin' me, hell
It's no biggy, they just lookin' for a story to tell
No groupie gettin' glory, ain't doin' nothin' for me
That's why I never let 'em stay the morning
I just open up my eyes when I wake, and I bake
On my grind, stayin' scruffy, never shavin' my face
A lotta time on my hands, never takin' a break
'Cause Sheffy hit me up with some paper to make
I'ma take my time, grind until the day I die
My weed the flavor lime, gettin' high, chase the sky
You see the paper  shit
So please, keep your distance like an eighth grade dance, bitch

You know I counted eighteen thou' for five of them
Been around  Swishers blowin' clouds of piff
Ounce of sour down, goin' in, you know what time it is
Thinkin' over lines, smokin', never too high to spit
Never doin' time 'cause we seem friendly in an environment
Ready to retire my early twenties, so I'm tryna spit
And get my workin' heavy so there's plenty more time to live
I can't lie, I'm livin' better, so I'll die with what I did
That's why I'm smokin' all the time with Mac Miller
So when he hits me, get my bitch up off me
Smokin' out the Civi' all night, never miss the party
Yeah, get her started on those spliffs  cigars for later
For that late-night Swisher with ya bitchy on me
And wake up to the next hit, early mornin' smokin'
Strap my Jordans, goin' to breakfast, blowin' smoke out like Vince, yeahEmbed

I'm a 5'7" giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls with makeup get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, 'cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feelin' like a hundred wars are goin' on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Actin' like you fuckin' with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe

Then shake though, you get exactly what you pay for
Stop actin' like you can't go, you swaggin' to the ankles
I feel you, baby, hopefully I look familiar, maybe

Fallin' down the same rabbit hole lookin' for love
But you will never ever get it, because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holdin' the drugs
And you can never ever see her, because
Life a cliché, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land, and then the bags come
We walkin' on this planet, seekin' action
Break a girl's heart, sorry Ms. Jackson

Fallin' down the same rabbit hole lookin' for love
And you will never ever get it, because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holdin' the drugs
And you can never ever see her

And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock

Show 'em what you got, tiger
A'ight, look

Uh, sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin', "What am I supposed to do?"
Done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands, then I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
Yeah, my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'ma cope
I think they underestimate the grind

'Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, "Who gon' touch me now?"
And do we ever get to know the truth?
'Cause everybody seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you, I'll be there to rescue you

I'm lightin' up a stogie, it's longer than a hoagie
Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies
Fuck the world, kill 'em all, she answer when I call
If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers
See, I come from a place where stars never shine
And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined
Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody
If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard
I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important
I'm just tryna buy time, but can't really afford it
Sayin' ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad
I feel like money in the trash, like...

It was all about a dream
Turned into reality, double-cup of lean
Ugh

Let me get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryin' to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when everybody know me
Well, I made it big and everybody phony, ha
So could you pour me? I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mix in purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?
Go 'head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality

But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my Sprite, then my night slows... down, down (Aha)
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was "Donald Trump," a fuckin' hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walkin' in the club
Hey, this the 'Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you lookin' far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill your cup up, and I'ma sip mine

Fill it up with dreams, turn 'em to reality

Uh, close your eyes

So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waster of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition 'bout these women and suspicion
Got me lookin' at shit different, how a man in my position
Can't start slippin' down these slopes 'cause it's all just downhill from there
As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware
When you a youngin', you just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits, so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes, I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is

A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, 'cause enough of 'em don't

The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us, and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see

Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you

Mornin' after, my lungs hurt
Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works
It's funny how we fucked but fell in love first
Been three years, I wish I finally trust her
She make me feel like how them drugs work
Itchin' for my fixture, when she gone the love hurts
I just get her temper, I just need somebody I can vent to
Someone get me stoned, be my Emma
Left your lipstick on the glass of your daiquiri
Ruby red, usually end up tragically
Work of art, you could be my masterpiece
But you fast asleep

Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense

Uh
Then she wake up, cryin' while she puttin' on her make-up
Trapped inside her love for me, ain't no escape for her
You wanna leave? Say the word, but she can't
Lookin' in my eyes, "Is everything okay?"
She lies, put on her disguise, play it safe
'Cause we've been fightin' for the past three weeks
She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak
Strong, baby, tell me what's been goin' on
I don't wanna be sober long
So you need to get me high again

Until we strung out like a violin
Come back to life, then we die again

Uh-ah-ah, top of the morning to you
You know, it's been so dark outside
That I—that I figured I'd turn a couple motherfuckin' lights on real quick

Uh
I ain't talkin 'bout nothin' with a flow so disgutin'
Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in
Need substance, feed it to the public
No one gon' touch it like my Poppy's old musket
Roll up to the function, eatin' all the Funyuns
Sentence keep runnin', word to double E Cummings
When people say to me it doesn't mean nothin'
Bumblebees buzzin' 'cause the trouble needs lovin'
Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?
Those are the people to which I dedicate this rap today
Your shit is fragile, if I have to I'ma crack your face
Monday to Saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case
While Sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my Callaway's
Or watchin' football, word to Joey Galloway
Take a shower, start singin' like Al Green
From outside, it probably sound like some loud screams
Always had child dreams and nightmares
My music like the airport, I hop on a flight there
Wanna go to Monaco to see what it's like there
Roll up in a pair of Nike Airs, just like, "Yeah
Wassup?" Here I am, lookin' in the mirror and
All I see is me, I'm at peace
Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems
The things I regret now, be gone by the mornin'
My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been
Pencilin' my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes
Number One albums, always givin' you mixtapes
And that's what I'ma do until I'm richer than Bill Gates
It ain't all about money for me, though
I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego
Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend, though
Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to Cee Lo
Bottles of Clicquot, a couple of Cristal
May head to L.A. like I'm Chris Paul
'Bout to go platinum off of "Missed Calls"

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around
Chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between
Purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream
That's so cliché, but I can tell you what it means to me
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm payin' you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
Said, I'ma be waitin' for that
(Waitin' for that)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Take me
Take me—do you miss me?
Can we stop now? Melt with me—are you okay?
I'm never gonna let you go—touch me—please don't go
Where are we? Do you miss me?
Please don't go—wake up—touch me
Where are we?

I have a vision to add: the gift of subtractin' limits
If everything was gone tomorrow, who would miss it?
And if I pack my bags and moved away, who would visit?
If you knew what you should say who would listen?
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout a new religion
Somethin' to feed off, we searchin' for it like groups of pigeons
Kinda futuristic, yeah, it's cool, we different
'Cause what I do's terrific, I'm just hopin' you can feel it
Yeah, so tell me if you can
Are you numb enough? Can you listen in?
I would lose it all to show 'em I'd get rich again
But matter fact, fuck that, 'cause I don't give a damn
You see it's simple when it's only cigarillos
In the world, no one should feel you, don't expect it from a little man
Fuck empty, my glass is filled
Countin' roses, daisies, and daffodils, chill

Well
Take your vitamins!

Well, I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met
The other day while I was on my break to smoke cigarettes
I hit her up, she had some weed and told me, "Come through, we should smoke
Bring a pair of lungs, don't bring no money, baby, I ain't broke"
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor
The door had opened up and it was her
She told me, "Hurry, come right in
Leave your shoes up by the front, 'cause we just put new carpets in"
She asked me 'bout my day, then sat me down
Told me, "We should have some fun, there ain't nobody around"
She got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work
Told me it would make my problems go away and fix the hurt
That I had, well, that don't sound bad
Down the hatch, kinda nervous, "Just relax," she said rubbin' on my back
Well, I ain't really into drugs, but fuck it
I'ma take a trip and I'ma love it (Love it)

I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back
You might also like
I left right after that and started drivin' to my house where I reside
I was high and possibly a little fuckin' out my mind
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house
I said, "Fuck it," took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out
And it's funny 'cause I didn't even hit against the road
I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own
I see colors, different colors like they glowin' and they're light
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark, but it was bright
That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take?
If this kill me, I'ma come back, haunt her every single day
As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I never seen
Feel like I forever dream, just imagine, set a scene
Power and imagination got all my surroundings changin'
Found a place to drown my brain in somethin' like it's outer space
But nothin' like the pictures from the astronauts
They showed me back at school
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man, they had me fooled

I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back

I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows, though
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe, though
Now I'm dressin' so expensive for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got some fam who can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go

Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?
Could we figure out what God might've miss?
It's funny that these questions never get an answer

Never understand her, why should I even try?
Live forever then you'll never feel the need to die

America

I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well, that's ridiculous
I'ma live forever, 'cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun
And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)

To the top I aim, testin' waters, so I've been afloat

Ayo, Josh
Ayo, where the fuck you at, man?
What you mean you on your way, yo?
Our session was at nine, it's fuckin' eleven
I'm out here blowed, smokin L's, waitin' for your ass
I don't even think I got—
Oh no, I definitely still got some weed for the lab
But still, when you gon' be here?
Soon? Motherfucker, how soo—oh, there you are right now
Ayo, what's good, bruh?
This is a DJ Haze exclusive (Hello?)
Ayo, what's good, bruh?
Shit, chillin'
Yeah, I'm tryin' to go to the studio or whatever
Yeah, I got shit to drop, motherfucker
I always got shit to drop, damn
Aight, you'll meet me there? Aight

I woke up, scratched my nuts, rolled a Swisher on the shitter, ha
Got blowed, then I light me up a cigarette
The coolest flow,  movie role
Now I'm tryna head up to the lab
I headed to the studio, open the door
Say, "What's up?" to everybody who was posted before
I'm 'bout to record, they know I'm smokin', of course
Blow some haze in the air, pull out my notebook
Then I head up to the booth, load the beat off my email
Phone on silent, ignorin' calls from females
My man Josh sit down, get the tempo
Put on my headphones, aight, let's go (Do it)
I let go, intro of the beat's startin'
Say a couple words, try not to be retarded, ha
'Cause I'm a goofy dude doin' what I choose to do
Eatin' tracks up like some snacks, call me Scooby-Doo
Now the beat about to drop, verse one
It's like a war when the soldier pull the first gun
Everything blank, it's me and the mic
I don't read a lot, so I try and see what I write (Visualize)
Visualize the melody, hypnotize
Everybody watchin', I hope they ain't blink they eyes
'Cause you don't wanna miss a fuckin' second when I'm catchin' wreck
I be in the booth goin' off, try and catch my breath
Couple more bars, couple seconds left
Killin' 'em softly, takin' extra steps
They never guessed I'd be murderin' and blessin'
Aight, the first done, but before we start the second
We gotta do mad shit, doubles and ad-libs
And Josh make it sound like magic
He a old school genius with the Pro Tools
Try and school me on everything that the pros do
I tell him that he needs to think it in the book
But for now we makin' guap, just singin' on some hooks
So I don't worry 'bout the chorus, the track got a hook on it
And my verses with that, they sound good on it (Uh-huh)
Now I do a second, maybe do a third
If I'm in the mood to go crazy with my words (Yeah)
I take a little break, got some haze to burn
The cats sittin' outside can wait they turn (Wait, bitch)
We makin' classics in the session, mom's askin' me these questions
"When you comin' home? You got school" Ha, nah, I'm suspended
After this track done, burn the last blunt, smokin' good
Payin' for my time with stolen goods
Say peace to whoever, outside it's dark
I'm blowed and can't find where the fuck I parked
So I beep the car, oh, there it is
Let's go ahead and dip, hop in the whip, light a cigarette and sit
Got a ride home ahead of us, slumped in the back
Tell my mans with the whip to bump on my track
I'm tryna ride out, and I'm high now
I'm outYou might also likeEmbed
True love is hard to find, so I thought I'd start this rhyme
With a couple bars and lines of leavin' it all behind
I've had all the dimes and all are fine
But now I need the one to call her mine
You know that girl that everybody wants?
But can't have fat ass, nice eyes, high class
I get the last laugh now 'cause she under my arm
Lay down, hittin' Ls, lookin' up at the stars
I tell her, "Listen, I ain't gon' do you wrong
Forget what you hear in all my songs
My old ways is gone, I'ma be real wit'cha
Recently I been lookin' at the big picture
Perfectly framed, see the way I'm workin' the game
Take my name, I'ma share all of my fortune and fame
Beauty or brains, girl, you all the above
True player for real, but now I'm fallin' love

I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
