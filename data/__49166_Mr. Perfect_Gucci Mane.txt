14 ContributorsMr. Perfect Lyrics
My watch is obnoxious
Ring is enormous
My chain is humongous
My brain is abundant
Kush, humongous
Purp, enormous
My jewels are flawless
My girls are bossy
My flow so awful
(EUGH) I'm barfin', (PLAW) I'm coughin', (SWISH) I'm ballin'
(SSS) I'm pissin, (PTT) I'm shittin' (Every verse 100, my watch 100)
Ha-choo sneezin', still breathing?

My front yard still look like a car show
Mansion so big, kids playing Where's Waldo
Where's Waldo, Gucci where's Waldo?
I jumped out my Vette, to jump in my Gallardo
That new Gallardo? That stanky new Gallardo?
That baby blue Gallardo, cuz I'm so far from Harpo
Harpo beat me, baby girl beast me
Pulled up, hit the horn twice like beep beep
She remind me of a ????
These jeans ain't cheap, and the kicks aren't either
Either way, I'm a ride illegal
I'm higher than an eagle on ether
I'm higher than a falcon on California reefer
Got money like a Falcon, no Dan Reeva
Humongous bracelet, rings like I'm Jordan
I'm not 23, but not far from it
You might also like

She flyer than an airplane
On my private jet mane
I'm not talking air train
Flyer than a ??
Can I be your old man?
Promise we can hold hands
I can't be no blind man
I am not a blind man
Smash her backer crack her crack her back
Like a chiropractor
Shorty saw my cauliflower
I gave her $800
$800? Gucci Mane you trippin'
Nope, I'm not trippin', I got it I'm not trickin'
Ha, jokes on you, jokes on you, Eddie Griffin
Hoes on my Scottie Pippen, that's my Sidekick
My side chick's a dime piece
You side order Jive bitch
Damn you a Jive Turkey Gucci worth a thousand bricks
