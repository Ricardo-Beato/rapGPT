9 ContributorsYou Love Me, I Hate You Lyrics
Now listen...lemme preach to 'em
Lemme show 'em why..w-w-what it take...
I ain't gonna say why I'm better than others
'couse i ain't better than nobody, actually
But lemme show 'em why I'm a lot different from everybody else
Because...and what I mean by everybody else I mean everybody else that does what we does
You know, this recordin' industry, music, thing
What I do is, I don't go out to the clubs
And when you do see me in the club, trust me, I have been paid to be there for those thirty minutes that you enjoyed with me
I don't stay inside for nothin' couse my house is nice
I don't just get in my cars and just ride around neighborhoods where no girls are at, because my car is nice
I don't do that
What I do is, I go to studio
And I just stay in the studio
See you have to understand the difference
The difference between me and you is to you, this is your job
To me, this is my life
The club; that's my job
The mall; that's my job
Your neighborhood; that's my job
This studio; this is my life
This is what I do better than anything
So why wouldn't I do this all the time?
See that's the difference between you and I
You get money and you get crazy
I get crazy and I get money
And the biggest difference between you and I is...
You love me and I hate youYou might also likeEmbed
