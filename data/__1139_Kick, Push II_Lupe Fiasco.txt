72 ContributorsKick, Push II Lyrics
Look at what we did
Came a long way from dirty ghetto kids, ugh
Yeah, look at what we did
We came a long way from dirty ghetto kids, yeah
You know what it is
Haha
Ugh, ugh
C'mon

Well, the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin', no
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus, he had to be at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read: "A lil hungry, and need a lil money
It's for my lil sister and her lil tummy"
Wasn't lyin', though—he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
Cause he knew they wasn't cookin' where he live
The "kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk"s now took him to the crib
A lil' hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right past the pushers who couldn't under-dig
"What's the use of pushin', you ain't pushin' none of this?"
"If I kick it with y'all, I'm just pushin' for a bid"
But what was on his mind and pushed him to the lid
They best customer wasn't cookin' for her kids

Yes, sir, pa-punp, so, he kick, push
Over his shoulders, he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah
Ugh, and so he kick, push
Over his shoulders, he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah

You see, his mom was a crackhead
And his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combatted
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see, his girl was a white girl
But just 'cause she was white, see, her life wasn't light-world
She, too, had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama, but her daddy used to mama-hit
Daddy caught something chasin' fatties, made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
Had suicidal feelings
But riding switch over the transitions help her conquer it
Pays for her mama's pills with a sponsorship
Her cell phone bill and a Honda kit, uh-huh
And that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel her pain and a place to be

That's why, that's why, that's why, she kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah
Ugh, that's why she kick, push
Over her shoulders, she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah

A traveling band of misfits and outcasts (Outcasts)
Nod they heads from Misfits to OutKast (OutKast)
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts who did this without dads
One's father was filthy rich
Two was middle-class, and one was homeless (Ugh)
Add in the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair who just liked to watch
And that was the whole clique
I think about 'em every time I see this old flick
That was taken in the park in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, "You thank for 'Push, Kick'
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick"
Well, I did—I hope you seen it
It's on MTV, Soundtrakk's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk, beef from the Ice Creamaz
Before we put it out, had to pay the Filipinas
Just to show 'em how you
Just to show 'em how you kick, push
Over your shoulders, you swore you'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah
Ugh, that's why you kick, push
Over your shoulders, you swore you'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah6Embed
