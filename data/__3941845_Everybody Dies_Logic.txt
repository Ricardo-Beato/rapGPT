90 ContributorsEverybody Dies Lyrics
Yeah, fuck that shit

You are watching a master at work (Yeah)
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
(You are watching a master–)
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement

Grew up broke as fuck, rich folks was adjacent
Maryland, starin' out the window for motivation
I remember Lil Bobby, Lil B
Man I wish that I could be a dog in a rich family
Oh how nice would that shit be, my life a catastrophe
Now my shit a masterpiece, No Limit like Master P
Now I am the master, see, that's the way it has to be
My life is a movie, I'm so glad God casted me
I am not top ten, more like top three
I am not two 'cause nobody could top me
Get the pussy wet like Jodeci, you know it's me
I can't seem to put my finger on it like a rotary
But somethin's missin' from the game, when I'm gone, oh it's me
I feel sorry for these rappers comin' up, woe is me
I just took a hiatus and wrote a novel, motherfucker
I got more verses than the Holy Bible, motherfucker
'Cause I'm sittin' on five, unreleased albums
Greatest of all time, no lyin', that's the outcome
I do it for the boom bap, the trap and the radio
Fuck a fake fan, steppin' to me, try to play me, ho
I make music for every genre, every occasion
My shit is amazin', I'm blazin', it's insane
Going crazy in the gym, goin' in gains
Had a lot of dark nights, but bitch I been Bane
I was born in the darkness like Rick James, bitch
Sippin' scotch with Chappelle after the Grammys
Said them countries wasn't shit holes, they prolly wanna ban me
'Cause I say the shit that others won't, prolly can't stand me, uh
Like these rappers claim to hate me, but they stan me
I said these rappers claim to hate me, but they motherfuckin' stan me
They hate what I represent, but bitch, I am me
They hate what I represent, but bitch, I am me
There's nothin' but legendary shit that be goin' on, the phenomenon
You might also like
You are watching a master– at work
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
I got my rap and I got my gat
Yeah they got my back, but I won't bust back
Unless I need, this world is greed, I lead by example with ample
Education, my lyricism is here to imprison your vision
The fallacy society has rejected, I'm here to protect it
Everybody di–dies deep within this world we live in, and not everybody tries, but everybody lies
You can't take– money with you when you die so spend it and don't look back like an addict in recovery
But also don't blow it, you know it, don't be a coward, but don't be too heroic
Live your li-life to the fullest, don't push it or pull it
Don't murder others 'cause you disagree with they beliefs
We all the same underneath
I had some shit I had to get off of my chest in that first verse
But this verse come first when it comes to importance of message
(Do what you love, do what you love)
Do what you love, do what you- do it, do it
(Do what you love, do what you love)
Don't do it, don't do it, that's society
(Don't do it, don't do it, do it, do it, do it)
Break free from the cycle, don't be scared to walk like Michael on the moon
RattPack be the platoon, so much more is comin' soon
Yeah I've been goin', I'm already knowin', know Bobby been flowin'
My shit get around like a woman that's hoin'
My body been growin', my mind been growin'
I'm already knowin' that I'm gon' die one day, you gon' die one day, we all 'gon die one day
God already got the date set, so live your life, live yo' life
Yeah you live it, that's a bet, 'cause if you ain't fulfilled in the end
You gon' be filled with regret, bet
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
You are watching a master at work
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement

You are watching a ma– master at work
