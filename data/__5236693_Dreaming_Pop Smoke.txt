Uh, come on, baddie, pull up
Yo, what you doin'? (TrapHouse Mob)
You on live? Look (Bad bitches know what I mean)
(This is a Melo beat)
Wait, wait
Woo, yeah, yeah, that shit right there
Let me see some' (Uh-huh)
Woo back, baby
Talk to me nice, look

Perc' 30 (Perc'), dreamin' (Dreamin', I'm on Cloud 9)
Know that I'm dreamin' (Know that I'm dreamin')
Pour a four (Pour a four, lil' nigga), leanin' (Leanin')
Know that I'm leanin' (Uh, woo)
Walk in, thirty (Got a whole lotta bags), Neiman
I'm up in Neiman (This shit fly)
Papi lurkin' (Yeah, I'm lurkin', nigga), schemin' (Woo)
Know that I'm schemin' (Bah)

Amiri the denims, got ninas attached
Big body Benz, I got tree in the back
Scope on the Glock and it hit like a MAC
I can't fuck with these hoes 'cause these bitches is trash
I like my bitches classy
She suck on my balls, she nasty
She open her legs, gymnastics
She make it disappear, magic
Christian Louboutin, spikes on my feet
Red bottoms when I walk in the street (Pop Smoke)
I'm the one they wanna meet (Pop Smoke)
They know I'ma bring the heat (Pop Smoke)
They wanna fuck with the team (Pop Smoke)
Bad bitches, that's my thing (Pop Smoke)
Eleven karats on the ring (Pop Smoke)
Mike Amiri, Billie Jean
