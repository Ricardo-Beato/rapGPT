9 ContributorsBamboo & Cross (interlude) Lyrics
The music's starting
My name is B-A-M-B-O-O
I'm so fast and everybody is slow
I'm so strong I can pick anybody up
I will throw you down and I will give you a pop
He farts a lot and plus drools a lot and he's sleeping a lot

You don't kill me like that!
My name is Cross
I am the boss
I'm a vicious bowler
I wear a Polo â€“ with the horse on it
I'm on it! I'm on it!
And I pop a wheelie
If somebody speeds me I hit 'em!
I can't remember...
I want to dance
Can I dance?You might also likeEmbed
