8 ContributorsReal Dope Boy Lyrics
Real dope boy whip hard chicken with the egg beater
Bricks ain't stamped boy trick em with the eagles
No lettuce in my bank but real monefa
Smoking up the pound, boy OG Reefer
The judge say I got a real dope boy description
All in the courtroom, on the mud sipping
8 in the morning, on the molly nigga tripping
D boy shit, young nigga double clipping
On the road, we’re street finessing and juuging, oh

Gucci prints for all my children, oh
Big Guwop one dope ass nigga
Pour mud up and sipped up nigga
 chain, he must be doped up nigga
I’m no sleep gang, why you ain't up my nigga
Unload the truck my nigga, just caught me a duck
Call up, in New York, trust a dope boy’s script all on my 
I’m a real dope boy, so you know what’s up
Gucci and Scooter on my side with the U-Haul truck
We ain’t moving nobody, we bout to move some bucks
We ain’t moving nobody, bout to move some bucks
Count up, count up

Real Dope Boys, Real Dope Boys
Black Amigo Gang Brick Squad Real Dope Boys, (BMG)
Real Dope Boys, Real Dope Boys
Money Pounds Ammunition, Means you a Dope Boy
Real Dope Boy, Real Dope Boy
Don’t touch that pot if you can’t whip that Dope, Boy
Real Dope Boy, (whip that dope) Real Dope Boy
Never seen a brick, thats means you ain’t no dope boy
You might also like
26 by 12 inch rims, if 12 pulls up, let’s do it
Your dope it jump out the gym
But my dope it might break the rim
We don’t use a fork, you know Spook, he might shake the pot
Hundred thousand cappin' and I ain’t have to cook a fuckin' rock
Dope boy Certified, I put work on any block
In the drought we satisfy, listen, you could learn a lot
Gambling on the road, road running, I done lost a lot
I Wiz Khalifa bricks, Tailor them, I got a remix shop
You ain’t no dope boy, you ain’t got no dope boy
My partner Longway, a real dope boy
You claim to be a boss, you a ho boy
Every day of the year I got dope boy

Real dope boy whip hard chicken with the egg beater
Bricks ain't stamped boy trick em with the eagles
No lettuce in my bank but real monefa
Smoking up the pound, boy OG Reefer
The judge say I got a real dope boy description
All in the courtroom, on the mud sipping
8 in the morning, on the molly nigga tripping
D boy shit, young nigga double clipping
On the road, we’re street finessing and juuging, oh
I like my dope Peruvian, all my niggas shooting
I ball but I ain’t hooping, you can call me Mark Cuban
My earrings is a movie, my watch is filled with rubies
My niggas stick together, getting this money like we Jewish
She almost got the ring, but I ain’t finna do it
I cut her from the team, she had a check, she blew it
I like my hoes exotic, I like my shoes exclusive
I’m pouring fours now but I used to pour deuces
I throw grenades now but I used to shoot Uzis
I'm riding in a four four two on deuces
I’m back making old school trap boy music
It’s Gucci Mane & Scooter so the work can’t lose it

Real dope boy whip hard chicken with the egg beater
Bricks ain't stamped boy trick em with the eagles
No lettuce in my bank but real monefa
Smoking up the pound, boy OG Reefer
The judge say I got a real dope boy description
All in the courtroom, on the mud sipping
8 in the morning, on the molly nigga tripping
D boy shit, young nigga double clipping
On the road, we’re street finessing and juuging, oh2Embed
