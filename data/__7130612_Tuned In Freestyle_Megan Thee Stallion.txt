14 ContributorsTuned In Freestyle Lyrics
This goes out to all y'all tuned in
The hotties, the secret hotties, all you motherfuckers
(What Juicy say? He be like, "Shut the fuck up")

Talk about something y'all like, stop talkin' 'bout me
Since y'all hate a bitch so much
The way broke bitches comin' for me, know it gotta be free
But I get paid when I show up
Pressed, stressed, obsessed, I got 'em
Everything I do keep another bitch talkin'
Watching my back 'cause these dudes be stalkin'
Watching my plate, got these broke hoes starvin'
Damn, you hoes hate me
Ridin' dick so hard, havin' babies
Y'all bitches so ugh, stop it
Making everything but a deposit, yeah
Killin' bitches, send 'em to the Gulag
Hot girl shit, never let 'em cool off
Make him do what I say, he my voodoo doll
Backshots, balcony, we don't care who saw
One thing about me that you need to know
I ain't nothin' like none of these average hoes
"'Cause I fucking want to," if they ask me, "Why?"
I'm from the Southside, niggas can't make me cry (Ah)
Nigga, this head game lethal
Use my tongue, put thread through a needle
Bitch, I'm a movie, these hoes my sequels
Keep a pussy hoe real tight like a kegal (Yeah)
Self-esteem high, bank account full
Hoes goin' blind tryna look at my jewels
Ass real fat and my pussy get chewed
If I worried 'bout the hate, I'd be a damn fool (Fool)
You might also like
If I was worried 'bout y'all niggas how y'all be worried about me
I'd be fucked up, too, ayy

Your Instagram account seein' more interactions
Than your bank account seein' any transactions
Love to talk shit, whole time, I'm laughin'
I'll never give a bum bitch satisfaction
Why? I'm way too player
Hoes love sayin' they a demon, I'm a prayer
Drop a lil' verse when they get to actin' up
Put my hand in her face, send her back where she from, uh
Bitch, I'm 'bout my money
Pussy out when I'm feelin' real cunty
He like 'em thick with the accent country
Sell his soul for a sniff of my undies
I'll walk the soul out you like some tennis shoes
I'm finna bust that pussy wide like ten-to-two
I got a nigga, but I find some of you bitches cute
Cut the convo short, fuck an interview
And when I show my wild side, make 'em doo-doo-doo
I got these niggas blushin', lookin' like they Pikachu
I'm the hot girl, feelin' like Charizard
And he know he finna win if he get my card (Ah)
Real motherfuckin' hot girl shit, ah5Embed
