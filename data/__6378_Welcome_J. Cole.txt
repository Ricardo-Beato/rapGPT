Yeah
Hey
Yeah, hey
Fayettenam, yeah
Bitch

Yeah, I'm sipping liquor for the pain, pouring liquor for the slain
Nothing else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
In my mind, tryna figure where this 20 G's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought, I think I need to speed it up and make mo'
Time to build, Lego, in the Ville, laid low
Counting days, still waiting on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick
Feel a vibrate, hold up, I got a call, old bitch
How she get my new shit? Swear the city too small
Type of chick won't take her shirt off 'cause her titties too small
I could give a damn, girl, lift up that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in the deep, seeing just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard
Lord, I'm up in that
Got the type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that
At the door with a towel on and nothin' under that
Saying welcome
Hey, yeah
Yeah, welcome
Yeah, yeah

I let these words flow out like water from a spout
Like rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowd
'Cause these words go deep from my soul when I speak
Then the flows hit the souls of all those that I've reached
If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when I'm gone and if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thoughts, at times I wonder if I'm sane
Man, it's hard to trust friends when the paranoia blends
With the marijuana, wonder will this high ever end?
Swear I'll never smoke again, y'all niggas blow the weed
Let me take another shot, man, this liquor's all I need
Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me, got me feelin' so alone
They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingerin' in my dome
I tell 'em ain't nothin' wrong, I deal with it on my own
I deal with it on my own

Yeah, I deal with it on my own, nigga
Yeah, oh, welcome12Embed
