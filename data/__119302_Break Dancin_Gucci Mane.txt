24 ContributorsBreak Dancin Lyrics
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break a nine piece off a brick and make it break dance
Choppa got you spinnin’ on your head like you break dancin’
My pistol in the club with me, I don't wanna break dance
This MAC-11 gon' make a nigga strip, like a shake down

My favorite weapon MAC-11, black and red patent leather lavish
Was so broke in '97, prayed a brick would come from heaven
Niggas used to laugh when I walk from Boulder Crest to Gresham
So who’s laughing last, I just pulled up in a 911
Money don’t make me, clothes don’t make me
Lot of people still ain't heard of me
They used to just know me locally, now they know me globally
Atlanta Overlook apartments, just came back from overseas
If I can do it, you can do it, you started with more than me
Mom couldn't really do much for me
So broke used to eat lunch for free
Backstabbed so many people that my boysL won’t even pass the blunt to me
Lord I hope that he forgive me, but fuck that nigga that’s history
Yeah fuck nigga I stole your bombL, hope that ends your mystery
And if it's all about the timing, my time piece cost 80 g's
Hit a lick for 80 P's, boy just go ask 
You might also like
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break a nine piece off a brick and make it break dance
ChoppaL got you spinnin’ on your head like you break dancin’
My pistol in the club with me, I don't wanna break dance
This MAC-11 gon' make a nigga strip, like a shake down

1017 for them bands, we gon' hunt ya bae
Got a rifle with my dog like a hunter bae
Red bottom add the spikes, I’m a punter!
She wanna suck all of these Snickers, she got hunger
500 horses on my motherfucking tires
I'll splat his ass up put that on fiver
Everybody with me eating, we got fiber
In the kitchen, wrapping, wrapping like a cypher
Told you one too many times, we got dimes, it’s my prime time
Ridin' with king slime, that’s my slime
K spank yo behind, we gon' drop a dime, I'm not lyin'
You's a Busta like Rhymes, never committed a crime or did no time

Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break a nine piece off a brick and make it break dance
Chopper got you spinnin’ on your head like you break dancin’
My pistol in the club with me, I don't wanna break dance
This MAC-11 gon' make a nigga strip, like a shake down5Embed
