79 ContributorsOD Lyrics
Uh, OD'ing on drugs
Ayy, bring me a lighter
Somebody, please
(Wheezy Beats)

I think I'm OD'ing on drugs
Nigga, I started a fight inside the club
Never switched up on my brew I'm not a dub
I got a foreign car outside sittin' on some dubs
Baby said she gon' help me out with my problems
I'm still screamin' fuck the crime stoppers
Yes I'll hit you up, go do a dub for my partner
Yeah, ridin' in the back just like a scrub for my partner
Knuck if you buck for my partner (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I show love for my partner (Yeah, yeah)
I'ma fuck a ho when I leave the club just for my partner (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'ma pull off and take off on my plug that's for my partner
I can live life on a boat like Nautica with my partner (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's my motherfuckin' partner in crime, baby
And you know I'm never stoppin' the time, lil' baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you know it's not a doubt in my mind, lil' baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you know I'm doin' it for the slimes, baby

Thugga, I'm a big beast, yeah, wilderbeast
You can't see me, I'm tired of these streets
I will remain an OG when deceased (Ah, yeah)
R.I.P. Mike Brown, fuck the Cops (Yeah)
Screamin' R.I.P. Bennie shootin' up a block (Grra)
No clock, lil' nigga, sit back and watch
Me move all of these chickens, lil' nigga, no Popeye's (Damn)
When my palm go to itchin', boy, I get missin' (Yeah)
Whippin' up fake dope in Big Duck's kitchen (Ah, woop)
I swear to God I hurt to whip it, ah (Yeah)
Dirty Cup for a nigga sippin', oh
When I get through with that 4 a nigga trippin', woah
I changed my shoes to Givenchy's, ain't no trippin' no
I'm a young rich nigga, flip a flippin' O
S-L-I-M-E, yeah, I wipe your nose
Wipe it, wipe it, wipe it
I get that pussy and I just demolish, 'molish, 'molish (Yeah)
Divide it, all in they mouth no trident
No baby, but I wipe it, I kiss it and good night it
I make love and I fight it
Precise and yes it's righteous
My luck and how and why can't I fuck it all night
Got sticks and I'm never scared, never frightened (No)
Keep 'em all out your business, they just here because of your riches
You keep these ones flyin', no biscuit
This money I'm gettin', it got me

Rocko, I do, I do
Yeah, and that on God that it's true
My niggas, they was some clothes bandits
Now they dealin' with bad bitches and they know they have it
And they show they have it, bitch, we photograph it
I might put mud on my truck and hop out clean and dandy
Free my lil' brother Bean, yeah, you know, a savage
Yeah, but he don't wrestle, no Randy
Pussy clean, she don't need panties
I see right through that bitch like she panoramic
Yeah, I treat that beef just like fuckin' manwich
I'm, I'm screamin' 30, fuck a blue jean bandit
We don't care about no jeans, we just want that cash in
So we stole the truck and smashed it 'cause tragic when I'm
OD'ing on drugs
