4 ContributorsKim Gets Deeper LyricsI don't really wanna feel
Like back in the days way before the record deal
Hustlin, tryin to get a meal steady tryin to flip a brick
Ya girl had the blues you would thought I was fuckin crip
I sip that crystal shit and smoke a L and at the same time
Try to strategize how to get this paper
More money, more haters
Especially when you ain't the average bitch
Cause I'm a boss (yo that's deep)
Cause I be on some "get it how you get it"
You know, "money over niggas"-type thing
I got these rap dames turnin green like they want it with the queen Ms G.O.A.T, never stressin, tell these bitches better fight for second
Even though it gets lonely at the top
Anything is better than being back on the block
Cause don't nobody know it's Kimberly Jones then the Queen B
Know what I mean?
Every now and then I start trippin and get to thinkin bout BK thugs in the pj's or my peoples (yeah I know what you mean)
That's living illegal
Don't let niggas mislead you, the streets is evil
Ain't nobody in the game stuntin like we do
I'ma make it to a bill, trust this
Just give me some time like the judge did
If you hatin, y'all can get the middle finger, fuck it is Nathan
Kiss em, thats my pussy you tastin
Amazing, Queen B in the place
My thoughts paint pictures y'all just copy and trace
Don't fuck with the fake or talk about em (uhn huh)
Fuck the law always kept it hardcore like my first album
(so why don't you just soften up) never that
The first code on the street is to never rat
I don't trust no body (yo you can trust me) - why?
(I'm just like you)
Okay, thats deep....You might also likeEmbed
