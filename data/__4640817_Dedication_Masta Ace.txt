4 ContributorsDedication Lyrics
Dear ma, I wish we had more time together
54 years sounds like a long time, but I wish it was longer
There's a lot of things I didn't get to say
Thank you
You pushed me to be great and you taught me right from wrong
You raised me to fight my own battles
And if I needed to, pick up something and hit him wid it
You put me through college, I don't know how you did it
Everything you did, shaped me into the man I am today
You are the single most influential person in my life
And I thank you
Love, your sonYou might also likeEmbed
