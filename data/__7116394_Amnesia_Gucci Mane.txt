5 ContributorsAmnesia Lyrics
I need ya
I know you need me, girl 
 leave ya
 wish I had amnesia
Imma lay there in your brain, so you don't forget the days
 don't be acting like you got amnesia
I know you recollect, you said you never forget
You act like you got amnesia
Well you got amnesia

Don't act like you got , I'm not just some small timer
Wish I never met her
Like 
I'm so forgetful, I can't even remember
Sorry, I just bought a new Farrarri, 
Damb my thoughts keep slippin 
Do you have a  for sail? Cause Gucci need another 
Pinky and the Brain changed to 
 baby girl you 
Most of these girls I don't repeat
Freak 'em, feed 'em, 
Baby I'm just like my 
Counting up big piles of money, hundreds
You might also like
I need ya
I know you need me, girl 
 leave ya
 wish I had amnesia
Imma lay there in your brain, so you don't forget the days
 don't be acting like you got amnesia
I know you recollect, you said you never forget
You act like you got amnesia
Well you got amnesia

I'm Yo Gotti!
She say that she remember me, Summer Jam 03
When I bought my first Porshe, flooded out my Rolie
Say I done her so right, even let her spend the night
Ask if I remember her, 
 yeah
I still wanna  ya
Know I used to fuck with , 
Just don't know where I met you at
Then how we end up breaking up
Think I got amnesia
Let's do some making up
I need ya
I know you need me, girl 
 leave ya
 wish I had amnesia
Imma lay there in your brain, so you don't forget the days
 don't be acting like you got amnesia
I know you recollect, you said you never forget
You act like you got amnesia
Well you got amnesia

It's Gucci!
Never get it back like yesterday
Trying to remember
Let me consintrate
Can't consintrate
 or contemplate
Contemplate or consentrate, 
I can't ly, I can't fucking ly
I'm so camera shy
 fly, we so fucking high
We so 
Like a kite, better yet an owl
Only on a cloud
 round
Let me beat her down
I remember now
 like she was attached to me
Gucci!
I need ya
I know you need me, girl 
 leave ya
 wish I had amnesia
Imma lay there in your brain, so you don't forget the days
 don't be acting like you got amnesia
I know you recollect, you said you never forget
You act like you got amnesia
Well you got amnesiaEmbed
