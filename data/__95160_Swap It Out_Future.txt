11 ContributorsSwap It Out Lyrics
Said I'll swap it out
I'm swapping everything out here brand new

I swapped out my True Religion, put on my Robin jeans
I swapped out that clean Sprite, mixed it with codeine
I swapped out that old school, pulled up in that new thing
I swapped out a Puerto Rican, and now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame, now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet hoe, cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe, make my pockets fatter
Swapped out them VV1s, now I got better carats

I went psycho with that Sprite
I went a drug addict with that sprite
I got hoes that like to dike
But to tell you the truth they fly like kites
I got bad bitches who write
Went to space and took a flight
Yeah I'm fly but ain't no kite
Cause they're too short for my life
I'm on Pluto, you on Earth
I had Burberry at first, now it's Pluto on my shirt
I don't go crazy, I'll go berserk
Had the Maro hardtop
Pulled the Rari with the vert
I'm the king in my hood
Aye the globe is my turf
See me rocking diamonds and you know them diamonds very bright
Had to swap out the mid, then we start sellin' white
I was True religion saggin', now them Robin's on me nice
Paid the cash in, cash now, all I do is swipe

I swapped out my True Religion, put on my Robin jeans
I swapped out that clean Sprite, mixed it with codeine
I swapped out that old school, pulled up in that new thing
I swapped out a Puerto Rican, and now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame, now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet hoe, cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe, make my pockets fatter
Swapped out them VV1s, now I got better carats

I swapped my Louis scarf for Alexander McQueen
I just brought a Sprite and it's no longer clean
Was a True Religion kid then I Designer'd my jeans
Hey I run ATL, man I feel like the king
I'm red bottom walking when I walk on the fly
Rosalina pop a pill, now I'm no longer tired
Marijuana in my system, you can see it in my eyes
I've got a pocket full of hundred men I feel like Plies
I was old school shopping, now the Rari what matters
I once trip off light, now I'm in Pluto forever
Yellow Stone, White Stone, stepping up on my bezels
I VVS the face, took out canary yellow

I swapped out my True Religion, put on my Robin jeans
I swapped out that clean Sprite, mixed it with codeine
I swapped out that old school, pulled up in that new thing
I swapped out a Puerto Rican, and now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame, now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet hoe, cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe, make my pockets fatter
Swapped out them VV1s, now I got better carats1Embed
