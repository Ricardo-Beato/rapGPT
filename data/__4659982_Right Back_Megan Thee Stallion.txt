6 ContributorsRight Back Lyrics
What makes you wanna lie to me?

I hop up on the beat with no topic
Other bitches hop up on the beat and need to stop it
I ain't out here rappin' bout the D'uss I be coppin
Fuck around be rappin' bout the places I be shopping
And if I'm out here shopping, bitch, you know just who I'm with
Don't act like you ain't know I was your daddy main chick (Ahh)
Don't act like you ain't know exactly who he came with
I ain't given him no pussy and he still paying rent (Ahh)
A lot of hoes don't like me, yeah, I know
'Cause I'm shaking like dice and I'm always on the roll
I'm always on the move
Bitch, I'm always on the go
And by the time you catch up, I'll be already gone
They be wishin' that I would but I won't
'Cause I'm too fucking pretty and these lames can't get me (Nope)
I'm pushing all these bitches when they get to actin' shitty
And they sleep, but y'all better get some Faith like Biggie (like Biggie)

Yeah, it's been a cool lil week
And tonight I'm looking for a cool lil freak
He hit me Monday, been tryna see me
Now I finally got some time at the end of the week
I'm getting money and he like that (Like that)
And every time I poke it out he tryna bite that (Bite that)
He say I'm crazy but he like that (Like that)
And every time he try to leave, I put that right back (Right back)

Look, pussy wrap a nigga up like a turban
I throw it back and hit it hard like a suburban
He fell in this peanut butter then he started swerving (Yeah)
In and out this thang, now these lames I be curving (Yeah)
Don't be showing me your money nigga (Uh-uh)
If you spending then spend it nigga (Spend it then nigga)
A nigga with some money don't excite me (Nope)
Prolly why a lotta lame niggas don't like me (Ha)
Prolly why I end up with a ring, being wifey (Okay)
Prolly why he always in my face like we Skyping (Okay)
Prolly why his baby mama always tryna fight me (Damn)
Prolly why he calling me the sugar honey iced tea
Shit, I got a whole lotta confidence
A ugly motherfucker might mistake me for a cocky bitch (What?)
Pussy watching me, ain't putting money in your pocket bitch
I give it to you gangster but I'm really on some model shit

Look, it's been a cool lil week
And tonight I'm looking for a cool lil freak
He hit me Monday, been tryna see me
Now I finally got some time at the end of the week
I'm getting money and he like that (Like that)
And every time I poke it out, he tryna bite that (Bite that)
He say I'm crazy but he like that (Like that)
And every time he try to leave, I put that right back (Right back)
And every time he try to leave, I put that right back
And every time he try to leave, I put that right backEmbed
