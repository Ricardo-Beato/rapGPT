Hello Children

Black Jack Johnson N.Y.C., R-O-C-K-I-N-G
Sun and the moon, earth, stars, and planets
Before song done, y'all gon' all understand it

Like - Hot
The haters can't fuck with it
Cause they mom and they sister and girl in love with it (And they niggas)
Sound man holla black, come with it (Come with it)
Spin the record 'till the record done spinning
Up top, is you getting up with it?
Dirty dirty, is you getting crunk with it?
Smokey smoke from coast to coast
Be careful our first draw be that overdose
Who stay holding it from Brooklyn? You know it's Mos!
Ha, Jackpot I (Sing yo) got to go for broke
Is this the only way the Smith Family know to go
Right here to my youngest one is older folks
I'ma put down like a dirty so and so
Freak daddy came here to work the mojo - oh
Because the - high is high and the low is low
And that go for the sinner man to holy folk
Put your shit in the sky like I know you know
Ha, my ghetto nation get toe to toe
Stay rocking steady steady cause I told you so
And after y'all get it go I let it go some more
That Black Jack about something for sure, for sure
For sure for sure 
Let me see you in the world making your shoulder roll
And if it get good tell your nigga throw your 'bows
You might also like
Cause we are so ghetto
Yes we are rock and roll
Yes we are so ghetto
Yes we are rock and roll
Yes we are so ghetto
Yes we are rock and roll
Yes we are so ghetto
Yes we are - rock and motherfucking roll (Woooo!)

Ha, I am a fighter and a lover
I'm the freaky baby daddy, I'm a bad motherfucker
I'm the earth, wind, fire, and the thunder
I said I am, go ask my mother
You don't believe that shit believe what you want to
Alright, OK, So, Shut-up!
Speak language come straight from the gutter
Observe the terms that we trade with one another
Like - what's good, what's popping, what's cracking
What it is, how you living, what's happening
Work songs that the slaves sang back then
The playground chants, with little girls clapping
 + (Girls chanting)
Black John Johnson N.Y.C., R-O-C-K-I-N-G
Sun and the moon, earth, stars, and planets
Before the song done, y'all gon' all understand it
Black John Johnson N.Y.C., R-O-C-K-I-N-G
Sun and the moon, earth, stars and planets
Before the song done, y'all gon' all understand it

Gimme the space!
Back up, gimme the space!!!
Let a nigga rock!
Gimme the space!
Let a nigga rock!
