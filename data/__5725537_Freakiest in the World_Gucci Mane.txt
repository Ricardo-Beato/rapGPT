26 ContributorsFreakiest in the World Lyrics
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
I slowly board the jet, it was a sixteen passenger, woah
I can pink toes tat you up

She a very freaky girl, the best in the world
Asian and Brazil, but I caught her in Montreal
Diamonds and pearls, she say I rock her world
Mink brown like a squirrel, feed her salmon and pills

I woke up in St. Barts on a yacht with a thot
She want all the smoke like that time I smoked with Bart
Slob on my knob, babe, don't blow it, that's your job
Bitch gave me her heart and said, "Don't break it, that's your job"

I just told Gucci he hot as he gon' get
I took a bowl of grits, I put it on my wrist
It's like I live in a toilet the way that I be shittin'
My niggas never bargain, we stand firm, not concerned

Gotta bring the crew with me, a couple hitters flew with me
My young nigga just FaceTimed me with all you niggas' jewelry
All this blue cheese on me, I'ma need some celery
Thugger, that's my evil twin, from now on, call me Jeffery
Thug and Gucci (Slatt), takin' over the industry
Thug and Gucci (Slatt), bought us Bentleys just for the B's
She lovin' on me (300), I'm lovin' this codeine (Yeah)
She suck 'til it's so clean, then left with the brodie
YSL and 1017 tied like some shoestrings
Jumped off the bridge, bungee, millions on a wedding ring
Fucked her 'til she had a stroke, now she need some therapy
We gettin' on the medicine and now I got her scared of me
You might also like
Fuckin' in the back of the car like a sofa
I don't pitty-pat, tryna kill you and your mother
I don't know about it, but I can teach 'em how to stop 'em
Red and blue diamonds, but I promise I ain't a cop car
I been in the trenches froze tryna make some
I been servin' molly all weekend
I crack your old lady like a pecan
Implants got a nigga bitin' through cement

If this bitch take another bean and OD, that's a felony
Tried to slow her down, but she keep mixing up the medicine
All these Rolls-Royces pullin' up, bitch, I'm the president (Go)
Had to take him off 'cause he kept callin', I wasn't ready yet
YSL and 1017, one weekend, spent a yellow 'Vette
Had to put some diamonds on her neck, that pussy very wet
Monica Lewinsky, bitch, you just sucked on the president (Wop)
Gucci Mane and Thugger, man, together, that's one heavy team

She a very freaky girl, the best in the world
Asian and Brazil, but I caught her in Montreal
Diamonds and pearls, she say I rock her world
Mink brown like a squirrel, feed her salmon and pills
Stepping on these bitches' necks, it's unfair (It's unfair)
You rich and you fine and it's rare (Girl, you rare)
I'ma take my bitch to Lenox Square (Lenox Square)
You a pool table, green and you're square (And you're square)
I tell you watch your body and your deep friends (Deep friends)
Can't tell you 'bout his body, he too deep in (Let's go)
'Cause if this shit get leaked, niggas get took off the streets
Tie some tons 'round your feet, now you're swimmin' with the fish
Living like a kingpin, vacation every weekend
A demon for my semen, she love it more than breathin'
From gamblin' in Four Seasons to suites at the Venetians
For no apparent reason, she love me more than breathin'
Forgis on flat tires and extinct, park the Bentley (SEX)
I go Grinch on a freak every year (I go Grinch)
Tie my tithes with the Brinks, yeah, yeah (With the Brinks)
My artist out your tax bracket, sheesh, in one year
My artist just signed, I already got an M
So many fallen stones that you damn near can't see 'em
Underground king, I'm like Bun B and Pimp
The world is 1017, they should put it on a blimp

I just told Gucci he hot as he gon' get
I took a bowl of grits, I put it on my wrist
It's like I live in a toilet the way that I be shittin'
My niggas never bargain, we stand firm, not concerned
I shoot you 'bout two hundred just like Worm, just like Worm
I make her pussy stretch like a motherfuckin' worm
Skydweller on my side, bitch, but Patek her concern
I keep a 40 by my dick just like sperm

She a very freaky girl, the best in the world
Asian and Brazil, but I caught her in Montreal
Diamonds and pearls, she say I rock her world
Mink brown like a squirrel, feed her salmon and pills

I woke up in St. Barts on a yacht with a thot
She want all the smoke like that time I smoked with Bart
Slob on my knob, babe, don't blow it, that's your job
Bitch gave me her heart and said, "Don't break it, that's your job"

I can show you a rich bitch schemin' this for this cash
I can show you a misfit and you'll eat her ass, ayy
I can go down south in a West Coast Jag'
Took a red leather coach out the house, put it in the Jag'

She a very freaky girl, the best in the world
Asian and Brazil, but I caught her in Montreal
Diamonds and pearls, she say I rock her world
Mink brown like a squirrel, feed her salmon and pills

I slowly board the jet, it was a sixteen passenger (Come aboard the jet, sixteen, six-twenty)
I can pink toes tat you up
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
