4 ContributorsLil Buddy Lyrics
Ay Jeezy, wassup my nigga?
Yeah, this ya boy Lil Buddy, what's hatnin, man, I ain't seen ya in a minute. Yeah, man I'm keepin' it hood, my nigga, namtalmbout, what about you?
What's hatnin?
Well they say you ain't been keepin' it real, but I-
You know what I'm sayin, I'on listen to these hatin' ass fuck niggas man
Them niggas just be poppin' off, my nigga
Namsayin'
A lotta on yo dick tho, namsayin
It's a lotta niggas out here rappin' my nigga, but you doin' that shit for the streets
I can honestly say, my nigga, you the realest nigga in it, for real

Snowman, bitch, respect it or check it
Don't matter to me, I'll Mac-11 or Tech it
You lil niggas better keep my name out ya mouth
A hunnit rounds'll make a frame out ya house
I cruise the city by my lonesome
Open invitation for anybody want some
The hood say they really feelin' you, mayne
A million records sold, I don't do gold
Fo sheezy, this rap shit easy
Can't leave the mic alone, the streets need me
Red Monkeys saggin' on them apes
That's 900 just sagging' on the Bapes
You might also like
That's what the fuck I'm talmbout, man
You heard what the fuck that nigga said?!
900, nigga, saggin' on them Bapes?!
That's more than some of you nigga rein' up with, man
Y'all ain't ready for them CTE, USDA niggas, man
Blood Raw holla at em!

Up early, grab my onions out the cereal box
Seven straight, two broke, in the cereal box
Hit the hood, like the name, Raw official in the streets
Keep that yellow shit, nigga, got that yola in the streets
Kept slabs like french fries
Circles like Moon Pies
4s like wagon wheels
Quarters like potato pies
My major would be culinary
Whip game, unordinary
Bet I make it jump back
And cut ain't necessary
Shawty had big dreams
, so I keep clean
One wit a full team
One vision, get green
My nigga get yo scrilla
Certified, I'm a US-DA nigga
Man y'all niggas don't want none of this muhfuckin' shit, man
You pussy niggas round here holdin' ya nuts my nigga like we gone fall and shit
Yeah, yeen know that I fuck with them Coporate Thug nigga huh?
I'm on the block err'day nigga
This ya boy Lil Buddy
And I'm the nigga that these niggas send at you puss ass niggas when you get wrong nigga
So when you fuck niggas even thinkin' bout sayin' a nigga name, better know Lil Buddy comin' nigga!
And I ain't playin' no muhfuckin' games fuck nigga
And I'll get ya mind rightEmbed
