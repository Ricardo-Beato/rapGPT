16 ContributorsBasic Instinct Lyrics
Late night niggas at the Shell deep
Bird out, gang signs to the pale beast
Big guns, long clips and they well greased
Black woman on my 20 dollar bill crease
Head shot, man down in the Ville, sheesh
Enemies, M.C.'s, they get swiss cheesed
Double back, 10 minutes made a big scene
Bullets start flying by a nigga, that's a sick breeze
While I'm here, take a pic please
You know legends die young, rest in peace Prince and Pimp C
From the block to the big leagues, self-made millionaire, white America ain't pimp me
Don't tell me that it's skin deep
Don't tell me that I'm tripping
Only listening to my instincts
Step back for the increase
Hussle ain't got it mapped out? Don't offend me

Yeah, look
Late night, niggas out on 108th deep
Choppers out 'case a nigga tryna come creep
Bitch tripping cause I'm always in the street
Bag of money in a Beemer on the back seat
Bitch, you getting paid or you playing?
Broke ass niggas always running round hating
See an unknown face, where you from? Is you banging?
Heard your name before
You that nigga making statements, uh
So Way Out gotâ€¦
Gang of niggas in the cut pointing red dots
Lil' skinny ass nigga calling all shots
They send the snitches tryna get a nigga knocked off, ah
Fuck all cops, to a million dollar spot when I slide off
Chunk the deuce in the G when I ride off
All luxury shit for a young bossYou might also like1Embed
