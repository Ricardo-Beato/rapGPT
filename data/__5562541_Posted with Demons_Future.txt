(Woah), Yeah
I was tryin' to tell you be cool 'cause I ain't never wanna see you goin' through it
I ain't even have to trap no more 'cause I was doing it too fluently
I told myself I would never rob nobody and then end up doin' it
(Who dat, Trell?)

Came off the block, I was posted with demons
You ain't did the shit I did
Came off the block, I was posted with demons
You ain't did the shit I did
Came off the block, I was posted with demons
You ain't did the shit I did
Came off the block, I was posted with demons
You ain't did the shit I did

All this dope I sold
I tell my real life, finna go cop me a Ghost
I was already ahead of the wave
Now I gotta go out and buy me a boat
Rich nigga fuckin' on the baddest bitch
I still fuck a average bitch
I be on some savage shit
Ran it up with this rappin' shit
You might also like
I'm casually pimpin' these bitches
I don't give a fuck if the bitch is Catholic
I give zero fucks
You can worship the devil, bitch, just drive these bricks
I got the preacher's daughter
Sellin' pussy, bitch gon' make me rich
I might've fucked the lil' thot on the strength
Or because it was late and a nigga was lit (Woah)
Came off the block, I was just posted up
With all the demons and did what I did
Codeine, Wock', plastic Glock
Drop my top, pull off on a cop (Skrrt)
Broke a block, down to rock
Disturbin' the peace like I'm Chris
I'm not an average street nigga, stop frontin'
Puttin' diamonds on you, bitch
Codeine, Wock', plastic Glock
Killed the box, got sloppy top
I just wet this nigga, bitch
Codeine, Wock', plastic Glock
Broke a block, down to rock
Disturbin' the peace, like I'm Chris

I can't never forget when I was starvin', that shit make me sick
I wouldn't care if I never seened your face again, you crazy bitch
All this ice on, you can see through tint when it's just three percent
Rocky stones, my diamonds on Sylvester Stallone
Sylvester Stallone diamonds, yeah
No, these not the wrong diamonds
Sylvester Stallone diamonds, yeah
No, these not the wrong diamonds
(These not the wrong diamonds)
You can see with your eyes on your own
I done went against odds before
Makin' it, takin' it, didn't see the wrong
If the streets don't kill you first, nigga
It's gon' make you strong
I done came from out the dirty, nigga
Buried the money in the floor
I got racks on me and I'm froze
Rockin' tennis chains on you hoes
