Kids
Kids, yeah
Haha

I'm just high, why they hatin' on me?
People tend to think all the drinks on me
I don't even have the money to spend
To buy Patr√≥n for you and all your friends (Hey)
Baby, I be on my grind, rain, sleet, snow
Rollin' up good every place we go
'Cause we tryin' get high (Get high), get high (Get high), get high
Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give 'em what they need
Just wakin' up, then gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup left in my bottle, damn
Well, it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs, ayy
Gotta work with what you got, ayy (What?)
Gotta work with what you got

Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?
Can you stay a while?
'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around
You might also like
Ain't tryna get out of my bed 'til noon
Neighbors smell the perfume, smoke in my room
And I got the door closed, can't be sure, though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euros
Get the herb rolled, let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escape the world, escape the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
'Cause we gon' handle that later, we gon' handle that later
Right now, let's get this paper and smile for all them haters
Ayy, cream cheese and a bagel
Have a glass of milk and an Eggo
I'm rockin' PJs and no shirt
I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Enjoy the best things in your life
'Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice (Twice)
They say you waste time asleep, but I'm just tryin' to dream

Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?
Can you stay a while?
'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around
Hardcore pound fucking, that's the shit right there
Hell yeah, yo, that's the only way to do it, man
It's that boom-boom-boom, man
Yeah
I know, but there's a difference between making love, having sex, and then fucking
