7 ContributorsWrath of Kimâ€™s Madness Lyrics
I'm all about my paper, ain't messin' with the majors
Told my nigga Un get the one's we can do this
No more J.M., it's La Bella to the death
That's the clique, so get with the movement
Now I'm collecting cheques, settle for nothing less
Same broad, the awards, exposing the breast
Y'all been frontin' and lyin', snitchin' and tryin'
But now I'm free
Need more than honey to try and catch the Bee
Actually, I'm internationally known
No HIV but my status is full blown
A few rocks and stones, but I'm keepin' it grown
Got my own Gucci store, up inside of my home
And if you don't understand my actions
Just know there's a method to my madness

Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

Some MCs are bold and arrogant
Try to make a name by dissing and competing
Niggas just like to spend cash
Cum fast, cos my pussy's so sweet
A diabetic wanna eat it, huh
Some people hate, and choose to talk trash
I brush it off then let it pass, like Steve Nash
Quick, fast, I get up in that ass
Kim spaz, and put hoes on full blasts
Boss bitch, what you make I take half
And dare you to put your hands in my stash
Dudes dates girls that try to be like me
My pimp game so good make you leave wifey
New York's finest, call me Your Highness
And know there's a method to my madness
You might also like
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away1Embed
