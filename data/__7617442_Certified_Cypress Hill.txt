5 ContributorsCertified LyricsYeah, yeah, yeah
Hook - Demrick
For years I've been devoting
Grew it, bagged it, and sold it
Rolled it, lit it, and smoked it
Living life out of focus
I'm certified with this shit boy
I'm certified, certified with this shit
I've been living in the moment
Rocking shows and record
My bags and my guns' always loaded
Yeah, you notice
I'm certified with this shit boy
I'm certified, certified with this shit
Verse - Sen Dog
I started out with a vision
Turned it into my mission
Sick of busting boxes
Washing dishes
Ma's bitching
I made some demos with my niggas out the ghеtto
Got signed to the weddo
Now it's pеddle to the metal
From that crack rock era
They were smoking on them pebbles
While I was picking nugs off the tree
Like rose petals
You want a problem
Take it up another level
I'm certified boy
I'm do or die
I'm a rebel
You might also likeVerse -B-Real
It tripped the scale
We have no limits
Pushin' it every minute
Like there's no tomorrow
And if you follow the finish
Together we could win it
Killing it if we will it
If a leaf is what you need
Not a problem I will fulfill it
I'm meshin' with the feelin'
Elevated the millions
Still continue building
And yesterday was the vision
Listen no superstition
California condition
And took this life
You slippin'
Be careful for what you wishin'
For years I've been devoting
Grew it, bagged it, and sold it
Rolled it, lit it, and smoked it
Living life out of focus
I'm certified with this shit boy
I'm certified, certified with this shit
I've been living in the moment
Rocking shows and record
My bags and my guns' always loaded
Yeah, you notice
I'm certified with this shit boy
I'm certified, certified with this shit
Verse: B-real
You know this lame that's unforgiven
Men, women, and children
Hands up to the ceiling
Like facing up with the villain
But we never harm civilians
Strictly the herbal healing
Celebrated by many
But really that doesn't thrill 'em
This chain is fucking broken
People remain open
They fight the fucking system
Resistance is now in motion
On the gas, we never coasting
Not tripping by emotion
Everything calculated
Bare witness to the explosion
