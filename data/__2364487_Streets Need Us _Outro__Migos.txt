13 ContributorsStreets Need Us (Outro) Lyrics
They call us young rich niggas, for a reason
They told me leave the bando, it ain't that easy
Hot boy, but my jewelry out the freezer
They try to take us from the streets, the streets they need us

They bust my trap one more time, moving my trap to Geneva
Face card A1 no steak sauce, no passport need no Visa
We fuck up Neiman Marcus, we spend a stack on sneakers
Shoot him in his face, he gonna' wish that he had Jesus

They looking at me cause' they never seen money
Pull up in a Beamer with a onion
All Benjamins, blue hundreds
Came off the porch, I was wrapping mummies
Al Capone, meet the Tommy
Safe house, cross the country
Bugs Bunny got the bando jumping
Straight out the jungle, Giuseppe Jumanji

Hop out the whip and I'm dressed in the latest
I'm talking numbers, I ain't here for conversation
Put some ice on my neck and put some ice on my Bezel
Hop out the whip with the mask like I'm Jason
I walk where I want with that strap on my hip
I got the molly sack I'm good when I dip
I serve you some gas, call that a QuikTrip
Hit a bag for a show nigga, that's a quick flip
You might also like
Tray 1 got a bankroll
I'm cooking up crack rock casserole
I got your unc in the finger fold
He went from hustling to smoking blow
Now that shit be a damn shame
I got a hit, blame it on cocaine
Cocaine classic, coming out the wrapper
I swear to god Tray1 ain't just rapping

Young nigga go get him
Fuck the club up, fuck everybody with him
Too many bullets, can't miss him
I got a extra 30 shots in my Balmain denims
Whole team got racks
We a solid foundation, we just leave you with the sacks
Your Backwoods ain't fat
And that's a cut pint, nigga that's a motherfucking fact

Migo JerZ
And I'm still on the curb
I'ma jugg his ass if you give me the word
Take poured up so my words real slurred
If you want a point five then you ain't getting served
YRN on my neck for life
North side OG, been earned my stripes
Fuck with the Migos, you gon' pay the price
I'm in the trap with a Backwood, shooting dice
Pop the 4, Trey got that shit out the liter
Sippin on lean but I'm cooking the reefer
Young nigga I got more stripes than Adidas
Smile like a cheetah
Ho from the stables she work at the Cheetah
Running 10k for a visa
Fuck her and leave her
I'm a rich nigga, I pull up in creature
Young nigga ball like a preacher

Migo, Lingo
Young nigga stay with the strap
Fuck up my check, I'ma get it right back
My niggas are crazy and that is a fact
Bitches want to hate because of the fame
I never would trust them because they the same
Creeping through the night like Bruce Wayne
My money in my pocket gon' stay the same

Skippa da Flippa's the killer
The trap always gone' need me, I'm the best dealer
Arch your back lil more, now I bet you gone' feel 'er
Dab on a nigga ho in a chinchilla
Old school McGrady, I stay with the Rocket
I got the cannon, make you pop, lock, and drop it
You talk about blue hundreds, that is my topic
You sipping Karo, need to stop it
They call us young rich niggas, for a reason
They told me leave the bando, it ain't that easy
Hot boy, but my jewelry out the freezer
They try to take us away from the streets, the streets they need usEmbed
