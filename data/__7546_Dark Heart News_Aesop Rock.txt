40 ContributorsDark Heart News Lyrics
Limped up like a dog with three legs (shut-up) to the stage...
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the prudence of the
Dark Heart News

Breathin's a tug of war, wet when I rush the ball
Flushed, 29 bust gum stuck, clutch the door
Slumped in the back burn Bush by the son of George
Sweat tear and feed cause I don't bleed when I cut no more

A system of gods from each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laughs held

Spiraled get vertigo, signals the flash and beep
Postin my head for myself to get back to me
Pouch full of dynamite, blast cap anatomy
Bags full of smelling salts
Mad as the magazine attack
Medic, Stretcher, Call, cracked, Crazy, Header, Fall
A threat, a break, a mistake with a pulse
Pickin' every last fuckin piece of paint off the walls
You might also like
Okay the rotary corner grow to be notably mobile
And social gopher teeth form holes
Or any scene where Brie is normal
We'll locate every exit, had seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell

Burning it at both ends, friends let's commiserate
Turn it into something to the sound that the triggers make
Born at the baddest sign, half this time, still awake
Training all my zeros to perform like they're figure eights

Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
(Scratched) Extra, extra, read all about me

'ey, four corners of the globe
All invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with torch to the border line to boast
Watch them collide and explode
When I peel the blinds back, up jump the irons call
Monkey wrench in my hands, razor cut the islands off
Homemade taps-memories, I ignore the private calls
And ever since the 80's, I think something's in my Tylenols

What plague? Make an idolant brigade
So eager to walk planks, they will climb a tree and wait
Their irony is waning over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations come, we'll kindly disobey it
I will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
Can't hold howls in corrals with a key
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three
(THREE!)

If I had a dollar for every time I couldn't sleep
I could buy a million locks and finally read a book in peace
No more would my president come off as a crooked thief
And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me

Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Panel of contemporaries killing me loudly
99 models of fear on the wall timorous
Done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Three legged dogs that chew up the wrong food
Riff Raff (?) with (?) wolves
Land sharks know to take money, money, lose
Dark Heart News! AHH!
