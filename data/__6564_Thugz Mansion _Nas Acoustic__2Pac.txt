39 ContributorsThugz Mansion (Nas Acoustic) Lyrics
Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug's mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothing but peace, love
And street passion (I wanna go, nigga)
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's mama to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
‘Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just 20-some-odd years, I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
‘Cause, like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
‘Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings, in thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good (at thugs's mansion)
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion
Dear mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
(At thugs's mansion)
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion9Embed
