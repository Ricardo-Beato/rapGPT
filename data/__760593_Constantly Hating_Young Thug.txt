Pour that shit up fool, it's ours
Ha
Monster!
Man so you ain't gon' pour?
Oh, so you're gonna make a nigga beg you to pour?
Okay bool, you dig?
(Wheezy Beats)
Uh

Hopped out my mothafuckin' bed
Hopped in the mothafuckin' coupe (Skrrt)
Pulled up on the Birdman (Brr)
I'm a beast, I'm a beast, I'm a mobster (Ayy)
You got 50 whole bands, you'll be my sponsor (Just for the night)
Them snakes on the plane, me and Kanye-conda (Anacondas)
Yeah (Them anacondas)
I might piece him up and let my partner smoke him (Triple cross)
Chuck-E-Cheese him up, I pizza him, I roll him (Cross)
I'm a gangster, I don't dance, baby I poke
Right now I'm surrounded by some gangsters from Magnolia
I heard I put it in the spot, yessir she told me
My niggas muggin', these niggas YSL only
I heard my Nolia niggas not friendly, like no way
But we not friendly either, you know it
Ha!
Yeah, thumbs up
I've seen more holes than a golf course on Donald Trump's course
My bitch a tall blooded horse, nigga, bronco
And if you catch us down bet you're not gon' trunk us (No)
You got a body, lil' nigga, we got a ton of 'em (Yeah)
You got some Robin's, lil' nigga, we got some Batmans
I let that choppa go "blocka, blocka," get back, son (Back)
You got them MJs, nigga, I got them Jacksons (Racks)
You might also like
But really what is it to do
When the whole world constantly hatin' on you?
Pussy niggas hold their nuts, masturbatin' on you
Meanwhile the fuckin' federal baitin' on you
Nigga tell me what you do
Would you stand up or would you turn to a pussy nigga?
I got a hundred things to do
And I can stop rappin' but I can't stop stackin' fuckin' figures

Yeah, I'm from that mothafuckin' 'Nolia, nigga ('Nolia, nigga)
Birdman'll break a nigga nose, lil' nigga (Nose, lil' nigga, ah)
You need to slow your fuckin' roll, lil' nigga (Roll, lil' nigga, Thugger)
We created Ks on shoulders, nigga (Shoulders, nigga)
I'm a scary fuckin' sight, lil' nigga (Sight, lil' nigga, ah)
We won a hundred mil' on fights, lil' nigga (Fights, lil' nigga, hey)
A hundred bands, sure you're right, lil' nigga (Right, lil' nigga)
I keep some AKs on my flights, lil' nigga (My flights, lil' nigga, I do)
Birdman Willie B (What?)
Smoke some stunna blunts, now my eyes Chinese (Chinese)
Hundred K on private flights overseas (Overseas)
Choppas City nigga, free BG (BG)
Bentley with the doors all 'round, not a Jeep (Jeep)
Rich nigga shit, smoke two pounds in a week (In a week)
Can't find a bitch that don't know we them streets (We them streets)
Bitches know that I am Birdman, that's OG, brrat
But really what is it to do
When the whole world constantly hatin' on you?
Pussy niggas hold their nuts, masturbatin' on you
Meanwhile the fuckin' federal baitin' on you
Nigga tell me what you do
Would you stand up or would you turn to a pussy nigga?
I got a hundred things to do
And I can stop rappin' but I can't stop stackin' fuckin' figures

Nigga, I'm a crack addict
Thought about lettin' them get a cut
Then I went and snagged at it
Yeah, the new Boosie Badazz at it
I'ma drop a nigga life, just like a bad habit
I stick to the ground like a mothafuckin' rug
I'm a big dog, lil' fuck nigga, you a pup
Lil' bitch, clean your drawers before you think you're a thug
Before I be in front your shows, just like your pub
I ain't even lyin', baby
I swear to God I ain't lyin', baby, no
First I'll screw you without these pliers, baby, or
I might dap you like, "good try, baby"
Big B livin', baby
Them boys on my left throwin' up Cs
I promise their mama see them this week
And I don't break promises with my Ds (Them my dogs)
I want Ms and cheese, mister Mickey Ds
She know I am a beast, I am so obese (Rrar)
In Miami I swear they don't got good weed
Wiz Khalifa can you send me some weed please?
Yeah, overseas, nigga, top floor, clear windows, nigga
Glass house, drankin' GT, you understand?
We in that Red Light District, you understand?
We 3 and 1, that mean 3 on me, nigga, you understand me?
Just livin' the life, boy, ayy, Thug, just a dollar for a 1, nigga
We can blow a mil', boy
