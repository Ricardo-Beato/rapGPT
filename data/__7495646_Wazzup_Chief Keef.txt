He GTA bang, that boy from Forum Drive (Wassup, Sit Gang)
I can’t be beard chest, it feelin’ like Arm & Hammer (Wassup, Huh?)
My shorty beat the drum, I call ‘em David Banner (Wassup, Okay)
Granny made the style and mommy made the manners (Wassup, yeah, yeah)
Shawty pull up fresh, call her Dolce Gabanna (Wassup, Sosa baby)
Was a hander-hander, I’m an acrе handler (Wassup, GBE baby)
