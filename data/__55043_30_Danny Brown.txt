104 Contributors30 Lyrics
Sent your bitch a dick pic and now she need glasses
Turn your bitch Slick Rick right now if I flashed it
Ate a couple pills and took the bud up out the plastic
Flickin' bogey ashes, bitch, I stay blasted
Microphone Cassius, Magic with the sick shit
'Posed to been dead, but bitch, I'm still up in this bitch
Verbal herbal poison, words I contortion
Fucked a pregnant bitch, she save money on her ga-bortion
I feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ
Coverin' Too $hort, smokin' a Newport
Hurt, hoped the drugs would help the pain to go away
But all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray
So step inside the mind that revolves around the rhyme
And every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines
Dyin' in the arms of a blonde, blue-eyed twenty-something
Don't know her name, but the paramedics chest pumpin'
Thirty-something Black male OD'd off of pills
That he weren't prescribed, but they took his life
Left behind a daughter that don't really even know him
'Cause her mama thought he wouldn't make a living off of poems
But it was a long journey on a rocky road
Had a hoodie on and a jacket in the snow
Walkin' in the cold on the way to the studio
Nigga, that was just a couple years ago
Dropped a couple mixtapes on the 'net
Niggas tried to front like I wasn't all that
But guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Signed to Fool's Gold, now everything is all gnarly
Now these bitches want my number to get up in the party
Came a long way from extension cords in the window
Borrow neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo
Where the oven's never closed and the stove's never off
Every winter so cold, niggas sleepin' wearing scarf
But I always tell myself that it's gon' get better
You know who you is? You the greatest rapper ever
So now the pressure's on to prove that voice right
Some people never knew they goals, knew mine my whole life
So now his turn's up, fixin' up to bat
Pitchin' singles to the label when I used to pitch crack
I never learned to rap, always knew how
Ever since a nigga eight, knew what I would do now
When I turned twenty-eight, they like, "What you gon' do now?"
And now a nigga thirty, so I don't think they heard me
That the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed
Tears in my eyes, let me get this off my chest
The thoughts of no success got a nigga chasing death
Doin' all these drugs, hope an OD ain't next, triple-XYou might also like16Embed
