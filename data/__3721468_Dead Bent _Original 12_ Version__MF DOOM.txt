6 ContributorsDead Bent (Original 12" Version) Lyrics
("He's Super")
It's the DOOM, Super Metal Finger Villain, just chilling
("He's Super") Boutta' get this million, (Chilling) chilling
Yo, this chick tried to tell him:
Ooh, you're like the sun (She said)
Chasing all of the rain away (She said, she said, she said)
When you come around, you bring brighter days
(She told him)
You're the perfect one
For– (For yo, yo, yo, I told her)
And I will rock this mic (Rock this mic)
For always
It go like

I hold mics like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl-white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific, more times than dimes in a briznick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, your ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said "Darling, you was stupid though"
You know the Supervillain ("He is a super...")
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees out, styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's
The Super Metal Face Villain
He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U
Throwing divine rules to come through
We will overcharge you
And won't feel remorse for shit
Except for once—
Once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits (damn)
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (Who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From niggas with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter-proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof
You might also like
(Tat-tat) That's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at
I told her more wine, mingling with no single mentions of
Stay tuned for more spine-tingling adventures of...
Ha-ha-ha
