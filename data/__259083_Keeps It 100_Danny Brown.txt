8 ContributorsKeeps It 100 Lyrics
Danny, it's your Godfather, Trick Trick
These pussy ass niggas acting up again man?
You know what we gotta' do though
Just gotta' keep it 100
Fuck 'em

I keeps it 100, 100 on the streets
Pay a couple hundred get a nigga put to sleep
I keeps it 100, 100 on the tree
100 on the drink, come fuck with a G

Niggas is tough guys, they act real hard
Until it's on deck and you gotta' pull their card
See niggas will fold and my niggas ain't bluffing
Nigga you front, I'll take the top off your muffin
And I ain't no super-thug, nothing like that
I know any day I could easy get got
I been through the brawls nigga I done seen it all
10 on 1's, left bloody in my drawers
But nigga I come back, it ain't no thing
Catch a nigga slipping when he out tryna' hang
You go to the club nigga get that ass clubbed
Beat to fucking death with a fucking car glove
You might also like

I keeps it 100, niggas think they stuntin'
Niggas come around with all that pussy ass frontin'
Nigga you'll get stomped, pushed with the pump
Beat, stripped ass ho naked in the trunk
Bitch you in the back, nigga we in the front
Fully automatic MP5 I'm a thug
Got a problem with the D? Then I'm suggesting you jump
We gon' keep it 100 leave you with 100 lumps
Now you walk around sick looking like you've got the mumps
Stanky bitches you running with, them niggas punks
They talk real bad, nigga it ain't shit
State pen and corners Danny Brown and Trick Trick

See niggas is hard heads until they get taught
A motherfucking lesson then they ass get caught
For thinking that it's sweet like Mickey D's sweet tea
And you gon' see how easy I squeeze
This ain't no rap shit this more like a letter
To any stupid nigga that don't know better
So you gon' learn, get taught a quick lesson
Get your ass burned, bullets will have your flesh melting
You know I'm a G, you can see it in my eyes
You come to the D you'll get young burgularised
And that ain't no threat it's more like a promise
I'll put that on coupe, I'll put that on my Mama
