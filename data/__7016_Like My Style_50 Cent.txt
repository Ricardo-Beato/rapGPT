(Uh-huh)
I know you like my style (Uh-huh)
You like how I break it down
I know you like my style (Uh-huh)
You like how I break it down
I know you like my style (Uh-huh)
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how

On ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow
Teach ya how to turn Yayo into dough
The original don dada, nobody bomb harder
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hoodrats, they say "He so crazy"
The snitches, they say "He tried to spray me"
But that's what you get for tryna play me
The aftermath of my wrath is so shady
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop this
I catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coup√© cockpit
If you a pimp, why ya hoes stay outta pocket?
Front and find out how my P-40 Glock hit
"50, you need some help?" Chill, Yayo, I got this
See, where I'm from, man, the D's tryin' to knock us
They swear to God that it's me selling the choppers
Man, I ain't give them little niggas no product
You might also like
I know you like my style (Uh-huh)
But how much do you like my style? (Uh-huh)
You like how I break it down (Uh-huh)
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how (Uh-huh)
I know you like my style (Uh-huh)
But how much do you like my style? (Uh-huh)
You like how I break it down (Uh-huh)
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how (Uh-huh)

The birds they say I got a way with words
I be like "Baby girl, I like them curves"
If ya not busy tonight then we can swerve
I'm a bachelor, baby, fuck what you heard

From the Telly in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics 'cause they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood, they be tryna G us
Tryna holla at the kid every time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thuggin'
Put my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm buggin'
We family, baby, kissin' cousins
Now, look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese, my degrees is hotter than ya oven
I'm a New Yorker, but I sound Southern
And we sip DP 'til the Don stop bubblin'
After we play, okay, go to ya husband
I know you like my style (Uh-huh)
But how much do you like my style? (Uh-huh)
You like how I break it down (Uh-huh)
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how (Uh-huh)
I know you like my style (Uh-huh)
But how much do you like my style? (Uh-huh)
You like how I break it down (Uh-huh)
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how (Uh-huh)

Em' said you gon' like my style
Dre said you gon' like my style
I said you gon' like my style
You will like how I break it down

You're not really, really ready, ready
The drama'll have ya ass in trauma, boy
You're not really, really ready, ready
My knife flip open and then I gets to poking
You're not really, really ready, ready
Them shells start poppin', them bodies gets to droppin'
You're not really, really ready
You think you're ready? You're not
Really, really ready, ready9Embed
