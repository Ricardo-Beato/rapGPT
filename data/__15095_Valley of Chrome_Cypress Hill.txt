5 ContributorsValley of Chrome Lyrics
You can't hide from the man with the master plan
Huntin' for your head, "How I Could Just Kill a Man"
Ayo, where you at, baby? Keep your head low, damn
Got you on the camcorder in the black minivan
You crossed line, time for the light to blind
You can run but I never be far behind
You never know when it's gonna come, paranoid
'Cause the mentality is seek and destroy
Better look around before you come out your door
'Cause shit catches up but you don't want no more
Only time will provide the right sign for real
You might die 'cause you hesitate to find the steel

You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on, keep, keep, keepin on!
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin' on!

Listen up, motherfuckers, I got shit on my mind
The spotlight's on me and it's time to shine
I smack any brat that be jumpin' outta line
I smoke any fool try to diss on my rhyme
I get y'all when no one can't protect y'all
Wash your brain and have you infiltrate the
Same bunch of suckers that be tryin' to hate me
Wanna take me out so they can try and replace me
Fuck what ya heard, have ya seen lately?
The size of my clan is improving greatly
No holdin' back, bringin' the big heater
Watch a nigga run scared, faster than a cheetah
Speed of light, move faster than sound
But I'm still on they back and I'm gaining much ground
You might also like
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on, keep, keep, keepin' on!
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin' on!

No matter what you seen, we still smokin' the green
Represent for all the people still a part of the scheme
Playa haters, imitators wanna roll with the team
But they fade away, hate away, all for the cream
They wanna instigate and get me to forget my stake
Take advantage of the Real-a, rob killa who scrapes
Stupid motherfuckers who don't know who I am
Better step aside suckers watch the heater expand
Get outta hand, see the light, you and your clan
Better scram outta here before you get slammed
I stand strong, keepin' on, when I'm rollin' alone
But you sorry bitches hide away, place unknown

You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin' on, keepin on!
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin on!
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin' on, keepin on!
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin' on, keepin' on! Keepin on!1Embed
