Zaytoven
Yah
Oh yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah

Codeine, it sit on my kidney and dissolve
Hit a few licks with my dawgs, we mobbin'
Called a few chicks on my line, they slobbin
Girl on a girl, if they eat that's the topic
Thought she was true, she was fuckin' the opps
Can't tell her none, might be workin' with cops
Told me she loyal, I found out she not
Can't trust a unfaithful girl at the spot

Head over water, I ain't never gon' flop
Everything I do is super galore
Fuck on rich niggas, she don't care if you broke
Protectin' my heart like never before
Keep her around and she moral support
Three in a condo, I'm keeping 'em stored
Trap out the house with the bales on the floor
Ran outta hard, had to cook up some more
You might also like
My Cinderella, I'm keeping' her spoiled
Danced with the Devil so hard to avoid
Hand on the chrome, don't you never ignore it
I left some behind, they didn't leave me no choice
People get to me, can't tell I don't show it
Shit gettin' brutal, gon handle it with force
Yellow Presi and it wasn't off-shore
Enough water on me it can fill up the tub
Platinum your ice if you know where to store it
I smell the blood, I'ma eat you like sharks
Hold on to grudges, don't tear me apart
(don't tear me apart, don't tear me apart)
Yeah, blood on my griddle, phantom in the clear view
Top of the ceiling look just like Skittles
Get some utensils, goin' presidential
Cash in the revenue, all a nigga ever do
I made me a boss, I'm tellin' ya I feel very impeccable
A neck fulla beads, I'm tellin' ya this shit gettin' spiritual
Get down and plead, baby, and beg for forgiveness
I came with some lean, baby, and a whole lotta benefits

Codeine, it sit on my kidney and dissolve
Hit a few licks with my dawgs, we mobbin'
Called a few chicks on my line, they slobbin
Girl on a girl, if they eat that's a topping
Thought she was true, she was fuckin' the opps
Can't tell her name, might be workin' with cops
Told me she loyal, I found out she not
Can't trust a unfaithful girl at the spot
Head over water, I ain't never gon' flop
Everything I do is super galore
Fuck on rich niggas, she don't care if you broke
Protectin' my heart like never before
Keep her around and she moral support
Three in a condo, I'm keeping 'em stored
Trap out the house with the bales on the floor
Ran outta hard, had to cook up some more

I'm gettin' higher than satellite
You can get flyer than me in my afterlife
Sit down and watch me and have a bite
Put it on the floor, she gon' eat it up
Put it in a safe, we gotta keep it up
Throw 'em in a lake, you gotta teach 'em somethin'
Seen a wing on the pedal, and I stomp to the floor
Cost a couple of Ms tryna save a whore
Lucky as a blessing and there wasn't a loss
Wrapping a bale feel like my hand was forced
Put one of the girls in an executive Porsche
Crib with a maid, and it came with a horse
Cover the green like a golfer on course
Purchase that lean with no problems, of course
Brought the machine with the money ain't short
Where I come from, you know trappin' is sport
Codeine, it sit on my kidney and dissolve
Hit a few licks with my dawgs, we mobbin'
Called a few chicks on my line, they slobbin
Girl on a girl, if they eat that's a topping
Thought she was true, she was fuckin' the opps
Can't tell her name, might be workin' with cops
Told me she loyal, I found out she not
Can't trust a unfaithful girl at the spot

Head over water, I ain't never gon' flop
Everything I do is super galore
Fuck on rich niggas, she don't care if you broke
Protectin' my heart like never before
Keep her around and she moral support
Three in a condo, I'm keeping 'em stored
Trap out the house with the bales on the floor
Ran outta hard, had to cook up some more1Embed
