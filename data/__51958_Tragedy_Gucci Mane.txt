Lord knows I don't wanna be
In the penitentiary
But that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy
I be right back smoking weed
Chilling with the family
Cause that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy

Starting out my week with a quarter boat
Stupid strong and I won't sell a quarter O
I got 5-0 mad cause I'm infamous
Fuck fame, strippers love me..
"Back to work nigga! I know y'all niggas miss this shit!"

Y'all know I don't wanna be
In a penitentiary
But that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy
I be right back smoking weed
Chilling with the family
Cause that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy

Starting out my week with a quarter boat
Stupid strong and I won't sell a quarter O
I got 5-0 mad cause I'm infamous
Fuck fame, strippers love me ask Infamous
Fuck no, I ain't working for the minimum
I'm going in, every weekend is a cinema
So get a Coke, hot dog and some candy bars
I'm from the 6 but my dick dunn been in movie stars
I'm so high right now I want to buy the bar
Let everybody in free
I'm bringing all my cars
And I don't wanna be locked up, hell no!
But we got weight so really wanna sell dope

Y'all know I don't wanna be
In a penitentiary
But that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy
I be right back smoking weed
Chilling with the family
Cause that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy

Excuse me for being gangsta, I'm crazy
I couldn't have been a sissy
Mama wouldn't have fed me
I'm all-red and my Beemer confetti
I'm reminiscing 18 with the Chevy
I'm deadlift with a tool like Freddy
Not Jackson, Kruger, you smell me?
And no push ups, just kush up
No lay-ups, just caked up
E A G A got bakers
Eastside, can I roll through Decatur
I'm going hard for the squad
I'm the major
Anything move here, Gucci paper2Embed
