25 ContributorsChampagne Thoughts (Interlude) Lyrics
I would like to make an announcement
To everybody that said I wouldn't amount to anything
In the lines of music
I told you, what did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you?
Cause I told you
Mmhmm
And when did I tell you?
A long time ago
And what did I say?
What happened when I told you?
Exactly what just happened

I love to jump up on the track so poetic
But the champagne I'm sipping got me spitting moetic
The second I aim, I dead it
Now give me the credit
'Cause I envision myself living in wealth
Breakfast at Tiffany's
Lunch at Louis V's
Now excuse me please
I got dinner plans overseas
Killin' with ease
Young Sinatra got your girl
And now she a Bobby Soxer girl with nice clothes and thick curlsYou might also like3Embed
