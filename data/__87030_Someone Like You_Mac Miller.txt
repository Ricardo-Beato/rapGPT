Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like you
Someone like you

Uh, yeah
Light up 'til the pain gone (Gone), all I hear is the same song (Song)
When the radio came on, fuck around and get based on (Bitch)
Do this shit 'til the day I die (Die), are you ready (Ready), are you ready? (No)
Terrified but my hand is steady (Steady), verified, get the camera ready (Click)
Carry my own weight, all these earthquakes don't wake
Me up from this deep sleep (Sleep), divin' into this cold lake (Brr)
Fuck a bitch 'til her toes shake (Shake), tellin' me I'm her soulmate (Mate)
Disguised emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks (Uh-huh)
Dealin' with it since '08 (No), fucked around, now I'm done
And I heard you're supposed to race when you hear the sound of that gun (Blaow)
Now it's losin' all of its fun (Fun), spendin' days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
Not thinkin' logical (No), gettin' high, jump off the moon (Moon)
Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible (No), when the mind is so closed (Closed)
Came in for your money (Ha), then left with all of your hoes, ha
You might also like
Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind, start forgettin' what you know, oh
Shit ain't been the same since she left me here alone, woah
You hurt so good
Girl, your lovin' hurt so good (Uh)

Love me, love me, that fentanyl, it numb me (Numb)
Beautiful, it get ugly, turn you into a junkie (What?)
Still searchin' for something (Who?), but I don't know what (What)
Dreaming about nothing, wake you up and then fuck (Fuck)
I love it when you get a little nasty (Uh-huh)
Hit it from the back, if you like that, wiggle them ass cheeks (Blaow)
Isn't that sweet? Same shit we did last week (Uh-huh)
'Fore all the cash, you might've stood up and would've walked past me (Bye)
Wake me up from this bad dream (Dream), put a match to this gasoline ('Line)
Every night you somebody different, got me thinkin' it's Halloween
Fucked up, can't feel myself, work hard, might kill myself
Exist through audio, but all my problems as real as hell
Trapped in this wishin' well, death creepin' like Splinter Cell
Gettin' high, blew my mind away, find the words, what I'm tryna say
I'ma think of that later (Later)
When the world goes against you, you better get that paper (Paper)

Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind, start forgettin' what you know, oh
This shit ain't been the same since she left me here alone, woah
You hurt so good
Girl, your lovin' hurt so good
You hurt so good
You hurt so good67Embed
