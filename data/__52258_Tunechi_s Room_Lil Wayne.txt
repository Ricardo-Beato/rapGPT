56 ContributorsTunechiâ€™s Room Lyrics
Uh
Dana text me and say she wanna see me
Then sent a picture of her in the mirror
No clothes on, of course
She want that dope dick, hello, world, I'm the dope dealer
I love it when she talk crazy
That dick make her walk crazy
And last time was awesome
All the lines, we crossed 'em
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
I O. J. Simpson that pussy
Ha, yeah, that's the shit
Pussy taste so good, make you smack your lips
I don't know about you, but I'm a beast with mine
She say she waitin' for the Carter 69, ha
Ha, I told her, "Sorry for the wait"
I value her time like an Audemars Piguet
And we gon' stay current like the water in a lake
Yeah, we gon' fuck around like we fuckin' in a circle
Ha, pardon the slur, that's the purple
It feels so real like it's virtual
Any kind of position, she's versatile
And she take it every way except personal, haha
Yeah, that's my bitch
Pussy wetter than a wishin' well, I wish
I was in it right now instead of makin' this song
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the end zone
Don't trip when I say I can't see ya
And she say she workin' on her career
Smoke got our eyes lookin' like we're from Korea
We floatin', but I'ma rock the boat like Aaliyah
RIP, shorty got me
And shorty knows I fucks with her, hard body
Shorty fine by me, spend some time by me
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree
I know what's on your mind, fine
Yeah, we can do whatever that is
She tell me that it's mine, I say, "Fine"
Shit, I was taught to live and let live
So go and live it up, baby, giddy-up, baby
It's your world, ain't tryna interrupt, but maybe
We movin' too fast, but, fuck it, let's crash
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now it feel lovely, it feel great
I slide her: safe, ha
Yeah, yeah, all that good shit
No, I ain't a player, I just play it by the bullshit
I know what I'm doin', and she love how I do it
She throw that ass back and she never over-do it
Ha, she call me "baby" and I call her "bae"
Sorry for the wait, Carter 4 on the way
August 29
