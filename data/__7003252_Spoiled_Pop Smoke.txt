When's the last time you had a real one?
She said, "It's been a while"
Someone that's gon' deal wit' ya
She said she got no more
She said she just got her body done and it's still sore
From head to toe, she dripped in Christian Dior

See, there ain't no doubt about it, you're spoiled
See, you wanna be rewarded for bein' loyal, bein' loyal
You want me wrapped around your finger
Like a rapper or a singer, nah
See these diamonds in my teeth?
Bitch, I am royal, I am royal

When's the last time you had a real one?
She said, "It's been a while"
Someone that's gon' deal wit' ya
She said she got no more
She said she just got her body done and it's still sore
From head to toe, she dripped in Christian Dior

See, there ain't no doubt about it, you're spoiled
See, you wanna be rewarded for being loyal, being loyal
You want me wrapped around your finger
Like a rapper or a singer, nah
See these diamonds in my teeth?
Bitch, I am royal, I am royal
