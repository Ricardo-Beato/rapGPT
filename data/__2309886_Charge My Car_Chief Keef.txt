15 ContributorsCharge My Car Lyrics
Zaytoven
GIP Blood, man, GIP Cap, man (Grrah, bang)
I pulled up cappin', doors straight flappin' (Grrah, bang, grrah, bang)

My glove department filled with residue
Had to shit on you cause you thought you was cool
When I pull out them hundreds, boy, I'm blessin' dudes
I got a hundred for you, you, and you
Hop out at the gas station 'cause I'm a star
Full tank, 'cause I didn't even charge my car
I let the doors go up, then your bitch get in
She sees all this money, she say, "Chief Sosa you winnin'"

I rolled up ten joints, I got weed for days
I got all this green, I swear that it's my baby
I've been getting money since my senior days
But I forgot, I didn't go to school, I'm crazy
I put Margiela's on my fucking shoes
I poured two deuces, nigga, fuck some booze
I'm rollin' up three grams in a fuckin' wood
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm getting money, I'm good
I pull up to the club, and them doors go up
Motivation? No-you's only dumb fucks
Gotta use the shower, hella hundreds in the tub
The police can run in here, I don't give no fucks
You might also like
My glove department filled with residue
Had to shit on you cause you thought you was cool
When I pull out them hundreds, boy, I'm blessin' dudes
I got a hundred for you, you, and you
Hop out at the gas station 'cause I'm a star
Full tank, 'cause I didn't even charge my car
I let the doors go up, then your bitch get in
She sees all this money, she say, "Chief Sosa you winnin'"

I got a million unread texts
I got a million read text messages
I only read 'em if you're talkin' benji's
Can't be talking small, gotta be talkin' plenty
I got six hoes in six different beds
Dro and Mike told me I'm the black Elvis Presley
I got hoes in 50 different states
Been all around the world, can't tell me 'bout a penny
'Member kickin' doors and hittin' stains
I'm eatin' good, fuck your Craig Jenny
For all you dumb ass fucks, I'm talkin' Jenny Craig
Try to make me go on a diet, pussy, I ain't with it

My glove department filled with residue
Had to shit on you cause you thought you was cool
When I pull out them hundreds, boy, I'm blessin' dudes
I got a hundred for you, you, and you
Hop out at the gas station 'cause I'm a star
Full tank, 'cause I didn't even charge my car
I let the doors go up, then your bitch get in
She sees all this money, she say, "Chief Sosa you winnin'"Embed
