16 ContributorsBIG CHILLIN Lyrics
Okay, I'm big chillin’ (Chillin', ayy, ayy)
Told me that she numb to it, she don't get feelings
I’m a smooth criminal, I'm a slick villain
I already finished, but the dick still in (Dick still in)
Ass fat, she ain't get fillings (Fillings)
Weezy F. Baby, I don't hit ceilings
And my brodie got a job, yeah, he quit dealing
OGs tryna figure what the kids feelin' (Kids feelin')

The flow need penicillin
I been trying to get these pent up feelings off
I could give a fuck about how the fuck you feel about everything
Ice make it sound like I carry change (Carry change)
She's addicted to the Mary Jane
But she's still got goals like Harry Kane
Pussy hit me like a hurricane
And I came quick but the shit was not embarrassing (Ooh)
Go and let it marinate
Show packed out and I’m standing on a barricade
Bad chick, black dress with a pair of shades
On the sidewalk, in the crib she don’t wear a thing
She don't wear a thing when we in the crib, you already know, ayy
She don’t wear a thing, yeah, she get naked 'round me, she don't⁠—

Okay, I'm big chillin’ (Chillin', ayy, ayy)
Told me that she numb to it, she don't get feelings
I'm a smooth criminal, I'm a slick villain
I already finished, but the dick still in (Dick still in)
Ass fat, she ain't get fillings (Fillings)
Weezy F. Baby, I don't hit ceilings
And my brodie got a job, yeah, he quit dealing
OGs tryna figure what the kids feelin' (Kids feelin')

Just like Fig Newtons
Man, these fellas real sweet, it's no disputin'
No tickets at the door, I can't get you in
Know we used to have something, but it's slick ruined (Ruined)
Slick talk, can't stop, won't stop until the world pissed off
In a plane every week, I'm getting sick of Biscoffs (Ooh)
Your chick getting picked off (Uh)
Think about life, trying to get the jigsaw put together
They ain't fucking with you 'til it's all put together (Ayy)
When she stepping out, she looking all put together (Ooh)
Fuck what the world thinks
Because my dogs know me better (Ooh)
Because my dogs know me better
And she's a bad motherfucker
How could we not go together?
Okay, I'm big chillin' (Chillin', ayy, ayy)
Told me that she numb to it, she don't get feelings
I'm a smooth criminal, I'm a slick villain
I already finished, but the dick still in (Dick still in)
Ass fat, she ain't get fillings (Fillings)
Weezy F. Baby, I don't hit ceilings
And my brodie got a job, yeah, he quit dealing
OGs tryna figure what the kids feelin' (Kids feelin')1Embed
