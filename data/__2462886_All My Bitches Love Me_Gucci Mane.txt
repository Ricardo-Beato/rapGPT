She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
VVS all my rocks, my watch
I love you too baby (It's Gucci! So Icey CEO)

Shawty says she loves me but I’m thinking maybe
Wanna have my baby
And wanna name him Radric
My name Radric Davis, I am not a savior
Radric is a player but Gucci is the mayor (It’s Gucci!)
Shawty fine as hell but she slick as hell
Love the way she walk and I love the way she smells
Shawty says loves me, but I don’t believe her
What about your ex-man? Could have been your husband
What about your boyfriend? Better yet your girlfriend
Girl got a girlfriend, But I don’t have a girlfriend
But I got a bitch tho sitting in my seven four
Ridin through the Six slow hood love me
So Icey Boyz everybody got a bad bitch
Juice keep a bad bitch, Zay keep a bad bitch
Frenchie got a bad bitch, Whoo got a bad bitch
Gucci got a bad bitch and Waka got a bad bitch

All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, I am very lucky (kisses hahahaha)
My bitch says she loves me, my bitch says she loves me
I am very lucky, cuz my bitch say she loves me
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, my bitch says that she loves me
I am very lucky, I think that she loves me (It’s Gucci Baby)
You might also like
All my bitches love me, my bitch is not ugly
My bitches ain’t dusty, but your bitch is busted
Yo bitch is a buster, my bitch is a hustler
She don’t fuck with suckas, she know you a sucka
You probably know of her, you may even fucked her
She can’t give me nothing but a nut because I’m stuck up
Gucci got a dump truck and he got a hummer
And he painted all of his cars green for the summer
You a freaky gurl but I don’t want your number
(noooooo) I just want that thang beat up just like it’s a drumma
BumBumuBum grab you by your pum pum
Then I pull out a condom and make her want some (It's Gucci)

All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, I am very lucky (kisses hahahaha)
My bitch says she loves me, my bitch says she loves me
I am very lucky, cuz my bitch say she loves me
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, my bitch says that she loves me
I am very lucky, I think that she loves me (It’s Gucci Baby)

Gucci Mane a bachelor, damn you attractive
Looking for the baddest bitch cuz I think I can handle it
My swag is conceited, some bitches can’t stand it
Some over stand it, but some don’t understand it
All my bitches love me, but I’m not romantic
But I love it when they were their dress without the panties
Gucci Mane, I’m madness, don’t you think I’m handsome?
Curling like a Lambo, You handle like a Phantom
Hotter than a candle you trying to get a temper
Can I get a sample? I feel like a need a pamper
So Icey the shit girl, don’t you think we handsome?
Don’t you think we handsome?Embed
