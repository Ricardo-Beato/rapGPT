Yo man, you gotta be, you know
You gotta be on to dime, man, what's up with that?
Yo bro-shot
Yeah, word up bro-shot
Uh, we need some brothers to be, uh, like dropping knowledge
And writing good stuff
Ayy man, why don't you quit talking all that stuff and do something about it
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, you talking about kick some, uh, knowledge
Yeah, won't you do that like right now
Some wisdom for the people
What's up with that?
Okay, I got it
("Brothers and sisters")

Ya mom is so fat (How fat is she?)
Ya mama is so big and fat that she can get busy
With twenty-two burritos but times are rough
I seen her in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (What?) ya mama smokes crack (What?)
She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back
Her knuckles drag down to the ground when shе walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk
You might also like
Nakеd on a mountain top, tootin on a flizute (Flute)
Ridin' on a horse drinking whiskey out a bizoot (Boot)
She's got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
(Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it)
Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
(Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama)

Ya mama look like she's been in the dryer with some rocks
With the big bust nose sucking dirt out of socks
Held up the ice cream truck with a slingshot
She grabbed a bag of Cheese Corn and a soda pop
Ya mama root'n'toot and stole my loot and my suit
She may have the muscles, but no, she's not cute
She's not pretty, oh what a pity, got the glass titty
Filled up with Kool-Aid, just for the kiddies

On a cliff butt naked, tootin' on a flute (Flute)
Ridin' on a horse drinkin' whiskey out a boot (Boot)
She's got the teeth and the wings of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama got the wooden legs with real feet
(Ya mama got the wooden legs with real feet)
I said ya mama got the wooden legs with real feet
(Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama)
Watch out, I'm thinking about your mother to a funky beat (What?)
I went to your house (What?), and she licked me on the cheek (What?)
I said, "Excuse me lady, but I remember seeing you at the Palladium
Way back in September
'Cause you was beatboxin' for Lou Rawls
In some bright red boxer drawers"
You said ya moms was pretty and young
But she's old as dirt and got hair on her tongue

Ya moms, ya moms, she uses Brut
And I saw her ridin' a horsey drinkin' whiskey out a boot
She's got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Ya mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand
(Ya mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand)
I, I, I, I said ya mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand
(Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama)

Ah, ya mom is so fat (How fat is she?)
We rode up on her back to get some burgers from Wendy's
And her skates went flat; I got stuck in her butt crack
They thought I was lost but I was caught by the G-strap
Heaven forbid a giant fart would give way
'Cause that would blow me 'round the world in a day
We drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
Because we dressed her up to look just like a Chevrolet
Naked on a mountain top tootin' on a flizute (Flute)
Ridin' on a horse drinkin' whiskey out a bizoot (Boot)
With the wings and the teeth of an African bat (Ba-aa-aa-at)
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama's got an afro, with a chin strap
(Ya mama's got an afro, with a chin strap)
I said ya mama's got an afro, with a chin strap
(Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama)

Ya mama got snake skin teeth
Ya mama wears coat hangers for earrings , dude, she looks like...
Ya mama was making sex threats to Ricky Bell and shit
Ya mama jacked the Kool-Aid man for a sip, nigga
Ya mama was walking down on Sunset with a 99 cent sign on her back, dude
(You're a sellout) Ya mama's a sellout nigga
Nigga, ya mama did a pop tune, nigga
Ya mama's glasses are so thick she look into a map and see people wavin' at her
Your mother got an Ouija board on her back
Sidney, you should be hearing everything that you be saying
His mother be hooked, fishin' with a hook and reel at the frozen food section
Tre's mama got Playdough teeth and shit
Ya mother be eatin' Daytons like Now and Laters and shit
Ah, ya mama's an extra on The Simpsons and shit
Ya mama's so fat you can't even see her legs
It just looks like she's just gliding across the floorEmbed
