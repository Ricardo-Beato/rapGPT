8 ContributorsDon’t Deserve Me Lyrics
Yeah
I be tryna tell these niggas, man

Heard some money out this bitch, I'm up early
Tryna help a nigga get it, they ain’t worthy
Yeah, I said what I said, hope they heard me
Nah, y'all motherfuckers don't deserve me (Nah)
I ain’t blind, yeah, I seen the way you switched (Woo)
Like Rico did Money Making Mitch (Damn)
Yeah, I said what I said, hope they heard me (Hope they heard me)
Nah, y'all motherfuckers don't deserve me

My nigga hit my line, said he got hit up for three
I'm gon' grab the chopper, nigga, where I need to be? (Boom)
Nigga actin' too cool just to have lost three bricks
Next week, this nigga buy a Cadillac and shit (Damn)
I seen what you doin', I ain't motherfuckin’ blind
Tryna help him get some money, this motherfucker tryna shine
Fast forward when I was workin’ on Thug Motivation
This grumpy motherfucker sittin' around a nigga hatin’ (Yeah)
Actin' like he Tonto and my name Ceto
Only thing free in this game is a free throw
You might also like
All that fake love, you ain't my motherfuckin' brother
Had to cut him off, I ain’t no motherfuckin' sucker (Nah)

Heard some money out this bitch, I'm up early
Tryna help a nigga get it, they ain't worthy
Yeah, I said what I said, hope they heard me
Nah, y'all motherfuckers don't deserve me (Nah)
I ain't blind, yeah, I seen the way you switched (Woo)
Like Rico did Money Making Mitch (Damn)
Yeah, I said what I said, hope they heard me (Hope they heard me)
Nah, y'all motherfuckers don't deserve me

Niggas come around with expectations
Shit don't got they way, niggas gon' be hatin'
Seen this before, so I'm gon' be waitin' (Waitin')
Shit never fails, so I'm gon' be patient (Yeah)
Gave niggas jobs, even put niggas on (On)
Yet still, niggas sing the same old song (Song)
You ain't hit the target, nigga, I gave you a shot
Either gave you a hit record or I gave you a pot (Woo)
They wouldn't let you in the door, but I walk you in the buildin'
Only thing I'm takin' care of, nigga, is my children
All that fake love, you ain't my motherfuckin' brother
Had to cut him off, I ain't no motherfuckin' sucker (Nah)

Heard some money out this bitch, I'm up early
Tryna help a nigga get it, they ain't worthy
Yeah, I said what I said, hope they heard me
Nah, y'all motherfuckers don't deserve me (Nah)
I ain't blind, yeah, I seen the way you switched (Woo)
Like Rico did Money Making Mitch (Damn)
Yeah, I said what I said, hope they heard me (Hope they heard me)
Nah, y'all motherfuckers don't deserve meEmbed
