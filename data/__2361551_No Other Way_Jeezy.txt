5 ContributorsNo Other Way LyricsYeah I’m street smart nigga plus my heart as tuff as penitentiary bars nigga
You gon' boss or you gon' fold nigga I don’t give a fuck no more

Cause there ain’t no other way
Just know I'm standing taller than I ever stood
For every real nigga off in every hood
Cause there ain't no other way
When the pressure on I hustle hard
Talkin' money longer than a Marta
Cause there ain't no other way
You pussy niggas plotting on my downfall
Pussy niggas know how I get down dog
Cause there ain't no other way
Won't lose rather die won't quit rather try roll something
Cause there ain't no other way

Fuck all y'all monkey niggas,  y'all sweat from my fuckin' balls
Just know I’ll leave this bitch and go straight home to fuck ya broad
That boy reincarnated he came back too hard
He hungry as a muthafucka, them folks took his black card
It's back to the basics like they gone repo my shit
Me and Pinkney on Papa Street, we was broke than a bitch
Know you vultures your waiting back focused you're hating
It must be something in this weed I feel rejuvenated
If he keep speaking on me than he can't be my homie
Listen to gossip 'bout real niggas that make you a phony
Talkin' birdies no wings 8 ball and a dream
If anything I owe Goldmouf he took one for the team
You might also like
Cause there ain’t no other way
Just know I'm standing taller than I ever stood
Every real nigga off in every hood
Cause there ain't no other way
When the pressure on I hustle hard
Talkin' money longer than a Marta
Cause there ain't no other way
You pussy niggas plotting on my downfall
Pussy niggas know how I get down dog
Cause there ain't no other way
Won't lose rather die won't quit rather try roll something
Cause there ain't no other way

I refuse to lose I paid my dues Jizzle lost it April Fools
Never bite the hand that feed you, put you down you know the rules
You niggas ain't got a hustling bone in your body
Penthouse mindstate while you talkin' 'bout the lobby
Why my name all on your lips while that Ana in your heart
Keep on playing with me pussy beat yo ass so help me God
If I know one thing I know you ain't to be trusted
You know anything you know I ain't to be fucked with
Got real shit goin' on, bill shit goin' on
Hustle is terrific and my grinding is exquisite
Talking birdies no wings 8 ball and a dream
If anything I owe Mailman he took one for the team
Cause there ain’t no other way
Just know I'm standing taller than I ever stood
Every real nigga off in every hood
Cause there ain't no other way
When the pressure on I hustle hard
Talkin' money longer than a Marta
Cause there ain't no other way
You pussy niggas plotting on my downfall
Pussy niggas know how I get down dog
Cause there ain't no other way
Won't lose rather die won't quit rather try roll something
Cause there ain't no other way1Embed
