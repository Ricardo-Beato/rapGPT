9 ContributorsFuckin’ Witcha Lyrics
I love my fans and I love my clan
And we stay with bands
So if you love your man say, say
I'm fuckin' witcha, even if you aren't
Boy I'm fuckin' witcha, yeah let's fuck baby
Cause you're up baby, you're so up baby
You're stuck up baby
And I ain't got money on the floor you can't step up under that
I got one old school you might step up under that
Yeah, I said yeah, yeah

And I'm ridin' down the street, I'm about to turn a ride in your ho
I got xans mixed with syrup and (?) all on my clothes
And if you never heard about me boy, ask your ho
I'm listenin' to the Lil Mike, I mean Ca$h Out so touch your toes
Ohhh, live life like a rock star baby
Born in Jonesboro South, but I live with pop stars, baby
Your ho look scary like a cop car baby
I'm so high if I had a gun I could pop stars baby
What the fuck you mean (?) baby girl you trip
What the fuck you mean I'm broke? You need a whip
Come here let me see that ass ho

So up baby, you're stuck up baby
And I ain't got money on the floor you can't step up under that

Have you ever had your name on the seatbelt of your flight?
Because that bitch belong to you
Motherfuck who think they king, baby girl I'm thronin' you
Lil tomboy ass cologne for you
And I ain't never, never had a girl like you
I swear every girl can get some pearls for you
I swear I just had to love the girl for you

Got goons on go, not friendly, bitch
Pulled up in Haiti in a Bentley, bitch
And my whole crew buyin', not renting shit
And I called the plug up, so you know that I sent for it
Hundred bricks on the road the birds flock together
Put some change on your head, call me "Money" Mayweather
And nigga I can show you how to pick a feather
Half a brick to a whole thing, remix, put it back together
And I got my Adidas on, but I got more stripes
And what these niggas rappin' bout, hey man that's your life
And I bet these niggas feel left cause I went so right
And if I turned this four into a nine it'd be so right

I love my fans and I love my clan
And we stay with bands
So if you love your man say, say
I'm fuckin' witcha, even if you aren't
Boy I'm fuckin' witcha, yeah let's fuck baby
Cause you're up baby, you're so up baby
You're stuck up baby
And I ain't got money on the floor you can't step up under that
I got one old school you might step up under that
Yeah, I said yeah, yeah1Embed
