I remember all those hungry nights
I remember when they told me I would never
See my name in those flashing lights
But little did they know
That when you're a star
Means that you're chosen, yeah
Let your light shine bright
Get in a Husslas State of Mind
Be who you are
Don't lose your focus, no
You better get on your grind
Get in a Husslas State of Mind

I left the streets alone
I had to take a chance
I did it for my daughter
I hope my niggas understand
I can't believe I sat in it
No matter of fact, I can
See, first it was my dream
Then it became it my plan
I was always strapped
That's cuz I gangbang
My city teaches people use yo' pistol, not yo' brain
Knee deep in these streets, I'm still tryna' make a change
So everyday Nip Hussle live up to his last name
Slauson Boy gang
Through the joy and the pain
Seen the best and worst days
So we play 'em both the same
Hit a lick don't celebrate
Take a loss and I won't complain
I know that I'm a boss and that's just a part of the game
My new gold chain and 2 kilos of cocaine
Put 'em both on the scale, they gon' come back the same
And in my young life, the only rule that I obey
Is All Money In, No Money Out everyday
Hussle
You might also like
I remember all those hungry nights
I remember when they told me I would never
See my name in those flashing lights
But little did they know
That when you're a star
Means that you're chosen, yeah
Let your light shine bright
Get in a Husslas State of Mind
Be who you are
Don't lose your focus, no
You better get on your grind
Get in a Husslas State of Mind

Look
Look, I wish we all made it as rappers and ball players
But truth of the matter, it's...
Look, I wish we all made it as rappers and ball players...
Look, I wish we all made it as rappers and ball players
But truth of the matter, it's really based on your mind state
If you want it, then grind daily
Get it, then shine crazy
First class, leather seats is how I'm flyin' lately
I'm gettin' June money tryn' make July pay me
Cuz if they violate me, who gon' feed my baby
And I didn't tryna see the institution
So my music is the pudding that the people see the proof in
Started at the bottom
Said I couldn't do it
Now I'm lookin' like a problem
Somebody call Houston
Ask yo' favorite rapper
Bet he'll tell you I'm the future
I'm the streets and in the booth
I turn my life into a movie
And yea I did dirt
But I believe in God
I beat a couple cases
And every single odd
That was stacked up against me
I put on my for my city
Now every time I fuck inside the roof I'm makin' history
I remember all those hungry nights
I remember when they told me I would never
See my name in those flashing lights (Hussle)
But little did they know (It's all hood tho)
That when you're a star (yea, yea)
Means that you're chosen, yeah
Let your light shine bright
Get in a Husslas State of Mind (Hussle)
Be who you are
Don't lose your focus, no
You better get on your grind
Get in a Husslas State of MindEmbed
