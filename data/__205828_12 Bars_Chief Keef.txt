Got his bitch trippin' 'cause she seeing me, thought she was off a trippy stick
Don't know why she sneak dissin' to me, say he got a shrimpy dick
Pull off in that Rari, now they think I'm on some fishy shit
Two year ago I ain't have no car, I was on that 'come get me' shit
Two years ago I ain't have no job, I was on that young drilla shit
Posted on the block with the Glock, tryna drill some shit
Don't give no fuck, that thot with the opps, I'ma drill a bitch
And I swear these opps know how I rock, Glo until I be killed
I don't want your bitch, boy, let me see if I can fit her in my schedule
I won't wife a bitch, boy, these bitches be goin' everywhere
I don't care 'bout goin' to jail, they treat me like heaven there
'Fore I let a nigga try to kill me, I'ma send his ass 11 shellsYou might also like19Embed
