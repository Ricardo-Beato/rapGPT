120 ContributorsMake Her Say (I Poke Her Face) Lyrics
I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-oh-oh
What up? Ah-ah
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
Me first... Ha-ha!

Ugh, ugh-ugh, she wanna have whatever she like
She can if she bring her friend
And we can have one hell of a night
Through the day, ayy

I mean, you staring like a creeper 'cause you gotta peep her
I mean, you prolly might be saying you ain't jockin' either
But, man, ol' girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, the type to make you tell a bitch, "Just dance"
And fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for her bitches (Ayy)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for the sticking (Ayy)
And fuck them other niggas, hope she down for some licking (Ayy)
And fuck them other bitches 'cause she down for the tricking, ugh
I'm hopin' she a rider
When it's said and done, do she spit it up or swallow now?
I ain't gotta trip about them niggas who like her
'Cause me and mami know who can really make her go
You might also like
Oh, oh-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face (Ugh-ugh)
Pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh (Yeah)
Ah-ah-ah-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face (Ayy)
Pa-pa-poke her face
What she talking 'bout, 'Ye?
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah) Yeah

She said she want whatever she like
She said she gon' bring her friend
And we gon' have a hell of a night
Through the day

I made her say—Hold up, (Yeah?) born in '88? (Word?)
How old is that? (Man!) Old enough
I got seniority with the sororities
So, that explain why I love college
Getting brain in the library 'cause I love knowledge
When you use your medulla oblongata
And give me scoliosis until I'm comatos-es
And do while I'm sleep, yeah a little osmosis
And that's my commandment you ain't gotta ask Moses
More champagne, more toasts-es
More damn planes, more coasts-es
And fuck a bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa, -oza
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh (Yeah)
Ah-ah-ah-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say

She said she want whatever she like
But you gotta bring your friend
And we can have one hell of a night
Through the day

She blamed it on the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-alcohol (Woo!)
She had her hair did; it was bound to fall (Woo!)
Down, down for a—damn, Cudi already said it
Her poker Facebook, I already reddit
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body, known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South, looking for a payday
Said, "Bitch, you should do it for the love like Ray J"
But they say, you be on that conscious tip
Get your head right, and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the godly to the party
It's the way I was raised on the Southside safari, so
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my (Woo!)
No, he can't read my poker face (Woo!)
She's got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody34Embed
