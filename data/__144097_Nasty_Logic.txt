Nasty
I don't ever stop! Ugh!
Sinatra
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Cannon

It’s funny how your role model gets outdated, becomes the old model
At the hotel, askin' for mo' bottles
Ménage et plus one, I’m fuckin' fo' models
Wordplay that elevates minds like Aristotle
Murci-lago, whippin' through Chicago
All these beautiful women follow wherever I go
Million-dollar deals on the table
Just a couple years ago, I couldn’t pay for cable
Growing up surrounded by 'caine like I was Abel
Shit was unstable, now Visionary's the label
Plus Def Jam, know who I am
I’m that motherfucker that do it just ’cause I can (The cannon)
Now I’m on a level that your elevator can’t reach
I got information that the school system doesn’t teach
I got verses that your Sunday service wouldn’t dare to preach
Second coming of Christ flow, they like, "woah"
Rapture you with lyricism, kidnap your soul
And changed your mind like I’m penetrating your skull
I seen shit John Lennon couldn’t imagine
Just me and a mic on a main stage spazzin'
It’s the type of shit normal people can’t even fathom
So much swag, kiss your bitch and she orgasm
I’m hazardous, you would have sworn I was from Nazareth
I’m resurrecting hip-hop like it was Lazarus

Real
(I'm the one)
Nasty, all- all the time

Step to the mic and they gon' dread it like Weezy
Man, this industry is so damn greasy
Swaggin' on the track, they say I sound like Yeezy
But I don't give a fuck cause gettin' money too easy
21st century, doing something mean to it
Play this in the south and everybody gonna lean to it
"Greatest of all time" has got a nice ring to it
We do it for the music, money ain't a thing to us
Been shining muhfucka what's bling to us
Most loved, most hated at the same time
Star player in this bitch and it's game time
Who you know lyrically killed the club in the same rhyme?
They call me Logic, motherfucker, better know the name
I spit crack like Pusha (Yuugh!), Novocaine
We never dumb it down, you know we just numb it down
And watch you get up in your feelings when we come around
Grew up on section 8, you probably can't relate
‘Cause y’all just watched the throne, I’m tryna checkmate
I been shinin since before I brought them diamonds in, and
They talk that shit, they talk that shit, it’s so astonishin'
Y’all better swallow that pride like a klonopin
'Cause I can lay tracks with my eyes closed, China man
Real
(I'm the one)
Nasty, all- all the time

Got a show in LA Sunday, then New York Monday
Looking at the BET cypher like I’ll be there one day
It’s the Roc reincarnated, we call it Visionary
Fuck the world ’til I’m on top, we call that missionary
The game’s on pause, it need to load again
These rappers is reruns and we need a new episode again
Yeah, well motherfucker, this the pilot
So fly I recorded this on the PJ next to the pilot on a CB
Now you see me on the TV
Said this would happen back in the day but you ain’t believe me
So um, I'ma keep rising to the top
Never stop and finger fuck the world ’till the day my album drop76Embed
