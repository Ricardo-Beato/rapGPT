Real hot girl shit
(Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it)
And the motherfuckin' City Girls
(Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it)

I would never trip about any old dick (Yeah)
If my heart broke, it's nothin' that my jeweler won't fix (That my jeweler won't fix)
Put some ice on my chest just to cool my shit (Brr)
And I keep me a fur, 'cause I'm a real cold bitch, ayy (Ah)
I'm a cold bitch, yes, I'm a cold piece
Lookin' for a Mr. Freeze to get froze like me (Like me)
Got a lot of cold stones, and I ain't talkin' ice cream (Ice cream)
Put my arm to the sun, bet I melt your wholе team
Okay, now can I take your order? I'ma sеrve 'em what they wanted (Yeah)
Bitches thinkin' they the shit when they really toilet water (When they really toilet water)
They don't go against me, they gon' go bar for bar? (Bar for bar?)
I'ma get 'em in the end like Simba did Scar (Ayy)
Oh, shit, I think I'm pregnant, but I don't see no belly (I don't see it)
These bitches tryna come my way before they even ready (They premature)
They say I got the skills, they say I got the look (I got the look)
I got so many bars, they puttin' money on my books, hey (On my books)
Be mad at them niggas how you be mad at me (Bitch)
He got you lookin' stupid, but you wanna argue with me (Huh?)
I got a couple of bitches mad 'cause I don't fuck with them no more (I don't fuck with them no more)
But since you say you so unbothered, what you speaking on me for? (Shh)

Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it
Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it
Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it
Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it

Top-notch bitch, I'm A-listed (Huh?)
This City Girl shit, can't flex like this
Old country-ass bitch can't dress like this (Can't)
Bye, do it on the dick and a bitch (Period)
Clap this ass on that dick, I'ma spazz on that dick
Go to sleep, take a nap, I'ma crash on that dick
I won't beg for no dick, I won't cry for no dick
If your dick broke, nigga, put a cast on that dick
Rich with an attitude, R-W-A (You is)
Bitch, I got kids, I know how you hoes play (You do)
Ice cube, peanut pussy, eat it, soufflé (Ow)
These hoes my sons, I should call 'em O'Shea
Fuckboys, I ain't pressed for 'em (At all)
I need a nigga with a Patek and a TEC on him (Ice, ice, ice)
Big dick, Chrome Hearts, and baguettes on him
If he got the bread, I'ma do the rest for him, period

Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it
Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it
Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it
Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it
Ayy, real bitch, but that body built like a doll (Like a doll)
I ain't in no competition with these hoes at all (With these hoes at all)
I should own a bakery way niggas bring the cake to me (Ah)
And if that boy a baller, I bet I can make him play for me
Okay, now, do it for a real bitch (Yeah), buy a bitch a real bag (Buy a bitch a real bag)
Before I pick the wrong nigga, make sure your friends tagged (Who is he?)
Do it for them bitches and they friends who be big mad (Ah)
I know my haters watchin', so I do it for they bitch-ass

Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it
Do it on the dick, do it on the dick, do it, do it
