11 ContributorsAbove Dem Niggas Lyrics
Thugger
Hey, hey you, come here! Come here ho
I mean, I eat you alive
Come here

I've been gettin' money before you niggas
And if they ever, ever play I'ma show you niggas
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas
And I ain't Young Money but I'm above you niggas
Hey, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga
I say, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga

I'm cryin' wolf, I'm on that kush, kush
Got 23 grams of that Reggie so I mush, bush
Like, get away from me, you tastin' me
Your bitch patiently wait for me
As I, fuck that
These fuck niggas really play 'round here
Ummm, actin' like Big Will ain't really the man 'round here
Let YG come and stand 'round here
Really? he'll tell them fuck niggas really ran 'round here
Oops I mean ran 'round here, got the gun 'round here
And if your bitch ridin' here, she come 'round here
Actually she comes 'round here
Which means they fuckin' on her, she a pussy donor
Sorry, my diamonds are yellow No Coronas
You might also like
I've been gettin' money before you niggas
And if they ever, ever play I'ma show you niggas
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas
And I ain't Young Money but I'm above you niggas
Hey, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga
I say, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga

I been throwed away what y'all just got
I'm with a bad bitch, she look like she from Baywatch
And I gotta line that you don't wanna cross
I get your head knocked off for an ounce of soft
Put 'em in the lost and found, go kickback in my loft
Inches fast growin' up and just laugh it off
Anyway, I got bills bigger than y'all
And please, don't make me pull the semi
That bitch sing a sad song with another end
Don't make me send them goons to come and clean your premise
All my goons strapped up, every clip extended
And you can get it, pussy nigga, I'm in it

I've been gettin' money before you niggas
And if they ever, ever play I'ma show you niggas
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas
And I ain't Young Money but I'm above you niggas
Hey, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga
I say, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga
I say we been gettin' money, that should be my middle name
I'm just a young gunner tryna get a little fame
You little niggas lame, bitch, I am a renegade
Before you shoot that burner, you gotta learn to penetrate
But we gonna show them niggas
Pull up and get to it like we owe them niggas
No deal but I'm at the front row of the Grammies
Grab a Swisher Sweet and stuff 'em with them grammies
Now we in the Sicilian suite
No Halloween
But we trick 'em and treat 'em
Chopper make 'em spin
Should I call that the ass cap?
I'm at the finish line you still stuck at your last lap

I've been gettin' money before you niggas
And if they ever, ever play I'ma show you niggas
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas
And I ain't Young Money but I'm above you niggas
Hey, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga
I say, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga1Embed
