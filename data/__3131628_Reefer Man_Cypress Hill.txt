La-la-la-la-la-laaa, la-la-la-la-laaa (Smoking)
La-la-la-la-la-laaa, la-la-la-la-laaa (Come on)

Far and wide, high and low (High and low! High and low)
Close your eyes, we up in smoke (Ha-ha-ha)
Swim the sky, here we go
Round and round (round and round), the reefer blows
Far and wide (come on), high and low
Close your eyes (close your eyes), we up in smoke
Swim the sky, here we go
Round and round, the reefer blows

As it travels through your lungs back out, I see it swirl
Now you're feeling I'm without a care in the world (Once again)
But that's what happens when you come see the doctor
I don't care what the feds say, fucking cockblockers
I live in reefer land, I grow a little reefer and you wanna get high?
I'll make you fly like Peter Pan
On cloud nine no one but the reefer can
I'm the reefer king of Cali known as Reefer Man
I recommend you don't tell a friend, they will buy it out
Then they never leave you nothing in the end
I could never grow enough, so people want my secret
But you don't get to peep it, you're in danger if you seek it
You might also like
Far and wide, high and low
Close your eyes, we up in smoke
Swim the sky, here we go
Round and round (round and round), the reefer blows (The reefer blows)

I have so many different strains to choose
I break 'em down in samples
Make sure you get the one you want and know what you can handle
Got the indo (yeah) and sativa (uh-huh), gonna make you a believer (That's right)
Yeah my brand is off the meter and the flavor so much sweeter (Oh, shit, me?)
You wanna blow some trees, you wanna smoke some real shit?
Put it in the paper, roll it with the Phuncky Feel Tip
Then put it in the air, smoke rises 'till the heavens ash
Falls to the ground, cash, doubles up in seconds (Ahh)
OG Kush from Cali from the Valley to the Playground
People on the street wanna call this one the lay-down (Lay down)
The hydro's so heavy like a '57 Chevy
Heavy, feeling ready for a steady dose as the reefer blows

Far and wide, high and low (Let's go)
Close your eyes, we up in smoke (We up in smoke)
Swim the sky (swim the sky), here we go
Round and round (round and round), the reefer blows
Far and wide (Cypress Hill), high and low
Close your eyes (close your eyes), we up in smoke (We up in smoke)
(He-he, it's another one of them old funky Cypress Hill thangs, put it in the air, homeboy)
Swim the sky, here we go
Round and round, the reefer blowsEmbed
