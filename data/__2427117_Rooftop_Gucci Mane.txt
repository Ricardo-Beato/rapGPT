5 ContributorsRooftop Lyrics

Tell me what you wanna do, what you wanna do?
I got killers the rooftop, all on the rooftop
Who you wanna shoot, but I don't wanna go back
You don't wanna do that, why you gotta prove that?
What you gotta prove, these niggas better move back
Shoes come in two stacks, Imma take a few back
What you wanna do, I'm choking off that fruit pack
Riding with the roof back, crazy color coupe
Homie what you wanna do?

Sippin' absolut (eghh)
Im walkin' from the car lot straight to the booth
So my swagger through the roof
I got money too
This what money do
My shoes came from the zoo
My cane came from peru
My car painted piru
Piss body say suwu
My earrings candy blue
We walk in different hues
See me on the news
My lawyer is a jew
In case you wanna sue
I got a lot of scoons
The beef ain't nothing new
I pull up in a coupe
Same color as a soup
And I ain't got on a suit
I just look fountain blue
My room right by the pool
I said look at the view
You might also like
Tell me what you wanna do, what you wanna do?
I got killers the rooftop, all on the rooftop
Who you wanna shoot, but I don't wanna go back
You don't wanna do that, why you gotta prove that?
What you gotta prove, these niggas better move back
Shoes come in two stacks, I'mma take a few back
What you wanna do, I'm choking off that fruit pack
Riding with the roof back, crazy color coupe
Homie what you wanna do?

Them bitch detergent riding dirty is you nervous
Conduct yourself with class when i'm in session dont disturb me
Describable, just like a circus, you're unreliable
I want the cash, the car , the girls, all things i'm entitled to
My white brand make them rich white girls back bend
Ass backwards like paying taxes on a back end
Gucci mane airtran how i fly the hoes in
Wouldn't be my cut friend till i put my golds in
Now Ive crossed the globe boy mean stick my nose in
Ten thousand diamonded out loafers stick my toes in
Fresh squad post man the books are closed
They might not re-open cause you niggas is hoes

Tell me what you wanna do, what you wanna do?
I got killers the rooftop, all on the rooftop
Who you wanna shoot, but I don't wanna go back
You don't wanna do that, why you gotta prove that?
What you gotta prove, these niggas better move back
Shoes come in two stacks, Imma take a few back
What you wanna do, I'm choking off that fruit pack
Riding with the roof back, crazy color coupe
Homie what you wanna do?Embed
