Guwop
Gucci
(Verse)
Gucci Mane a bitch, I'm gonna hit him in his shit
Gucci mob, he don't throw fists, all he do is diss
Getting shots off my yapper, how bad you want a hit?
Ayo with Mike in this and homie big boy 200 bitch
Baang Bang, Glo Gang, that 300 shit
I feel like Woo and French, they mad, they on that broke shit
I'm on that level, if you broke then I can't smoke it
I'm worth a hunnid bricks, still rob yo ass for 4 bricks
Can't find a fork, I'm cookin dope with the remote, BITCH
I took yo best and went and smoked it with yo artist
I fucked yo mama secretary at the office
And I'm so hood I'm pourin codeine in my coffee
(Hook)
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Man these niggas broke as hell man and I can see they ribs
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Man these bitches broke as hell man and I can see they ribs

Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Nigga say he fucked my bitch and he couldn't wait to squeal
What's a bitch to a nigga like me with the Ms??
Would shit break if it's yo head? I'll hook a thrower back in
Let her swim, let her swim
Like a brim let her swim
Call me Mr. Gucci Mane, call him NeverHeardOfHim
Man that nigga suck a nigga dick just to get a deal
Gucci Mane keep it real, I told er scrap, that's what it is
(Hook)
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Man these niggas broke as hell man and I can see they ribs
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Keep it real, Keep it real, Keep it real
Man these bitches broke as hell man and I can see they ribs
(Outro)
Man, what's happenin?
It's Big Gucci
La Flare himself
Selfmade millionaire
And I'm still trickin out wit yo bitch with the show money nigga
33 years young
Young old ass nigga
I got my eye on 100 M's
Don't worry about the beef
Not the beef in the can
I'm the CEO
All beef will be expected
Yea, you lookin at the man nigga
