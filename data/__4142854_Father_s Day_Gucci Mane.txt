29 ContributorsFather’s Day Lyrics
Wop, brr
You are the mirror of my—
Wop

Rollin' like a mothafucka, high as a kite
Like a hooker in church, I'm sweatin' like a bitch
Lit like a wick, sharp as a tick
Don't slip on the drip, 10K on the kicks
Metro on my beat, Guwop from the East
So play if you want, get shot in the teeth
I cop new time pieces, a million at least
I cop 'em in threes, a million a piece (Well damn)
I'm jumpin' the list for the car that you wish
Deep-dish rims that I bought from the fish
My arm in the pot, I'm cookin' the dish
I'm workin' my move, I'm twistin' my wrist

I fathered the style, gave you all the wave
But I didn't get nothin' for Father's Day
But I was the one servin' all the J's
I was the one cookin' all the yay
I fathered the style, gave you all the wave
But I didn't get nothin' for Father's Day
But I was the one servin' all the J's
I was the one cookin' all the yay (It's Gucci)
You might also like
Pick your face up, stop droolin'
Haters on my page, not trollin' (Wizzy)
Took the girls out, no golden (Huh)
Call me red carpet, shorty, I'm posin' (Wop)
Nigga knowin' damn well he can't hold me (No)
Plug limit old me, I paid him (Yeah)
Told him, "Thank you" 'cause it was a favor
Thank God 'cause he showed me favor (Lord)
Trap God, now I got all flavors
Won my Vanguard lifetime achievement
I ain't showed the whole world I'm resilient
Hell, all these rappers my children (Yeah)
Brick factory, I breed villains (True)
Told my young niggas it's no ceilin' (Huh)
God willin', run you up a billion (God)
Fuck feelings, run to the millions (Wop)

I fathered the style, gave you all the wave (Day)
But I didn't get nothin' for Father's Day (Posse)
But I was the one servin' all the J's
I was the one cookin' all the yay
I fathered the style, gave you all the wave (Day)
But I didn't get nothin' for Father's Day (Posse)
But I was the one servin' all the J's
I was the one cookin' all the yay (It's Gucci)7Embed
