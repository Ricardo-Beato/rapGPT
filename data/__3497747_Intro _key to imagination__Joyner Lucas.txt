4 ContributorsIntro (key to imagination) LyricsOpen your mind
Breathe
Now, I want you to close your eyes and imagine
You're entering a new dimension
A dimension of sound
A dimension of sight
A dimension of mind
You're moving into a land of  shadow 
Come with me
You lock this door with the feeling of imagination
Low-Frequency Oscillators
You motherfuckers

How the fuck they gon' talk about me?
Bitch, you talkin' 'bout more
You talkin' bout peace, should I talk about war?
You talkin' bout a nigga 'bout a body gotta ride or drive
Or when I catch you, beat you, I just hop up in your Maserati
Get pissed when I spit liquor
A fully grown pimp, bitch with a 
I'ma fully, I'ma automatic stick shift 
With a big dick and a mentioned killer
Certified nigga, I ain't talkin' bout bars
And def come in threes, I ain't talkin' 'bout four
The best come with me, they ain't resting in peace
I'm STD's on your MPC
They envy me, you're the big pet peeve
A lot of rap niggas don't interest me
 press press keys on a nigga had 'em be the itos on Belvita cheese, eggs on my rita
With a chicken noodle soup and a Solo on the side
Pull up on a ride, in the morning when I rhyme
With a mouth cat busy ever dreams of a Drizzy with Cassie and Nicki tryna go at a Minaj
Never scared of death, I don't know why I'm alive
Let her take risks I don't know when I'ma die
Tethered to the booth like I know went over top
And I never been a snitch, I don't know a lot of cops
Cop cars on the block for had the block all blocked off and I blocked more
Mama had a baby and the baby head popped off when the block niggas chopped off on the block, pause
Open up your eyeballs, get a good look
You looking at a nigga that was in a good book
In the rap game, everybody sound the same, with ya lame ass songs with a really good hook
I cook crack on the stove and sell it to a nigga that was jealous of the shit that I was yellin' on a beat that he's probably feelin' so he caught feelings had to drill him in the street
Kill him with the rhythm, put the pistol in his  hit him, get him, and then kill him in the middle of the east
Heavy metal beats, never settle, but I never been or ever willYou might also likeEmbed
