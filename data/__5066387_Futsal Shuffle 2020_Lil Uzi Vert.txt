Yo, sing this shit, are y'all fuckin' dumb?
Eternal Atake
Gotta shoot two at her (Yeah)
Gotta shoot two at her (Woah)
Blue cheddar (Yeah)

That girl, she got with my clone (One, two, three)
I told that lil' girl that she gotta just do better (Woah)

Are you serious?
I swear my money get serious
Okay, all my checks, I just be clearin' it
She suck my dick 'til she get delirious (Wow)
Okay, jump on the jet, so I'm Clearin' it (Woo)
Okay, 'Port, but I'm not talking New' (Let's go)
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette
If that boy try to make a false move, uh (Damn)

I'm on some whole other shit
I got a whole 'nother rich, I'm on a new level
I was fucking on your bitch
She was ridin' on my dick, she ain't need two pedals
I swear these niggas, they bitches
I swear they all gonna snitch when my niggas go shoot at 'em
Niggas, they mad about this
Niggas, they mad about that, but it's only if you let 'em
She save my name in her phone
Only thing she save me under is probably that "U" letter (Hello?)
No, I don't got provolone
Only thing in my pocket is probably, um, some blue cheddar
She tried to leave me alone
Then she got right with my clone, man, I hope that she do better
I know it's blue cheese on me
But when I got fifties on me, I call that shit loose cheddar (Hah)
Jeremy Scotts all on my feet
I had a cougar with me, so I call that girl Coretta (Coretta)
I am the richest nigga in my city
I can make it rain like no matter what's the weather (Facts)
I know that girl, she got swag
But when it come to puttin' it together, she could do better
I sent that girl a DM
She ain't answer me, so you know that I gotta shoot two at her (Yeah)
You might also like
Gotta shoot two at her (Yeah)
Ayy, gotta shoot two at her (And you are Lil Uzi? Vert, let's go)
Ayy, stay with the blue cheddar (Woah)
That girl, she got with my clone (One, two, three, let's go)
I told that lil' girl that she gotta just do better

Are you serious?
I swear my money get serious
Okay, all my checks, I just be clearin' it
She suck my dick 'til she get delirious
Okay, jump on the jet so I'm Clearin' it
Okay, 'Port, but I'm not talking New' (Woo)
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette
If that boy try to make a false move (Lil Uzi)

They try to cut me down when they say I'm too low, woah, uh (Turn me up)
I said, "Turn me up," I cannot hear my flow, woah, woah
I ain't never been no fool
Do what I want, I'ma bend your rules (Woah)
I'ma take the dub, I'ma win
I ain't ever been no type that lose, yeah
Born like this, I ain't did no study
Everything I got, man, I got it in a hurry
If I love you, better say that you love me
And if I trust you, better say that you trust me
Talk 'bout the bag, the mula, the guap
I'm at the bank, only time that I'm runnin'
I said I'm on the road, no, I cannot stop
I'm runnin' through obstacles, I'm in a hurry
Woah, stop that
Told a fuck nigga just drop that (Yeah)
If you shoot first, we gon' pop back
Margiela on me, lil' nigga, that's not that
What you got on? Prada sweatsuit made of nylon
See my righteous girl, yeah, she say, "Right on"
When I hit that girl right with the light on
When I hit that girl, oh
Gotta shoot two at her
Ayy, gotta shoot two at her (Woah)
Ayy, stay with the blue cheddar (Woah)
That girl, she got with my clone (One, two, three, yeah, yeah)
I told that lil' girl that she gotta just do better

Are you serious?
I swear my money get serious
Okay, all my checks, I just be clearin' it
She suck my dick 'til she get delirious (Woah)
Okay, jump on the jet so I'm Clearin' it
Okay, 'Port, but I'm not talking New' (Mhm)
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette
If that boy try to make a false move (Woah)
