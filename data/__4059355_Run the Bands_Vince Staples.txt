Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey (I need my M's)
Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey (I need my M's)
I don't have to say it more than once
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
I always been famous where I'm from
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Started from the bottom of the slums
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Jesse Owens while I'm on this run
(Ayy, you better tell that bitch to stop mothafuckin' playin')
Run the bands, run the bands, hey

I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one, on Crip

I'm the man, I'm the man
My girl is the real Roxanne (Roxanne)
My work speak for itself
My trophies on my shelf, okay
My homies level four, okay
You folded in the war, okay
You told on your day one, okay
They store day never come, no way
I'm... on it
Southern Californian (On it)
Run it if you want it
Car so big it's haunted
Car so big it's Tongan (Tongan)
House so big need Kanye lipo
Nikes Off-White like half-time Michael
Him no play, him Bateman psycho

Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey (I need my M's)
Run the bands, run the bands

Run the bands, run the bands, hey (I need my M's)
I don't have to say it more than once
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
I always been famous where I'm from
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Started from the bottom of the slums
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Jesse Owens while I'm on this run
(Ayy, you better tell that bitch to stop mothafuckin' playin')
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Don't slip, I'm gonna find you (Spot you)
Slide through, might paralyze you (Got you)
Don't run, I'm gonna chase you (Chase you)
Point blank, that's how the Yanks do (Yeah)
Brand new shrink, had a breakthrough
Brand new mink for the great room (Yeah)
Don't bring knives to the gunfight
We bring knives to the dayroom
North Side, right by the Popeye's, popped out
Ran from the cops but the cops get shot now
We don't do no Axel Foleys
Find me if you askin' for me
We went to his Instagram
He said that he had the .40
Found him, then shit hit the fan
Now he actin' pastor holy (Yahweh)

Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey (I need my M's)
Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Run the bands, run the bands
Run the bands, run the bands, hey (I need my M's)
I don't have to say it more than once
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
I always been famous where I'm from
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Started from the bottom of the slums
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
Jesse Owens while I'm on this run
(Ayy, you better tell that bitch to stop mothafuckin' playin')
Run the bands, run the bands, hey
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)

I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one (Don't slip)
I'm not the one, on Crip
