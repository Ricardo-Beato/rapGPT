28 ContributorsFloat Lyrics
This fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring;
The prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing
I'm broke. I know a walking corpse who'd spit icicle dagger to slit throat
Quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope (H-O-P-E)
I paint a portrait from my cell called life inside the tortoise shell
Tortured
Orbiting hell's orchard intrigued but not compelled
I smell a hint of charred child flesh sweeping through my quarters
Order one canteen of liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter
Now is you is the villain of my kabuki hologram
Cuz I hobble with hollow hands
Please pan the nozzle
We see intent to re-invent dream application with homage to ancients
But honor modern replacements circling now basics
I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tipping the Petri dish (fresh)
Beached fish on the shores where the feast of wits eat the corpse
Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible
That's a harp of a different color but the song remains identical
I am not a crook
I cook the wick at both ends
Just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope dance
Life
Sight beyond
Fire ant with a hunger pain gut be gone
Belong to something civil, saint, cuz this Rembrandt paints on
And it's a cold canvas lodged in the gut of Atlantis
Some present impressive lung, some truly learn what a death chant is
I alone personify mankind's collective sulk
As a result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp in bulk
Face it
Die
Place it on the shelf next to the portrait mommy gave you of the day it rained
But y'all posed by the slave ship anyway
Make it rain 'til the levy breaks
My fetus breeds as a combine of father time and his sweetest concubine, wine
And it saddens me like televised casualties
I'll be hung in the village square in exactly 5 minutes;
You don't want to miss it
As a token of my discontent regarding the equation
I'm officially closed for consultation
