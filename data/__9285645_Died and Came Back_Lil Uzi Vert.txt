Ah
This shit forever, I'm Lil Uzi Vert
I can't stop goin'
Woah

Rigatoni is not spaghetti
Racks is not the same as fetti
Pills and the Casa' got me deady
Fuckin' her off the Perc', ain't ready
I'ma do everything you let me
No first class, I'm always on jetties
Pay everything cash, no, I don't do credit
You worryin' 'bout savings, I'm worryin' 'bout checkings
Rigatoni is not spaghetti
Racks is not the same as fetti
Pills and the Casa' got me deady
Fuckin' her off the Perc', ain't ready
I'ma do everything you let me
No first class, I'm always on jetties
Pay everything cash, no, I don't do credit
You worryin' 'bout savings, I'm worryin' 'bout checkings

Ah, I died and came back
Your voice don't sound the same, get your range back
When the fuck did they bring these lames back? (Lame)
You said you fucked my bitch (I fucked your bitch too, woah)
You might also like
But you ain't even go get your chains back (Huh?)
They ran up in your crib and took your platinum plaques (Yeah)
I thought that you was ****, what's up with that? (What's up with it?)
I like the Crips 'cause the money in my pocket blue
I be with the Bloods and they all say, "Soowoo"
What you paid for your rent, I paid that for my shoes
If you try to diss me, boy, that's a lose-lose
Moncler on me since Luv Is Rage 2
When I made the first Luv Is Rage, it was Canadian Goose
I'm on probation, the government hatin', can't even see my Canadian boo
I'm never fakin', I dress like I'm Asian, don't care what they say, I'm makin' it through
Ice on my neck, bought my mama a new home
My wrist presidential, you ain't never seen me with a two-tone
My crib residential, but I also got two homes
Don't cheat on my bitch, but I still got me two phones
I still see demons in the dark
I still see demons in the dark
Demon engine inside of a Trackhawk
They pretendin', don't speak if it ain't rack talk (Woah)

Rigatoni is not spaghetti
Racks is not the same as fetti
Pills and the Casa' got me deady
Fuckin' her off the Perc', ain't ready
I'ma do everything you let me
No first class, I'm always on jetties
Pay everything cash, no, I don't do credit
You worryin' 'bout savings, I'm worryin' 'bout checkings
Rigatoni is not spaghetti
Racks is not the same as fetti
Pills and the Casa' got me deady
Fuckin' her off the Perc', ain't ready
I'ma do everything you let me
No first class, I'm always on jetties
Pay everything cash, no, I don't do credit
You worryin' 'bout savings, I'm worryin' 'bout checkings
I died and came back
Your voice don't sound the same, get your range back
When the fuck did they bring these lames back?
You said you fucked my bitch (I fucked your bitch too)1Embed
