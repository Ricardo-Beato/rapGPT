7 ContributorsSpeakin So Freely Lyrics
Yeah
C'mon
Yeah, yo

It's all about the murders and the killings, bitches they catch feelings
Niggas mixin' business with pleasure won't measure, will it?
Summer's my home skillet, just came home from penet'
I tried to look out for him, now I can't fuck with him
He had distorted vision, thought I ain't deserve this
How he the streets, and I ain't put no work in
Nigga I ain't lock you and take all your years
You the nigga that was careless, get the fuck out of here
Yeah, blood, sweat, and tears, every buck I made
I ain't complain when you was hustlin' and I leave paid
Yeah I'm up, boilin' blood to see me bust
Even worse they ask for help like I'm the Red Cross
I don't knock niggas when they down, I try to lift 'em
But they tried to get all in my shoes, like they could fit 'em
Can't happen overnight, when it comes to winnin' (Naw)
It's a ten year road, but niggas ain't tryin' to hear it

All this dough we make, we makin' it look too easy
Niggas can't get any money cause they palms so greasy
Don't know how they survivin' though, they wish they could be me
Niggas better watch they mouth, or stop speakin' so freely
All this dough we make, we makin' it look too easy
Niggas can't get any money cause they palms so greasy
Don't know how they survivin' though, they wish they could be me
Niggas better watch they mouth, or stop speakin' so freely
You might also like
You listenin' to the world's most Infamous
This is different than what you used to
Them other niggas, they ain't killin' it
We come through militant, niggas be grillin' it
Screwin' up they face, but my adrenaline
Is at a maximum, I can't be touched
Just as soon niggas move, niggas get tore up
We so confident in ourselves, it's not fair
While you still tryin' to overcome your childhood fears
We settin' up shop, takin' over the blocks
In e'ry hood, e'ry boy and e'ry girl gon' cop
Now we chillin' in, new airplanes and Rolls Royces
My watch is my president, and guess who's the first lady?
Yeah, my big fat princess cut
She a little overweight, but I love her so much
So charged up right now, you niggas better stop
If I squeeze we gon' breeze to the top of the charts

All this dough we make, we makin' it look too easy
Niggas can't get any money cause they palms so greasy
Don't know how they survivin' though, they wish they could be me
Niggas better watch they mouth, or stop speakin' so freely
All this dough we make, we makin' it look too easy
Niggas can't get any money cause they palms so greasy
Don't know how they survivin' though, they wish they could be me
Niggas better watch they mouth, or stop speakin' so freely2Embed
