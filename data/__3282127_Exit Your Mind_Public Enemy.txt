1 ContributorExit Your Mind Lyrics
Greatness awaits us in hell for centuries
Still able to pull good out of nothing
And every time we go there
The world witness our creative genius
The arts and science
The gods and culture
Unlimited progress for the original people
We brought civilization to the world
The fathers and mothers of it all
America would not have no flavor if it wasn’t for the black population
Come on black people, it’s our time
The great musicians we brought
Science and mathematics to the world
Stop copying
We’re the original people
It was the mathematical genius of three black women
Who put the man on the moon
From the traffic light, down to heart surgery
Experience life from the creator of life
There is no way around it
We are the people of God
Exit your mind, enter the thinking of GodYou might also likeEmbed
