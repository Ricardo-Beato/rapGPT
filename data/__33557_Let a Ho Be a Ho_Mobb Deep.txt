No matter what you think, a ho gonna be a ho, and a nigga definitely gonna be a nigga, 'cause I'm a nigga!

M, O, double B
I don't know why they wanna trouble me
Is it because they bitch be suckin me
Or just mad cause they shitted wit the family?
We be bubbling, up in the Navigator huddlin
While you frontin in that rental, cuddling
With that weak ass bitch, damn right she snitch
And if I had in my misdt, she'd be biting shit

Cause a ho gonna be a ho
A nigga gonna be a nigga
No matter what the fuck you think
Got cash in my escrow, never gonna let it go
(Hell motherfucking no!)
Cause a ho gonna be a ho
A nigga gonna be a nigga
No matter what the fuck you think
Got cash in my escrow, never gonna let it go
(Hell motherfucking no!)

Chillin at the crib layin in my boxers
While shorty got bent spittin tha latest gossip
Didn't want to hear it in the middle cut her off
Lit a stog, smacked her ass, grabbed her by the draws
Bugged in the head but her looks turned me on
She tried to turn me on with edible thongs
Plus I like the way she sounded when repeatin my songs
From Queens to get to her crib didn't take long
Said she had a man but was locked up in Attica
Freak off with the VCR to my camera
After that shit that happened to 2Pac
Yell rape? Show 'em the tape jus playin my part
Opposed to being on tape but the G that I ran
Had her tongue in my ear and my dick in her hand
When I thought I knew I shoulda brought my fam
Bring her to the lowest level and shared it with my mans

Cause a ho gonna be a ho
A nigga gonna be a nigga
No matter what the fuck you think
Got cash in my escrow, never gonna let it go
(Hell motherfucking no!)
Cause a ho gonna be a ho
A nigga gonna be a nigga
No matter what the fuck you think
Got cash in my escrow, never gonna let it go
(Hell motherfucking no!)1Embed
