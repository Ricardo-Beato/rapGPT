Please.. wake me when I am free
I cannot bear captivity
Where my country, I am told, "Hold no significance"
I waited and died in ignorance
But my inner eye can see, a race
Who reigned as king in another place
The green trees were rich and full
And every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as equals
War was gone because all was at peace
But now like a nightmare, I woke to see
That I live like a prisoner of poverty..
Please.. wake me when I am free
I cannot bear captivity
For, I would rather be stricken blind
Than to live without expression of mind
