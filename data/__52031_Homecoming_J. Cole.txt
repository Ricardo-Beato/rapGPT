25 ContributorsHomecoming Lyrics
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh-huh
Yeah

I'm I-95 cruising, the sun in my eyes
Headed south, dog, my mom ain't seen her son in awhile
Yeah, I sure live
Can't wait to see my niggas and fuck with my old chicks
Can't wait to cruise the city, be catching them cold grins
Same niggas, same place, doing the same old shit
Yeah, so nigga watch it
A nigga been in NY tryna get some bigger pockets
You still up in the 'Ville, tryna make it in the trap
I'm finna put us on the map, I told you I was coming back, cuz
Yeah, so make way
The prince of the city, ain't a street that I can't stay
You niggas is hatin', just be happy I ain't change
Blunts rolled to the murk, we all want the same thing
And that's money to feed us, yup
We pray to God, but, we ain't tryna meet him yet, haha
Yeah, If I never
Nigga, man
Actually that is a bad idea, my nigga
'Cause, uh, nah nah nah
Now I'ma always come home, it's where a nigga was grown
Where a nigga was shown how to scrap (yup)
Shown how to mack (yup)
Where my niggas sold a whole lot of crack (yup)
Juggling them hoes, there was a whole lot of that (yup)
Momma work to the bone, puttin' clothes on my back
I'm comin' home to give everything I owe to her back (yes)
Yeah, I swear they say, man
Yeah, yeah
You might also like
Shout to the whole 'Ville!
Of course, so real!
Uh, If I never- if I never went home again
"Hello? Chill out nigga, what's up, boy?
Yeah, I just touched down man
I'm over off Ramsey and shit
Aight, well look
I'm about to go check out my mom's man
What's jumping for tonight?
Oh the Live? I'm in there, nigga1Embed
