2 ContributorsElevators (Me & You) (ONP 86 Edit) Lyrics
One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago, on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my - rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs, this - here must stop
Like "Freeze!", wе making the crowd move
But we not making no G's and that's a no-no

Chеck it, a one-two, a one-two dope - in the Cadillac
They call us, went from "Player's Ball" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
- say, "Mother- that playin'", they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"OutKast, yeah, them -, they making big noise"
Over a million sold to this day, - take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
I'm out this
You might also like
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bull -
Pull - off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them - got crunk
Chunky -, passes getting thrown like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so -
I'm smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, "Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick, and momma, I'm sucking - now"
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony! Toni! Tone!
Like this, East Point and we gone
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way
That I just came from
Some - was saying something, talking 'bout - something
"Hey, man, you remember me from school?"
"No, not really"
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, "What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup -
From all them songs that y'all done made"
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he has
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim - cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doorsEmbed
