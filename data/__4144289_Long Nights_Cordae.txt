7 ContributorsLong Nights Lyrics
Days grow shorter, the fight get stronger
And I'm whipping up the juice
The fight gets stronger
We back, yeah
We back

You see the nights get longer, as the days grow shorter
My fight get stronger, as I witness slow torture
Been through it all, seen it all in no order
My rhymes Arizona, state lines ain’t got no border
See, see, I've been down and alone
Swimming in the shark water, might drown on my own
Nigga always follow waves, I'm surrounded by clones
Pound for pound, check the sound, words my crown on the throne
Then I be happy, I be satisfied, living in gratified
Just another rapper died
That’s why I move the way that I move, gotta strategize
I see your dreams crumble in person, you had the saddest eyes
Mom, would you be mad if I
Took my own life, don't worry, never had thoughts of it
But lord knows I done lost, suffered, no cars covered
I feel the people that's contemplating, they lost purpose
It's all rubbish, we flying with Hugo Boss luggage
So DMV nigga, I read scriptures
Drowning in all this cheap liquor
And one bad day will turn your whole week bitter
This past year, I took more L's than Meek nigga
But I'm hopping out the van in Africa, with chains and safaris
My man told me, "Make a hit that they can play in the parties"
But I'll stay true to my roots like Damian Marley
I took a couple money picks, tell Jay Z I'm sorry
Laying out my blueprints, hoping to make the new rent
Last month we made it but barely, I’m just a student
Shit, that’s just excuses
But I don't do the talking, I leave it all in the music
Damn, what’s my influence
That's the question to ask
If this breath be my last
Will I still be remembered, what I left in the past
And will my impact show niggas that I was destined to rap
The only option besides balling and catching a pass
