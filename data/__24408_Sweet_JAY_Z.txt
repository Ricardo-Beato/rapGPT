Sweeeet... and still there's pain (pain, pain, pain...)
If I would have grew up to be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same (same, same...)
But since I grew up through the game
And my influence is the same
And my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed (ashamed...)
And though I wish I could separate the two things
I cannot so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearing the coast up
Tight coupes like I'm wearing the roadster
For any coupe, bear-hugging the holster

Hov', alright al-right
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
Once again it's the life
You might also like
So I make no apologies, crooked policies
So a G a nigga gotta be
We playing for property, no Monopoly
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me
They say the child shall lead
So I take it far as I can and then we shall see
Shall we dance with the devil for a beat
I pray to God I ain't got two left feet
Do the hustle put keys in the street
Then I'm ballroom dancing
Ke-ke'in in the suite
Sweet, BB's on the feet
TV's in the seat, ene-mies on the creep
It's so corrupt
Soak it up, it's a lesson, every fuck up
One day you're up
Next day you're down
Long as you stay the same it'll come back around

Hov', alright al-right
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
Once again it's the life
I'm even better
I'm eating better
Best thing about it is
My niggas eating together
With each endeavor, we reaching levels
Niggas ain't seen in like forever
I'm Hyman Roth, so made all my partners rich
I can't vouch for you
If you ain't a part of this
So pardon me as I pave my wrist, uh
As I parlay my chips
Hov', alright al-right
American gangster, gangster
Businesses like I'm white
But I'm not, I'm just bright
So fly with no fear of the flight, uhh
So if y'all hear my plight
And if you think you can make it this far without a fight
Couple mistakes here and there
Not always right, but I'm always real
That's how I sleep at night

Hov', alright al-right
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
Once again it's the life
Sweeeet...3Embed
