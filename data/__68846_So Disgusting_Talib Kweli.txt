2 ContributorsSo Disgusting LyricsTell her Kweli!
Relax, Smith!
Shout out to my man, Mr. E
We’re international
We’re international!
Ready?

This life is so seducting
You say you know you’re fronting
We, we, we, we get into what?
It’s so disrupting!
You stay promoting or something
That’s how I know you’re bluffing
These bars make you wanna go whoa, it’s so disgusting!
Baby is born everytime someone die
Angels cry every time someone lie
They fall to the Earth and they lose their wings
And they worship the devils and get they kings

This life is so seducting
You say you know you’re fronting
We, we, we, we get into what?
It’s so disrupting!
You might also like
What they say when they speak on your memory
Confortable .. and the weed is the remedy
We get drunk and rich for the Hennessey
Speak to the Lord like speak to the Tennessee
Either walk through the valley of the shadow
Look up in the hills, you can see your enemy
Come a forth mile, come up with a smile
..in the streets, better wow!
They’re ain’t no respecting lady
There ain’t no hesitating
So where our neck is breaking and the respect is taken?
I pause cause nothing is given
We get lost in the system
Ah, ah, ... but what’s the cause you’re living?
Boys like me... to the prison
Laws are written be a pause for...
So you know the price, do you know the cause
I’m so.. the flow is nice, victorious
We gonna take ‘em laws, so glorious from Brooklyn like
Notorious, we’re taking...
When the warrior ...

This life is so seducting
You say you know you’re fronting
We, we, we, we get into what?
It’s so disrupting!
You stay promote or something
That’s how I know you’re bluffing
These bars make you wanna go whoa, it’s so disgusting!
Baby afford every time to adopt
Angels cry every time ...
They fall to the Earth and they lose their wings
And they worship the devils if they get them kings
This life is so seducting
You say you know you’re fronting
We, we, we, we get into what?
It’s so disrupting!
You stay promote or something
That’s how I know you’re bluffing
These bars make you wanna go whoa, it’s so disgusting!

It’s awful every ghetto or town
No matter black, white, red, yellow or brown
Ain’t no sign of settling down
When the guns ...every.. is a sound
..block of law, .. don’t stop the flow!
Martin Luther King Junior had a dream
That was ... streets and hospitals
Where the bodies go before they’re berried
Or already half way to the cemetery
This ..who holds the story
..the ice and the cream like...
And the murder story but the ghetto is clean
...working on a seven day lean
..just grabbing a heavenly scene ...
The point I’m making is know your colors
Before your blood run red in the ghetto
I got a flow to make you so shut up
Can you borrow that? No my brother!
Get your own, get in the zone
And tell everybody that it’s your song...
..turn your felonies into melodies
Recipes to my nigga..
...the best to the... memories
This life is so seducting

Baby afford every time to adopt
Angels cry every time ...
They fall to the Earth and they lose their wings
And they worship the devils if they get them kings

This life is so seducting

We, we, we, we get into what?
It’s so disrupting!
