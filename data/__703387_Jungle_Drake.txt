(Put a bib on me)
(Put a bib on me)
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

These days I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same
Our relationship changed that, or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

She said, "You're my everything"
"I love you through everything"
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything
This a "forever" thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a "whatever" thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle
She from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me
This shit is everything
Don't know where we stand
I used to hit you 'bout everything, oh
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

Rock me real slowly (Yeah)
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
(Give me back) The things you do
Yeah, these days, these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
