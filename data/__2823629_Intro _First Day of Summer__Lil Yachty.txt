41 ContributorsIntro (First Day of Summer) Lyrics
It was hot as ever today
Long time no see folks
Boat, Yachty, and Perry, and rest of the gang been inside all sunshine with the perfect compilation of songs for you guys this summer
And I'm just so proud of them
The whole Sailing Team actually
You know I'm glad you guys liked the Lil Boat mixtape
They worked really hard on that
And I just wanted to be the first to let you guys hear Summer Songs 2
Tell me what you think!
Yah!

That's right, that's right, that's right
Niggas Kawasaki bike riding on a nigga wave
Oh my days, I want to engage, but I won't give 'em clout
No I can't, but I'ma make this chant so I won't have to rant
Woah, damn
That's right, that's right, that's right
Niggas Kawasaki bike riding on a nigga wave
On my days, I want to engage, but I won't give 'em clout
No I can't, but I'ma make this chant so I won't have to rant

We do what we want to do
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's been a long time coming this far
I remember back in school when they used to make fun of my scars
Now I'm 18, I can buy any car
Look what I did, mama so proud of her kid
Gee wiz I'm the shit
Yes I'ma brag, brag cause I got me a bag
And my bitch, she a brat
I'ma do what I got to do
To stay the king of the youth
Tie all my shoes so I'll never ever fall
Middle finger 'em all, walk the carpet holdin' my balls

That's right, that's right, that's right
Niggas Kawasaki bike riding on a nigga wave
Oh my days, I want to engage, but I won't give 'em clout
No I can't, but I'ma make this chant so I won't have to rant
Woah, damn
That's right, that's right, that's right
Niggas Kawasaki bike riding on a nigga wave
Oh my days, I want to engage, but I won't give 'em clout
No I can't, but I'ma make this chant so I won't have to rant

We do what we want to do
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's gon' be a hot summer, ridin' 'round the city in a Hummer
Dick deep, plunging bitches' throats like a fucking plumber
I don't care, and I never did, and I never will
It's young Will, shout out to my manager, that's Uncle Phil
I love my family
All summer '16 I'm fucking bitches on your family tree
You niggas getting tired of me
But oh well
I'm playing through your house like a doorbell and you hate it..
You hate that I made it

That's right, that's right, that's right
Niggas Kawasaki bike riding on a nigga wave
On my days, I want to engage, but I won't give 'em clout
No I can't, but I'ma make this chant so I won't have to rant
Woah, damn
That's right, that's right, that's right
Niggas Kawasaki bike riding on a nigga wave
Oh my days, I want to engage, but I won't give 'em clout
No I can't, but I'ma make this chant so I won't have to rant

We do what we want to do, yeah
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Taking over all summer '16
On fire  all summer '16
Running shit all summer '16
King of the youth forever
It's Yachty forever
I'ma be on fire forever
We gon' stick together forever
We gon' stick together cause
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
We are the youth!
All summer '16
