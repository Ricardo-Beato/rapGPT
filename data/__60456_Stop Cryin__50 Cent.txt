23 ContributorsStop Cryin’ Lyrics
Yeah
I am N.Y. no lie
Yeah
I am N.Y. no lie

They say they do it, like I do it with no mask on
Nigga, get the fuck outta line, you getting blast on
Jesus let the weak roam the Earth without a purpose
Well, I’ll stomp ya fucking head til it’s under the surface
Now I need you to get it through ya bloodclot head
Before I put a bullet through ya bloodclot dreads
These niggas ain't made of the same shit I’m made of
I dump a clip for my man if he need a favour
I let a nigga slide he came back and almost shot me
Then he was thinking I was scared, nah nigga not me
They don’t understand I was raised by the vultures
Kids laughing like hyenas in a crib full of roaches
Call grandmami "mommy" cause mommy already dead
Daddy been missing since I was a little kid
Now who dared go there playing games with the orphan
They know my pedigree, test me I’mma off ‘em

Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Don’t cry, dry your eye

That first body drop, we just getting started, death come in threes
AR15, M16, semi-automatic, murder machine
Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade in your flesh it’s an emergency
Your love leak, heart open call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the altar
See, I have an advantage I don’t care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontin’ when them casings start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds, now a nigga half crazy
What is that a tear I see forming in ya eye
Why are you so frightened? We’re all gonna die
You can say a prayer when I’m coming like the reaper
Staring through that sight on the top of my heater
Now...

Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Don’t cry, dry your eye2Embed
