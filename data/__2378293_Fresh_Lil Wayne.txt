No Ceilings 2
No Ceilings Dos
No Ceilings Bisexual, that means two
Freaky! Here we go
(Tunechi)

Tunechi in the building
His house ain't got no ceiling
These hoes, they catchin' feelings
We 'bout to make a billion
Stop that bitch
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune
Tune, Tune, Tune
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga

Tunechi
No Ceilings 2, No Ceilings 2
Next to Lil Tunechi you are so minuscule
So pitiful
Dope in the spoon
'Bout to go grizzly bear, no Winnie Pooh
Tunechi
Gun under table
Hand on the Bible
My homies homicidal
You dead on arrival
I'm tatted up, I'm tribal
And I'm duckin' trial
I used to throw my money away, now I recycle
Shout out to the Vice Lords, and to Disciples
That's that gang talk, you need subtitles
We sendin' Scud missiles
Your bitch in love with us
We simply mud sippers
More cane than a cripple
Look I am nobody, 'cause nobody's perfect
Abracadabra, I make a ho out a virgin
I treat her like a servant
Thanks for your service
I'm cold like sherbet
Got it sewed up like a surgeon
It's me and Mannie Fresh back together, bitch we mergin'
The jokes on them and we smirkin'
Man fuck them niggas, they hurtin'
She deep throat like a serpent
I stole out too many purses
Got too many bitches flirtin'
It's No Ceilings 2, curtains
You might also like
Tunechi in the building
(I'm in the building)
His house ain't got no ceiling
(Ain't got no ceiling)
These hoes, they catchin' feelings
(They catchin' feelings)
We 'bout to make a billion
Stop that bitch
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune
Tune, Tune, Tune
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga
Step up to the mic, nigga
Get that bitch right, nigga

Mula, baby!7Embed
