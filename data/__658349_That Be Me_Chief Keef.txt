21 ContributorsThat Be Me Lyrics
We smoked some dope, I fucked your hoe
You wifed that bitch, either way she gon' go
You like that bitch in the way she like me
She only like me 'cause I'm fuckin' icy
Ten chains on, I feel like Mr. T
Six rings on, I feel like 23
My gang on my back can't you see
Fifty for a show, baby, that be me
That be me, ayy

That be me, that can't see
'Cause I'm off this tooka pack, all this Tooka thrax
Like Tadoe, I'm just too damn smacked
Bussin' everywhere
I'm pointing my nine up everywhere
I got my guys up in here, ayy ayy
And they blammin' everywhere, ayy ayy
Rest in peace Ben Franklin
I swear I need Ben Franklin, ayy
I need to keep Ben Franklins
I needa be Ben Franklins
And that's a bill, ayy
For the B, you get killed with the steel to your tip-top
Got a jar of piss, got a pint of lean, got the plug with ziplocks
That's all I need
And we gon' be at it until we scream
Bang
You might also like
We smoked some dope, I fucked your hoe
You wifed that bitch, either way she gon' go
You like that bitch in the way she like me
She only like me 'cause I'm fuckin' icy
Ten chains on, I feel like Mr. T
Six rings on, I feel like 23
My gang on my back can't you see
Fifty for a show, baby, that be me
That be me, ayy5Embed
