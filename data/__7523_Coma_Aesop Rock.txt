36 ContributorsComa LyricsI now present to you
Music, music, music, music
Music to make you stagger

I've been a biplane dog fighter
Henson invention Trooper
Burst the result of Dragon Ball Z/Speed Racer gene splicing
Mach force, blind the extorted style from the common dirty
Destiny dream sighting, important as split the prints
God shit the planet screaming "What on Earth is that?"
I sit back five dimensions
Only to mostly over cook the specimen
Vending tragic fatality successful dodging volleys
All Hail Mary's and Hello Dolly's!
I flow ridiculous, indigenous to now
Who holds the fifth golden ticket?
Tour the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets
The house next door to when the stickball clears the fence
Y'all hesitate to fetch it!
I was walking through a pinball tilt built landscape
Pterodactyl circling turtle
I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow
Suck and rust the oxygen gulps
And spit the metal directly back up the barrel
We ice grill the silhouettes (right)
The common decency factors a lowball estimate of zero
My testament is striking B-Boy stances
Dancing past the foggy mirror
When wiped clean, the billy goat beard camouflage the spirit
I'm at six degrees of sexy sarcasm
Yeah, never swam up inside Summer Jam classic
Another bent backwards bastard
Scouring the carnival grounds for an outlet
Who the fuck is Aes Rock?
I'm not a name to keep at arms length
Adjacent to little Linus quilt makeshift
Sick security mechanism, check your mission
I am not a vision, check your mission
Just a simple sour patch delinquent
No it will not help you shove your Lincoln
You might also like
I alone settle
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone, I condone rebel zone planting
I alone stand in a social coma
All up to your dome, follow I alone
I alone settle
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone, I condone rebel zone planting
I alone stand in a social coma
All up to your dome, follow I alone

Now you see me, now you don't

Well he was maverick enough, but still scraped up
Taki 183 innovation for the kids
Brick foot iron lung honor
Escape through the night like a disgruntled teen Krylon bomber
Without a care, aside from posting the roster
Maladjusted blank-faced civilian dispersed feelings
Reeling in several separate defunct fame booster modules
This nervous twitch mark the most delectable ingredient
See Aesop starving troopers in cell blocks with strap-on feeding bins
(More like)
Like I'd auction off a fuck for that blind 'cause you ride in
I'd rather find the flaws and watch you hide 'em
Feel the haggard look penetrate brain castle
Blasting clear out the back of this batches sour wind collection
(Flash flooder!)
You're a fuckin' wind-up toy
A goddamn fourth string criminal trading card
The reason they decorate the fonts of closing credits
To boost onlooker amusement after fading hard
Catch more Z's than Rip Van Winkle's 12 Step Narcolepsy Seminar
Action!
We all compete the masked illusion
The common folk, I provoke 'em all
Challenge dirty balance
I elope with talent while they fidget
If the revolution ain't gon' be televised
Then fuck, I'll probably miss it
I alone settle
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone, I condone rebel zone planting
I alone stand in a social coma
All up to your dome, follow I alone
I alone settle
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone, I condone rebel zone planting
I alone stand in a social coma
All up to your dome, follow I alone

Omega 1, where you at?
Talkin' that...
Saying lines about me
This guy over there, and her
If anybody says a bad thing, shut the mic
Shut them down
I'm the boss
Shut them down
That's all I gotta say4Embed
