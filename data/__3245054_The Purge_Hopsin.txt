61 ContributorsThe Purge Lyrics
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me
Watch, watch
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me

Bitch, I'm kickin' through the door!
Let's go! 8-18, H O P
Bet on me, you gon' see
Ain't no thing, bitch, I'm on
Bitch, I'm kickin' through the door!
Yeah, 8-18, H O P
Bet on me, Prodigy
When I hit the track, bitch, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Yeah, homie G, the cold emcee
Rollin' deep through your vicinity (yo)
I just had an epiphany
I don't know what it did to me
But I'm hopin' the devil doesn't get into me (woah)
I'm still a beast whose enemies finna be
Off the chain with a brand new delivery (yeah)
Try to get in my way, the feelin' of rage
That sit in my brain and then I blast you to smithereens
Nigga please, I'll be damned if I'm thrown on the back burner
Fuckin' maniac purgin', a rap server
The cat burglar who be committin' mass murder
That's word to the G.O.D. 
Fuckin' the game from the P.O.V. 
Niggas beg and they plead on knees
There'll be no peace, the D.O.G., I feed on beats
If niggas wanna die they can lean on me
No Bill Withers, U.P. I done built it up
You wishin' you was on the field with us
I'm the ill nigga, no deal, look at me grill niggas
Fuckin' with me then I will erupt
Still we must remain calm
Napalm in my dang palm
I'm a dark villain like Blade, Spawn or Akon with a cape on
It ain't fun, you can't run
This is the horror flick your life is based on
I ain't gon' say that I'm runnin' shit
That's the shit every rapper say and think about
Nigga, just go in and look at the bank account
I just don't have enough patience to take it out
Niggas is hatin' now, I don't suffer from no paper drought
Always winning's my favorite route
My whole life, I just lay it out
Being around me is a blessing so, boy, you should take a bow
Look!

I'm 'bout to make this bitch jump
(Watch me, watch me, watch me)
Take a look, take a look
(Watch me, watch me, watch me)
I'm shuttin' shit down
I'm 'bout to make this bitch jump
(Watch me, watch me, watch me)
Check me out, check me out

Bitch, I'm kickin' through the door!
Let's go! 8-18, H O P
Bet on me, you gon' see
Ain't no thing, bitch, I'm on
Bitch, I'm kickin' through the door!
Yeah, 8-18, H O P
Bet on me, Prodigy
When I hit the track, bitch, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Comin' up, niggas said, "He can't go far." (oh shit)
I cut through like a relay go-kart (woah)
I give it to you like a B-Day postcard
Killin' shit with my nigga DJ Romar (yeah, yeah)
You know you made it when they claim you overrated
Flow is slayin', cultivatin'
Way way back in the golden ages
Now I got hoes from here to Copenhagen
Like nigga, you don't even know where that's at
BagBak 'cause I'm a class act of Mad Max
A mental hazmat lookin' for a jackass to spaz at
I'm turnin' you niggas into my lab rats
Hashtag, #FuckYouMan
Got a dome piece with a nut and a bolt screwed in
Don't care what cult you in
I'm AWOL like I'm D. Trump's new plan
I be givin' you some mo' action, mo' thrashin'
Old-fashioned ho slappin', throat slashin'
Hittin' you harder than a collision with a semi
The windshield bust and then youâ€™re thrown past it
I'm the maniac in yo attic, nomadic, toe taggin'
Ho, that's my dick, you should blow at it!
I don't really give a fuck about your feelings
You can cry me a river 'cause I'm a dog and you know that shit
Clearly there's a devil on my shoulder with an angel
But they don't go back and forth
We are all in agreement in knowin' just what I am rappin' for
Just smashin' whores, give me ass galore
It's all I'm askin', Lord
I can fit the women inside of my black Accord
And we can speed through the night, unless I crash of course
I may need to see a psychiatric ward, so let's go!
I'm 'bout to make this bitch jump
(Watch me, watch me, watch me)
Take a look, take a look
(Watch me, watch me, watch me)
I'm shuttin' shit down
I'm 'bout to make this bitch jump
(Watch me, watch me, watch me)
Check me out, check me out

Bitch, I'm kickin' through the door!
Let's go! 8-18, H O P
Bet on me, you gon' see
Ain't no thing, bitch, I'm on
Bitch, I'm kickin' through the door!
Yeah, 8-18, H O P
Bet on me, Prodigy
When I hit the track, bitch, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah, yeah
Nigga, better tell these hoes I'm kickin' through the door!47Embed
