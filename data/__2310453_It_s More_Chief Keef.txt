18 ContributorsItâ€™s More Lyrics
For Blood I pour out a fifth, keep on pourin' the shit
In the club standin' on the couches, enjoyin' the shit
She want all of this dick, I give her majority of the dick
Baby I gotta get all this money, need all of the shit
But there's more to this shit, girl it's more to this shit
Girl, it's more to this shit
Girl, it's more to this shit, baby
It's more to this shit
It's more to this shit
It's more to this shit

All I see green, green, nothin' in between
No brown, no white, all I see green
All I see green, no broccoli, I eat beans
And I smoke trees, so high like I eat leaves
Ayy, I roll off with that guap like "beep beep"
You don't gotta like me, but yo' bitch like Chief Keef
She say she love me, then I leave with my cleats
I know I was drivin' but I was runnin' up the streets
I walked up in the club, they don't need to see my ID
I ain't got no patience, don't need to see my IV
I picked up some paper tryna see where that's gon' lead
I walked up out the office with a check on one, two, three, three
You might also like
For Blood I pour out a fifth, keep on pourin' the shit
In the club standin' on the couches, enjoyin' the shit
She want all of this dick, I give her majority of the dick
Baby I gotta get all this money, need all of the shit
But there's more to this shit, girl it's more to this shit
Girl, it's more to this shit
Girl, it's more to this shit, baby
It's more to this shit
It's more to this shit
It's more to this shit

I see blue, blue, no I don't see you
All I see is blue, is that Blue's Clues?
If you cross the red, red, shots up in yo' head
Ya dead, ya dead, just like my dead presidents
I pulled them Ben Franklins up out my pocket
I know I'm so icy, I got my rocket
I gave my tech to y'all, you know I T-Mac'd it
I took it back a while, this T-Mac spit magic
Hop out that clean, with green, shiny like Oil Sheen
Spraying shit like mousse, Rudolph where you goin'?
I'm the king, I'm Mufasa with some wings
I want some Wokcanos, I don't want chicken wings
For Blood I pour out a fifth, keep on pourin' the shit
In the club standin' on the couches, enjoyin' the shit
She want all of this dick, I give her majority of the dick
Baby I gotta get all this money, need all of the shit
But there's more to this shit, girl it's more to this shit
Girl, it's more to this shit
Girl, it's more to this shit, baby
It's more to this shit
It's more to this shit
It's more to this shit2Embed
