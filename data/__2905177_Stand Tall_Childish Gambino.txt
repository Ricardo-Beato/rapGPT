82 ContributorsStand Tall Lyrics
When the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92
I listened to what my father said

Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can

How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said

Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
Oh I, nah, nah, nah
If you are strong, you cannot fall
If you are strong, oh no
There is a voice inside us all
So smile, ohh, when you can, ohh, when you can
You might also like
If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side, woo, oh
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do

Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall

Oh!
Give me a moment, oh, oh, oh
When they're gone, keep to yourself
Oh, oh, woo, oh, ooh, yeah!
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Oh! Oh!
Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
(Thanks for doing that, thank you)
Oh! Oh!
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall)
Ooh! Oh!23Embed
