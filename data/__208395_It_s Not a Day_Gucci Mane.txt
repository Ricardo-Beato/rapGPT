It's not a day that goes by, ahhh
That I don't wanna look in your eye, ahhh
Girl you so fine, I might try, ahhh (Brr, brr, brr)
To fuck around and lick you dry, ahhh
It's not a day that goes by, ahhh
That I don't wanna look in your eye, ahhh (Yo eye)
Girl you know you got that fye, ahhh (Hot, hot, hot)
If you don't give it to me I'll die, ahhh (Oh)

She so fine, it'll make you cry
Make you smile, even make you lie
Make me cum and I don't know why
Got me actin' dumb and I don't know why (Dumb)
Some say I'm sprung and I'm young
And I'm dumb, full of cum
I'm a fiend, you the drug, I'm high (Ooh)
Baby so fly, ain’t nothing I won’t buy
She different Louie until she is a lie (Lie, lie)
Baby drive
I'm too drunk to drive
Sliding down Ocean Drive (Question)
Driving a Lambo like New Jersey Drive (Ooh)
There's two freaks inside ()
Pull up in a Coastal suicide
I propose a toast (We did)
Got a bitch so bad I wanna boast
Bae, let's get some to smoke
Everywhere I go my youngin' wanna go, she wanna go
The hoes with the most from coast to coast
A whole brick just a host
Baby, let's elope
I buy you a stone bigger than a cantaloupe (Brr)
Girl, you dope as cancer smoke
And I think I'ma overdose (Guwop)

It's not a day that goes by, ahhh
That I don't wanna look in your eye, ahhh
Girl you so fine, I might try, ahhh
To fuck around and lick you dry, ahhh
It's not a day that goes by, ahhh
That I don't wanna look in your eye, ahhh
Girl you know you got that fye, ahhh (Ooh, ooh)
If you don't give it to me I'll die, ahhh

I'll be a lie, if didn't say that you fly
And I ain't lyin'
Louie carrier, carry on bag
When we flyin' ()
I'm supplying all this shit I'm buyin'
I can keep you high (Ch-ching)
Private jet, I'm passing kush out to the pilot when we fly
Ferrari jet, you my copilot when I wanna drive (Uh huh)
I do the drivin', then you do the ridin'
Let's take a ride (We ride)
You got that wet
With that water slide, and I wanna slide (Haha)
We smoking jet fuel
The kush came in darker this time (Gang)
In ya spine
And hit from behind
And damage the linen ()
And she came and I came in
That's perfect time
That pussy wet, man it's too wet
It got me slidin'
I'm a vet
Got a mean chick
But shawty ridin' (Gucci)
It's not a day that goes by, ahhh
That I don't wanna look in your eye, ahhh
Girl you so fine, I might try, ahhh
To fuck around and lick you dry, ahhh
It's not a day that goes by, ahhh
That I don't wanna look in your eye, ahhh
Girl you know you got that fye, ahhh
If you don't give it to me I'll die, ahhhEmbed
