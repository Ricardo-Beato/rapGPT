32 ContributorsThe Rooster Lyrics
Hold up, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Somebody done told you wrong
Thought it wasn't gon' end off like that there, huh?
Hot, too hot, too hot
Too motherfuckin' hot

Okay, I started out all alone
'Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm living it through this song
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me
Like a candle in the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di' before she died, therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end, you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win

Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a party? Not hardly; I'm tryin' to stay up outta that womb
Or that p-u-s-s, puss, I said puss
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit, smash and turned it timid
If anyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swole
For the most, most part, you fuss, fight, fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the signs

Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

K-O, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas, now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings
And then my son, he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing
I think he's pissed, I can't dismiss the matter of the fact
Because he saw me and you argue, now the energy's coming back
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax
Tapes, CDs, baby, please
You make me wanna scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing? (Wax)
Tapes, CDs, baby, please
You make me wanna scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?
Throw your fuckin'â€”

Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

Tapes, CDs, baby, please
You make me wanna scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing? (Wax)
Tapes, CDs, baby, please
You make me wanna scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out2Embed
