Shout out to all my peoples out there
Who been holdin' me down
Shout out to Swizz Beatz
Shout out to Cassidy
Shout out to all my Hollywood family
Shout to my girl, LR, LisaRaye

I'm doing my thing right here on the mixtape
Shout out to my boy Katt Williams
Shout out to all my peoples on MySpace

It's your girl, honey girl
