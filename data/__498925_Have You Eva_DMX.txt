11 ContributorsHave You Eva Lyrics
Have you ever got up smiling, laid down crying
First you love life then wish you were dying
Bitch so fed up gave up trying
Kept it straight up but niggas kept lying
Ever seen something that you wanted so bad
And got it then wished it was something you never had
You ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it
If you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it
You ever felt so strong or so loved
But when it came down it wasn't meant to be so hard
Wake yourself up like, where did I go wrong!?
Just get back up, pray on it and go on

Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

Have you ever wanted to go right, but then chose left
Deep down with a lift to way shows death
Burn in the night but everyday shows stress
Regardless of what you think I'm going in that
Have you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there
Gaze so in your heart, but really didn't care
Stand out at the wrong turn and now life ain't fair
And all you can do is take it, like ye
Ever found out that the shit you was living with
Deeper, cause to me is tryin' to creep ya
Back your Glock off put your ass in a sleeper
Used to be my dog, now he's the Grim Reaper
You might also like
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

Ever seen something that you didn't want to see
Had to be something that you didn't want to be
Had to kill a nigga that looked just like me
Wanted to believe to have a trust like me
I seen the dark, I seen the light
I seen the day, I seen the night
I seen the wrong, I seen the right
I seen the start, I seen the final

Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it9Embed
