You seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down. when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it
Respect the struggle. respect the hustle. respect the dreams.  respect the movement
I had an album listening and clothing presentation and Madison Square Garden
People were crying. people were throwing up the fist. people were dancing
But Media Takeout couldn't say one thing positive knowing damn well you'd love to be on the YEEZY 350 list
You probably got bootleg Yeezy's on right now
I'm a human being. I'm an artist, bro
Your site is entertaining and hilarious but certain things are just too far. you have no idea what I've had to go through
So many people didn't make it and gave everything they had for me to stand on their shoulders and break through fashion
Fashion ain't no joke for me. It's a way of life. creative expression and industry
I've given everything I had for this moment. a lot of people feel it's the paradigm shift
And I'm proud of this picture with me and Caitlyn. She gave the most heart felt speech at my wedding
