13 ContributorsRollin Lyrics
J. White Did It

Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
All my bitches rollin', rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin'
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
Rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick

Look, show you bitches how to do this shit
Stand back while I demonstrate
Pussy worth like a million dollars
I think your nigga got expensive taste
I'm not a bum bitch, I'm a boss bitch
You sideline, I'm center stage
I don't even get involved with it
If it don't make me cum or it don't get me paid
If it's not the money then it's "poof, be gone"
Steal your man with my Doobie on
Whole team full of bad bitches
And that Louis Vuitton our uniform
24 karat my grills, I do what I want
Bitch, fuck how you feel
Fuck a whole check up all on my nails
I pull up in foreign and cut in my wheel, byes, bitch
You might also like
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
All my bitches rollin', rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
Rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick

Look, I'm not a rider chick, I'm a driver chick
I could come get you instead
I hope all of your homies got money, nigga
'Cause all of my bitches got bread
Look, got a home girl out the west coast
Swear to God, I love that bitch
Ask about us, any club
They gon' tell you we run that shit
I'm like the strip club, Mariah Carey
Dominican, Halle Berry
Hair be laid, bills be paid
Still put bread on my nigga commissary
If I want somethin', it's, "Whatever, cop it"
Balenciaga, tell 'em check the closet
Heard you fuckin' for that extra change
That's why that pussy got that extra mileage, I be rollin'
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
All my bitches rollin', rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
Rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
Rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit2Embed
