33 ContributorsFallin’ in Luv Lyrics
30, you a fool for this one

I'm fallin’ in love with the life
Fallin' in love with the ice
Fallin' in love with the world
Fallin’ in love with you, girl

What you mean?
She look so mean in lil' blue jeans
Girl, I done seen all the good
In the back, in between
I know I'm wrong
Prolly shouldn't want this nigga's bitch but fuck it, I'm on
Off the boot, she lace her shoe, she getting gone
Purest molly, real thing, shit strong
And she smoke the loudest weed, Cheech and Chong

(Mm-hmm)
Off the boot, she lace her shoe, she getting gone
(Mm-hmm)
And she smoke the loudest weed, Cheech and Chong
You might also like
I'm fallin' in love with the life
Fallin’ in love with the ice
Fallin’ in love with the world
Fallin' in love with you, girl

I done fell in love once again, oh-no, no
I done fell in love once again, oh-no, no

I been fallin’ in love with the world
I done spent me a dub for your girl
60 racks for the club and 10 ounce for the pub
I got mink on the rug
And some diamonds and pearls
Mm, I'm around the world
Bringin' all this money in, I don't gotta work
Nigga say he wanna spend, I cost a vert
Love to see my bitches spend, cop a purse
I just hopped out the Benz (Hopped the Benz)
I got gold on my lens (Gold on my lens)
Gunna Gunna gon’ win (Gunna Gunna gon' win)
Oh, you down 'til the end (Down 'til the end)
And you love to drink Hen
Would you come with a friend? (Come with a friend)
Me and Yachty again
Overseas, spendin' Yens
(Mm-hmm)
Off the boot, she lace her shoe, she getting gone
(Mm-hmm)
And she smoke the loudest weed, Cheech and Chong

I'm fallin' in love with the life
Fallin' in love with the ice
Fallin' in love with the world
Fallin' in love with you, girl

I done fell in love once again, oh-no, no
I done fell in love once again, oh-no, no

I'ma own up to it
Prolly should have never did this
Sex on sex on sex
You done fell in love with my dick
You done fell in love once again, oh-no, no
You done fell in love once again, oh-no, no5Embed
