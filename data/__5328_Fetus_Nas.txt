38 ContributorsFetus Lyrics
Yeah..
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore, I could see
Through my belly button window, who I am...

I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Nine-months process, infant size
A prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties
Was married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop
I'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones
Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones
Hearing prayers, she asking for my good health
That I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself
Nervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood
Mixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes
Lot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping
I'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen

I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes

Yo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered, "If I am born, will I be safe at all?"
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
September 14th, 73
Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop
See how the government start retraining cops
Month nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said "Stay calm," holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud
Wanting to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he say, "At least that nigga ain't ugly"
Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers
