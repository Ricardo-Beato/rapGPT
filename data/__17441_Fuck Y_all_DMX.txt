14 ContributorsFuck Yâ€™all Lyrics
Fuck all ya'll niggas (Ay fuck you too)
Ay yo fuck y'all niggas (Man fuck you too)

It's big dog baby gettin' down like what
See I'm a thorough bread, I don't fuck wit muts
Bloodline is where the pups at
They off the Grand Champ, yea what black
Don't nothin' move less, dog say so
Cats clueless about the way it go
Off the chain I got at least 3 kills
Even though my last album only did 3 mil
I still give em chill cuz they feel dog
I can't help what it is, shit is real dog
You must have thought that it was a joke or somethin'
Now you done fucked around
And got your man choked for frontin'
Now hold up playa cuz I don't play those games
And don't ask me shit cuz I don't say no names
See what I know I'm takin' to the fuckin' grave
So keep knockin' cuz you ain't gettin a fuckin' thing

Fuck all ya'll niggas (Man fuck you too)

"Who We Be" was off the last joint
But now it's who we see and we forget the last joint
Cats ain't never walked like X
Even before Kool G Rap talked like sex
I've been around since at least 83
So ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin' me
Cuz I'm gon be here when you cats is gone
And other cats is on, another batch is born
Don't give a fuck about none of y'all
Fuck each and every one of y'all
Cuz I done done it all, been where ya at
Been where ya goin', then brought it back
I tried to tell ya about it but you wouldn't listen
Now I'm gonna take you to the hood cuz the hood will listen
I wish you woulda listened cuz then you woulda known
That it's only right to give a dog a bone
Bitch

Fuck all ya'll niggas (Man fuck you too)
Ay yo fuck y'all niggas (Man fuck you too)

Aw Man
There are some things I can't stand
When a nigga holla wanna shake my left hand
When a nigga follow cuz he actin' like my man
Nigga might as well swallow cuz he actin' like a fan
And I got balls like you do
Man I got Paul to pull through you
Stan don't they know how we do
Ear to the streets with our hearts to the people
Gots to give a little to get somethin' back
And what you usually give see you ain't nothin' black
But when you don't give then it won't last
His shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast
You'll get broke fast, that's the Lord's will
Hold up I think somebody's a the door, Shhh chill
You sit right there, I'm gonna answer that
Cuz when I finish poppin' ain't nobody answerin' back
 X4
Fuck all ya'll niggas (Man fuck you too)
Ay yo fuck y'all niggas (Man fuck you too)
