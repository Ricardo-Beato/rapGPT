61 ContributorsBlack Girl Lost Lyrics
 Hello?
 Whassup, girl?
 Ain't nothing, this nigga in here stressing
Talking that old off the wall, back to Africa shit again
 What, that God Body shit?
 Yeah, that dumb shit
I'm trying to get up OUTTA here
 I hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumping tonight
 Word, f'real, where?!
 You know, where the real niggas is popping the Cristal
Not that White Star!
 Ha hah! Word, where the real niggas at?

Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby, baby, listen

A young, wild, beautiful love child
You like 'em thug style, link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink, a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel, looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (So fine..)
To see ya prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man
But you juggle way too many willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear, get your fuck on
Following week, you back there, but what you stuck on?
Weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up, ma? Fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo, it should be a throne for us
But for now, that's a whole different zone from us, word!
You might also like
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (Trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (Messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

Like Isis, he got your heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up, girl, instead, you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever getting down and trife-est
To get his mind, all you do is give him something priceless
'Cause in time, he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed
(Deceit, yeeeahhh)
There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice, tricking on you
You never listen to this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past, though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time, and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home, wanting more from a college degree, uh
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (Trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (Messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

Where are you focused? On legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo, you seem hopeless
Your value â€” too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop 'em off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost
(You should be ashamed)
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you being lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn, look! There goes a black girl lost
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong
