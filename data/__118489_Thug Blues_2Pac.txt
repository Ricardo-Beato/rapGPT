Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm

First it was nothing, not even, a fake echo of a song
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes
Thought I'd never feel this way again
And you were supposed to reach my heart
And find love within, love, love

Love within a storm
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love
Love within a storm
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me
Love within a storm
Wonderful
Love within a storm

I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near
Any problems plaguing my mind, would suddenly dissapear
It was rebirth of my heart, the day that you became my friend
Because I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again
Fall in love again, in a storm
You might also like
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm

Just when I thought I'd seen it all
Our paths crossed, amen
And I knew, from the first glance
That you, would be hard to forget
Your eyes, attracted me first
But you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldn't wait, to touch lips
And kiss, with my heart's intention
When we did it, was what I expected
And for that moment, we erased the tension
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters
And the initial blind date, first impressions
We kissed again; and I felt the passion
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessing

We made love, within a storm
In the midst of passion and chaos
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder
Those who prevail this drama
Will learn to bring their love farther
But now, the storm has past
And the seas of our friendship are gone
But as long as I live, I will remember
The love within a storm
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love
You know that I miss you, and love you
You know that 2Pac broke my heart
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice
They say, this ghetto fabulous
On 125th street forkin' around
This village, and the village uptown
South Central, Compton, Philly
Chi-Town, Southside
It's hot in 'Lanta, hot in 'Lanta
Jersey peeps, I hear ya
Miami, South Beach, uh
Yeah, got love for you, love for you
My Brooklyn knights lovin' you, lovin' me
This open, rich city
Ya know, I got love for youEmbed
