69 ContributorsNumbers Lyrics
You already
Know what I been on, you know where I be at
'Cause men lie, women lie, numbers don't, I see that
Catch me in a private jet like, "Fuck it, where the weed at?"
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass, you know I need that

Now these bitches say they love me, but they just obsessed with the image
Now if practice makes perfect then this is a scrimmage
'Cause I ain't perfect, I never said I was
But now they hatin' 'cause a brother finally got some buzz
The things that I say (Say,) the places I'm seein' (Seein')
The people I talk to you don't know what I mean
Even matters of love, it ain't always as it seems
Yeah, there's plenty in the sea until you hit the mainstream
The girl that I love, the one I call my honey
Now I wonder if she love me for me or my fuckin' money
Sometimes I think about the love that I had in the past
I truly miss it, but it just wasn't destined to last
'Cause our separation lit a fire under my ass
And now I'm gunnin' for the throne, yeah, that is my task
Just a youngin with a dream that acquired a team
Motivated by bad bitches and rockin' Supreme
Now the whole world wonders what's his next move
That all depends on what I feel that I need to improve
Tell me what you think of me, I swear it doesn't matter
Just as long as I am happy and my pocket's getting fatter
Watch me shatter the competition, get mad and now all of 'em wishing
You coulda done it like I done it, bitch, I run it, ah!
Yeah, you know I do it like it ain't ever been done
Hit the Vegas strip and blow a million euro just for fun
To be honest I may have embellished that last line
Chillin' with a shorty that is so much more than fine
At the penthouse poppin' bottles of that hundred-thousand-dollar wine
I got the connect, met 'im through the grape vine

You know what I been on, you know where I be at
'Cause men lie, women lie, numbers don't, I see that
Catch me in a private jet like, "Fuck it, where the weed at?"
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass, you know I need that
Y-y-you know what I been on, you know where I be at
'Cause men lie, women lie, numbers don't, I see that
Now these bitches say they love me, but they just obsessed with the image
You know what I been on, you know where I be at

Yeah, it's been a year, and everything I said would happen has
New-school style with old-school bars like Alcatraz
'Cause I ain't never second guess this music shit
I knew this shit was all I ever wanted, all I ever had
Born famous, now it's just time to convince the world
Ditch cats, like drainage if they disrespect then don't step through
I paint pictures for your mind and bring it to life like cinematography
Say it then I do it, my whole career's a prophecy now
Better grab your jacket, 'cause in this world we live in it's cold out
And when my album hit the stores it's sold out
Like these rapper's careers, I'm the sum of our fears
Fuck a Grammy-nominated, bitch, I made it and I'm here
I said it's all about the fans, not all about the record sales
They said it wouldn't work, I told 'em go fuck theyselves
Why you think I'm independent? Visionaries never fail
Why-why you think I'm independent? Visionaries never fâ€”
You know what I been on, you know where I be at
'Cause men lie, women lie, numbers don't, I see that
Catch me in a private jet like, "Fuck it, where the weed at?"
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass, you know I need that
Y-y-you know what I been on, you know where I be at
'Cause men lie, women lie, numbers don't, I see that
Now these bitches say they love me, but they just obsessed with the image
You know what I been on, you know where I be at (Sinatra)

"You gotta realize
A lot of the time when I talk, and I'm talking extremely cocky
I'm not talking about myself
I'm talking about the work." You know where I be at
