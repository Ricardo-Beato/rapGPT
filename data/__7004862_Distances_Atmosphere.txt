4 ContributorsDistances Lyrics
And I'm not your mommy
Never cared 'bout your money
And I left your party
'Cause y'all clowns are too funny
You can dive off the stage
Or you can climb up those curtains
It's alright to admit that
You're afraid of the uncertain
I'm here to audition
For the role of the unhinged
Tryna act like it's an accident
The bad guys catch wins
I might just be nervous
Anxiety resurface
I got issues with the misuse
And your excuse of a purpose
I stayed until the finish
To the dismay of my critics
When it's all said and done
Y'all can say that I did it
Or you can tell them I failed
I mean, I guess I don't care
That's none of my concern
Y'all gotta learn not to stare
Stop, we not the same
You can spot me from a plane
Cowpie from the Southside
Floor hockey if it rains
Probably camped out at home
Won't answer the phone
If y'all can understand
Leave me and my family alone
You might also like
Might have to scream just to see if they're listening
I been missing since back before the distancing
I don't remember a normal experience
I been missing since back before the distances

Who is you talking to?
Won't you please leave me alone?
Who is you talking to?
Won't you please leave me alone?1Embed
