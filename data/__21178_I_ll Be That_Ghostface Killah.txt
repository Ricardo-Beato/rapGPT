4 ContributorsIâ€™ll Be That Lyrics
I could be your friend, I could be your tease
I can be a freak, I can be a P.Y.T
If you ask, I'll be that
I could be your girl, I could be your wife
I complete your side, I could be watching me
If you ask, I'll be that
I'll be your homey, lover, friend, I'll be your everything
If you ask, I'll be that
Say you want me, I'll come running
I can be your baby, just you ask, I'll be that

My girl, my love, come through, rescue me
Throw me on the bed, no clothes, wrestle me
After smashing that, then will you cook for me
Promise I won't hit you, you don't have to be shook of me
Washing my boxers, shirts folded nice and creased
Plus when we argue, she will never pull a beast
Clap for my baby, award winning, best nookie
I been in the whole wide world, that's why I stay spending

I could be your friend, I could be your tease
I can be a freak, I can be a P.Y.T
If you ask, I'll be that
I could be your girl, I could be your wife
I complete your side, I could be watching me
If you ask, I'll be that
I'll be your homey, lover, friend, I'll be your everything
If you ask, I'll be that
Say you want me, I'll come running
I can be your baby, just you ask, I'll be that
You might also like
I want you in a scarf, boy shorts around the house
Wife beater, undercover, sitting on the couch
Isley's is playing, lights dim, vanilla candles is melting
It's a long time, don't let no one else in
Fresh out the tub, sweetness and peaches
Body work splash around your neck, the kid admire all your features
Niggas be hollering; peace ma, what up boo?
You suck your teeth and keep it moving with the screw, yes

I could be your friend, I could be your tease
I can be a freak, I can be a P.Y.T
If you ask, I'll be that
I could be your girl, I could be your wife
I complete your side, I could be watching me
If you ask, I'll be that
I'll be your homey, lover, friend, I'll be your everything
If you ask, I'll be that
Say you want me, I'll come running
I can be your baby, just you ask, I'll be that

Happy birthday, red roses, big cakes
Donna Karen slippers, got your birthday gift by the lake
Big boats, thick ropes, ostrich purses
Snakeskin boots, Jared Jewelers, the mink cost mad loot
Ski trips, resorts, close your eyes, baby, make a wish
Blow your cake out, earrings is snowflaked out
Will you marry me? Will you carry me?
Through rain, hail, sleet and snow
Don't say no, you'll embarrass me
I could be your friend, I could be your tease
I can be a freak, I can be a P.Y.T
If you ask, I'll be that
I could be your girl, I could be your wife
I complete your side, I could be watching me
If you ask, I'll be that
I'll be your homey, lover, friend, I'll be your everything
If you ask, I'll be that
Say you want me, I'll come running
I can be your baby, just you ask, I'll be that

I'll be that...
Baby...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I'll be that, I'll be that...Embed
