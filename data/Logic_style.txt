Yo it's your boy Phil Ade
Ah man it's crazy here
Logic, I think they're ready for it
Let's get it!

Yeah I got it now what is it, pay the world a visit
Let them know I'm 'bout it with this golden ticket
See my curriculum is flippin' 'em
A hundred and fifty one yeah we sippin' 'em,
Bitches they trippin' all up in the club
Show me love if you really 'bout it, I don't never doubt it
One of the best out of Maryland
I'm down to shout it (Oh really?)
Never cocky I'm just confident the flow is prominent
This is the reason that I'm dominant
That automatic platinum plated flow, know I'ma shine with it
All of y'all is down to conform but I realign with it
Performing at a full house, feeling like Uncle Jesse
Bitches they stress me, take them to the crib undress three
Children lie, men lie, women lie then we die
But I'm here to tell the truth and let you know I'm finna rise
To no surprise, fake rappers meet your demise
The microphone and Adobe Audition my only supplies
Look within my eyes, yes I'll bury the odds
Now I ask 'em, is you feelin' me?

I got it back and now I'm on again
Hit you in your chest like breathing after a shot of Gin
I'm just a living organism that has arisen
With so many bars, I can manufacture for various prisons
So let me show you what I'm 'bout and baby how I do it
Flowin' for hours every day just so I can improve it
When I perform I envision a crowd and how to move it
See I am lyrically inclined
Alphabetically take apart and rebuild your mind
I'm on my grind and guarantee ain't no style like mine
I bring the force of course with no remorse
I'm married to the game, don't even talk about divorce
'Till death do us part, reincarnate then restart
With Biggie's eyes, Big L's mind, and Pac's heart
Rip it apart, intravenously like poison dart,
Y'all bananas if you think I'm slippin' in Mario's Kart2Embed
This right here, homie
This that first take shit, you know what I’m saying?
For my real heads
All my real hip hop motherfuckers, they know they're Roots shit
You know what I mean?
So we gon' get it like this
Let that beat drop, Psychological

I spit fifties and shit hundreds
Do shit that's undid
Spontaneously combust in these bitches guts
I get 'em wet, no need to touch
Break their back like Dutches
Keep 'em close like the toast I clutch
Never the less, I'm never depressed, I keep feelings suppressed
One of the best but need to listen if I'ma progress
I'm ready to live, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to ride for rap
I said it on a record, now I can't take it back
Stop, I shut it down like a bloodclot
Smoke MCs, like a fuckin bumbaclot
Mic check, I come to catch wreck
Death before dishonor so I'm coming for your neck
I pop MCs like Hymens
Y'all glass posing in studs, but I'm a diamond
Now recon, you need to listen, I'm never dissin'
Unless your shit is wack, I'll beat you into submission
Catch me fishin' 'cause I'm eating for a lifetime
Wisdom in my mind, I'm a star watch me shine
Fucking your bitch from behind, record it and hit rewind
I'm nasty, construct rhymes like rhinoplasty
A hip-hop statue, rhymes coming at you, God bless you
When I kick wisdom it never stress you or test you
Unless you a dumb ass motherfucker

(Psychological) Yeah, no want no more
Fuck it, ayo

Said this is mathematic tactics
Murder this rap shit
Intravenously inject my prophylactics
Inhale my words like a fresh batch of Vicks
Similar to black ice 'cause the flow so slick
What's up, rappers hear the rhyme they slit they wrists up
Do a whole 'lotta talking, no rapping like fisticuffs
Ah, yeah, (Turn my headphones up)
That's all you sayin' but I'm sprayin' and I can't get enough
Raw, rugged and rough, my alter ego, Mr. Tough
I'll call your bluff, face to face never snuff
I murder you with predicate poetic balletic shit
No mercy 'cause if I grip the mic they might curse me
Da Vinci flow, when I grip the mic I’m in control
Before I manifested tendons, I was rhyming as a embryo
Living in vertigo, half of these fuckers don't know

Yeah, all day. Drop tracks like that, all nuts in. Maryland stand up, that's it. I'm out, peace, one love. Fuck if you doubt me
(You are watching a master at work)

Ain't no need to talk I just want to bite down
On your bottom lip, let your bra rip open
Never had a feeling like this and I'm hoping
We could do it again, never thought I could find heaven within
A heart of a woman and now I begin
To understand more than I did from the start
Gimme your heart, trust me with love
Baby girl, I swear you fell from above
Lend me your hand, I'll be your man
I promise to do everything that I can
I'll be your Sinatra, be my Monroe
Give me your heart and I'll know it will grow
I put it on everything baby my love is yours for the taking, my darling, my drug
And now I know, and now I know

Most living the life that I'm living
Is driven by money and women
But you're all I ever need girl that's a given, feel me
Now sick as fuck just heal me
My heart broken can you seal me
Baby I'm knowing that our love is ever-growing
Which direction are we going
I think we should get to slowing it down
The only girl that make me smile when I frown now
Re-interrupt but we can fix it though I wonder how
All I know is I miss the way you smile

It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight

Now I ain't ever treat you like you was less than nothing
And I ain't ever beat you unless we talking fuckin'
So meet me halfway baby girl tell me something
You left me in the dark I pray to god the sun coming
Now its been a couple years many fears is what I face
But all that disappears when I look upon your grace
We ain't spoken for days so I guess you needed space
Did you need some time to mentally erase
The fact that I'm the only man that put a smile on your face
See when you do not talk to me my mind it just wanders
I swear to god I trust you but alone I start to ponder
I swear I treat you good, I swear I treat you right
But sometimes I do not listen that's the reason why we fight

Now, what did I do? What mistake did I make?
See shall we persevere forward with it or make a clean break
Since the first day we met we both knew it was fate
So baby girl I guess you needed some time
But I put effort into you like I put effort in my rhymes
Now that's on everything, my best friend I tell you anything
Give you the world plus some kids pick out any ring
So know I'm down especially when we up
Half empty, half full—fuck a cup, she my waterfall
This song is just for her fuck all of y'all
Ain't looking for no Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson
I'm looking for the girl that always thought I was handsome
Before the money and some, chillin' and dirty dancing
High price hotels flower pedals romancing now
Every now and then emotions they can shift
But all of this means nothing with no one to share it with

Alright for the real hip-hop mothafuckas, you know what I’m sayin'?

Visionary boy
Yeah yeah, uh, yeah, we gon’ do it for 96’ (yeah)
We gon’ do it for hip-hop (yeah second renaissance type shit check it)

Who would have thought that painting pictures ’bout being broke
Would get me riches like dealing coke?
Like big brother used to do so we could stay afloat
I heard them guns outside my window, them gangsters would tote
Thought about the life I wanted, picked up the pen and then wrote
While they was firing, you could hear sirens
From people dialing 911 crying in the phone
I was in the zone, trying to make a living
Heading to work in the morning
Everyday felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased
Until I quit my job, then my work ethic increased
Elevated to levels I ain’t ever seen
Stacking this cream, living the American dream now
I’m going crazy, I ain’t slept in days
Dreaming of Michael Jordan money like I slept in J’s
Always shouting out my team ’cause I get all the praise
But they the ones that motivate me on depressing days
See I’m from Maryland where cats draw gats like animation
From the smallest altercation, that can lead to termination
With a rapper on every corner, like the rest of the nation
Passing bars back and forth like legal examinations
As a youngin I was running wild
Me and my homies skipping school, puffing on that loud
Doing shit just to do it, ’cause we wasn’t allowed
I thought I understood the world, but I was still a child, yeah
Now when my mama was at home drinking, thinking ’bout the bills
I was dreaming ’bout the mills, running round looking for thrills
I guess this is how it feels when your memory spills onto the page
And paints a picture of another age
Back in West Deer Park, chilling with shorties after dark
‘Cause when the sun is down, the police always want us down
‘Til we get older and hustle, now they try’na gun us down
We just trying to make a living off of what we’ve been given
Wassup

They call me Logic, yeah that’s L-O-G-I-C
I ain’t wrapped up in them bitches, I just write ’bout shit I see
‘Cause these lyrics set me free, fuck the world, let me be
And when I feel like I can’t write, that’s when I hit the MPC
My talent limitless, but time is limited so listen up
If you can’t see the shit I see, you better get your vision up
I’m the king, watch me reign, born to rule my domain
Album ain’t even in stores, they tryna sue me for my name
Shit insane, so berserk, never complained, I just work
Chasing after my dreams like them high school skirts
Back as a youngin, spitting game, tryna get the nut in
Living life to the fullest ’cause them little things ain’t nothing
My flow unkillable when I be murdering syllables
But I take my time, slow it down, check the rhyme
Perfectionist to the dime, from the womb to the tomb
I be rapping ’til I’m dying, doing everything I love
That’s the life of a don, skipping school, sipping liquor
Tryna get this money quicker, bad bitches, good weed
That’s the type of shit I need
Lyrics bleed from my mind state
Elevate my mind and watch it rise like the crime rate
‘Cause sometimes I be high, and sometimes I be low
And sometimes I do shit I thought I'd never do before
My life is like a movie role that’s starring me, got these women on me
I hit the club with all my homies, and the drinks is on me
At the crib with the shorty that I met at the spot
Pretty eyes, nice lips, Grey Goose what she sips
Both my hands on her hips, ’til she put 'em on her tits
Freak bitch want the dick, biting on her finger tip
I only fuck with nice girls, I never do this type of shit
I’m thinking ’bout hitting it raw, shit I must be wildin' out
But that pussy wet as hell, I think it’s time to end the drought
Then again she could be burning, and that’s not what I’m about
So I dipped out, to live another day and die another night
‘Cause when I’m gone that ain’t gon' be the song that they recite
What up?
My Jedi powers are far beyond yours

Psychological protégé, what more to say, nothing

See I'm a stain in the game, tryna scrub me out, I'm still in
I started at the bottom and now I'm spreading to the ceiling
Is you feeling this lyricism, I'm dealing like rummy, you know?
My flow smoother than gin, on its way to your tummy

Nah, see? I think we should come in like this
You know what I mean?
With that ill beat, sort of give it a different type of vibe
Uh, yeah, we finna get it like this, uh

See I'm a stain in the game, tryna scrub me out, I'm still in
I started at the bottom and now I'm spreading to the ceiling
Is you feeling this lyrcism, I'm dealing, like rummy, you know?
My flow smoother than gin on its way to your tummy
Yeah, I'll stop your heart like a pulmonary edema
I'm so hungry I need FEMA,  and I used to be a dreamer
'Til I came into fruition, now, all of y'all better listen
And understand it's my mission, that no matter where I walk
It's my purpose to glisten 'cause you rappers can't see me
Like you bought the wrong prescription, but I spit that Lasik
So close, that I can taste it, while you go back to the basis
'Cause you don't know where you headed, as soon as I shred it
You dread it like Wayne's skull
I'm one of the best, to ever do it, that ain't done it yet
And yes, that might sound cocky

Multi-million dollar deals

And for real, it feel like I ain't even broke the seal
'Cause when you drop hits they want you to pick up the bill
Now my, life is in Maryland
My heart is in Chicago
New York state of mind but out LA man that's where I go
When I need to lay this shit down
So much on my mind, that's the reason I'm spitting now
Finally running the game and everybody tripping now
But I can't give a damn I got they bitches dripping now
Moet we sipping now

Yeah, smoking in London while the snow fall
In another country, so pardon me for the roll call
Damn, who would've thought the fan base was this immense?
On the first fucking train to Paris so pardon my french
Shows sold out, fans in line even though it's cold out
Yeah, touring Europe getting swiss cheese
Many said I'd never attain it now I'm like, "Bitch please, what up?"
Allow me to open up the verse with something so diverse
Now let the flow immerse, hold up; watch it disperse
Visions of Biggie, Big L and 2Pac just looking at me (Biggie)
From the gates of Heaven while the police booking at me
Open your mental while bitches give me brain with no dental
Y'all probably think I'm crazy for touching this instrumental
Shout out my cousin Ego, he know this shit's sentimental
Been doing this shit for my dogs, holding down the kennel
My ex hit me, talkin' 'bout she wanna make up
But on the real, I got no time for cover girls
Music is my main bitch, no time for other girls
I'm finna blow like Hiroshima, my demeanor get meaner
Watch me elevate to arenas, me without the mic
That's like Martin without the Gina, Venus without Serena
Now these thirsty bitches on the dick, we call that Aquafina
I used to bus tables until them tables turned
And everything I have obtained is everything I've earned
And everything I rap about is everything I've learned
So hopefully the listener can position a situation
Where they don't get burned and they can learn from my mistakes
Like I've learned from the greats to do whatever it takes
For Heaven's sakes open your mind, this shit one of a kind
Elegant and refined, irrelevant to the swine
What's the deal? Whipping through LA in the coupe de Ville
On the real, to various people I do appeal, 'cause of skill
So this the type of shit I'm gon' keep making
That make MCs break fast like flapjacks and bacon
Rest in peace to BIG, and many other fallen soldiers
Never Hollywood, I'm grounded like a cup of Folgers, bitch I told ya
Allow me to open up your mind and mold ya
Indulge ya, within this shit I call the second Renaissance
The system broke and they sent Logic in for maintenance
'Cause all you wack rappers couldn't break change to make sense
I'm back again with another argument about how much I'm black again
Fighting for credibility from the lack of blacker skin
It's kind of funny how your pigment determines how people perceive you
That's ignant
Ain't seen my momma in a minute
'Cause growing up she called me a nigg​er
That would never amount to nothing
Racism from my own momma, left home 'cause of drama
But I can make it in the rap game, look at Obama
You ain't been in my shoes, you don't know my story
You don't know what's in store, but bitch I stocked the inventory
Fuck a critic with the balls to try to tell me how I feel
You wasn't with me as a child, never once did you feel
The pain of my stomach that manifested from the lack of meals
Headed to the soup kitchen on foot by the lack of wheels
We aim to keep it real and hell no we ain't never missing
Came a long way from eating when government gave permission
If you think these lyrics ain't deep, you too stupid to listen

Yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights, yes, I want it all
The girls, the clothes, the cars
My name within the stars, standin' as they applaud
Yes I—yes I want it all
The money and the fame breaking in the game
My name, in lights

Yes, I want it all from the big to the little, things
When you hear my voice it rings
C-notes in my pocket, 'cause Logic does not prefer to sing
All the women know what I'm about
Make music then I dig 'em out
'Cause I got it, flow hypnotic
And not a single one of y'all doubt it
And when I think about the life I live and the studio time I give
To the fans in the stands, usually kill it but now you can dance
Cause this is a banger, Logic is not a stranger
To makin' that music that make you feel better
Whatever, whenever, however I'm just rhymin' oh so clever
Gotta flip it up just like coke
Step to this mic and this murder I wrote
I feel like I can keep it real
On my independent shit cause I don't need a deal
You see I want it now
Step into the stage and everybody wonder how
How you kill it like you do?
Every time that you walk through
Yes I want it all, but I don't have it all
So I'ma stand tall, until I get it all, until I get it all

Nasty
I don't ever stop! Ugh!

Yeah, yeah

Cannon

It’s funny how your role model gets outdated, becomes the old model
At the hotel, askin' for mo' bottles
Ménage et plus one, I’m fuckin' fo' models
Wordplay that elevates minds like Aristotle
Murci-lago, whippin' through Chicago
All these beautiful women follow wherever I go
Million-dollar deals on the table
Just a couple years ago, I couldn’t pay for cable
Growing up surrounded by 'caine like I was Abel
Shit was unstable, now Visionary's the label
Plus Def Jam, know who I am
I’m that motherfucker that do it just ’cause I can (The cannon)
Now I’m on a level that your elevator can’t reach
I got information that the school system doesn’t teach
I got verses that your Sunday service wouldn’t dare to preach
Second coming of Christ flow, they like, "woah"
Rapture you with lyricism, kidnap your soul
And changed your mind like I’m penetrating your skull
I seen shit John Lennon couldn’t imagine
Just me and a mic on a main stage spazzin'
It’s the type of shit normal people can’t even fathom
So much swag, kiss your bitch and she orgasm
I’m hazardous, you would have sworn I was from Nazareth
I’m resurrecting hip-hop like it was Lazarus

Step to the mic and they gon' dread it like Weezy
Man, this industry is so damn greasy
Swaggin' on the track, they say I sound like Yeezy
But I don't give a fuck cause gettin' money too easy
21st century, doing something mean to it
Play this in the south and everybody gonna lean to it
"Greatest of all time" has got a nice ring to it
We do it for the music, money ain't a thing to us
Been shining muhfucka what's bling to us
Most loved, most hated at the same time
Star player in this bitch and it's game time
Who you know lyrically killed the club in the same rhyme?
They call me Logic, motherfucker, better know the name
I spit crack like Pusha (Yuugh!), Novocaine
We never dumb it down, you know we just numb it down
And watch you get up in your feelings when we come around
Grew up on section 8, you probably can't relate
‘Cause y’all just watched the throne, I’m tryna checkmate
I been shinin since before I brought them diamonds in, and
They talk that shit, they talk that shit, it’s so astonishin'
Y’all better swallow that pride like a klonopin
'Cause I can lay tracks with my eyes closed, China man

Got a show in LA Sunday, then New York Monday
Looking at the BET cypher like I’ll be there one day
It’s the Roc reincarnated, we call it Visionary
Fuck the world ’til I’m on top, we call that missionary
The game’s on pause, it need to load again
These rappers is reruns and we need a new episode again
Yeah, well motherfucker, this the pilot
So fly I recorded this on the PJ next to the pilot on a CB
Now you see me on the TV
Said this would happen back in the day but you ain’t believe me
So um, I'ma keep rising to the top
Never stop and finger fuck the world ’till the day my album drop76Embed
This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothin', now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn, this is real life

Uh, yeah, I've been fiending for this moment
I've been dreaming 'bout this moment
I guess this is how it feel to have everything you ever wanted
Writin' these records like a dissertation
While the fans goin' crazy from anticipation
Damn, nine years that's a lot of patience
And now I'm lookin' at my idols and feeling adjacent
It's hell of a long way from back in the basement
Lookin' at hip-hop tryna find my placement
I bought my first pair of Jordans at twenty-two, huh
Same year I bought a crib too
Now my face in magazines I used to flip through
And my music on all the sites I used to sift through
Remember meetin' Nas for the first time
Shook his hand and he started quotin' my lines?
Said he a fan, goddamn, this is my time
I'ma get it, I'ma do it 'til we prime time
Yeah, I told him every single day that I be at it
In the studio recording like an addict
He said that real hip-hop shit I had it
Thinkin' to myself, "Damn, man, you made Illmatic"

Used to feel like I was nothin', now my life has meanin'
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life
I used to wonder what it feel like

Aight, I guess we back again
With another verse about how much I'm black again
You don't like it? Blame God for the packaging
Bringin' up my race, don't call me a white rapper then
Damn, they judgin' me by my skin tone
Instead of my talent, man, these motherfuckers been wrong
But it's all good, I just thought I'd address it
And spell it out for people so they can finally assess it
This is dedicated to anyone wit' a dream
And a realization of what followin' it means
Breakin' the cycle and not following your genes
That perfect moment when your logic intervenes
And let you know that everything ain't always what it seems
But if you really lookin', I promise you'll find your dreams
This is everything I ever wanted, half of y'all won't get it
The other half will probably laugh and wonder how I did it
I just spit it from my mind, one word at the time
Take everything I'm going through and put it in a rhyme
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lot of weight upon my shoulders
But this is my therapy as I flow this
Spilling out my heart, I just hope somebody notice
I've been real from the start and you motherfuckers know this
Once my name elevated that's when the fame escalated
But on the real, I've grown accustomed to the stares
People watching every move I make like it was theirs
All up in my business, and even in my personal affairs
Now, I know I talk a lot of game, but I ain't tryna sell you
'Cause honestly, I could show you better than I could tell you
And even though there's been moments when everything have fell through
We kept it moving, assumin' even the greatest fail too
I swear this business shit is do or die
I never contemplated suicide, I'm too alive
In front of thousands, but I'm talking like it's you and I
And everyday, fewer find their dreams because fewer try
This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking somethin's gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothin', now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life
I used to wonder what it feel like

Everything I seen, made me everything I am
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
Throw your hands in the air, stand behind mine
Everything I seen, made me everything I am
Stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine

Said, welcome to forever
Welcome to forever
Welcome to forever42Embed
Alright
Seen a lot of shit (Yeah)
Seen a lot of shit

I seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me, goddamn, you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't into fairy tales, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you got a fucking problem, bitch, I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah, we leave ‘em deceased
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capiche? Homie, what up?

I hope you live a long life hatin'
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
RattPack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, whoa
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it RattPack 'til the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind-state celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they mama's
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

I went mainstream with my main team, you just mad as fuck, you ain't come close
And your next girl is my ex-girl, she fine as hell, but she a mess girl
All I do is rhyme, I got no time, so I can't reply to your text, girl
Bitch, I'm back again and I run it, always gotta keep it one-hunnid
All of y'all know y'all want it, turn it up and get blunted
I'm like, "Fuck the money, fuck the fame," I came here to fuck up the game
Gon' get it, I'm feelin' myself, fresh to death, bitch, I'm killin' myself; I'm gone
We burnin' it up, step in the building, we turnin' it up
Talkin' that shit, but they never admit when I step to the mic I be murderin' it

She do it with joy, no almonds, ugh
Living life to perfection, V.I.P., that's the section
Presidential watch, presidential suites
You would think we held an election
It go Logic first, then I'm up next
I do not converse, I just cut checks
I do not rehearse, I just drop the verse
I need to cop a hearse, 'cause I'm fresh to death
I bet you never seen so much designer
Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer
Boy, I stunt when I ain't even tryna
Swaggin' is nice, but first I'ma rhymer
And I rep Maryland, home of the Terrapins
Say you spit crack, homie, we spit that heroin
Bring it right to your front door like I'm carolin'

Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it, oh yeah



Me and my homies just chillin' feelin' the vibes
This the time of our lives but many don't realize
Havin' visions of livin' on another level, never signed to the Devil
The rebel that be fuckin' 'round with the treble
Bumping Tribe in the system like penicillin, motherfucker
I'm killing, spittin' venomous never remember this it's like a system
Say it then I do it, I never missed 'em
Fuck 'em after I kissed 'em, sit back and listen
My chain, it glisten, it's like I'm from another dimension
Did I mention my circle's smaller than an intervention
Then some beautiful women tell me I'm handsome
Then I snatch they heart and make the pussy the ransom
I fuck 'em until inside they belly burst
Stop it, drop the beat and then we cue the verse
Spitting lyrics like how a Mac-11 really disperse
Slaughter MCs and resurrect them when they in the hearse
They say I got too many styles, bitch I've been diverse
They scared to jump in the cipher, I be all up in it first
My apologies but if you're after me then it gets worse
When I come through I spit voodoo and leave 'em cursed
Common logic

Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program — Midnight Marauder
Sounds like some, some '90s shit
Midnight Marauder, It's a good farewell
Midnight Marauder, Uh, I suppose, yeah, music

This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words, the tribe that's next

It's been a long time and I ain't even in my prime
I remember many moons ago spitting the realest lines
On the come up, matter fact it was long before that
Before I bought my first mic, before I could afford that
This is a letter to the underground, the place where I'm from
This is a letter to the fans that understand what I've done
And even though I gotta leave, man, don't none of y'all grieve
'Cause even in the mainstream that lyricism I breathe
Some of y'all love my raw records, some of y'all don't
Some of y'all will love my radio shit, some of y'all won't
Just like my race, my music has always been yin and yang
Something for everybody, no not just one lane
And on the real, I'll never forget the day I got my deal
Full creative control and the money was unreal
Started from the bottom and got here 'cause of my skill
And I never set a goal that I didn't plan to fulfil
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest

Yeah, yeah, this the realest
The realest, say what? Say what?
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest

I hope y'all understand. Y'all get it. Just have fun, you know what I mean? Enjoy the music, that's what it is at the end of the day. It's just good fucking music, man. Yeah boy28Embed

I wonder what it feel like
To do that shit in real life
And now I know I got it
That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted
But it's still Visionary 'til the death of me
Yeah, I'm tryna make it but I gotta find the recipe
Greatest of all time, I want the world addressin' me
At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressin' me
I'm tryna stay focused, I guess that's the Lord testin' me
I knew as a child, that this was my destiny
They do it for the limelight
But I make sure my rhyme's right
Waiting 'til the time's right
Smilin' at my mom's like
Smilin' at my mom
Smilin' at my mama
Moët what we sippin' now
We was never trippin' now
We on private jets, in other words, that means that we trippin' now
'Cause they was over there, I was over here
They was too scared while I was facin' my fears
I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer
That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers

But you wasn't there in the beginnin'
Nowhere to be found when I was down
But you show up when I'm winnin'
Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimmin'
I do it 'cause I love this shit
Fuck the money, and the women, and the—
And the whips with the rims still spinnin'
I been at it since the beginnin'
All these girls screamin', "Logic"
But I wanna hear my real name
Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real, man
Y'all act like I'm Superman
But I can feel pain
I should've gone crazy, and yet I'm still 'sane
Love it when they sing to us
Been shinin' what's bling to us
Yeah, over here
It's only been a year
I was dirt broke, now I'm ballin' like a sphere
I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

Now that I'm in the limelight
They hit me all the time like (Logic, you never call me)
Shut the fuck up, ho, let me get my mind right
'Cause this is for the fans, who truly understand
Real all the time, all of y'all my fam'
Shootin' for the stars and I ain't finna land
Givin' everything I can while they tell me I'm the man
Makin' music is the plan
Matter fact, you can call it plan B
'Cause I kill these rappers while they're in their infancy
And I be first to pop off, infantry
Gotta keep 'em in line like symmetry
We all fam', same root, smokin' different tree
And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony
Uh, to my ears, I love it when they cheer
On the road to success, these haters in my rear
I got nothin' to fear
'Cause the whole team here
And everybody shoutin' (What they shoutin'?)

Real talk, just RattPack, besides that, nobody I trust

Back again like I never left, Young Sinatra, that’s to the death
We turnt up ’til we go deaf, rep RattPack ’til my last breath
I cut records like Kid Cudi, day and night, that’s all the time
From the underground to the mainstream, my same team get all the shine
They wanted beef but I never knew, I just keep the peace and get revenue
Stay true, they never do, cut all ties, I sever you
These rappers like women, that's off of their pill, we keeping it real but they flow is irregular
Grab the mic and I murder on the regular while these bitches hit me up on my cellular
I can’t take the time that I take to rhyme and just bullshit, man, that blow my mind
I’m 23 like MJ, that’s no rest like overtime
Writing rhymes on the tour bus, we stay real to the core of us
They talk shit ’bout RattPack but every day, man, there’s more of us
That money come and that money go, but this music shit, man, that’s all I know
I been broke and I got paid, like a Goodfella that got made
I’m draped up and I’m dripped out, went to school, got kicked out
Told my mama, she flipped out, said “fuck it all” and I dipped out
But I’m back though, whole time, fuck bitches, I just rhyme
Brand new state of mind, my lifestyle is so divine
'Cause I’ve lived and I’ve learned, now I hustle and earn
Cause once you in the limelight, everybody concerned
With your wellbeing, and if you feel okay
Bitch, you wasn’t here a year ago, why are you here today?
I got professor paper, your money need an extension
I’m selling success, save up and pay attention
Money can’t buy happiness, but that shit can support it
'Cause what’s a family of five if you can’t even afford it?

If I lead, would you follow with a ease? (Uh, uh, yeah)

Swerving at 120 while she’s rolling weed on the dash
Many never follow their dreams but follow the cash
And this is the reason the Reaper is coming for they ass

Yeah, this is my vision
Written without second thought or revision
The type of shit that affect you like an oncoming collision
That just make you freeze, drop to your knees and beg 'em
Please Lord, forgive me for gripping a semi now
When searching for God all I ever do is stare up
While Satan sending me women
Wearing nothing but they hair up
Got the condom on the dresser, I can't wait to undress her
Would you think lesser of me if I did it?
Cause I get lonely, I'm human, and boy it's been a minute
Fresh out the states, surrounded by women that wanna hit it
But should I take the pussy just cause I could get it?
Or do I want something that's more committed?
God damn, it's hard to admit it
As you focus on the little things, the bigger ones will get you
So I minimize the negatives to see the bigger picture
I get richer while you fuckers hate
So keep it up and watch a young brother elevate
I'm black and white but racism I still cannot evade
I never understood the concept, even to this day
You know we're all the same in the eyes of a blade
Because when men shed blood it's still the same shade

That's why I'm just a man homie
Flesh and blood, I'm just a man
But I don't think they understand homie
I ain't perfect, I'm just a man
Yeah, y'all think I'm more than just a man

Went from a small town in West Deer Park to XXL
Now we shopping at Louis V, back in the day it was Ross
They calling me the savior, hope they don't give me the cross
Now that's the realest shit you ever heard
Never in the streets but I was closer than the curb
Do you feel me?—Whole world wanna kill me
Signed a deal but I'm still me—in five years will I still be?
Ever since I was a youngin this is all I've ever wanted
Always kept it real while they perpetrated and fronted
I was in the studio while they was gettin' blunted
Always have my doubts but deep down I knew I'd run it
Sportin' Armani like menage a trois that's double breasted
A lot of time I've invested and never once have I rested
Feeling nervous like when you getting tested
The game is over saturated, completely infested
The greatest story ever told, realest song ever written
To hell with a Plan B, motherfucker I ain't kiddin
I''m just trying to get this money, I'm just trying to get paid
That's the type of mentality put careers in the grave
Fuck how much you made
What's it worth if your memory fade?
Now I ain't perfect, on occasion I'm strayed
It's been forever since I prayed and I guess today is the day
So I step in the booth and treat that shit like a confessional
Thinking back as I reminisce
Wondering; does God even exist?
A man of faith but mentally I feel at risk
What you want from me, where am I supposed to go?
Seems like you never talk, tell me how I'm supposed to know?
I'm just a man, I ain't perfect—is this life even worth it?
It's time to dig up the past so fuck it let's unearth it
Like my childhood, living free like a child should
Remember the time I opened the bedroom door crack?
And saw my daddy smoking more crack?
No food in my house, we just couldn't afford that
Momma drinking, sleeping until five
But she always seemed to get up whenever men arrived
Feeling alone at like eleven
Segregated from the other kids like it was 1957
I've loved, I've hated, I've cried, I've died inside
I've resurrected but don't neglect that I've modified
I'm stronger, faster, better than ever before
And everything I've been through can honestly assure
I'm no less, no more
That's why I'm just a man homie
Flesh and blood, I'm just a man
But I don't think they understand homie
I ain't perfect, I'm just a man
Y'all think I'm more than just a man30Embed
Seem like my whole life changed in the last year
At parties with legends like "What the fuck I’m doing here?"
Waiting for someone to say "What the fuck you doing here?"
Until I realized I belonged and had nothing to fear
Who would’ve thought I would mingle with celebrity singles
In a room full of Grammy winners discussing they singles
Some people love you, some people hate you
Some people need you, some people act like they know you
But they can’t even read you
The effort I put into music is still the same amount
'Cause ain't a damn thing changed except the bank account
I remember the day I got my advance money
I’m talkin' so much bread, this shit'll make you dance money
What's the first thing I did?
Got my team out the way and then I got myself a crib
My boy Lenny gave me a place to stay for a year
Put food in my stomach, I had nothing to fear
And once that 365 was up, I told him to quit his job
And gave him a new career
So many rappers on that stupid superstar shit
But I plan to eat with the people I starved with
I’ve made money, I’ve lost money, I’ve spent money
I've slept outside due to lack of the rent money
I’ve been in love, been happy, been through a lot of pain
'Cause what the fuck is sunshine without a little rain?
And love is like leaves in the fall
'Cause some people get scared and leave when you fall
Speaking of which, I met this girl the other day
The type of girl that make the pain fade away
And I have a feeling she gon' be my next
'Cause she make me forget all about my ex
I’m talking something that’s deeper than just sex
But I don’t want her to be the third letter in the word next
Old soul in the sea of love
I’m just not current, none of the above
And man, fuck all that depressing shit
Let’s get this money and fuck these bitches
You know what I’m sayin?
Sike, nah, all of y'all just know that I’m playin'
'Cause all the money you possess ain’t what makes you a man
Big shot, tough guy, blow 100 grand
But you still in the same place, damn
But man, the world is so fascinating
Ambition got these girls gravitating
And honestly, it strokes the ego
But beautiful women ain’t good for nothing
Except procrastinating
I got a show in Paris coming up
Followed by London, I'ma tear it up
So many people just don’t care enough
Analyzing faces in the crowd staring up
What's the difference between me and them?
How come I ain’t in the crowd at they show seeing them
What that guy see in me that he ain’t see in him?
'Cause honestly I see no difference between me and him
We all people, all equal, we all the same?
Lookin' for control tryna play the game
We all got issues, just different magazines
We all sleep but have different dreams
However, once you’re awake and your life ain’t what it seems
And that’s the reason I’m living within my own dream
Hell yeah, fuck 'em all like I’m runnin' from the law
Haters probably think they phase me, I’m like no, not at all
I’m too high up, now to fall
Like a sphere, bitch I ball
Never asked me where my team at
'Cause you know I brought em all
And if you’re looking for a problem then we can get it solved
I just kill them with kindness, keep it peace and it dissolve
You got bitches, I got Bobby Soxer girls that be ride or die
A shawty on another level, let me catch a vibe
Super bad girl, IQ is in the sky
She graduated cum laude, your bitch went to DeVry
God damn, oh girl, she a go getta
At the party takin' shots like a Beretta
Doing anything and everything to feel better
And now she in the crib getting high like a falsetto
How you feeling, I be yelling
"Why these motherfuckers grilling?"
And she give me life ‘cause I’m making a killing
Bring it down, do it slow, show me how that really go
Girl I’m new in town, I don’t really know
They be like, when you gonna tell me that you love me?
I be like, "Bitch I gotta hit the studio, ho"
Now she got me on the crib, talkin' that she wanna do it
Condom on the dresser looking at me like ain't nothing to it
Thinking should I do it though, I don't even know the ho

Throw a Molotov in your crib
And tell them bitches to bill us, we the illest
Finger fuck a critic
Shit is darker than "The Chronicles of Riddick"

Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on122Embed
Aye, this that shit

I'm lappin' in this luxury by nappin' in a big ass house
Chillin' with my homies on the West side, West side
Bringin' out my best side
I was on the road for like a quarter I was in and out the border
From London to Paris, yes it's very extraordinary
Fuck around and took the bus and a ferry
Should've seen the itinerary
Then we made it back home like woah
Tell me how you're feelin', higher than the ceilin'
I know I've been illin'
Probably wonder where I'm at, bitch I've been chillin'

I've been vibin', let me guide em, I said I gotta know
I've been ridin' for so long I think that it's time to go
Feeling like an addict that ain't had it, up and at it in a minute
If it hadn't been invented, my limit wouldn't be infinite
I'm feeling like an infant in a womb, I'ma be here 'til the tomb
Lately I've been in my room
Lookin' and lookin' at records on the wall
Hold up—

Okay now, this how I'm feeling, lately I'm like the villain

Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5
You know this that shit that you bumpin'
In your whip while you drive
I've been living life and I hope that you do the same
'Cause if you ain't doing what you love, it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game
'Bout time that they know my name
Numb it down for the pain, this music my Novocaine
Lord willin' we overcame, it's time to get over man
I've been around the world and back
And I swear it's all the same
And what I learned; a prophet don't do it for the profit
Gon' get off it, check the topic
Watch me drop it, can you top it?
I don't know I've been at it on the low
Never did it like this here before

KAI: Anybody?

My program has just informed me and my partner of another ship that’s now 31 kilometers out...

Did you just say another ship?

Yeah, that's what he said!
Another fuckin' ship in the middle of space, man!!

I’ve gathered information from the ship’s motherboard...

Engage the ship!
What?!

Copy!
I’m receiving audio embedded in the ship’s distress signal...

Man—
Why white people always gotta go investigating shit, man?!

Shut up Kai—Thalia, playback message!

I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people
Truly wish that I could, check it, uh, yeah
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world
I see life different like this music shit just ain't the world

Letters back and forth from my homie
That's locked up in prison
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him

I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in
What if the tables was turned
And I was the one that been in, damn
He said he's seen me in the magazine
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel
That's been my dog from the kennel
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
Skipping class with all of my homies on a constant search for who I was
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
I never graduated, but I made it to the summit
Don't get me wrong, so many times I thought that I would plummet
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem to stomach
All of the beef around my way, I mean, I never wanted
To live a life where all you're truly living is a lie
I knew I always wanted more and so they wonder why
I said they wonder why
This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind

I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around, so the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate
And when the situation delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no, can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap, never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen?
Stop spending money on things that glisten
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over
I Know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over

Ayy, hey now boy?
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gat gat gat
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver spoon

Chuch, yeah
Now this that—
Yeah, yeah

Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious
I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born out of wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good
No ingredients in my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda
Gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it, hold up wait
Now take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin
Based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway—
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that "My Way"
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
What the fuck done happened to the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy (crazy)
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep (why)
Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker
Wide awake on the creep tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed watch him grow and then watch him lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC

I remember my life long ago in my adolescence
I could feel the presence in my residence
Hesitant even thought it was evident
I should get the fuck—
I know something is wrong
Yeah, I know something is wrong
Feel like my mind gone
I know I play along, I might drown in this song
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed
Shit maybe then I'm noticed, huh, but maybe not
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
Walking to work and I go blind
Sippin' on that Kool-Aid
Gettin' big wig money, that's toupée
Look around and see people with no class
Like snow on a school day
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu
Livin' life how I do is crazy
This shit never amaze me
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why
All I know is my mind racing
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it
Yeah, I be pacing, bitch I'm back again
Been here since way back when
Now let that shit begin, yeah
This album two but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise

This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming "I knew it!"
This is real, so real
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
Most of these people will never hit fruition
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
All alone with no one to dial
I'm just a man, I got problems
Understand, this is all I ever wanted
Yes, I do it for the fans and I ain't perfect
I've questioned if this life was even worth it
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now

This album two but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise61Embed
C-Sick
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams?
I know I'ma do it, go get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money
Don't make me mention
It don't cost nothin' but time for you to pay attention
Now don't get me wrong
I know there's people out there hatin' on ya
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative
Talk all you want about me homie, I'ma let it live
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive
Hatin' in your blood, you was born to be negative

And if I knew back then what I know right now

I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

This is dedicated to everyone that never made it
And the people that persevered even though they was hated
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion
But on the real, the road to success is prone to collision
And every now and then something happens that's unexpected
Like that newborn in your life 'cause you was fuckin' unprotected
And I swear nobody perfect, hell, I know I ain't
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow, teach 'em everything I know
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now

I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

Um, you like that take? I like it
Yeah, should I make it more surreal though, or...
I think it's good, hey Bobby run it!62Embed
Me and my team gotta intervene
What's the point of living if you ain't living a dream?
We live in a world where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming "Money ain't a thing", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew that living out a dream
Meant living out a suitcase, I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get money—run it

What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen
Boy, this been my house, this is merely an addition
Fuck 'em and their permission, they was killin' the game
Who the one that gave 'em remission?—you know the name
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget, second time around shit is different
Cause they know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating
They can suck my dick—run it

Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey
On an Interstellar mission in Chicago
At the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I gotta beware of the people
But I take care of the people
When I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No, we ain't never acquainted
On the rise like a defendant
That was charged with possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision
God damn, can you feel it?
Uh, I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot
Just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a PlayStation
'Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em
I'm too tied up, this a ransom—
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
Autographs off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan, anything you wanna do you can
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact, you should take a step back—cause I run it61Embed

What'd you wanna be when you grew up?

Honestly? A musician...

What?

I know man, crazy right?

Nah, what's crazy is...
Original music hasn't been created since Earth!

I know man. Lucidity...
What?

Back then, people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness. Shit we took for granted was obvious; water, food supply. It's insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise. I dunno, I guess that's what I'm looking for...

Living life on the East Coast
Way back in the day trying to beat most
Anybody that wanna do what I do
Well let me keep it one hunnid with you
It ain't about that; ain't about Hip Hop, ain't about Rap
Take a minute, hold up, wait, now use your cap
Chicago, know I'ma snap
Nah, this ain't no basic rap

And so they wonder who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high

Back again, never outside so I'm acting in
I laugh again when they don't understand
What I mean, bias; everybody seen by us
Everybody wanna live a life like this
Man fuck that, do what's good for your family
Make music like there's no Grammy
For that last line, they might ban me
I don't give a fuck though
'Cause I am me, from Beijing to Miami
I'ma just do what I do with my crew
Ain’t no telling what I'm finna do
But I promise that I'ma keep writing for you
And I know what to do, everything right here for you
Only for you, depending on what you gon' do
It's all for you—it's all for you

And know that I'm the only one

There is no one besides the only one
And you know I gotta let 'em know
If you love it, let it go
At an all-time low and all I know is, all I know
I do what I love, came from below and then rose up above
Created a world no one has been to
Everything that I'm into, everything that I've been through
Bring it back like, let it shine like a Bat Light
Reminiscing on that night, gotta take flight
Everybody probably wonder what I'm living like
In the middle of the night, I might write
Despite what they say is right and wrong
Despite they wonder (Wonder)

Are you ready for this?

Are you?

Wait, wait—what's that sound?

First fucking week!
Then it's other motherfuckers talking 'bout:
"Oh, Logic's blowing up, he's getting so big now. I don't want him to blow up on me. Oh, Logic's changing..."

Chattering

Feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I'm low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water now I'm prayin' for a flood
Feel like time passing me by, slower than a slug
While this feelin' inside of my body's seepin' like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you'll never leave
Even though my daddy you know he

If you deal with war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap)

Yeah, in London talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, "'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

People want to talk about what makes them happy
What really makes you happy?
Tell me what makes you happy
Makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you glad
Tell me what makes you happy
People say its money, give me the money
All the money (money)

If I could live forever and a day
Know I'd never fade away
But my life is not okay, I...
I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed
Life is fucking up my vibe, I...
I wish had a lot of money
Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper, you already know
My life would be so much better with cheddar
Only work as hard as I do for vendetta
Cause my ninth grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit
Wouldn't be nothing, working that minimum wage
And cooking McMuffins, so I'm puffing on this green
Wishing I had more money than I do
Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, ah!
And so I'm all about my business
Is there anyone who wit this?
Can a brother get a witness like: Ah—Ooh, Ah—Ooh
Wassup with it, come and get it
Tell me now what's on your mind
I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline
Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine
Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line
Somebody tell me now what done happen to society
My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety
They say that money cannot make you happy
Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke
And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?
Why you trying me, like ah...

Psycho is fearless, anti-snitch that means I'm illest
No bitch in my blood so I qualify as the realest

A mastery with more verses than the first testament
Sacrifice a week, MC's that's how I do repent
C4, I'll disintegrate your friend to see more
Suicide lyricist, hit you like a claymore
My sixth sense leave you to burn like a pack of incense
Flow intense, filled with mad suspense
As I drench your headphones, proclaim my throne
Switch up the style quick to invert the tone
Yo, ha, yo

My mentality decipher reality from pretend
My state of mind is forcing spoons to bend
Can you comprehend from where I do descend
My minds may never end, my philosophy is endless prophecy
Want me teach you this hypocrisy
I'm an assassin with the name of a Kennedy
But truly E-K-Killa my identity
Sway with the miracle known as lyrical melody
Coming with brutality, finish them with fatality
Listen, I'm the illest white boy on the M-I-C
Reside in MD
Right around the corner from DC
In my spare time, I write rhymes in three
What's the dealio?
Sharp like Number 24s free throw
Playing Bitches like kino pass the C-note shit
Cause you know I need dough
Never pack heat my blade rip from retreat
I never sleep, less it be around the police
Spit projectiles, rugged exterior like a reptile
I never met an MC that could truly amaze me
Yeah they bust shots, but they bullets only graze me
A mental institution, I probably need to be in it
Cause I ain't done 'till I'm done and the song finished
This the type of shit that you bump with your windows tinted
This the type of shit that you bump with your fingers lifted
Spit the illest, I grab the microphone so you can feel this
Give you the realest, c'mon you know the deal is
Ever since I started rapping, real shit begun to happen
Brainwave frequencies I'm tapping
My first show, standing ovation, they still clapping
Showcases of governmental facilities
They was feeling me, dictionary my only utility
My flow heavier than menstruation
Leave the whole club shocked cause my skin Caucasian
Amazing, sharper than a sword by an Asian
Rhymes I release through my rugged fingertips
Keep a 9 to 5 only 'till I get rich
Cause I gotta hold a job, or I'll feel like a bitch
I murder mics, wordplay nice, heart made of ice
Any publicity good publicity, right?
So if my name in ya mouth, then I'm spreading like lice

Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her

Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than con...
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it
My oh my, oh my
Feeling innocent, oh my
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky, to the sky
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, acceptance64Embed

I know, I know, I’m supposed to been home, I’m coming
Just, I’m on my way home, every time
I’m on my way there right now, okay?
Oh shit!
Life, what’s it all about?
What? Wait, where am I?
The space between spaces
Beyond time and existential intelligence
Forget, fuck all the hippy shit, where am I?
What’s the last thing you remember, Atom?
I was in the store, I bought some smokes
I came outside, the phone rang, I...
How do you know my name?!
You were walking home from work when you died
Died? Dead? I’m dead? I’m dead?!
It wasn’t an act of courage or bravery, but it was your time
What do you mean it’s my time? What? I got...
What about Vanessa? What about the baby?
Your wife and son? You see, that’s what I like to hear
You find out you’re dead and the first thing you worry about is others
Man, answer me, what about my family?
What’s going on with Vanessa?
They’re doing just fine
You see, your wife was cheating on you
Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!
And even though she loved you dearly
She was a bit relieved you would never find out
Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?
How you gon' tell me I’m dead then gon' tell me my wife cheated on me?!
Atom, none of that matters now
Walk with me
Wait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?
No
Well, I don’t see no pitchforks
Little red people runnin' around
It ain’t too hot up in here so I guess this ain’t hell either
I think the easiest way to describe it, this white void
Is to look upon it as a waiting room
So...are you God?
Yes, I’m God43Embed
I want what I want how I want when I want it
I’ma keep it a hunnid, I’m blunted
I don’t give a damn, I don’t give a fuck about another man
Fuck a brother man
I’ma make it, make it rain like the weather man
Old girl shoulda, shoulda got a better man
Ass fat, lookin' good in my letterman
In the hood I’m a better man
Wish a mothafucka would, would
Whole life I been up to no good
Change it all if I could
Rearrange my heart, the beat good but I can’t
I’m a sinner, not a saint
Layers to my life, no I can’t
Cover it up with paint
Keep on livin', livin'
Livin' on money and women
As soon as I’m in 'em, I’m out
Now the truth never come out my mouth
Speak life when I come in her mouth, like

I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life, a waste of skin
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don’t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now

Than work for the man in my universe

Momma told me everything gon' be alright
I mean my life can’t be off right
But come to think about it
Everybody runnin' the world seem to be all white
Can you mothafuckas see alright?
I mean, I need it, I want it, I gotta have it
Every day tragic
If you’re from where I’m from, everyday ain’t magic
On this I know
I been telling everybody I’ma give it a go, I know
I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know!
Love it or hate it, I made it
I did it, I lived it
While the whole world lookin' at the boy like whoa!
Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey
Really wonder what the remedy
Tell me, how the world gon' remember me?
Got me feelin like the enemy
Like I ain’t got no energy
I been lookin' for an entity
Feelin' like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity
Fuck all that
I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life
A waste of skin

Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

I know my life was lived the wrong way
I know I did you wrong in my own way
But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized
That hypnotized the only
Part of me you loved
Part of me that had the strength to rise above
Part of me you know
Part of me you love more than to let it go
Dear God, I just wanna know why
Why do you put us here?
Why do you put us below?
Why do you put us subservient?
Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers?
And then we crawl and we scratch our way out
We betray each other
We lie, we take from one another
And we told you gon' forgive us at the end
But the state don't forgive us
I'm locked up and half my friends
And then when I get out, or I make it out
I'm expected to somehow give back
To people who never wanted to see me escape
I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror
And it's gettin' clearer
That society was designed to keep me on the bottom
So, if you real, if you're out there for real
Please explain to me why
Why do we suffer? Why do we die?
And why do the people
Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead?
I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right
But tonight, I am in this church
Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me
Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do
So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down
I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up
I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame
And all I wanna do is believe in you
The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt
And they make sure it hurts
And I am tired of hurtin', man
I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared
So if you out there, do something about this
'Cause I can't take it no more
Help me46Embed
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"

Everybody wanna tell me what I am, what I am not
"You ain't black, you a mothafuckin' white boy
Shut ya mouth, do it right boy, a'ight boy?
Man, why you such a hype boy?"
"Why you always talk about being black?
Skin too white, nigga fuck that"
Everything you talk about, cut that
That door you trying to open, you could shut that
Grip the gat, yeah that’s how I’ma buck back
Tell me what I am and what I know now
All this prejudice has got to go
Life is moving fast, it need to slow down
Come and see me when I am in yo' town
Practice what we preach before it go down
Practice what we preach before it go
Yes, I got the gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the?
Masta deep down inside of me
The plantation deep down inside of me
Everybody fuck like sodomy
'Cause one or the other what it gotta be
Tell me why my momma gotta lie to me
Unity for everyone that lied to me
Peace on Earth what I try to be
I just wanna spread the message of equality
And yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the gat?

Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, right?
And I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn’t be shit!
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy
You ain’t never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there
We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say:
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other59Embed

It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind

And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore825Embed

It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one’s body
I’m not here
I’m not me
I’m not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can’t be anxiety
It can’t
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
I’m so in control of my mind and my body
But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxiety32Embed

But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me

'Cept the person you don’t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud

I blow your mind like cocaine, nah

Sucker emcees deceased
Rise on the East, I'm the sun bringing heat for sure
I've been making tracks on the low
Waiting for my time to shine and then blow
Like Johnny, Depp, increase the rep
Like a bench press set, homie, yes, I get repped
Paid my dues but I'm still in debt
'Cause I have no credibility in the game yet
Gotta apply, and run a background check
But I bounce, 'cause I ain't done shit yet
Right now, that's what I'm trying to do
Stay spitting rhymes whenever I roll through
Call me the Grinch, homie, I don't give a hoo
Any emcee, yes, I gotta kill you
But don't take it personal, it's business, fool
Do like Travolta, just be cool
And nowadays, everybody sound the same

Won't never stop till they all know my name
Gotta grind to the top, Rodriguez with the fame

Son
Son!

He was a class clown, loved by all around
He was kinda goofy, make you feel good when you're down
But one day he disappeared and never came back
At 17 got kicked out by his mother just like that
He moved in with his father that he never grew up with
But we're not gon' get into that, like cocaine we gon' cut it
He loved music, but never had the time
'Cause he was working two jobs and they both was overtime
His girlfriend always told him that he was destined to shine
He smiled, said "really?", but really paid it no mind
And when he was of age the situation was shitty
So he packed up all his stuff and then he moved across the city
Rented a room from his homie's mom and dad
They saw the situation and they felt so bad
They let him live with 'em, and he was doing good
Working at the street fixing cars under their hood
He got up with his mentor, that he knew for a while
He met him back when he was a youngin', only a child
A real good guy that gave him some equipment
And then he sent him packing like a UPS shipment
He said "lay some tracks, and maybe we can get it"
So then he quit his job and he moved in with his sister
They lived together as children so yes he really missed her
But then he got another job, still working on music
Tryna find a style and figure out how to use it
But one day he got it, yes, he's so excited
But then he stopped
Said I got a way to go on top, they gon' find me
Such a long journey like I'm walking I-90
Three thousand miles leaving the haters behind me
Along his path, he ran into a wise man
Said "please tell me how I let 'em know I'm great"
Wise man then said "drop a mixtape
But not just the regular shit that everyone doin'
You gotta let 'em know you forreal in what you're pursuing"
Then he was gone, just as quick as he came
After this encounter he would never be the same
'Bout 100 miles and runnin', he started feelin' something
What's that?
Maturity
Every single night, sacrifice rest to write
Dusk 'till dawn, he be rappin' 'till the sun up
Call him Super Mario he always get the one up
Finally dropping tracks, now the mixtape is completed
His appetite for perfection was seriously needed
Then it dropped
He would, sell it for twenty but his country in recession so
Take it for ten homie consider it a blessing
Yes he a rookie, but you know they respect him
That Botox flow, so whenever he inject 'em
Them haters tighten up their game but now it don't affect him
'Cause if they step out of line yeah you know he finna check 'em
He grew up on the bottom, but dreamt about the top
He finally found out that until he reach it he won't stop
He's headed to the summit, where everybody plummet
The game need change and Logic can break a hunnit
The consul to the game so you know we run it
Nah, that last line was, over dramatic
But he coming for that ass and he gon' let 'em have itYou might also like2Embed

Show you a little bit of versatility on my end
Let's show you how we do it
Listen to this, niggas

Uh, yeah, uh yeah

I'm a youngin' that give it his heart a donor, but you
Ain't got a clue, I call you Silver Stone
Bring punches like I'm Stalone 'cause I'm rockin' 'em
On the rise fast like I'm stockin' 'em
Everybody hear Logic then everybody jockin' 'em
I bring soul like Nike, I love life like Mikey
Nobody like me step on the stage, everybody like me
Drop at least a track a day
Homie, I'm tryna fill a 30 gig
This is nothin' but dedication, yeah, you gotta dig
Keep it blunt like when I spit game
Baby girl, I'm yo' next man, soon to be yo' ex man
'Cause I'm so beast, I'm an animal
Fuck the pussy, but never eat you, I ain't no cannibal

When the honey's walk by, you know they always slippin'
'Cause I leave 'em drippin'
Holla at yo' boy, I'm down to dippin'
Yeah, I'm from the East Coast, but this flow is grain grippin'
My qualifications exceed great like Britain
I don't sell 'caine 'cause these tracks what I'm flippin'
I'm lookin' for that money you can store up in yo' mattress
So if you wanna shine, you can shine and they can't tax us
Rubbers for my bitches, but the wifey get the plastic
I spit fire like that boy that be so damn fantastic
Keep the flow suspenseful and the punchlines stay drastic
I'ma drop tracks 'til they drop me in the casket
Step around my way, motherfuckers, and get blasted
Yeah, you bitin' like the Dawn of the Dead
And I'ma be the character to put one in yo' head
You lookin' for the brains and you also found the brawn
They should call me James 'cause I'm ballin' like Lebron

Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze1Embed

That's it, squad, bitch

Check the- check the bling that's on my finger 'cause I'm married, ho
There he go, everybody know that boy's pockets is swole
What's good? That sound familiar, never been here befo'
Life good, 'cause I just got quoted two hundred a show
Oh no, oh no, two hundred a show
Overnight, all this money that I've been makin', I gave it right back
To all of the people that made me, you know we like that
Don't know why your bitch wanna date me, but I can't fight that
Guess you ain't done shit for her lately, not on the right track
If I think that shit sound good, I gotta write that
Weed man knockin' on the door, I'll be right back
Pass the shit to 6ix, watch him light that
Hit the studio, record the shit, then mix the shit, then master it
And then we do the show and they recite that
Bitch, I'm right back, told 'em 'bout my life, told 'em 'bout my life
Told 'em I was broke as fuck too many nights
Now I see my name up on so many lights, but everybody prolly think this shit done happen–happen–happen

Overnight, people think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trap over–over–overnight
People think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trappin' and burnin' (Woo, woo)

More achievements for yourself and less talk
Cats beef with Logic, yeah, they prayin' I respond
If I ever did, I dead you in this game with no respawn
Peace, love, and positivity, that's all I want with you
But you push the issue 'cause I give you more press than your publicist could ever get you
Hell nah, fuck rap, fuck beef
Anyone that hate me, I wish you success
I wish you look in the mirror and ask yourself why you suppressed
The feelin's of self-hatred that you want project on me
Bet if I never picked up the mic, then we might be homies
But you jealous, you look at my life and you feel envy
Constantly comparing yourself to me and feel empty
Most people that don't fuck wit' me ain't never shook my hand
I'm a good man, yeah, I love myself
I know who I am, yeah, I love myself
They don't understand

The deeper and deeper I go, it get darker
They say they want the old me, they want the Young Sinatra back
The one that murder it, rip it up, no, never givin' up 'round the almanac

You ever wonder what it means to make it by any means
And finally attain your dreams?
On the come up, where they run up from the world of many fiends
I been at it since a teen, get this money, get the cream
Hard work and sacrifice but not a lot know what I mean
Most these rappers ain't got no class like bomb threats
And bein' ill is a disease, it's the onset
And it don't matter where you at, if you white or if you black
If you rich or you poor, we gon' always want more
But one thing I can be sure, as long as I got the floor
I'ma use this power to paint a picture of unity
And yeah I'm rippin' it up with that energy like it's two of me
Fuck the lights and the cameras, right now it's just you and me

One day (one day), I'll be richer than I was before

Never address me as "Robert" 'less it's 'bout that Dinero
Far from a hero, I ain't never saved my hoes
I'm not defined by these clothes, and zeros
It don't matter if you got six dollars or six figures on the creep
'Cause in the end we all six feet deep
Meanwhile, I'll be immortalized on this 6ix beat
Flashbacks of havin' visions way back in G'Burg
Every single one of my homies and me work
Cuttin' had to get up out it, make a hit, forget about it
Youngin' wit' a dream but nobody gave a shit about it
Ten years later, pick up a pen, write a hit about it
And back then I thought I'd be defined by how good I rhyme
Not like these rappers with shit flows, but look good online
Not made to feel bad for speakin' bout this shit on my mind
Or called a faggot, a nigger, a cracker who wish he was blacker
I wish I could face my homophobic, racist attacker
And smack the shit outta they ass as peaceful as possible
It's highly improbable, it's stoppable
But still, way too many people feel how I feel
That's on the real, on the real, on the motherfuckin' real

Fuck a mumble let's make America rap again
Industry don't give a fuck about rap or what's happenin'
Fuck a hypebeast, bitch, now who seein' me?
Nobody reports the music, this shit, this rap TMZ
Nowadays everyone divided, so I collided with headlines
Preach that, go 'head boy now preach that
Wash my hands of this negativity, word to Three Stacks
So fresh, so clean, who the illest on the scene?
Wu-Tang, get the cream, Sinatra gon' reign supreme
Open your mental, get out your feelin's like dental
This shit is consequential, lightin' a fire to the game
Can you rappers feel the flame? Nah, this shit won't be the same
Fuck a rap beef, I promise I want all of y'all to prosper
But deep down you know it's only gon' be one Mufasa
I'm the king, fuck the bling, but just might make you kiss the ring
All these rappers I came up on, I surpassed, I know it sting now
Don't try to twist my words and turn that into some shit
I love all you motherfuckers, just want to hear you spit
Dropped my last shit, the whole wide world applauded it
Game still ain't give me my credits, so I'ma audit it
I'm heartless like Kanye in '08
Yeah, that's word to NO I.D, now they all know who I be
I'm callin' out Jay-Z to jump up on the track with me and smack the whole industry
Show 'em what that real rap do
The ball's in your court, Hov, I hope to hear from Guru, woo!58Embed

Man I wish that I could be a dog in a rich family
Oh how nice would that shit be, my life a catastrophe
Now my shit a masterpiece, No Limit like Master P
Now I am the master, see, that's the way it has to be
My life is a movie, I'm so glad God casted me
I am not top ten, more like top three
I am not two 'cause nobody could top me
Get the pussy wet like Jodeci, you know it's me
I can't seem to put my finger on it like a rotary
But somethin's missin' from the game, when I'm gone, oh it's me
I feel sorry for these rappers comin' up, woe is me
I just took a hiatus and wrote a novel, motherfucker
I got more verses than the Holy Bible, motherfucker
'Cause I'm sittin' on five, unreleased albums
Greatest of all time, no lyin', that's the outcome
I do it for the boom bap, the trap and the radio
Fuck a fake fan, steppin' to me, try to play me, ho
I make music for every genre, every occasion
My shit is amazin', I'm blazin', it's insane
Going crazy in the gym, goin' in gains
Had a lot of dark nights, but bitch I been Bane
I was born in the darkness like Rick James, bitch
Sippin' scotch with Chappelle after the Grammys
Said them countries wasn't shit holes, they prolly wanna ban me
'Cause I say the shit that others won't, prolly can't stand me, uh
Like these rappers claim to hate me, but they stan me
I said these rappers claim to hate me, but they motherfuckin' stan me
They hate what I represent, but bitch, I am me

But also don't blow it, you know it, don't be a coward, but don't be too heroic
Live your li-life to the fullest, don't push it or pull it
Don't murder others 'cause you disagree with they beliefs
We all the same underneath

Ayo real talk, 6ix
As soon as you played me this joint, I already knew
I was like, "Yo, this some fucking, 'Last Call' shit"
And it got me hella excited 'cause I always wanted to do like
A "Last Call," I remember the first time I heard Kanye's
I thought that shit was so tight, dawg
And I was like, man I'm tryna tell my story, you know what I'm sayin'?
And then uh, I remember Cole did it, when did he do it?
He was on Friday Night—
Nah, nah, he did it on The Warm Up yo
And when he did the "Last Call" on The Warm Up, I was like "Damn, I'm tryna do mine"
So since—since this joint got that vibe, I'ma do my own "Last Call" right now for y'all
And my voice is messed up too, this is the last track of Young Sinatra

Yeah, yeah
Back in the day I wasn't shit, homie
Penny pinchin', I couldn't even pay the rent, homie
Thinkin' 'bout it I wonder where them years went, homie
Just a youngin' tryna survive, they was hatin' on me
I was working that nine-to-five, I was waitin', homie
I was bussin' tables fantasizin' 'bout cakin', homie
Letting 'em slip away my dreams, wasn't waitin' on me
This for anyone with ambition, calling anybody that'll listen
I'm wishing all your dreams come true, 'cause mine did
And yeah, you know I had to put that in the rhyme kit
But that shit came from sacrifice
Not on the corner selling drugs and smackin' dice (Listen)

Yeah, yeah
I treat the beat like it's my only son, my DNA
And this that Southernplayalistic shit like we was in the A
Back in the day, I was Young, Broke & Infamous
A Young Sinatra that was Undeniable
Who Welcome-d you To Forever while Under Pressure
And told you The Incredible True Story of Bobby Tarantino
And Everybody in the Ultra 85
Goddamn, it feel good to be alive
And all these bitches that I passed up
Couldn't fuck witcha 'cause your hair was too gassed up
'Member creeping with the gat, masked up

God damn, it's kinda crazy to reminisce on all this shit man
What it was like growing up
Damn man, just, motherfuckers running in and out of the crib
Doing drugs, selling drugs, all types of stuff
Meanwhile, I was just tryna keep it together
I was tryna make sense—sense of all this shit around me
I didn't know how to take it, how to perceive it, you know what I mean?
And then meanwhile I'm supposed to be going to school and getting good grades and shit
But I'm seeing like, domestic violence in my house
And just, so much going on
And I'm sure everybody was probably like, "Man, yo"
"Why little Bobby didn't come to school today?"
On the real, I was doin' anything to run away
And that's the same reason kids join gangs every day
'Cause they wanna be accepted, but at home they too neglected
Meanwhile, white America quick to call him a thug
But all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love
Tell him that he love him, that he need him
Promise he won't ever leave him
Never smoke crack, never lie, and won't never beat him
It feel like for my life I been needed a break
Looking at my family, I ain't wanna make the same mistake
And I know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin' great
Oh God, please
Can I have a conversation with a member of my family without it ending asking me for five G's?
To pay they bills or they lawyer fees (Huh)
I learned something, I ain't giving y'all a dime
I'll give you something worth more—that's my time
I ain't dropping stacks, I'm dropping knowledge
Unless it's for my nieces and nephews to go to college
And hit me on the phone, hit me up
Like, "Uncle Bob, where you at?
Yeah, I know your pockets fat but I don't give a fuck 'bout that
I'm glad we family" (Uh)
We a half-breed family, yeah, yeah, uh
Man, see, I remember when I was like fifteen years old
And my dad took me to the studio
I know this is random, I'm tryna take you guys through it, right?
And, I'll never forget it, I had like eight rhyme books
He'll tell you—he'll tell you, man
I just, I went through them motherfuckers
I was rapping for like fifteen minutes straight
And that was my first time, yo
I was like tenth grade, in the studio
And I knew that this was what I wanted to do
I knew it

I knew it ever since I first saw Kill Bill
I been flowin' like that blood, Uma Thurman spilled
None other than the RZA, yeah he did the soundtrack
And then I discovered Wu-Tang soon as I found that
And then Big L, Mos Def, and Nas, it wasn't no turning back
I couldn't change it if I tried, homie, how 'bout that?
See, I'm a student of the game, so simple and plain
But I'ma take it back to before I ever sat first class on a plane
I was in College Park, right?
Well I guess, technically, if you wanna go before that
I was uh, I was living in Germantown
Uh, nah, actually it was Montgomery Village
Back in Maryland, I was living in my sister's basement
And then some shit happened, you know, she kicked me out
It was Christmas, whatever, I love you Genie
Anyway, so shit happened, and then I just kept it pushing
You know, I was homeless for a little while, whatever, you know
I went, uh, I stayed at my—my mentor's house, Solomon
Uh, and then I stayed back at my—my godparents' house
Mary Jo and Bernie, I love y'all
Uh, Mary Jo, I'm sorry, back when I used to smoke
I would steal the shit out of your cigarettes
I love you, I'm sorry about that, but
You remember—always she would let me record
I'd always be recording in the attic or wherever I could, so
I love you—thank you for supporting me there
But then, she was like, "You gotta get the fuck outta here" too
After a while, she gave me some time
But like, I was twenty years old at this point
She was like, "Nah, you gotta get the fuck outta here and do something with your life"
And this was right around the time that I opened up my first show ever for Ghostface Killah man
In Gaithersburg, right in Old Town
The shit was insane, I'll never forget it
And that's where I met my boy Lenny, Big Lenbo, wassup!?
That's right, man, we just started kicking it and hanging
He lived in College Park, and before I knew it I was living—I was living with him in his basement
And this was right around the time I met 6ix
And 6ix was going to the University of Maryland at the time, which was right down the street
So I'd always go to their dorm room
I remember—there was nights I would just crash in the dorm when we was making beats
We was doing all types of shit man
When we first got out, we did the first Young Sinatra
And now we on the fourth Young Sinatra, motherfucker! That shit is crazy man
And I remember like, I used to steal quarters from Lenny just so I could go to the 7-11 to eat
And he was like, "You idiot, why are you stealing? Just ask me, bro" And I was supposed to get a job, I was—see, I was sleeping in, uh, his basement on the couch
Which is the—the, the cover to my first album, Under Pressure
Shout out Cathy, shout out the Rosado family, all my beautiful brown people!
We made it, it's crazy
But nah, nah, listen, I'm getting ahead of myself, I'm getting ahead of myself
So like, I was staying with him and I was supposed to get a job, right?
And he was like, "Yo, you gotta get a fucking job, bro"
Things were going so good with the music that we kinda stopped talking about it
It seemed like every week something new was happening
And I just sat him down one day and I was like, "Look bro, I—please, like, can you just give me one year, like just give me one year, man, let me put everything into this, and if I don't get it, fuck it, I'll just submit, and I'll just—I'll just blend into society."
And he was like, "Bro I'ma give you one year"
And for one year him, his family, all the homies, Benny, everybody man!
They took care of me, they put—he put clothes on my back, he put food in my stomach
You know, he helped me with microphones, and recording
And yo, almost a year to the fucking day bro, I signed to Def Jam
And my man, he was a land surveyor, out there like making sure all the buildings get built
Rain, snow, sleet, all that shit for twelve years, dawg!
And when I signed my deal I said, "Fuck that! Quit your job, we're moving to LA!"
This shit was crazy, so we get to LA
We're staying off Coldwater Canyon
Alta Mesa, in Studio City, man
And I'm going to the studio with No I.D. every day
And uhh, like, shit is crazy
That's the first time I met Cole, yo shout out Cole, that's my fucking boy
Big Sean, all these homies, man, that I met, it was crazy
Don Cannon, everybody
That's when I first met Kev
Bobby, my engineer—what up Bobby?
It was just like, life was insane
I dropped, uh, Young Sinatra: Undeniable, and that was crazy
That was insane, 'cause that was the first time

Me and my boys ever hit the road
On the real, you know we went from zero to overload
Performing in front of the fans, had they hands waving
This is all I ever wanted, this is all I'm craving
Me and my boy Chris shocked the game
Two visionaries on a mission, shit ain't been the same
Some ups and downs came around, had a lot of problems
But no matter what happen, you know we'd always solve 'em
Yeah, we'd always solve 'em, like

Man, it's kinda crazy thinking about it though
Like, so much has happened yo
And I mean shit, by the time y'all are hearing this, I'm 28
I'm 27 while I'm recording it
I mean, right now, literally, I'm working on Bobby Tarantino, Ultra 85, Young Sinatra IV
And a whole bunch of other shit, man this is crazy!
Acting, writing, like
I'm just—I'm just so, I can't believe I'm here, man
We grinded for so long, we worked for so long, yo
And motherfuckers, they hate you, man
They try to make me feel bad about how I look, how I speak
How I rap, how I act, my race, my everything
They just—they, they fucking hate you man
They'll hate you when you're in this position
But you can't let 'em—you can't let 'em, you can't let that shit get to you man
Continue to persevere, continue to be the best you you can be 'Cause I'm here right now man, best friends
I got everything I could ever want man
Even though you always want more deep down
And you got goals deep down, that's great man, but fuck that shit
I'm so happy, I'm so blessed, man
So if you're listening to this right now
No matter how old you are, how young you are
Whether you on the school bus headed to get your education
Or you driving home from work pissed off at your boss
Just, man, just please do what you love in life
So many people, they always say, how, "Oh, you know, I would do this—but," or "I can't, because"
And you already fucking lost, they lost
And I feel bad for that person 'cause that person will never make it "I would, but I don't have the money," "I would, but I don't have the time"
Fuck that, you gotta do it man
You gotta do what makes you happy
You have to live selfishly in that aspect
Stop worrying about others, stop freaking out
Just focus on yourself, man, and your own happiness
That's the realest thing
And that's all I can tell you, because
You can't help anybody else until you can help yourself, you know what I'm saying?
So please, put the—put the mask on first, like they say on the airplane, cuz
Put your—put your own motherfucking mask on
And go do it man
Go do it, just live your life

I love y'all, thank you so much for tuning in
Uh, I hope you've enjoyed this Young Sinatra experience, I know I have
Uh, this is prolly gon' be the last one though
Uh, this gon' be the last one for sure
I'm coming back with some fun, but, I don't know
I love you guys! Ultra 85's gonna be crazy! I mean, crazy! Bobby Tarantino's that trap shit, woo!
We took 'em back with this boom bap
Now we, we finna head to the future
We ain't scared, we makin' music for everybody, you know what I mean?
I love y'all—look at that Murrland accent coming out
I don't know why, every time I get on the mic that Murrland accent
"Go ahead 'cuh," "jah like" all day, boy, you sound like Wale, back of your neck, haha
I love y'all so much
RattPack
Yeah, yeah

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu-Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!

Ayo, ayo, Wu-Tang forever, who rhyme better?
We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever
R.I.P. O.D.B, comin' through like Killa Bee
Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93
You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered
Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered
Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender
My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)
Yeah, we live and thorough
Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem
All the way to Maryland, yeah, we comin' for all 'em
Bobby Tarantino to the Digital
My shit is pivotal, smokin' chronic, no medicinal
Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?
The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone
You might also like
Ay-yo, Logic, what up?
We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style

Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more cake
Intelligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate, tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronunciate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Team makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
57 MB, yo, metallic green, seats is piped off
Seize 'em old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wil’ out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statement—stop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'
The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers, and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs, puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like The Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
III-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy, hit y'all with that "Okie-dokie"
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddamnit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one?
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

Old school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lack the principles
Got more clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun, Smokey Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
Witty unpredictable torture over your physical
Struggle bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands off I'm digital
Me and my Ladybug, back when the planet was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on
It's only Logic, we got 'em mobbin' in the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

Survival of the fittest be cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin' that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What, what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No. 9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'?
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me
Perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in sea salt
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes is two and the same
Nigga get cooked on a open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school Wu beat
This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these Wu-Tang minerals

G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Toad style is mentally strong, so strengthen your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, Jamel Irief
Wise chief, Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning Regardless, I speak logic—clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)
W.T.C., ah-ha
The faculty
Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move
Nobody slide, nobody get hurt

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu tang style
I'd like to try your Wu tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me?64Embed

This concludes the program—

Damn man, we been walking forever...

Well, Thalia's tracking system says we'll be there in just over an hour...

Shit, at least we got good walking music—or is that it?

No man, I'm queueing up the fourth album now—his final one...

Shout-out my boy Henry right here in the studio
Aye, yeah—
Check, check, mic check, one, two
Alright this is classic shit, yeah

I coulda never imagine that this shit here could happen
Went from the basement to thirty million just off of rappin'
Young Sinatra, that boy that brought you so many classics
Ain't never comin' with nothin' less than the illest tactics
Thought the series was over, but we just gettin' started
I won't ever leave this rap shit, no I can't depart it
From the trap to the boom bap
To Young Sinatra to Tarantino
We know he do that
Bitch, I got the flame, who dat?
I'm the new Kanye when they was like "Who Kanye?"
I got that fire in my soul to make these classics, ayy
I decided to write this letter on a private jet
'Cause in many ways it still feel like I ain't made it yet
For every goal I attain, I set like ten more
But I had to take a break to write you, that's for sure
Take a moment and celebrate how we all alive
Had to write this letter here over a Nujabes vibe
Fuck that rapper shit, fuck a punchline
This for every single fan that know every single line
So I'm saying thank you for loving me
For setting me free and letting me be me
Thank you, thank you
For letting me speak my mind
And putting it all on the line
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
And never staying the same
And having the courage to change
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
For never staying the same
And having the courage to change
Thank you, thank you
For letting me speak my mind
And putting it all on the line
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
For never staying the same
And having the courage to change
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
For never staying the same
And having the courage to change

Yeah
We gon' let this shit rock
Hey
That's the "Cole hey" from back in the day
Hey, yeah

Just a youngin' with a dream
Tryna get this money, yeah, I'm tryin' get this cream
Not a lot know what I mean, for this rap shit I'm a fiend
Not one to talk about poppin' pills and sippin' lean
Just a passion for pussy, I'm tryin' to get up in the spleen
This is my mentality rappin' at nineteen
Back in Maryland just tryin' to break out on the scene
Buyin' fake chains at the mall so girls be like "Ooh, he clean"
Daydreams that my life is like a movie scene
Sippin' liquor, puffin' green, so obscene
Ride around the city with my homies in a gat
We was lookin' for trouble, now where's it at?
Paint the picture like Picasso, matter fact like Sam Spratt
Even younger I was trippin' skippin' school writin' raps
Never on the road but on the roll like them craps
Check the facts
Endless rhyme books in my backpack
Like that, uh
I guess I acted out from lack of a father figure
Go figure, performin' at open mics wishin' I could go bigger
I was never in it for the money like a gold digger
Every time my daddy call me he be like, "Ayo nigga, where the money at?"
Yeah, that's what he'd say, "Little boy, you know you know I saw you on a PJ
When you gon' fly me out, when you gon' smoke me out?"
Always throw demands out, motherfuck a handout
All I ever wanted was a daddy
But that man priority was huggin' with a fatty
But I'm glad he did 'cause it made me who I am
Now I'm the man that I always wish he woulda been
And never started smokin' crack; imagine just what could have been, damn
Always felt like somethin' it was missin'
Wish we could have played catch, had talks, and went fishin'
But had no one there to listen
Now it feel like my life mission is to be the best dad when the time come
For my daughter and my son when the time come
Teach 'em 'bout they heritage and where they come from
Teach 'em 'bout they family history and then some

Come on, come on Bobby, you ain't shit though
Why your personality be split though?
One minute it's PLP, the next that shit be slit throats
Devil and an angel on my shoulder, that's my conscious
Greatest rapper alive but never actin' Pontius
Keep yourself in check like a dollar amount
You ain't better than nobody based on your dollar amount
Yeah, you've grown accustomed to the lifestyle but you never bougie
Nah, you never brand new, no it's never who's he
See, I hate when I get recognized
And while the fan is hypnotized
I'm approached by random guys who feel the need to emphasize
"I don't know who you are"
I reply "I'm a gentleman and a fuckin' rap star"
Put your lighters in the sky if you got 'em
This for anybody that feel like they at the bottom
Nobody to tell 'em they special, you know I got 'em
Nobody there to tell them they love them, well I got 'em
Uh, no matter where you go you gotta persevere
Ain't no fuckin' around, ain't no makin' a sound, no you just gotta murder the fear
Yeah I've been thinkin' about it, been tryna get out of it
Fuck what I'm thinkin', it's time to break out of it
Findin' myself in the thick and the debt of it
Had a bit and I knew wanted to murder the son
And I'm ready to get it, motherfuck a critic, I'm livin' my life and
I've been on the grind tryin' find my way (Ayo, ayo ayy) (Uh, yeah)
People come and go but I'ma be the one to stay (Ayo, ayo ayy) (Yeah)

It's that Young Sinatra IV shit right here
(Rest in peace Mac Miller)
It's been like 10 years
Here we go (Yeah)

Visualizin' and realizin' my life is fuckin' crazy
Poppin' like JAY-Z, Dirty Dancin' on the game like Swayze
I'm one of the illest and bitch
I've been ready to kill it, it's so amazing
Bitch, I've been blazin', I'm talkin' grass, I ain't talkin' grazing
They just hit the tape while I sip scotch
Let the haters kick rocks, my shit is tip-top
I never flip-flop, why? 'Cause my soul too strong
Did this all on my own, 'cause waiting took too long
The flow sophisticated
All these youngins do is whine like they inebriated
I'm hated, but yeah, that's how you know I made it
I'm one of the illest, I'm one of the realest, I'm ready to kill this
The people, they feel us, me and my team made millions
But you know we still us
That's why they wanna kill us, that's why they wanna kill us
RattPack, real all the time, we never phony
I'm single-handedly running the game like a Sony
While the rest of these rappers is acting
Pass 'em the Tony, pass 'em the Oscar
From the new school rappers, yeah I'm the illest on the roster
Smoke like a rasta
Black and white like Bob Marley, yeah, like Bob Marley
These racist motherfuckers hate that last line
Probably haters on the internet ain't got nothing to bargain
Said I'd never make it, bitch, I just sold out the Garden

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch
Like Sinatra, screamin', "Motherfuck the cops"

They say they want the old Logic, the one that flow like a faucet I'm still the same me, they just don't believe it like they agnostic
If I spit over the boom-bap, then they perceive it as nostalgic
But the truth is, my subject matter has been the same
And my production selection is still flame
But they love you on the come up 'cause you ain't tainted by fame And you still they little secret
That's the type of bullshit that they frequent
From 19, to 2019, been murderin' this shit for a decade
From the boom-bap to the trap, I let my shits cascade (Listen, yeah, yeah)
So what's the dealy? Pass the Phillie, get silly, that's on the really
We snappin' like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, I'm talkin' achilles
Try to play me like I ain't me, but I provided all the deets'
Who you know worth 50 million, still rappin on break beats?
From Nasty Nas, Big-L, Tribe, The Roots, and many more
Of course we could never forget Biggie and young Shakur
Fuck the police, no we ain't fuckin' with Al Pastor
I'm the bastard that mastered the flow, I said it once before fa' sho'
While 6ix produce the kicks from the soul, you already know
Fuck these youngins talking outta they ass with no class
I'm here to school 'em
This that real shit, I'm never foolin'
I'm killin' these squares, we call it a massacre
I got the bread, but these fuckers need the dough like a baker
The legends above me love me like the RZA, like Nas, like Jay 'Cause I mastered the flow from back in the day
Respected by my peers from Drizzy to Cole to Kenny
Thank you for the love and inspiration plenty
Yeah, I'm loved by many, and only hated by a little
Now I think it's time to switch to lyricism, peep the riddle
I was born in mint condition, I'm everybody's life's mission
All right, listen, put me 'round your neck and I might glisten
The ultimate connect, I'll get you anything you need
From good credit to good weed
I can make any woman succeed
Control you with a heart of greed
Along with anybody that's in need, I'll make 'em beg and plead
I'm in the pocket of mafia crime lords and presidents
Without me, they'll evict you from your residence
Hov wrote about me on "Dead Presidents," never irrelevant
Not a soul on earth would love me if I weren't me
No matter what year I'm in, I'm current, see?
People that have me, yeah, they power's so immense
But people without me, make no sense, god damn
Yeah, the world revolve around me, the law evolve around me
The shit people do to get a piece of me astound me
Blood stains my face when drug deals go wrong
I'm given to the greatest athletes when they go long
You could put me in check
But I'm still laughing all the way to the bank
I'm the reason that the Titanic sank
I'm always there for you, yeah, when it comes down to the wire And some people even tuck me away 'til they retire
I usually come around on the first and fifteenth
If you owe me to somebody then they'll leave you beneath
People go crazy when they feel me
In the Middle East they drill me
If you let your guard down, then some people'll steal me
I knew these two dudes that's always been homies since fifth grade
Always schemin' on the block, selling crack to get paid
Now they never graduated, thought that shit a charade
Only thing on they mind that wasn't me was get laid
Then one day, they had a falling out on the block
See, one thought the other one had been stealing his rock
'Cause he coulda sworn he had more weight in his stock
Pulled out the Glock and his homie yelled, "Stop!"
But before he had the chance to pull the trigger
Oh shit here come the cops
They saw the gun and blew them both away
Now there's two more kids dead in the street all before twenty Over me, the most important thing to man: money
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch
Like Sinatra, screamin', "Motherfuck the cops"

We just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kids


It's a, it’s a vibe (Alta Mesa!)
All my homies we on the-we on the studio tour bus right now
This is Stoney Bob live in a room from
Wherever the fuck we are today on tour
I've uh, I've already rolled about four blunts
It’s 3:38 PM
I'm going off, here we go

What up? What's good? I'm running through your hood
I'm feeling like I should, I wish a motherfucker would
Bobby be my name, I'm 'bout to run a train
On this girl with all my boys and her name is Mary Jane
Cause I burn (big dope!) with my dogs
Joe Clay rolled a blunt so big that shit look like a log
In my dressing room but I can't see through all the fog
6ix supply the kicks like karate
I was fighting with the idea of smokin’ again and now I got my green belt
And that’s the longest line without a rhyme
But the punch before the line about the line was so divine
For shizzle my nizzle, I feel like D-O-double Gizzle on this grizzle, my nizzle
Put the greenery on the grill and let it sizzle, my nizzle
It don't matter the season Bobby let it burn when it drizzle
And boy I’m liable to put my right hand on the Bible
And tell the world that me and Berner got a strain of the cookie
That shit is so simply just undeniable
It'll make your world shatter like glass and I ain't talkin' ’bout them dabs

You make me feel so amazing

Mary Jane, I never been the same since our lips locked
The only lady that never gets pissed off
And if there's one thing I know
It's how to roll a J and let it burn real slow
For those who don't know, I go by Slaydro, ready, set, go
I take one to the dome like Pablo Esco
Germinate the seed, then just let it grow
Then harvest like a pro
Dodging cops just to cop digits
Made the packs move and flip like, they was gymnasts
Got me seeing trick green night vision
All truth, no fiction
Always fried like Popeye's Chicken
Hella mother- hella motherfucker
So you know I'm always know I'm always running late
Unless that currency at stake
In this Ruth Chris because I'm ruthless
Forty in the-forty in the trunk gone in 20 minutes
That's 80K for the ticket, every-everybody fucking with it
Smoking the container bet I'm always gon' retain it
Lit
You make me feel so amazing
I wanna ride with you, I wanna smoke with you
I'm coming to get you, girl, you know I gotta hit you like
You make me feel so amazing
I wanna ride with you, I wanna smoke with you
I'm coming to get you, girl, you know I gotta hit you like

It ain't nothing, joint stuffing, rolling blunts and
Big buds for breakfast crumble like a muffin
No discussion, smoking big dope with the fam
Stoney on the bus, used to hot box a van
In and out the cities, group the women and the weed
All these male groupies step unless you got tree
Better roll it and smoke it to the last drop
That cash crop, stay up in the hash spot
Daily session, that Buddha blessing, never stressing
Laid back but I keep the whistle like I'm reffing
That's some rap nigga shit, we Hugh Heffin'
Smoke out the grotto
Feeling like Pablo, saucing like tomato
Pull them numbers like lotto

You make me feel so amazing
I wanna ride with you, I wanna smoke with you
I'm coming to get you, girl, you know I gotta hit you like
You make me feel so amazing
I wanna ride with you, I wanna smoke with you

You
You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you
How do you want to be remembered?
Just being rich?
Yeah, yeah

Uh
Visions of seeing myself as someone different
Reality got me feeling indifferent
I'm lifting this weight off my shoulder
But hold up, older I get
I reload the clip and sip on something
I feel good for nothing
All my glory days behind me or beyond me
I’m folding like origami
My tables turning like interior decorators
Levels like elevators
These haters got me questioning my judgement
Tried by a jury of my peers, but where the judge went?
What will my legacy be?
Who will my enemy be?
In due time as I write this rhyme
I don't know
Flash before my eyes
Yeah, uh
You might also like
And on my deathbed what will I say as I pray?
And reminisce of another day, uh
I came from nothing, a child born in poverty
Went to college to gain knowledge
So they would acknowledge me
Honestly, I got a good job
I found a woman, made her my wife
But spent more time at work
So we could have a stable life
And when my son was born
I had to work even harder
Before I knew it, now my wife was giving birth to my daughter
Went from 40 hours a week to 80
Ain't nobody gon’ pay me but myself
Sacrifice my time and my health, for wealth
I missed a birthday, miss an anniversary
There's lots of people in this world that's worse than me
I wasn't there for my son's first words
But he ain't grow up in the hood like me, we in the burbs
Sacrifice a couple years, he could have all the money when I'm gone
What a fool I was
I missed his graduation, I missed her wedding day
I didn't even get to give my little girl away
But I paid for the honeymoon, yeah, I paid for the honeymoon
I’m not there right now but I will be later
I’m working on something that's greater
That’s my legacy
Uh, I'm gon' be remembered by generations to come
Damn, you dumb
You won't be remembered by your son
Uh, yeah
To be remembered by generations to come
You a fool
You won’t be remembered by your son
"Nonsense, nonsense!"
I said to the man with no money, nonsense, uh, uh
Step back who running from me I don't know my own identity
I look in the mi-look in the mi-the mirror, I ain't clearer
I'm just trying to be free— who is that? It surely ain't me
As I lay on my deathbed, I realized I was wrong
I have been the richest man in the world all along
A beautiful family that all I did was ignore
For financial stability and fear of being poor
'Cause when I was a child, knew I always wanted more
When I was a child, knew I always wanted more, more, more
And now I got it, uh
And now I'm laying in this bed; cancer spreading through my lungs
Looking at my family like "Damn, y'all were the ones"
I sacrificed my life for 100's, 50's, 20's, 10's, 5's, and 1's
So dumb, I'd give it all if I could
Do it for my heart again, not my wallet
I hate to recall it but it's gone now—legacy is gone now
Sacrifice my health for wealth, no, it wasn't worth it
But as I take my last breath, I know that I deserved it

Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy
The legacy you gon' leave behind you forever is the blood in your veins
Wake up, Daddy, now is the time for change
And as your child I'm telling you I don't give a damn if we living on change, Daddy
Just as long as we livin'
Just as long as we livin', Daddy
I just want to be happy, I don't give a damn if we live in a shoebox
Now my mama gon' tell you what you got
I love you, I love you, I love you, I want you, I need you, I crave you
Why you throw away this pussy that I gave you?
Why you fucking 'round behind my back
While I'm home raising my children?
Feel like a single mother even though a ring up on it
Supposed to be husband and wife, you more like my opponent
Finger fucking myself 'cause fuck infidelity
I'd rather look in the mirror be happy who I see
Sometimes I want to take my babies and go to my mama crib
Can I live?
Can I have a life away from my life?
Be the woman that I would have been if I wasn't your wife?
You know I love 'em—but if that test wasn't positive
I woulda had a lot to give
Sometimes I want to divorce your ass and take half
Motherfucker
But I stay 'cause I love these children
And I love you deep down, that's why I stick around, but
You never there
'Cause you just want to be the best
You just want to make this money, uh
Come get this pussy, motherfucker
Come get this pussy and love your children
Fuck your legacy
Fuck it

Float in the abyss of nothingness
My consciousness remembers a life before it hits black
I wish that I could get back and then I realize that all this shit is just a daydream
And there's only like four of us on the tour bus
And I'm in the back, how 'bout that?
Thinkin' 'bout my legacy
And how we as human beings sacrifice health for money
Ain't it funny?
'Cause in the end, we spend all our money on repairing our body and mind
When we really should have just spent time
Fuck a legacy
I'ma go live my life

They never seem to know that I am a master (A master at work)
Bitch I'm all up in it, come and get it, you could never get rid of it
Every bit of it in this motherfucker
Like I'm in the middle of little Italy, and all this shit was never given to me
That's just a fallacy told by the enemy tryna get ahead of me
They dead to me, everybody dead to me
Everybody know that Bobby will body anybody
Like Gotti the Gambino, from Maryland to Reno
We know Tarantino a killer but the Young Sinatra
Got you by the neck and the spirit the second they hear it

Everybody talk about my race on socials

I only identify as bi-coastal
I don't live life like most do (Like most)
Never did the shit I was supposed to

Yeah, my hairline faded but my bank account'll roast you

You already know what that is
Young Sinatra, icons inspire icons
Gold chains wrapped around my neck like pythons
The drip way, yeah

Yeah! Greatest alive, I'm the greatest alive
I'm the greatest at being me, ain't nobody seeing me
So, check it like CMB, that's word to the DMV
I'm straight from the basement, I made it like a villain, I'm hated
Word to Jermaine, this shit just ain't been the same
Never simple and plain like a bullet to the brain
I'm blowing minds, yeah, I gotta kick shit with this rhyme
Second I spit it, so divine, that's word to your mom
Sweeping these rappers up like it's a chore, who want more?
I'll leave anybody two times four
Dropping pounds in London like I lost weight
My mindstate is like a freight when I rhyme, check the state of mind
Yeah, my train of thought is never off the track
When I drive it, so stop it I'm killin' 'em like a virus
After they dead I'm still in 'em, who feelin' 'em, everybody now
It's never nothin' like the first time, nothin' like your first rhyme Nothin' like getting that nut in for the first time
That's the type of shit they never tell you now
Bitches come and go, I know, I know, you can't fuck with this flow
Bobby Tarantino, get the C note, oh yeah, there he go
Tell me they love it, they want it, they need it
I never been defeated, no, never given up
Do what I do, how I do gotta live it up
This shit right here on the real, I can't get enough
God damn, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Went from gettin' close to the gang
To sipping champagne on a plane
Do what you love in life and never second guess it
Even when haters protest it now
You ever wonder what it means to
You ever wonder what it, uh
You ever wonder what it means to finally live in your dreams?
Then realize that everything, it just ain't what it seems?
Uh, yeah, I thought I wanted to be the greatest alive
Until I realized that being the greatest is just a lie
Like the opening words in this verse
That as soon as they disperse, make other rappers converse
And plot to put in you a hearse, real talk, fuck rap
I hate and I love it 'cause it's so negative
Everybody selfish, nobody wanna give
A helping hand to the next man, well, fuck you then
Fuck your ethnicity, we all one
'Cause when my last album dropped, you know we all won
Yeah, that shit went number one, so everybody won
I said that shit went number one, so everybody won (Yeah)52Embed
Uh, suddenly I'm in the whip, with the gat, full clip
Out the blue, like a crip, doin' 90 on the backroad
Outta nowhere my girl hit me on the bat phone
I could hear it in her voice, know she just wasn't alone
Then a voice I didn't recognize
Said "If you wanna' see your wife alive, bring a million in cash and she's gonna survive"
Look at the clock, pitch black, it's 11:05
Hung up the phone, you know I put that shit in hyper-drive
Then I call my homie 6ix to tell him I'ma need his help
I'ma be outside in five, get the gat under ya belt
Then I felt the sweat from my palm on the steering wheel
I tried to shake it, man, I can't believe this shit is real
Heart pumping on the 101, this shit right here ain't no fun
Live and die by the gun, get you some
Yeah, I pull up to the crib, pick up 6ix, now we out this bitch
Only thing that's on my mind is "Put this fucker in a ditch"
Soon as I get there, boy, I'm lightin' up that ass
I'ma fill him with lead and they never finna count the cash
'Til I look up at the dash and realize I'm out of gas
So I stopped at the station, piss like probation
Tell my boy to fill up as I head inside to pay
Open the door and see a white guy at the counter named Clay
Pull out a 50 and told him to hurry
He movin' slow like he ain't got a worry in the world
And a attitude; maybe I was actin' rude
Hold up, if the person you love was kidnapped, what would you do?
He saw my gat in my jacket and froze
I told him I ain't want no problem but he chose
To reach for the shotty anyway, so I blew him away
Just tryna get some gas, now his brain's blast (uh)
Frozen, thinkin' 'bout what just happened, now it's in the past
Jump in the whip 0 to 60, yeah, we out fast
See that red and blue flash, damn, the cops is on my ass (*Sirens*)
Hear them sirens, flashing lights in my rear view
This shit like a movie in a theater near you
120 now, I feel like OJ
(The cops are gonna get us)
No they won't, everything will be okay
Swerve left, swerve right, now they almost out of sight
Finna pull under the bridge, they won't spot me here at night
Slow it down, play it cool, mama, she ain't raised no fool
Sit back, breathe slow, (Holy shit!), there they go
Man they found us, I don't know how but they came around us
Fuck the police, no, they never do astound us
In the back of my mind, I know I gotta get the cash
It's in my secret stash, wish I had another path
Out the window I can hear the bullets blast, wish I had a mask (*Gunshots*)
Make it to the crib, that's my only task
Adrenaline in my body, could take on anybody
Coming down to the wire, they blew my tire then we flip
You might also like
*Car crash*
Freeze you motherfucker! (*Gunshots*)
6ix, come on get up!
I'm shot, I'm shot! What? I'm shot! (*Gunshots*)
Get the fuck on the ground!
Aww, fuck, fuck!
They got me!

He bleedin' slow, blood dripping from his torso
Will he ever get to see his son grow?
What's the picture they gon' paint after he go?
Last song he ever sung when the bullet hit his lung
Man, I shoulda never called, he'd be alive if he ain't come
All he tried to do was help save my wife
Wish I could've saved his life, I wish I could take it back
Now my best friend's life curtain call, fade to black
It just ain't no turning back, pulled out the gat
And put a bullet through the man in blue and it came out his back
Jump in the whip, no looking back
First time in the front seat of that white and black
Side streets through the city, ain't nobody fucking with me
Yeah, you know I had to duck 'em all, screamin' "Motherfuck the law"
Next thing I saw was a block from my crib
Thinkin' 'bout my shorty, she my rib
Pull up in the driveway
No cops in sight but just might somehow pull up my way
Open the stash, get the cash, now I'm back out
So I put the Audi in reverse and then I back out
Look at the addy in the text with my girl whereabouts
Five minutes later, now I'm creeping in a warehouse
Lot of goons, lot of guns, now I'm shooting just for fun
I don't give a fuck where they come from, I'm killing everyone
Finally make it to the back, all alone, pitch black
Hear a sound, what was that? Think it came from over there
Lights on, now I see my wife, she's tied up to a chair
With a gun to her head and a man gripping her hair
All I did was stop and stare, he took the gag out of her mouth
And she started calling my name (Bobby!) but didn't seem to be in pain
Really shaken up (Bobby!), I felt like I was waking up
So I shot him quick in the neck and he hit the floor (Bobby)
Before I untied her, I shot him four more times
Put a bullet in his spine, was he dead? (Bobby!) Let's see (Bobby!)
Staring at the man, gun in his hand, it couldn't be (Bobby!)
The man who kidnapped my wife (Bobby!) was me (Bobby!)
Bobby!
What? What—what?
Man, get your ass up nigga, we at the studio!
Say what?
Damn, man. C'mon, hurry up, man! What's wrong with you?
Wake up, here. Come on
Wait, we're at the studio right now? We're here already?

Bobby Boy be quick to leave a bad bitch cut off
Like when you in the studio and the vocal get cut...

Five hundred thousand for a one-off
Hit the stage, I rage, and then I run off (Uh)
It don't matter where we at, it's poppin' like a gun off (Uh)
Bumping N.W.A. on the 101-uh (Uh, woo, uh, uh)

A little crazy, but tell me, what genius ain't a little nutty?
Everybody be like that sometimes
You can hear it in me in some rhymes
I ain't bipolar, Kanye make me wish I was
'Cause that level of genius the meanest
Nobody fuckin' around with that flow
When I spit it, you know it's the cleanest, uh
All my haters can suck my penis
Went from five hundred a show to sellin' out arenas
From SOB's in NYC
To smokin' trees at the motherfuckin' Garden
Pardon my ego, uh
Maybe it's the weed smoke
Maybe it's the beat though
If I draw it in the sand
Better not cross the line like a free throw, uh

Oh baby

I've been down for the cause for a minute now
Be lying if I said I didn't want to hit it now
On a hunnid, that thought been running through my mind
'Cause baby girl, you're just too fine
But first, I want to make you mine
Study you like constellations, I wonder what make you shine
On that 9-to-5 grind, but girl, you got bigger dreams
If there's no one there to tell you you're destined for bigger things
I'll be the one to let you know you're brighter than the sun
More beautiful than any girl I've seen where I'm from
By any girl ever, anywhere I might have gone
I only have eyes for you, that's why I wrote this song
Life's changing fast, I feel like I don't have long
To tell you anything you want, girl, you can do it
And I'ma be there when you make it, smiling like I knew it
Every man you gave your heart before me, yeah, they blew it
I just want the chance to show you how I do it

Oh baby

I've given my heart away just to have it beaten up
That's a heart attack, now my shit don't beat enough
But ever since the day we met, girl, I could read your bluff
If I wrote you letters every day, would you read the stuff?
Girl, if I gave you my everything, would it be enough?
The road is hard, and my current situation is rough
They say there's plenty more fish in the sea
But you're the only one God made just for me
Sometimes I wonder if you know I exist
Or if I told you how I felt, would you be like
"Hold up, who the fuck is this?"
Sometimes it feel like I'm inside a love movie
But I'm the extra in the background, truly
Wishing that he had the leading lady
But I guess it wasn't written for me, maybe
Unless I flip the script and just ignore the words read
Sweep you off your feet with the all the things I never said
'Cause every man you gave your heart before me, they blew it
I just wish I had the chance to show you how I do it
Every man before me, man, they blew it
I just wish I could show you, I'd be like

Mama, look at me now (Get shot)
Mama, look at me now

I got the juice, coming for you and I'm bringing the noose
Leaving 'em hanging, my shit banging
Second that I came in the game, I'm aiming
Hold up, wait a minute, break it down for the laymen
(Do-do-do-do-do-do)
I'm killin' everybody, I'm the MC that the MCs study
Look up to me, little buddy (Do it like me, little buddy)
Save yo money, don't think about a Beamer
'Til ya sellin' out arenas, and you're ballin' like a
Ballin'-ballin'-ballin'-ballin'-
Everybody wonder what it be like
Now it what it seem like, now it what it dream like
Go like green light, somethin' what a fiend like
Do it for the drug and we do it for the love
And we do it for the high that we get, when we ride in the whip
And somebody pull up on you and they vibe-vibe-vibing your shit

Mama (Yeah, uh), look at me now

But the truth is realer than the fake shit
Know they shoot to kill us, and produce the triggers
I go two gorillas on some BAPE shit
Look at all the fame and the fortune, the pain and extortion
The Range and the Porsches, the same, but it's gorgeous
Mama called me, said your name on the Forbes list
Thank God your daddy never paid for abortion
But sharing clothes, good times, I'ma cherish those
Now I'm stuck doing Paris shows
Embarrass hoes on carousels, I'm careless though
I bear the toe, don't tear your soul (My god)

Mama, look at me now

Ayy, I'm the one that's where you're from
They get it done, I'm killing them without a gun
Take it in, rake it in like a leaf from a money tree
Keep it goin', keep it goin', get the money, get the money
When it's sunny, 'cause when them clouds come
I can promise it's depression
That's when you learn your lesson
Thought you was cut out for this, your profession
Go be the best and all of that, nah fuck all of that
No one call him back, yeah, no falling back
Breaking down on stage, break it down the page
Breaking down your age
Like, like now, all you do is compare, compare, compare Comparing yourself to the world
And you losing yourself to the world
And you're losing yourself to your money, your fame, and your fans
You have bigger plans, you is in demand, they don't give a (Damn)
Spend all your money on bullshit and drama
Had zeros and zeros, and commas on commas
On commas, on commas, on commas (On commas)
Mama, look at me now (Me now)


Ayy, ayy, bitch, get the fuck off my dick
Everybody ready, I'ma talk my shit

Believed in myself when nobody else knew it
Goddamn, I been through it

You ain't got class, bitch you been truant
I am the truest, no need to ask
Back it up, girl, now back that ass

And all of the bitches say, "Bobby delicious"
To say I love bitches, completely fictitious

'Cause I, I respect women
But let's be real, man, there's some bad bitches out there

Man, I'm just playing
Chiefin' the reefer, don't know what I'm saying

Shoutout that boy Gambino, shoutout that boy K. Dot
Shoutout that boy young Drizzy, all y'all been doin' a lot
Why the rap game so scared to show love?
I don't know but I am not
That shit right there a Black Thought
Now bring it back to the roots

Yes, I got love for the game
Don't do this shit for the fame

Don't care what set you claim
Shoutout that boy YG, Nat King Cole and JID

Yeah

I can't get no better, can’t get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gon’ give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I’m fallin’
The world think I'm ballin’ and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who I’m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, "Fuck 'em all"?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint

Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause "you'll never be Kenny"
"You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole"
"You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old," yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love your—'member, love yourself

Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame

From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T

Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe

Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal

Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it

The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it

You just mad you ain't as big as I am
Real MC, your shit Sam-I-Am
Been a while, can I get a "God damn"?
I am the best in my field like a slave
Who said fuck emancipation, burned the plantation
Facing death, and then put the master in his grave

All these comments got me lost in my mind
All these thoughts that I'm having are not mine
I always post that I'm having a good time
So my life looks perfect online
She say she never done some shit like this before
Suck my dick until I nut and then I go
I want a good girl but I always fuck with hoes
I love drugs, I pop pills, I do blow, blow, blow
I think this girl at the club wants to fuck me
And I really think her boyfriend wants to fuck me up
You're the reason that I'm up all night
You're the reason that I get no sleep
You say my music ain't shit when I creep
Say I should empty the whole bottle in my mouth like Peep
And overdose, immortalize myself
While the media use my death, monetize they wealth
RIP Lil Peep, let that young man sleep
Let that young man death teach
The youth, the streets
To beat addiction
Yeah, that's my diction
Moment of silence
I don't do the Breakfast Club 'cause Charlamagne is shameless
That's the only one I leave out when I run my bases
Do your research 'fore you call somebody homophobic
You make a living off of controversy and you know it
I ain't that type of artist, respect my name and we can talk about it
I'd suck a dick just to prove it ain't that way (Nigga, what?)
Ninety-nine percent don't listen what I say (You gay)
Quote that line but leave out all the mental health
Slap a bitch in the face then I count my wealth
That's the shit they want, yeah, that's the shit they need
That's the shit make people click
That's the shit that make me sick, so

Ill as it is divine

Just to see what we can snatch from up inside
'Til the flashin' lights come 'round that corner then we run and hide
Prayin' to God up in Heaven, eleven at night and I got no alibi
My damn, dip to Stewart Town
Best not come 'round these parts if you new in town
Wonder what my homies from back in the day livin' at, are doin' now
Running with my sister Jeannie, schooling me like Mr. Feeny
This is the first time I heard a gunshot on the block
Growing pains (Three), this the type of shit don't never stop
Here come the cops
Shooting up the hood like Black Ops
'Cause trigger-happy police tend to trigger happy people
And some people who believe we not equal shoot up the steeple
My God, if you exist then why do you make life so hard?
If you exist the way you think is avant-garde
If you exist you got a funny way of showing it
What happens in the afterlife?
These people think they knowin' shit
And on that note, I keep it G
Like track four, "Kick in the Door" by Notorious B.I.G. 
Don't believe me, look that shit up, I promise you'll find the key
To that punchline, feelin' just fine
Let the abyss of my mind, my mind consume
Snap my fingers like Thanos and Bobby Boy bringin' the doom
'Cause I'm 6:30, killin' shit, hands down and dirty
That white boy can't rap, he talk good and act nerdy
I just texted Erykah Badu
To let her know what I'm gon' do
Sample "Dreamflower" by Tarika Blue
That's cool with you?
Yeah, that's fine, baby, all gravy
Long as you know you my baby
And I beat yo' daddy like if he ever cheat on me
I mean she don't own the sample but she might as well
'Cause her and Dilla paved the way for all I got, and, well
I'ma show my gratitude, no attitude, no auto-tune like T-Pain
Doin' Unplugged, I'm unplugged, like Trinity
Wonder how the people gonna remember me, goddamn
Switch up the plan
We all say it, we all claim it but it's no use
The greatest rapper alive is probably stacking produce
Introduce you to my train of thought
Snapping on a track like the illest conductor
With no contradiction
I brought my heart to the table
Fact and never fiction, fuck a fable
Ready and willing you better believe I'm able to spit
Power through these lines faster than fiber-optic cable, I'm gone

Work so fucking much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (I'm lovin' it!)
People calling me, askin' me for money, man (Uh)
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone (Yeah)

Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothin' at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card

God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm livin' divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wonderin', "How so?"
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is yo' sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
Uh, I’m sorry for callin' and bawlin', I’m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*

Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

Livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Wakin' up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you it’s a wrap
Finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop
‘Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches
And the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

Hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it I'ma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about what I pray about
Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
 — Get down or lay down
Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given
Anybody that’s ridin' with me, I’m ridin' with 'em
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em
And hit 'em with the venom
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related654Embed
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back
Cause I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

So what now? (So what now?)
Let's get down—let's get drowned, on this vision
My division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'ma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say "what's your motivation?"
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy, fuck a vacation
We do this for love, not no validation

I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want it—but fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me

It's the type of shit that they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and B-I-G
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with JAY
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant to me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again cause I love this shit
Write it down and they publish it
I went 5 years without a publicist
'Cause the word of mouth, they in love with this
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming
Went away a while but I've been fiending
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal
Been at it way before the deal
Now the  music got mass appeal
My main girl got ass appeal
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing
Little fish, that went mainstream
Now I'm big as fuck
My whole city, they know what's up
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit
I don't give a fuck
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt
If I'm talking business, I might erupt
If you're at the show, put your lighter up
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it
Outsiders, I could do without it
I crept in, got slept on
Sold out shows, no one knew about it
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it

Every day, boy, I thank the Lord
I got a lot of problems but could have more
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less
I been hungry like Budapest
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck
I just know I'm blessed
Love life even though I'm stressed
This business boy, I swear a test
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check
I'll send Chris to go cut they neck
I love the building, no disrespect
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist
I'ma intercept, It's my time
Put half a mil' of my own money in this album
That's my dime; no rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine, from the basement to the stadium
From the Roxy to Palladium
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor
Half naked playing Connect Four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window
Just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind
And then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like, "go 'head"
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme, so I gotta go
It's Logic, the one nobody would vouch for
How's that shit for an outro?
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes
Everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it, uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success so you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it
But right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Crazy, racist, white bitch looking at us
Like, "Who are these niggas?"
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam
Oh my God, this is my jam
"May-December" by Mos Def
In my headphones, that's the man

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own
These thoughts inside my mind be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive
I can't believe you don't like Tarantino
Ugh, I don't like him because, like—when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie—
You mean like Inglourious Basterds?—I didn't see that
What?!—I didn't, I don't know—
Oh my God! Have you seen 'Pulp Fiction'?
Yeah, but I don't really remember it
What you talking about? Have you seen uh... this is funny cause we're on a train... have you seen—fuck! What's his name? The guy from the movie, in the place, on the thing?
On the train? With the scenery?
Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit—'Source Code'!
No—You haven't seen that?
No—With the dude from 'Donnie Darko'?
Who's that?—Oh my God
Well, I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is...

Crazy how one day yo' idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus, money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe than think down and leave us
The baby cryin'
Crack cookin' where my sister be fryin' soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him, I'll kill him
I'll motherfuckin' kill him, I said, I really want to kill him—but I can't
'Cause if I do, po-po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it? I grip the mic and then kill it—okay, I'm gone
As memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin', sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little Bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the sto'
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my do'
Can't take no mo', mama on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I'm from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin' with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like "Thriller"
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don't do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slingin' like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)
Yeah

Hip-hop

I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer, even though heaven sent him, uh
See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersin' these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number one—I better be
Bitch, I said, "I bet I be."
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me, how is they gon' remember me?
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?
And the fans say they love you, but they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry 'bout bitches and gettin' blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference: I'm stronger and better from when I begun
So when people that never knew me, they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged, I just stop (I just stop)
And do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions, that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending, one must understand the prequel, uh
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer even though heaven sent him
Spit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em
Then we gone280Embed
Livin' good, I've been livin' good
Rollin' through my hood, understood (Yeah)

Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit (Yeah-yeah)
No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this (Nah, nah)
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do (If you 'bout it)

With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa (Killa)
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl
RattPack, know the deal
What's the motto? Keep it real!
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it
We live in an era where they get deleted
I'm wondering if I'ma make it
Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going, that's why I be flowin'
I'm already knowing this life that I'm livin'
Don't know what I'm given
It's so hard not to give in
Out the blue, like a Crip

Bruh, yo (Nah sayin'? It was somethin' that-)
Guess who I met last night, man
You know your land-, land chick? The fuck (Woo)
Oh, yeah, man (Ayy dog, I don't know, man)
Now that chick bad last night (God-damn-, fat ass), bruh
She just run up on me like, "Yo" (What?)
Nah mean? We talkin' and shit- (Crazy)
We gotta-we gotta stay- (Blap-blap!)
Oh, we heard man
It was cool, opp (For sure), you know, got crazy, so I had to let 'em out
(Yeah, faggot-)
Crazy thing that I heard, the homie say he ran around the corner from here
(Is that right?) Right around the corner, nah mean? (Boy, wait-wait-wait)
(Right around the corner?) Nah mean? (It's on, it's on!)
Sort that new life, he should look out (I'm gon' kill a nigga tonight)
Okay (I'm like-) (I mean if-) (Shit)
If somethin' go down, man, we ready, man, ain't-
(Nobody-nobody) and we ready, the whole hood ready (This car creeping)
(Looks brazy-) damn, oh shit!- (Oh, shit!)
Go, go, go-! (In the roof!) go-!
Uh, yeah, outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin'
And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion
I'd rather not have this discussion
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
Where my mind, don’t know now
But I know where it was
I need Nikki, where is Nikki?
Baby girl, please come and get me
Now I’m old and shit is trippy, but I know that God is with me
This that baby mama drama
Give a fuck about a man, I know I'ma
Be there for my son, talking with my sister, it begun
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check, check
Won’t ever bounce like my daddy did
But I’m glad he did 'cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8, grab a plate
Food for thought, gravitate
Food stamps, Social Services tryna take me away
My mama locked up, I pray to God that I see her today
Maybe not, maybe so; West Deer Park, that’s all I know
Just me and my homies, people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way (Around my way)
Living day by day (Living day by day)
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs
Five-O with them K-9's
Manhunt when it's game time
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I’m running from the police
Don’t know how, but I got away
Selling weed to my homies
And a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school
'Cause my homie told me to
What to do, what would you?
When will I lose my anonymity
And become one with the enemy?
Tell me, would I be the enemy?
Feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe

I guess maybe I was thinking things would be different now
'Cause when I wake up, my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes?
I wish I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen? Maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know—but tell me why, uh
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons?
Maybe not—All I know is this life I live
I can’t live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV, let it wash my brain
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain
Hello children, how was school?
It was good, how 'bout you?
I love you (I love you, son), I love mama too
Are you ready for dinner?
I’m able to set the table
'Til I snap out the fable when that TV turn off
And I realize I’m back in hell

This album was created over the span of one year. However, the majority of the album was recorded in only two weeks62Embed
Aight, or—higher probably, right?
Fuck it, just record it. Who cares?
One, two...

I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I'm not defined by the sales of my first week
'Cause in my mind, the only way I fail: if my verse weak
As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
Compiled of different races, gathering from different places
I just contemplate, shout out to those who can relate
And even though it gets hard I know my fate
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates, it's like

I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Looking for the sun in a world of gray
Feeling like my dream is a world away
I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Searching for the sun in a world of gray
Feeling like my dream is a world away

Hello. Welcome to the 'Under Pressure' program
My name is Thalia. I will be here to assist you with the information about the album and its creation
68Embed
Yeah!
Let that shit breathe, 6ix!
My mans just got that pub deal!
A-Hey!

This is dedicated to Dion
That's what the fuck we on
Who knew when you signed me that I would become a phenom?
Fuck rap
This is deeper than that
This is 'bout us as a people, now who fuckin' with that?
I'm on my Uma Thurman, I murk them
Then burn 'em, take they asses and churn 'em
I'm learning every day, uh

Tell me who you know sing ballads like young Freddie?
Tell me who you know the greatest rapper alive?
Tell me who you know that been down to get ready?
That's Lil' Bobby been rappin' since '95

All I ever needed was some confidence
I sold a couple million records, now they fuckin' with this
I said all I ever wanted was a place to be loved
But they wasn't fucking with me so I rose up above
Did it without they approval, I put it all on the line
No investors gave me they money, so I spent all of mine
Invested all in myself, sacrificed mental health
Pushed myself to the brink of insanity just for wealth
Yeah, that wealth was success, don't mean shit when you depressed
But they don't fuck with that in rap, so we keep that suppressed
And bitch I'm right back better than ever before
Emptied my bank account and paid for the Under Pressure Tour, shit
Only had 700 dollars
Dropped that Everybody album, now my bank account in triple commas
Believed in myself when they wouldn't
Fuck them and they drama
And bitch, I been at it, damn right, I'm an addict
Now I can't fuck with the static of this bullshit, I done had it, I said
Bitches want a man with money, so if I make it in this rap shit, they can't take it from me
That's the mentality that leads to fatality
My reality is on some Kill Bill shit, you know I'm saying?
I'm never playing, like

I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm just not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)
Nikki baby, I love you but now I gotta go
'Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)
Tell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God that's all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as a young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)
Nothing can replace you (Replace you)
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta
But lately, I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)

"Where is my place in this bright future?" I heard him say

Say I ain't good enough, they say I ain't hood enough
Even if I signed to Yeezy, I wouldn't be good enough (Good enough)

Killin' myself to make a killin'
Fuck the bullshit, I'ma just write what I'm feelin' (Write what I'm feelin')
(Heard him s— I heard him s— I heard him say)
I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I'm not
Give a fuck if it's hot (Fuck if it's hot)

That boy different, don't fuck with him
But I'd rather stand out than stand in
Let the story begin (Turn the mic down)

Look in the mirror and what I tell 'em?
Reflectin' on my life, I'm Keanu in Parabellum (Parabellum)

Came a long way from where you was
Up-and-comer with a buzz, overcame sellin' drugs
Overcame depression, even overcame addiction

Always in the kitchen, never mind who be bitchin' (Mind who be bitchin')

I've been battlin' with my demons
I'm cowardice when I see 'em
I'm powerless, I can't beat 'em
But deep down, I feel like I need 'em
Power is freedom, you can lead 'em but can't feed 'em
Smilin' on my face but I'm dyin' under the surface
What is my purpose? I'm feelin' worthless
Tell me what worth is
My flaws, I happily greet 'em
Imperfections, I love 'em
My enemies, I defeat 'em
Man, I know somebody gon' relate to this
If keeping it real is a sin, you better pray for this
'Cause I wanted this shit all my life
'Til I finally got it and realized there's so much more to life
Used to dream I'd become the fuckin' man I am
Stackin' money and readin' my son Sam I Am
Love life, can't tell you how much a fan I am
This is grown folk music if you did not know
Thirty somethin', I ain't rappin' 'bout no dumb shit, ho
Keep it real, Bobby boy ain't no kid no more
Now keep it real, Bobby boy ain't no kid no more
Now if you feelin' how I'm feelin', let a motherfucker know

Feelin' good, yeah, I'm feelin' my health
Got a couple plaques up on my shelf
Money in the safe at the crib just to feel my wealth
Think I'm gonna put it all on the line
I think I'm really gonna do it this time
I think I got a whole lot on my mind
Somebody tell God right now He need to hit my line (Yeah, uh)
You might also like
Now I ain't sayin' this my "Jesus Walks"
I'm just sayin', God, I need to talk
Too many kids in the community outlined in chalk
Scared of drive-bys when they should just be scared of the dark
Who's really doin' they part?
They say they don't want messages in rap, it ruins the art
Well, here I am, people, yeah, now tear me apart
So much happenin' in the world, I can't touch on every topic
I know You hear it in my voice, make the devil stop it
Too many people dyin' and baby mamas cryin'
It's been a long time, God, can You hit my line?
Evil politicians, people on Twitter bitchin'
Hashtaggin', but in real life, they never pitch in
I came with conviction, I hope You came to listen
No matter how much I ignore it, this message my mission
God, hit my line, this world is in critical condition
Like a fiend that need fixin', that done battled addiction
Been addicted to money, been addicted to fame
Addicted to arenas and people screamin' my name
But it's time to let go, it's time to make a change
So can You hit my line? I know You hear this rhyme
But come to think of it, You probably hear this all the time
Probably hear this all the time

I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)
I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)
I'm feelin' normal, yeah, I'm feelin' myself
Feelin' good, yeah, I'm feelin' my health

Think I'm gonna put it all on the line
I think I'm really gonna do it this time

This album was written over the course of one week
And mainly created in just four studio sessions between Logic and No. I.D.
But perfected over the course of the year that followed39Embed
Welcome to the No Pressure program
Good evening, this is Logic
And very happy I am to be back in the United States and back on the network
Even for so short a visit as this one
Back with old friends like No I.D. who is tonight's director and
Nobody argued the point, a lot of people asked us to do it again, so it's gratifying to get the chance— us to do it again
So it's gratifying to get the chance now (No I.D.)
Personally, I've never met anybody who didn't like The Incredible True Story
Now tonight, what we do have is a thriller
If it's half as good as we think it is, you can call it a classic
Quite possibly, a little escapade of mine involving a couple of planets which shall be nameless
Is responsible
Doesn't really matter
A story doesn't have to appeal to the heart, it can also appeal to the spine
And with two magic words

Ayy, no pressure
Never graduated, but I school 'em like professor
Growing up, the world always told me I was lesser
Growing up, the world told me I could not address her
Gangsters put that heat to your head like a hairdresser
If you press a issue on they block
(Hey, Logic, Snake here
I hear you're planning world domination through a new form of Metal Gear
Well, listen to me, it won't work)
This liquor that I'm drinking got me thinking 'bout some other shit
Feeling like I'm sinking like Titanic or some other ship
Word to your mothership, boy, this that gutter shit
Breaking down the weed to get high as Thomas and Kai
But y'all ain't ready for that shit, that's more like Ultra 85
Memories of powdered milk and roaches in my cereal
Praying that my crew next like cotton material
Never had a car, that's why I hate the fuckin' bus
Took the 61 to Germantown and hear them guns bust
Call it static, my headphones on, it's Illmatic
On my Rosa Parks, in the back writin' like B-Rabbit
How I carry it, murder the beat and then I'ma bury it
Producin' tracks for the underground like Harriet
Drop another number one and watch 'em all get mad again
Memorizing verses like the Vatican, I'm glad again
Empty the clip and then do that again
And now we ridin' 'round the city on a dollar twenty-five
Boy, you better keep your head down if you wanna stay alive
People telling you to stay in your lane, can't even drive
Tell you not to chase your dreams 'cause they chained to a nine-to-five
Bitch, I'm too alive like twins in the womb, come hither, consume
All of my memories from past and present like two identities
Logic fallin' off is an obscenity
Top five I better be, steadily
Doggin' these bitches like I'm a Pedigree
Obtain class with no degree
Fuck a GED, EBT, and the HOC
Feeling free, yeah, I'm feeling free
But it cost a fee to be the boss it cost to be
Over possessions like an apostrophe
It's chemical warfare on the block, who got the rock?
A tablespoon of baking soda leave you shellshocked
Leave the pusher in a cell block and his customer in a box
The government got my pops
The government can't be stopped
I'm a gladiator, this shit right here more like random thought
It's more like

Yeah, yeah, uh

Grammy-nominated, never won it though
Don't need it, but deep down I want it though
Bank account still on a hunnid though
My bank account still on a hunnid (Ayy)
But that don't mean shit, that don't mean that I'm shit
It's just me and my clique and we bombin' this shit
Ain't no drama and shit, now I'm throwin' a fit
Watch me throwin' a fit and get lit like I'm Evel Knievil
Just me and my people, we call this the sequel to Under Pressure
Ain't no need to measure who the best
Fuck around and know who the best
Who give a shit? I just spit about this and I know what I love
R-A-double-T, I put nothing above like that thing in the glove
From Maryland to LA, I'm a motherfucking boss at the bars
And I'm down for the cause, who's down for the cause?
Take a step back, hold up (L-O-G-I-C)
Put the city on the map with the city on my back
Let 'em know you're never ever goin' back (L-O-G-I-C)
Don't be scared to murk 'em all, hurt 'em all, watch 'em all
Get up all, watch 'em all get a ball (L-O-G-I-C)
When you grow up in a hood without a male role model
And your momma turn to the bottle
Give a damn about status, who the baddest
I just wanna be the raddest dad as I can be
This shit is systemic inside of us B', the media lie to us B'
They tell us we can be whoever we want to be
And then when we try, what they tell us? (What they tell us?)
What they tell us? To live more realistically (Ayy)
Fuck that, get the fuck back, fuck rap and all that noise
Growing up, how I grew up I really never had a choice
Had killers and murderers in my house and they was all of my boys
But deep down I always knew better, knew that shit I need to avoid

Ayy, ayo
I got a lot on my mind
Got a lot of work ahead of me
I'm tryna maintain balance of my time
Never want to let it bottle up like everything fine
That's how you go crazy and end up in the pond
I've been talkin' to my therapist
Rhymes I've been writin' so hot you would think it was in Arabic
Flow bomb like a terrorist, never careless
I got soul like Parrish, yeah, from Tokyo to Paris
My bitch bad, stay with money like a heiress
Time with my wife and my son what I cherish

Just try to relax your mind
Just try to relax your mind
Just try to relax your mind
Just try to relax your mind

Alright, well I guess I just I woke up one day and I was like "You know what? I kinda feel like rapping again."  You know what I'm saying? So I did. And I been chillin' with Little Bobby and his fine ass momma and we out here in the country. Shooting guns, riding dirt bikes and shit and I was just like "Man, I want to do this." So I invited all the homies out here in the middle of nowhere. And uhh we just decided to do this Bobby Tarantino EP, 3-P, off the cuff just for fun, just for the summer, just for all the homies. But we actually out here recording this album. It's gon' be my last studio-album on Def Jam. So, so it's gon' be a vibe. It's just gon' to be fun, you know, just a fun thing. You know me, I'm a nerd, I love hip-hop, man. I love you listening, I love the fans, we doin' this shit for the fans man. Whole time I was gone they was like, "Come back! Come back!" and I was like, "Nah." And then now I'm like, "Yeah, alright, I'm back." I love y'all so much. RATTPACK, baby. Yeah. Little Bobby. (Dadda, Momma)8Embed

Goddamn, goddamn, conversations with people
Crazy how one day, the legends forget that they equal
On this Under Pressure sequel
We not taking it back, we keepin' it pushing
People scared of change
But you'll find me deep in the cushion
Even when I win, it feel like I'm losing
Listening to beats, in the Bimmer cruisin'
I think I got another hit, I could feel my body bruisin'
What's the conclusion? Or rather, my hypothesis
I'm darker than Gotham is
Like reading Nostradamus at 90 degrees
You better believe
I know how to turn a profit with ease
Diacritical lifestyle, I'm always overseas
Hurricane Bobby in the studio blowing trees
Switch the topic, I drop it
Fuck around then leave them all concussed
When I bust, no thrust, this world we livin' in is fucked
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty one
Your new shit ain't good as your old shit
'Til your new shit is your old shit, son
And then some, gotta get some
I wear this 24 karat solid gold Rollie for my son
As an heirloom, not for looking dope as I rhyme
As a representation to give your family your time
If you're searching for love in the industry you'll be let down
They don't love you 'til you dead and then they call you profound
No matter how mainstream you was in the end, you still underground
That's the truth, feeling close to the cliff, like Rick Dalton in the booth
Money ain't the key to happiness and this the proof
Modern day rap is like a golden era spoof
But a few of us were searching within the second renaissance
And I know that my debutantes
Been keeping the legacy going
By flowing so involuntarily seamless
Me and my team is finally reaping
What we been sowing like a seamstress
I said I'm on one, I know I'm unsung
Was livin' my life backward like Tariq on Undun
And now they wonder how I got over son (Do you want more?)
Hell yeah, now check the method
I been livin' outside of pages for ages
Now I'm back, Chocolate City, home of percussion, Maryland on my back
From Takoma Park, all the way to Southeast DC
It feel like forever ago, it feel like BC
Everlasting life, kickin' rhymes in the parking lot at night
Inhale, exhale, people hate
Oh well, 2012
Dreamin' I'm a freshman on XXL
2013, on the cover XXL
Livin' life behind these bars with no intention of postin' bail
'Cause I prevail
But that's a story for another time
Story for another rhyme
And on my darkest days, I know that the sun will shine, eventually
Greatest lyricist to ever do it, yeah essentially
And if we're being modest then potentially
And if we're being humble then...

Ayy, fuck you guys! Fuck you guys!
Suck my dick!
Straight on the basement mic
Ayy, man fuck all these punchlines and shit man
I just wanna tell a story, I just wanna have some fun
Back in the basement type shit
Ayo, once upon a time a couple of guys from out this world
Was talkin' rap and hip hop with a young synthetic girl
The year was 2115 at Babel Space Station
Was home to the very last of the human population
The captain name was Thomas, the infantry man was Kai
And he's the man that discovered the Ultra 85
Accompanied by a girl inside their ear, her name was Thalia
Made of ones and zeros, she was a program
You could ask her any question even about the fall of man
Then one day they discovered a planet in deep space
That nobody before them had ever found in they database
I mean, maybe it's the place that's meant for the human race
The planet Paradise, Kai said to Thomas, "My God
It'd be very nice, traveling through outer space
We done had some scary nights
We done had some scary fights"
All about that rap shit, Kai like that trap shit
Thomas love that boom bap shit
"I wish God was real, I wish I could just get raptured
What if this planet full of aliens and we get captured?"
"Don't think that way, my son
Everything gon' be fine, we finna have some fun
And if by chance we do come across an alien
I'ma blow his ass away with this here molecular gun
Set to kill, never stun
Wagwan, we get it done"
Now the ship is enterin' the atmosphere (Ten, nine)
"We gon' take a look around and get the hell up outta here (Eight, seven)
We gon' double check that it's habitable and livable for man (Six, five)
And no matter what happens you know we gon' stick to the plan" (Four, three)
"Understood?" "Understand", "All good? Let's get it then" (Two, one)
Once they touched down nobody could hear a sound
'Til they opened up the ship door, that rappelled to the ground
What they found, a planet full of life
A planet full of shit they never seen
Straight up out a movie scene
On some Tarantino meets Christopher Nolan, nah mean?
Walk around the planet for hours, they was exhausted
If it wasn't for the music in they ears, they would have lost it
The seventh album by a musician they both revered
First time this planet heard it, let's call it a world premiere
Thomas thinkin' about a picture of his girl
That he left on the Aquarius Three in his dresser
Wishin' he could undress her
Give her the pipe, no lesser
Kai thinkin' nuts like a professor
Wondering if the oxygen on this planet fresher
Now is it us or is the natural life on this world the aggressor?
All the negative shit inside of his head, he need a refresher
Two men here to save the world, no pressure40Embed
Bitch, I did it, I made it, I'm loved and I'm hated
I started from the bottom, now my neighborhood is gated
They say, "Drink to your accomplishments," so every night I'm faded
Feel like every other day, me and somebody new related
You're my sister, cousin, brother from the other side? (The other side)
Well, I don't know who told you that (My mama)
Well, she fucking lied
Ayy, wake up, wake up, get your cake up
Cut it up like it's cocaine, shake up
All the streets with all these beats
I body beats, I'm not discreet (Per-Per-Perfect)
This is how I feel on the inside
All you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide
You worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter
You gots to get it through your head
You won't ever get no handout
Fuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out (Per-Per-Perfect)
My flow increased, my dough increased
You know I leave them all deceased
I am a fucking beast, I'm from the East
I keep the peace, don't need a piece
But I keep a piece, got it, capisce?
That boy gon' eat, this is a feast
Once I release, I'm smokin' trees
I bought my shit, I don't need no lease
So fuck you up like Master P (Perfect)
This shit right here a masterpiece, I'm comin' in hot like the police
Shooting my shot like the police
All on the block like the police, man, who gon' (Stop, stop)
The police from leaving bodies in the motherfuckin' streets, man? (Fire, per-per-perfect)

Okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, ladies and gentlemen, settle down
Okay, so, this next brother we're gonna bring up to the stage usually does not come in on Monday nights
You're in for a real treat, ladies and gentlemen
Give it to Mr. Hall

Rip out my soul from the depths of my flesh
Flesh from my blood I caress
Right on the page so it's fresh
I take my time, but express
Lot on my mind, but I guess
It's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene
Kick in the door, we blow it off the hinge
Music my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe
It's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend
Therapist tell me I don't need to defend
Therapy tell me I don't need to explain
Just drop the record on the needle and express my pain
Can't wait until my son shine and together we reign
My queen's by my side like Manhattan
Fuck rapping, this is poetic conviction
My rendition is not meant for your diction
Battled addiction in the womb
A crack baby by definition
Keys to ignition with no permission
That mean that I'm driven
Alive 'cause I'm living
Fuck workin' with what you've been given
I knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five
And I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did
'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did
Didn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid
All I knew was alcoholism and prison
Only saw domestic violence and racial division
Social worker trying to take me away
But I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way
At least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay
Adapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay

For the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy
We get big bread
Tryin' to be the greatest, that shit been dead
I'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead
I'm trying to get ahead like a fetus
Money don't complete us, but it feed us, it can lead us to depression
Being rich is not a blessing, fame is not a blessing
Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous, I learned that lesson
What's the meaning of life, to live it, what I'm guessing

Live it, live it
Living life like this is so crazy
Hip-hop is amazing
One day, you're on top and the next, they want to erase 'em
Goddamn, what I'm facing
Every day a new frustration
People thinking I'm complacent
People thinking that I changed like a cashier
But I can't let that register, get the fuck up on out of here
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, get high as the stratosphere
I can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme
Give it up, you're out of time
Never even had a prime
Like the Preemo never linked up with 5'9"
Bitch, I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae
Okay, fuck what you gotta say
I keep it going, already know when I'm flowing
For the listener, you're kind of like a therapist
Or rather Cole in 2005, flowing like Canibus
That throwback shit, yeah, that throwback shit
Fuck what you heard, my catalog, it ain't got no wack shit
'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum, everybody wanna be him
'Til they feel like they can't be him, then they wanna see him lose
Wrote this poem in navy, that's what I call singing the blues
Word to Dot D, my family got me, no carbon copy
Life can hit you harder than Drago
But if I roll with the punches when it's rocky, don't ever stop me
Never top me, never cocky, I'm never cocky
Okay, well, maybe sometimes
Occasionally in some rhymes
But it's fine, in due time
I'm the illest to ever do it, come now, Bobby Boy, cool it
An indigenous era of the indigenous emcee
Riding this motherfucker 'til the tank on E
What's up?
(You-you-you-you-you)
(You-you), yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah (Yeah)
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah

Uh, yeah

(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)

Fuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside
I wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride
Reflecting on memories from my childhood
Bringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good
All I ever gave a fuck about was my career
But all that shit out the window now that my son is here
Fuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams
Fuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less
If it ain't 'bout my happiness, then I could give a fuck less
I remember window shopping
Now I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room
Bobby coming soon
And that's the type of line I would've second-guessed
Putting on my shit before
Out of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate
'Cause it wasn't relevant
Give a fuck if it's evident, this right here is the evidence
I'm like Leo in Revenant, bear with me
You could tear me apart
But that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart
Where it's built from the start
Where it's finna stay
I've learned every day's a good day
Surrounded by people that love me
Don't want nothing from me but my happiness
Off the internet, that's when I'm at my happiest
Scrolling so much, my thumb fucked up
We call that carpal tunnel vision
Follow me like religion on this course of collision
Feeling imprisoned, and this is my freedom through these lyrics
As I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis
All this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus
I think I finally found my paradise, that's word to Thomas52Embed
Logic taught me
"So, uh... it's been twenty-four hours. Got my money?"
"Oh... uh, you know what, just give me 'til next Friday. I'll have it for you."
"Oh-oh, uh, that's funny. I could've sworn I said 'have it today'?"
"Yeah... I don't have it, sorry."
"Oh. Well alright then...
Yeah, that's what happens man!"

I'm Stewie Griffin
And this game is Brian
Beatin' the hell out of em'
Tryin', to get this money
Check the statistics
The chances of me blowin' up are far from realistic
Fuck it, I'll risk it
To have a chance at fame, I'd never miss it
I know I'm gonna be famous 'cause my friends and family insisted
(laughs)
Been on the low, concealing my shit just like a biscuit
But it's time to let off, set off, break this bread off
Bitches I'm comin' and I ain't finna pull out
All I do is get this money
Cut these records and cool out
My favorite night of the week to perform is Friday
But I kinda see it as Louis Vuitton day
'Cause when I step up on the stage
I'm snatchin' mics like Kanye
Too swift to book me for the night
That's Andre
Three stacks, I do it big
Take no relax, I'm spittin' the facts
Catch me in the booth, droppin' tracks
Yeah they talkin' bout me
Yeah, I know they talkin' bout me
Yeah I know they talkin' bout me but
Never face to face, they evade it
By rappers I'm hated
Because I'm fly, while they just levitated
As the hating escalated
My flow, it just elevated
Bitches I made it

They used to tell me I'd never make it
Now my flow streams
Across the world, spit lyrics, let them unfurl
Poetic rhetoric my girl
Got my mind playin' tricks on me
My eyes is closed, the ice is froze, I got it
Hip-hop was never dead, but it was fallin'
And I caught it
The way I process chips, you think my brain's robotic
Fuckin' with bitches overseas cos the pussy's exotic
I went from switchin' lanes in the rain
To switchin' planes with dames
Poppin' champagne, spittin' game, and gettin' brain

Of sacrificing matters of the heart just to obtain
Living a life that most won't attain
And I know it is essential
But when it comes to love, man, that shit is subsequential
For now I just be chillin' with ballers
Poppin’ collars, pushing Impalas, cutting records and counting dollars
I'm addicted, my lines is cocaine
And when they disperse blow minds like propane
And you know these haters that never made it this mad
Cause they never had what we had
Addicted to the game and I'm glad

Only fuck with golden girls, and I ain't talking Lifetime

Hit the bong I hit the ceiling, hit the drink I hit the floor
If they show 'em in the buildin to the crowd, then let me know

Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go

I’m on the come up
Anything that y'all do I'll one-up
Y'all grind till like 3 in the morning; I grind till the sun up
Homie, that’s dedication
This world is what I’m facing
I only hope in the end that they all love and embrace him

(I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, man)
Mama, I’m sorry that I left at 17
(I apologize a trillion times)

Everything ain’t what it seems when you try to follow your dreams
First you saw the bigger picture, now you see behind the scenes
You thought everything was sweet, now you see that shit is mean
Got a taste now you a fiend, been into it since a teen
Yeah, he nice and all his friends say he gon’ blow like Hiroshim'
Eyes on the prize like the baddest bitch you ever seen
At home late night, chillin', envisioning
Himself on the cover of Vibe magazine
But everything ain’t what it seems, though it seem like he gon’ blow
Will he make it? Maybe so
To be honest, I don’t know
He got lyrics, he got flow
But it takes so much mo'
So much love
So much pain
With such little time to grow
Yeah, we love it when he smile
But hate it when he frown
I remember when that girl turned his world upside down
But it made his music better
Brought emotion made it clever
Now he growing everyday
But he hungry tryna eat
Brain like an EKG the way that he study the beat
Now we know that he gon’ make it and he won’t accept defeat
Now I ain’t tryna be mean
Now I ain’t tryna be mean
But everything ain’t what it seem

Momma, I’m sorry that I left at 17
(I apologize a trillion times)

So many times have I designed a rhyme to blow your mind
'Cause I know that I wasn’t destined to live a life of crime
I remember Christmases with no presents
I used to fear my future now I dread my adolescence
Living the life of Logic
Really ain’t what it’s cut out to be
'Cause if I couldn’t rap y'all wouldn’t give a fuck about me
Hip-hop is politics
Filled with nothing but strife and stress
'Cause–time is money and it’s hard to invest
Step on the stage, I get the honeys so wet
Rockin' thousand-dollar tuxes, sippin' on nothing but Moet
Thinkin' I’m so set, but really I ain’t done shit yet
This game is war and in my mind I’m like a Vietnam vet
Now, I’m on the come up
Anything that y'all do I’ll one-up
Y'all grind till 3 in the morning; I grind till the sun up
Homie, that’s dedication
This world is what I’m facing
I only hope in the end that they all love and embrace him
(I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, man)
Momma, I’m sorry that I left at 17
(I apologize a trillion times)

For the motherfuckers that hated: I made it
Slowly elevated, escalated onto another level, ha
My flow is crack, the game is Whitney, yup
Fame is Bobby on their first date: it ain’t hit me yet
Now, visualizing driving down the horizon
While you despising the fact that I’m rising
So much hate within this world this shit is so traumatizing
Steppin' to me and you better be alphabetically ready
Aim steady
Lyricism sharp as machete
I got it already
See I was born to sell records
Y'all destined to sell tunes
All up in your headphones
Killing booths like cellphones
(I got it)
'Cause everything ain’t what is seems
It ain’t just him it takes a team
At the ten headed to the zone in his mug mean
Yeah, the quarterback shines, but not without a sense of safety
So truly he is me and motherfucker you can’t face me
Now I’ve had a lot of doubt
But I had to throw that out
'Cause I find that they listen when I rhyme not when I shout
And right now shit is rocky
With me and my girl
See music is my moon but this shawty is my world
Think about you all the time
Turn that shit into a rhyme
'Cause sometimes you can ignore me
But the beat listens just fine
Tell me do you even know
If you truly want to grow
Hate letters when I’m writing Love Jones all I know
'Cause everything ain’t what it seem
(I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, man)
Momma, I’m sorry that I left at 17
(I apologize a trillion times)
Living a life you only dream about
Flow angelic but now it’s time to bring the demon out
Can you feel me?
I said it’s hard being a saint inside a sinner’s body
You know its hard living as Logic after living as Bobby
This is the life I depicted
As a child I picked it
Feeling conflicted
To music I am addicted
Not one of y'all can predict it
So many bars I’m feeling convicted
Now writing like a felon I’m selling homie who you telling
While y'all do everything by the book fuck that I’m rebelling
Cause bitch I’m on another level
A level you ain't seen
A level that is truly only deemed for a king
The second you listen it’s my mission to murder any rendition
Busting with precision
If you in my vision I’m never missing, ah!
Logic administer sinister verses like a minister for the listener
Can you motherfuckers feel me?25Embed
Yeah, yeah

(Take my shorty to Nobu and dig up in her rib though, yeah)
'Cause back in my day it was food stamps
And I love my wife like I am Chance

I'm livin' on another planet
My manic depression make me constantly wanna panic
I'm stressing on stage, pretendin' everybody undressing
I think I'll never learn my lesson, but fuck it all, it doesn't matter
Ayo, I'm on a lyrical, poetic rhetoric
Lyrical miracle, satirical shit
If you don't like my conscious rap, you won't like my material shit
Love him or hate him, everybody know Logic can spit
Used to be up to date on that rap political shit
But nowadays I'm up to my elbows
And every single inch of my body in my baby's shit
I could tell you more about diapers than modern rappers in cyphers
I used to be about the B-Rabbits and Mekhi Phifers

They say that that boy done changed
He don't rap about his everyday life, he ain't the same
Goddamn, already had a hard life once
Am I supposed to recreate it every album for you cunts? Okay
You want to hear about my everyday
I wake up, I wake my son up, then I feed him
And lead him into his car seat
Drive up the street down to Target
Don't do hard drugs or beat my wife
But the paparazzi still wanna start shit
I don't answer their questions, I leave 'em in the dark, bitch
Then I walk through the automatic doors
A couple fans spot me but, shit, I ain't on tour
I ain't trying to ignore her
But I head to aisle four 'cause my drawers stank as fuck
And I need some new drawers
Then I spot some more fans, stan hella hardcore (Can I have a picture?)
Asking for a pic and I say sure
Scratch my dick and shake his hand
Shaking uncontrollably, he tells me I'm the man
Now I'm headed to aisle three for some Bounty paper towels
I also grab some wet wipes to clean the shit from my bowels
A really hot girl walks by with a fat ass
But I'm just wondering if Hefty really holds the most trash
Forgot my card at home, thank God I brought some cash
Then I grab some Preparation H for the critics up my ass
Head to aisle five for some Sgt. Smash cereal
Is this want you wanted, everyday life material?
I'm not a kid anymore and be sure shit's boring
Made it out the basement, now my bank account soaring
Most exciting part of my life is probably touring
Don't get me wrong, I love fans in every single city
But hotels suck and the internet is shitty
I mean, why rap about everyday shit
When I could murder punch lines and sound dope like this?

I'm a businessman, I got important people to see
Mainly No I.D. cooking up in studio D
That underground shit, L train across town shit
This that Nas, it's like Queensbridge, king, crown shit
Study my lyricism whenever you and your friends meet
I got enough M's in the bank to make ends meet
Oh my God, get gritty, '96 P Diddy, setting fire to the city
Keep it real, keep it true, sicker than the flu
You can smoke government dope and not get higher than my IQ
Are you ready? I'm calm my arms are steady
I'm armed and ready, digging in you like a machete
Surprise, confetti
You going to need more than bed rest when I hit you with these 26 bullets, no excess
I never went to school, never went to MIT, but my imagination out of this world like MIB
Who are you to me? These other rappers envy me, the MVP, born and raised in MD, get it B
Don't get it confused, fuck the style everyone use
Switch up the rhythm every track, flows, I never double use
X marks the spot, every day I give what I got
That's why I'm on top, steady running shit and you not
You steadily flop, every album steadily drop
Think you can do it 'cause I do it?  Come now, boy, better stop
Trying to take me out? My advice is aim for the top

Nah, on the second thought I can't play this

Come on, nigga, play that shit
Never one to flip scripts
I'm more raw than imaginary rubbers
Rain in the gutter, my talent is Night Killer
Always flowing venomous, never rolling in regiments
Whipping riddles intelligence, you got beef, then we settle it
Possibilities is endless, you'll never catch me pen-less
Suicidal lyrics, controvers' like stem-cell research
Ain't no time to compromise, my rhymes immortalized
Visualize as I vocalize, worldly lies, that we're hypnotized
Staring into space like the Enterprise
Contemplating on words that shall arise
Mentality merciless, never sympathize

Smoking weed in gazebos, incognito
Attracting more microphones than Magneto and that's real

Depression, anxiety got ahold of me
'Cause people say they want the older me
Well, I'm thirty, this the oldest me
Behold it's me, the piece of shit that's not good enough
Not black enough, not hood enough
Not rich enough, not poor enough
My heart has poured enough
I been beaten and battered, my confidence shattered
Been broken and tattered
I'm constantly second guessin' if my profession is worth it on my mental state
Writin' this from a dark place with humility and grace
Peace, love, and positivity was my nativity
But not when socials are in my vicinity
I'm not runnin' from the internet
My god, I was at its birth, I've been a vet
Goin' berserk like Peter down in Initech, yo, ayy
It's deeper than the surface, I'm searchin' for purpose
I'm tired of searchin' for Logic on Google on purpose just to read that I'm worthless
I remember makin' music alone, just a pen and a microphone
But nowadays it's hard to get in the zone
Writin' rhymes was easy before the fame
Now I'm constantly overthinkin' every line, it's a shame
Rap used to fill me with joy, now it's nothin' but pain
I'm stuck in the game, tryna get back from where I came
I write this letter for the person who's listenin'
Fed up and tired of people dismissin' 'em, I'm with you
I been through what you been through
And no amount of money can take away the feelin' of insecurity
Only through maturity can we overcome
Feel like I've been overrun, feel like it's over, I'm done
Whoever told you success gon' make you happy? You been lied to
All of my dreams came true but I bleed and cry too
Never been perfect, I failed every time I tried to
Feelin' hated and underappreciated
Every time I look in the mirror, I wonder, "Why you?"
Shit, I'd love to end this on some positive shit
Hit you with punchlines instead of some derogative shit
But it's okay to be sad sometimes and tired of shit, I guess

And people say, "Well you're just out for money"
I say, "That's none of your business"
You see, a lot of people don't feel happy
Unless they have another thing beyond money, which is called status
And status, to a very large extent in our economy consists in
In having this thing, and that thing, and the other thing, and having a swimming pool
A, uh, Ferrari, uh, certain kind of clothes and uh, certain kind of house
And so on, and so on, and so on
And we think, uh, we need all that
Because we haven't asked ourselves whether that was what we really wanted
They all think they gotta have this, they gotta have that
And uh, they don't really want it
If they sat back and considered, "Do I need all that? Is this trip really necessary?"
They would come to the conclusion that it wasn't, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha39Embed
This is Logic
I've spoken these words before but not on the radio
To be born free is to be born in debt
To live in freedom without fighting slavery
To profiteer
I have met Southerners who expect and fear a Negro insurrection
I see no purpose in withholding this from general discussion
There may be those within that outcast ten percent of the American people who someday will strike back at their oppressors
But to put down that mob, a mob would rise
I'd like to ask, please: who will put down that mob?
I'm an overpaid producer with pleasant reasons to rejoice, and I do
In the wholesome practicability of the profit system
But surely, my right to having more than enough is cancelled
If I don't use that more to help those who have less
I owe the very profit I make to the people I make it from
If this is radicalism, it comes automatically to most of us in show business
It being generally agreed that any public man owes his position to the public
That's what I mean when I say I'm your obedient servant
We must, each day, earn what we own
A healthy man owes to the sick all that he can do for them
An educated man owes to the ignorant all that he can do for them
A free man owes to the world's slaves all that he can do for them
And what is to be done is more, much more, than good works
Christmas baskets, bonuses and tips, and bread and circuses
There is only one thing to be done with slaves
Free them
If we can't die in behalf of progress, we can live for it
Progress, we Americans take to mean, a fuller realization of democracy
The measure of progress, as we understand it, is the measure of equality enjoyed by all men
We can do something about that
The way our fighting brothers and sisters looked at it
Some of them dead as I speak these words
The way they looked at it, we're lucky
And they're right, we're lucky to be alive
But only if our lives make life itself worth dying for
We must be worthy of our luck or we are damned
Our lives were spared, but this is merely the silliest of accidents
Unless we put the gift of life to the hard employments of justice
If we waste that gift, we won't have anywhere to hide from the indignation of history
I want to say this
The morality of the auction block is out of date
There is no room in the American century for Jim Crow
Tomorrow's democracy discriminates against discrimination
Its charter won't include the freedom to end freedom
Race hate isn't human nature, race hate is the abandonment of human nature
But this is true
There are alibis for the phenomenal excuses, economic and social
But the brutal fact is simply this
Where the racist lies acceptable, there is corruption
The race haters must be stopped, the lynchings must be stopped
The murders must be avenged
I come in that boy's name and in the name of all, who, in this land of ours, have no voice of their own
I come with a call for action
This is the time for it
I call for action against the cause of riot
It won't surprise me if I'm accused in some quarters of inciting to riot
Well, I'm very interested in riots, I'm very interested in avoiding them
So I call for action against the cause of riots
Law is the best action, the most decisive
It's in the people's power to see to it that what makes lynchings and starts wars is dealt with
Not by well-wishers, but by policemen, and I mean good policemen
Over several generations, maybe there'll be men who can't be weaned away from the fascist vices of race hate
But we should deny such men responsibility in public affairs
Exactly as we deny responsibility to the wretched victims of the drug habit
There are laws against peddling dope
There can be laws against peddling race hate
But every man has the right to his own opinion as an American boasts
But race hate is not an opinion, it's a phobia
It isn't a viewpoint, race hate is a disease
In a people's world, the incurable racist has no rights
He must be deprived of influence in a people's government
He must be segregated, as he himself would segregate the colored and semitic peoples
Anything very big is very simple
If there's a big race question, there's a big answer to it
And a big answer is simple, like the word "no"
America can write her name across this century, and so she will
If we, the people, brown and black and red
Rise now to the great occasion of our brotherhood
It will take courage
It calls for the doing of great deeds, which means the dreaming of great dreams
Giving the world back to its inhabitants is too big a job for the merely practical
No one of us will live to see a blameless peace
We strive and pray and die for what will be here when we're gone
Our children's children are the ancestors of a free people
To the generations: the fight is worth it
And that just about means that my time is up
When my time's up, I remain as always, obediently yours

You wanna try to eat, motherfucker, this my time
Ayy, it's a celebration, y'all, celebration now
Wherever I go in the nation, they celebrating my style
It's a celebration, y'all, celebration now (Yeah)
Wherever I go in the nation, they celebrate the style

Look
I can't front, we was hyped up for some nosebleeds
Now we sitting courtside, still posted in my white tee
I'm a Golden State Warrior when I'm spittin' this
Like KD from MD, that's Montrose, so venomous
You know it's me, Silas never jumpin' for your bitch ass
I'm hopping on a plane that's first class
'Member back in the day, we used to fast
Had no money in the bank account
My cousin showed me, pushing weight
Almost stabbed at the transit in the dead of the night
These fucking zombies, but really that's beyond me
Tryna live my dreams from everything that I seen as a young man
So if you see me rapping, know I got the upper hand
But on the other hand, you see a couple rubber bands
And now Logic really out here makin' dreams come true
Bobby Boy Records spittin' thorough
Every time I grab the mic, I'm paintin' murals
Doing shows in other countries, coming back with Euros
This that type of flow that really make your girl go
I'm marvelous, I'm all of this
That's why your girl all on my dick
I make 'em cum, boy, you make 'em sick
My net worth get the bank grossed out
No I.D. up on the beat, but 6ix, he kill it, no doubt
This a revelation, memories when I drive the M5 or the bus station
I have evolved, you's a motherfuckin' crustacean
What more can I say? Run it back and they hit replay
Bobby Boy Records, yeah, we celebratin' all day

When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

It was all a dream just a year ago
Bussin' tables, and servin' food, but y'all don't hear it though
Now, I'm on another level, but y'all ain't near it though
My soul bleedin' on the track, so spiritual
It's a blessing 'cause now, rappin' is my profession, yo
Set to detonate, I'm just waitin' for my time to blow
White boy at first glance, but when I rhyme they know
Race don't mean a fucking thing the second that I flow
It's been a year and everything I said would happen has
While everybody that I know was out havin' a blast
I was right here in the studio bustin' my ass
It's been a year, I'm twenty-one, but I feel (Thirty-five)
Yeah, and now, I got this
I taste the blood, no one can stop this
Second I drop this, die hard fans is finna cop this
While the rest of the world follows through fiber optics
I took my time, see I studied the game, learned how to rhyme
I was around drugs and gats, but never delved in crime
Had other things in mind, so I began to grind
First tape was a success
Locally, I got press
But I knew this one right here would run the world a mess, but I digress
A year ago, I was a youngin in his room
Staring out the window, lookin' at the moon, knowing it's coming soon
But today, I board this rocket ship and sonic boom

And at this moment in time, I’m on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he’s passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my
Good god, you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by
See I ain’t signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money, that’s my repertoire

While you worshiped other rappers that leave you less entertained
I was strategizing before the people knew my name
Fame what I shall attain on the road to success
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
Yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito
I know we fight, but that’s poquito
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito

Goddamn, my life is so glamorous
Surrounded by money and cameras
That Hollywood life, it do damages
Cut you deep down with no bandages
Goddamn, my life is so glamorous
That Hollywood life, it do damages
But nobody's painting this picture
'Cause we on devices, and threw out the canvases

Fuck who the greatest, soon as I drop it they play it
Ain't stacking no cheese, I serrate it
All of your shit is outdated
You bring me the beef, I'll filet it
Deon bring me the beat, I'll replay it
Bobby you know he gon' slay it
Just me and the homie from Fayette

Police wanna take my lifе
Emcee wanna take my spot
But they don't give a damn, what I got
Might gеt got, but then again not
I drop beats on the MP, feelin' empty
I'ma beat them to death like No I.D
Streets full of envy, wanna kill me
'Cause I made a lot of money and I'm still me
Dollar dollar bill don't thrill me, know somebody feel me
Not Logic, but the real me, under the surface
I'm rhyming with purpose I know I ain't perfect
I'm Kirk and you irking me?

They the same ones sucking my dick
Talking 'bout Bobby, you know I love the way you spit
Knowing goddamn well they don't really give a shit

Call me, I'll be there to pick you up

I know sometimes shit can get crazy and out of control
I know sometimes this world reminds us we should take it slow
Weight of the world make it impossible to stay afloat
And the demons we battle with make it harder to cope
Why you think we get addicted to alcohol and dope?
Addiction's like a mud bath without a bar of soap
In other words, it's impossible to stay clean
For people like us, bein' happy is just a daydream
But, beyond drugs, it's even day-to-day shit
Constantly comparin' yourself to others and they shit
Know your self-worth
'Cause that's the whole meanin' behind this first verse
I'm in the cut, I'm covert, definition introvert
Life's a bitch but I'm a flirt, tryna get up in that skirt
Come now shawty, get this work, get it 'til I'm in the dirt
No matter what they say, no matter what, I'm all me
And no matter where you been or where you goin'

Tell me do you really want to be a star
Cause the road is lonely and the destination is far away
Are you prepared to leave your girl
Just so you can rule the world
Are you the champion you know you are
You think that you are
Are you the one to save the day
The day

Show me the champion in you
I'll show you the champion in me
Show me the side that they can't see
Show me the person I've been dying to meet

And it goes on and on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on and on
And it goеs on

"I wrote a bunch of letters but—

I just wanna talk to you girl, mama you know are...I just got something I wanna say...

Baby do you remember
Warm summers and cold winters
Songs by soul singers the feeling it still lingers
Elevated by my kiss as you melted between my fingers
Babygirl, sometimes I wish
That I could just rewind this shit and take it back
I had visions but they just faded black
My train of thought is on a different track
When you’re in love it’s hard to separate fiction from fact
Your image in my head, and I’m trynna get rid of that
But you’re always on my mind like a fitted hat
Baby girl, I wanna bring it back to puppy love
When you was sent from up above to care for me
Said that you’d always be there for me
And even though you’re gone, it’s like you never left
Cuz you always in my heart and still take away my breath

Can I love?
Babygirl, can I love?
I said mama can I love?
Yeah, can I love?

Yea, and now I’m feeling like a fool
Writing love letters that you’ll probably never get
And right now, I love you more than I’d like to admit
Because we’re separated
Unto you this song is dedicated
I’m love sick and I need you to medicate it
Feeling devastated
I think about the past and now I hate it
Cause all it proves is that we never made it
See me and shorty got history like a textbook
But lately our positon is changed like that sex book
Ms. Independent she the type to hold her own
Late night contemplating all alone
The kingdom is empty without the queen upon the throne

Can I love?
Babygirl, can I love?
I said, Mama, can I love?"
I'mma ask you, can I love?"
They say there’s many more in the sea
But rather then go fish I play solitare
I look around and see you everywhere
But at the same you’re never there
Fingers through your hair
Reminiscing bout when and where
Remember when we pulled up to that spot and did it there
See I hate to watch you walk away
But I love to watch you come
Baby girl you’re so lustful then innocent when it’s done
The love we share is like a fine wine
Cuz no matter what happens, it only gets better with time
Baby girl you’re so fine that I had to take the time
To articulate this rhyme with you in mind, you’re so divine
Ain’t no matter who you’re fucking with
Or no matter who I’m fucking with, you’ll still be mine
Will we make it? I don’t know
The only thing that will tell us is time

Can I love?

Welcome, to some shit that’s considered legendary
I’m here to put the rap game in the cemetery
They told me it couldn’t happen
"Ain’t no way in hell you gon' make millions off of rapping"
But I’m just so determined
Catch me on the stage spitting verses like a sermon
You know I had to make 'em realize
Lights, camera, action, mofucker check the real in my eyes
Now they all looking so surprised
The dawn of a new era, like the sun I arise
Through these lyrics, I am immortalized
Strictly spitting the truth but the rest is telling more lies
This the type of shit most people fantasize
But this the shit I used to analyze
They told me I was too underground
So I took the mic out my basement and found another sound
I want it, I need it, I’m coming for the crown

Sold out shows, hoes, and a whole lot of ass
Damn what a concoction, but these hoes ain't an option

Uh, now, they lost it I found it, we leave 'em astounded
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease
Got it, capisce? Hungry as hell trying to eat now
Success is the only thing that can complete us
Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus
Close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this (Logic)
Now I've accepted I'm not from the hood
Cause sellin' crack and bustin' gats don't make my raps good
See this is me, L.O.G.I.C. reppin' MD to the fullest

Up a million percent until they finally hear this though
Bumping up in they city like, "oh my God, this go"
My business getting better every year like fiscal
Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil
I'm a original see but they trace like stencil
A stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
'Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine
I did it in 21, see I'm ahead of my time
'Cause when I flow the crowd never roll 'cause I rock
On the road to success, haters in my blind spot
'Cause I got no time to bullshit

How can sky be the limit when there's footprints on the moon?
Now, I used to bus tables, now I bust rhymes
Spitting lines to the illest of dimes just to pass the time
Living like a Don, mafietic mind state
Hip-hop heads never die, we multiply then dominate
Now I been flowin' since a adolescent up until the present
Rehearsin' flows for various shows
Yeah, that's how I roll
Gettin' respected, never neglected
As I infect it, they detect it, when I disect it
Rip it and wreck it, now that's on the record
As the vinyl spin so slowly
Bringing verses like a Holy
Bible, my flow is tribal
Meet me in the street homie I'm liable
To get it right then and there
Motherfuckers like, "Where?"
He come from?
Got music for days and then some
They were stepping confident until I made 'em run

In your vicinity murder evil entities better known as your enemies
You feel it now
Spark the L and you be coolin'
Chillin' relaxin' to this audio satisfaction

In a beamer bomber like Hiroshima
Hit you like Katrina 'til they like, "Damn Gina!" (Damn!)

Yeah, I know we seen a lot of shit whole time we've been together
Thought we knew it all but just couldn't predict the weather
I think about you and imagine a house and some kids
And wonder if you found another and it's all his
See, baby girl, I know you love me even through the lies
'Cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes
Sometimes I see you when you love it but you fear it
'Cause you try your hardest to run
But still feel me in your spirit, baby girl, I know you hear it
My heart is calling for you tonight
And even though the time is wrong I know the love is right
That's why there's so much emotion whenever I recite
Anything about this angel that lost its sight
Baby, you were my everything, but you playin' games
Fucking around got me feeling like blowin' my brains
But you ain't worth the satisfaction
'Cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action

So in the end, it only shows that you don't give a fuck about me
I know you hearing the emotion that's deep within this letter
But I don't give a shit about what you think
I write it so that the people can feel better
That have gone through what I've gone through
Memories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you
And if you think I write this song to taunt you
I don't want you
I want the memory of who you were
And what it was to wake up everyday
And have an endless love with an angel from up above
But now it would seem my baby girl has fallen
And another path within my life is calling
'Cause I put everything below you (Everything below you)
Even my music, and when you left me, I didn't lose it
I channeled deep within my emotions and used it
My heart you broke it and bruised it
So now I address this microphone and just ooze it

Poetic robbery is infamy
Out for me, yeah, they always was
We live in a world that's complicated
Finally achieve some form of happiness, they confiscate it
I roll up, then get down, I pour up, then sit down, let me get it now
Got a lot on my mind like a fitted now
Just can't fuck with that lame shit
Man, these people been talking the same shit
I flow like I'm coming to tame shit
Can't fuck with these people, they basic
See through they shit like Lasik
Y'all don't want no problems, can't face it
I remember days with my mama, days with my pops
Remember running from the cops and now we running from the ops
I'm never taking shots, unless we pay to be at Drai's
Rapping is a sixth sense
Shit can get intense on the block 'till its hot like a stove cooking rock, what's up
Get 'em like a freezer, pull it out, watch 'em freeze up
Anime flow, oh, there he go
Never graduated high school but you know he on the roll
Dilla swing with the raps, you know I'm all over the flow
What's the deal? How you feel?
Counting money, getting it still and I will prevail
I know cats that cook crack and, yeah, they still in jail
Logic on a Plato beat, I rise up on it
Ready to give it to who ever want it
Yeah, we blunted this world of Hip Hop, I'm from it
In my own lane, that gas you know I gun it
I just write it then rap it, I get excited then map it out like a bank heist
Liquor and weed is cool but music is my main vice
You know my aim nice, I killed the game twice
Bring it back to the streets, bring it back to the east
Yeah, I'm back for the feast, no cap get a piece, but I just want peace
I hope I reach the person listening envisioning their dreamsYou might also like4Embed
Hey, the mental state of a lyricist in his prime
Spit divine, thought from the mind
Poetic rhetoric that rhyme
Leave punch lines that leave you conflicted and hit rewind
Every time I spit an ill line, the world's mine
Fuck a Matana
Quit it the second I'm out the vagina
Won't even call her mañana, sike
Lyrical Unibomber, I'm allergic to drama
Mentality of a felon, rebelling elevate
While you repellin', only hate because I'm sellin'
Who you tellin'?
See I was on that raw shit
While you was on that naw shit
The people, they gon' toss it
When that all they endorse it
I just waited for my time to shine, I never forced it
Strategically planned it like Peyton Manning way before shit was even real

La, la, la
La, la
La, la, la, la

I remember nights as a child with my momma, hungry
But my hunger for this music is on another level
This shit will truly have you contemplatin' deals with the devil

All up under your girls skirt as if I was the breeze
Flow Celsius I surpass degrees
Homie, please
And now I'm feelin' like I'm number 1
Cause nobody made it in the game out of where I'm coming from
Can you feel me?
Me and my team devised a scheme to get the cream
Followin' dreams, livin' our lives like movie scenes
Started as a teen, sippin' liquor, smoking' green
For music I was a fiend, my homies know what I mean

Best get your money in order fore' you get checked now (Yeah)

Fuckin' with Logic, it's inevitable that I will result in your imminent death
Now hit rewind and take a breath, homie ain't nothin' left
I'm Gregory House and this game is testin' my patients

(Visualizing the realism of life in actuality)
Various women, I'm swimming in, like a shark
Hip-hop heads never die, we multiply then dominate
(Visualizing the realism of life in actuality)
C'mon this sound, it had to come from somewhere, right?
Uh, yeah

Various listeners is wishing us death
Don't give a damn, I'm reppin' Young Sinatra till my last breath
Easily my darkest confession is lyrical aggression
Through indiscretion that triggers anti-depression
When addressin' my profession in every session
The fact that I'm alive is such a blessing
Sippin' wine while these honeys undressin'
What I'm about to say is highly confidential
And in the music industry today, very essential
So bust out your pencil, you can do it on your own
Stop thinking that these labels is the ones that put you on
Let's change the topic, who's your favorite rapper?
I'm the top pick, ha
The flow is elegant, never irrelevant
How many times must I say this?
Cock back and spray this, never delay this
I pray this, reaches the masses
And spread like cancer on they asses
Now allow me to catch wreck, bust rhymes like Tech
Put me in your box and I destroy the deck

Whipin' through Cabo in a Murcielago
Dodging paparazzi with the finest dime I met in Chicago
The baddest Bobbysoxer that you ever seen, reppin' my team
We real all the time, so my squad keen, bing
Dave, it's me Sinatra and my boy Dean
The way we (Winning) I can't believe there isn't a Sheen
And pregnant women listen and they give birth to a fiend
I spit narcotic epidemic all up in your genes
In layman's terms, I disperse a verse you never seen
Assassinate rappers the moment that they intervene
While you in the alley playing dice
I'm in the yacht contemplating plans for the next diamond heist
Art thieves and jewel connoisseurs
I study every part of they mind and make my rhyme better than yours
Elevated by being hated, sleeping on the brother like they heavily sedated
Some say I'm one in a million, I say I'm one of a kind
Only cocky when I rhyme, I'm Muhammad in his prime

Yo, address the mic and start spillin' like I hit the vein
Back in the day they used to sleep on me like Tryptophan
Touchdown now the city screamin' my name
I flow gunshots and break fingers just to shift the pain
Whoever hate ‘em, I levitate 'em like David Blaine
Black Ops state of mind, play the game like campaign
Bumpin' Santana in the finest Copacabana
In Havana with a honey by the name of Hannah
Wearing nothing but a bandanna
Pussy wetter than Louisiana
You know the deal, peace to Miilkbone, I keep it real
Flyer than a man of steel, motherfucker how you feel, It's Logic
I woke up early on my born day, I’m 20, it’s a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body
Now I’m fresh and my physical frame is celebrated
Cause I made it one quarter through life
Some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it’s pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don’t go against the grain, simple 
Yeah
Destined for a life behind bars, but now where I'm living is gated
I made it, made million on millions, I'm elated
But never outdated, I move with the times
Do whatever suits me like Louis Vuitton, one of a kind, the don
A legend that's destined to pass the baton, and so on
I don't mean to go on, but (Go on), okay, fine
I'ma get mine
No shade, let me shine, in due time
My rhyme is nothing but classic
Most people fakе, nothing but plastic, get ya ass kicked
Quick, take a sip
Bitchеs know I'm packin' like a trip
Now get the fuck off my dick, I'm just a man
Bullshit make me sick, good pussy make me cum
Most never make it where I'm from
Feel these kicks in my soul
Getting money was the goal, now it's be a good person
Shit worsen, second I come through dispersing
This ill lyricism like a prism deep inside your mind
Never counterintuitive, so divine
I spit it strictly off the top of my mind
Can you understand, I’m just a man, where I’m from
Where I’m going, no one knowing
This is how we do it, who is showing their cards
The highest was the odds
I don’t understand, I’m not up there like the Gods
But I will be, yes I will be
Said I will be, say yes I, say yes I, say yes I willYou might also likeEmbed

First class, I am so new at this
Used to ride the metro, now that shit is retro
Like the infrareds on my feet, baby, let's go
Sinatra what they know me by, Logic what they call me
Gotta catch a flight, but the fans wanna stall me
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
Always in the lab with the fresh kicks on
I'm at the MGM, rocking MCM
Bobby Soxer on my arm, it's only 10 PM
Got the RattPack with me going HAM at the hotel
Name brand everything, fuck a wholesale
No, I am not materialistic
I was broke my whole life, and no, I don't miss it
Last seven years of my life was in a lab
Working every day, giving it everything I had
Now that a brother is finally recognized
I will not let the limelight hypnotize
Everybody be sure, I'mma always want more

Cracker-ass motherfucker, sike, nah"

See all I ever wanted was a window to sit close to
And you don't understand but in the end you ain't supposed to
I'm talking first class, 30,000 feet under my ass
Living life on the dash, constant pursuit of cash
Now I'm living a life that you and yours could only dream about
And just a couple years ago this shit I used to scheme about
Rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror
Until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer
See this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days
Fast forward to the present, rappers have no class like snow days
Good God, let me bring it back to hip-hops first renaissance

Get money, fuck bitches but respect women cause we love em'
Kiss em', touch em' and rub em'
Fuck em' but never grub em'
Hit it fast but then I slow it down like Robitussin
Shorty giving me brain until concussion
The club run out of vodka the second we rush in
Never under estimate the power in which I'm bustin'
My lyricism got yo girl blushin'
Ain't even touch her and yet she gushin' (ha)

Now these bitches say they love me, but they just obsessed with the image
Now if practice makes perfect then this is a scrimmage
'Cause I ain't perfect, I never said I was
But now they hatin' 'cause a brother finally got some buzz
The things that I say (Say,) the places I'm seein' (Seein')
The people I talk to you don't know what I mean
Even matters of love, it ain't always as it seems
Yeah, there's plenty in the sea until you hit the mainstream
The girl that I love, the one I call my honey
Now I wonder if she love me for me or my fuckin' money
Sometimes I think about the love that I had in the past
I truly miss it, but it just wasn't destined to last
'Cause our separation lit a fire under my ass
And now I'm gunnin' for the throne, yeah, that is my task
Just a youngin with a dream that acquired a team
Motivated by bad bitches and rockin' Supreme
Now the whole world wonders what's his next move
That all depends on what I feel that I need to improve
Tell me what you think of me, I swear it doesn't matter
Just as long as I am happy and my pocket's getting fatter
Watch me shatter the competition, get mad and now all of 'em wishing
You coulda done it like I done it, bitch, I run it, ah!
Yeah, you know I do it like it ain't ever been done
Hit the Vegas strip and blow a million euro just for fun

Yeah uh

Let me kick rhymes, let me do it slow
Gotta get it every time you ain't fuckin' know
See I'm half white and half negro
So I guess that's why I got a big ego
I got double the talent so I guess I'm too nice
Tryna eat like two dykes 'cause I'm famished (I'm famished)
Better yet I'm in the depths of Hungary like Budapest
And even when I'm fed I'ma keep going 'til the death
Call me the collar bomba 'cause I'm blowing minds
Like Osama, that's word to Obama
So much action within my words, there ain't no time for drama
Bringing wisdom like Dalai Lama, you ain't heard?

My name is Castro
Hotter than taking shots of Tabasco
I'm the shit, never constipated I got mad flow
Have you wondering why the fuck did he go do that for?
I don't know even my homies say I'm an asshole
My style is so defined 'cause I'm the definition
Of truth you want proof well then you better listen
I'm never dissin' that's a waste of time
Why waste an amazing rhyme
On them when I can take it and make it mine
I'll make it fine, homie I don't need no one's help
I stay on dimes so you can call me Roosevelt
Yeah, my flow is presidential
I rip it acapella I don't need the instrumental
So try to sleep on me, I leave you like Tom in Seattle

And you're gonna make it some way
No more waitin’ for the bus
And no more riding on the subway
Live life how you want to
So get on up, now, go get out there
Face your fears, no need to be scared
You better rebel
And if they hate you, give 'em hell
No more hiding in your shell
'Cause we are not defined
By how hard we fall
So, dust yourself off and stand tall
‘Cause you can make it

Ohh, yeah

I'ma go where nobody before me has gone
And I know that the journey is gonna be long
Livin' life like a mademan like a don
I was in the dark but now all the lights on
It's real hard on the rise to fame
Cause everybody's mad and you're the one to blame
And just last year you didn't know my name - Logic
Now they all demand it
Used to hate me and I can't stand it
'Cause now you love me you so damn manic
Said I'll never make it said I'll fail
My ship would sink
But motherfucker I sailed
I know I'm gonna prevail
Eyes on the prize right on my trail
Middle finger to the haters that are on my tail
'Cause I got heart boy I got spunk
Feelin' just like Jordan before the dunk
And if you fuck around I'ma put you in the trunk
Ha, I'm just playin around

Ohh, yeah

I swear to God that I love the life I live
And I'm grateful for every breath it gives
I remember thinkin' something's gotta give
New day but it all just feels the same
No clouds but I can feel the rain
Pointin' fingers lookin' for someone to blame (lookin' for someone to blame)
'Til I came across my own name
I wasn't in control of my destiny
Feelin' empty thinkin "Where's the rest of me?"
I gotta make it but I need the recipe
Only then will I find the best of me
I didn't wanna listen, didn't give a fuck
I was so selfish, I was so stuck
Cleanin' up food, for a little buck
Then I quit that, livin' on luck
I was so lost, at what cost?
Why be the worker when you could be the boss?
Still doin' wrong, tryna live right
Get my mind righteous, man, what a fight
Shit gettin' tight, man that ain't right
And my girl left, so I just might
So I just might
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and the
Happiness last, and the
Haters kiss my ass

Would've been a fiend, would've been a drunk
But they believed in me and it perceived to be all I was doing was right
I was born in the dark, but they showed me the light
Now that's what I call homies for life

Logic

Step into the mind of a young man
And if you don't then I don't really give a damn
All I wanna do is make you understand
But if you don't wanna listen I guess you ain't a part of the plan
Sorry if I digress
All I ever wanted was to be the best
Through lyricism that put your mind to the test
Stayin' up, late night, no rest
Feelin' bulletproof, no vest, but I confess
My mind's a mess, living in a world of stress I digest
But I gotta keep grinding
'Cause everyday success what I'm finding
And I don't give a damn if you hate on me
'Cause when I blow what you gon' say homie?
Heh, not a goddamn thing

All I think about is music
Don't get me wrong I think
About other things but this is how I fuse it
So the whole wide world can use it
When you feel like you just might lose it
Take a breath, homie, don't confuse it
Take a step in the mind of Logic
As long as you don't abuse it
So let me break it down for the whole world
Like I broke it down for my old girl
I can't deal with your bullshit
No more, gotta let it go, let it unfurl
'Cause I remember the time
When I was living sublime, wanted to make a living off of my rhymes
But the whole world told me never mind
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
Knocked down, round for round

That I never even been on so I can sit on
Every single piece of paper that I put a pen on
And when I been on for like ten years
I'ma do it better than anybody before me
So the whole wide world will adore me, ain't no need to assure me
And if you wonder why I'm rapping so fast
It's 'cause I gotta lot of things on my mind
That wanna come out at the same time
In other words I'm racin'
I used to pursue my dreams
But now they're reality and that's what I'm chasin'
Why are we on this Earth?
Why must we feel pain?
Why does everybody feel the need
To judge one another when we're all the same?
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)

But after a while, that shit get depressin', they don't wanna hear it
They just wanna turn up so that's when I come back

It's how we stay relevant to the young
I mean I'd rather be rappin' on breaks
But whatever it takes to get to the young

Word to John, oh, you know we got it going on
I'm a silver tongue motherfucker, but it never gone

While my homies smokin' more grass than acres on my lawn

Tell me I got a lot of money I should boast that shit
One minute you the greatest then the next you the worst
"Logic, you too lyrical to be having fun with a verse
You gotta come ten out of ten every time, ten out of ten every rhyme"
It's always gotta be perfect within my mind
But wait, that shit ain't fun to me
Look at what arguably one of the greatest modern rappers in this day and age has done to me
It's made me hate rap 'cause it used to be about passing a skill
Now it's all fucking heading downhill
It's more about the image
Check the game, not the scrimmage
It's not about the music if it's all about the image
And how we use it then what the fuck?
Hip-hop was Run-D.M.C, now it's run from TMZ
Now it's everything you do no matter what it is has to be done perfectly, shit
Somebody hiding behind a avatar said I'm starting to look old
Well I'm 30, what the fuck you expect?
Should I use make-up to cover the wrinkles in my neck?
Should I cut open the back of my skull and pay a hundred thousand dollars so my hair look full?
Should I write music from my heart? Or let a 20-something rapper do all the work while I chart?
Shit, we live in a world of instant reviews
Where people who aren't even your fans dog your art however they choose

Not for struggling critics tryin' to increase their YouTube views

What it truly means, just to be a fan and not constantly critiquing shit whenever you can
'Cause you had a power from that device in your hand
There's no more value in music for people that don't use it
'Cause real talk streaming platforms abuse it
Don't get me wrong
I love having every album, every song, by every artist that ever existed
But I just feel like this A.D.D. culture got it twisted
You really have an opinion on an album in 20 minutes after you listen but you fucking completely missed it
'Cause one million songs drop every seven days
Which only gives one artist in the world a week to be praised
Shit, I'm done playin that game
Making decisions based on money and fame
We all do it and I done it since my mixtapes
But I think I finally found my footing, I found my griptape

And then we kick push, kick push
Kick push, kick push, coast

What you would do if it was twenty mil' or live on the street?
I guarantee your ass is rapping on a radio beat
But it was deeper than that
I used that shit to spread a message that was deeper than rap
Hid the pills in the apple sauce, deep in the trap
Tried to save the world, but found out I couldn't do that
But I know I can affect it like a butterfly
Even though I know I can't protect it, deep down wonder why
And that's the reason I went mainstream, if you wonder why
To spread a message of PLP, make it worldwide
And feed my family for generations
So while you hipster motherfuckers is scared of radio stations
You played yourself, congratulations
Had a goal in my head, and at twenty-nine, I hit it
Multi-million dollar deals, Logic, yeah, we get it
So focused on the past, don't think you listen when I spit it
That kid back in the basement, he made it, he did it
And now my life is different, so I rap 'bout what I know
From the basement to the mansion, there’s maturity in the flow
Fuck rap, who gives a shit? I wanna see my son grow
With a fridge full of food, no wonder where the hunger went
Now I don't rap to prove myself, I pick up the pen to vent
But you people stuck in the past probably take that as content
When your ass should just be happy I'm still giving you content
And to the fans that ain't need me to spell all this shit out
Thank you for riding with me beyond a reasonable doubt
Logic out (Okay)

Here we go

I've been envisioning something different, not insufficient, fuck all the bitchin', I'm on a mission
Like timing, shit is iconic, memories back in the day of the chronic
In my lungs and in my ears, I wrote this shit with blood and tears
Thought about doing it over the years, 85 finally here
Doing this shit for the art, I'ma give 'em my heart like a high-speed collision
And I give 'em my sight as they all want vision, I'm bleeding, no, wait, I'm bleeding
I feel like rap is retreating while my hairline is receding
Which is literally the definition of what I've become
That's an oldhead, wait a minute, go 'head, I'ma go off
2019 I got wrote off, but I'm bringing it back into focus
I'm God-level, here to locust, I'm so pissed like a P.O. 
Rollie gold like C3PO, and I'm busting off like R2
That's COD-level, I'm all through, now fuck you


Our boys have certainly been through a lot today
But they did it, they made it to the show
And to the next chapter of the rest of their lives
Through all the mayhem and adversity
Through all the negativity and hardship
They did it
And here they stand after the show
Radiating a message of peace, love, and positivity
The original RattPack members rejoice
Though deep down, Logic is unsure of something
Not himself or his craft
But something that's been rising to the surface
Something that would take up more space than it should in his mind
Through the next decade
Yo, that shit was crazy
For real bro, we're really on to something
Yo, what's up? Y'all— Y'all tryna grab a bite to eat or something
Mm, I can't
That chick I was rappin' up at the bar finna give me a ride
If you know what I mean, ah fuck
Hahaha, you're fucking wild (Yeah, peace)
Alright man (Alright dawg, I'll see you), alright man, peace
(I'ma head out too, but I'll see you next weekend at everlasting light)
Bet, alright man, I'll see you later (Alright man, I'll see you), peace
Well, I'ma catch a ride with OB I guess, man, I got finals tomorrow
6ix, you're lit as fuck, there's no way you're even gonna wake up
Bro, I'm Indian, we pass exams in our sleep, hahaha
Aight man, alright peace, dawg
Alright man, I'll catch you
Well, and then there were two
Haha, yeah, let me unlock it
You really should be proud man
Yeah?
Yo, bro, shit is happening
You getting shit posted on 2DopeBoyz and This Song Is Sick
Doing some real numbers on DatPiff
Look, shit, just a year ago you were homeless
You been sleeping on my couch for like only a year
And now look what's going on
Yeah, yeah, I guess
What's wrong?
Nah, I— I'm good—
I don't know man, I'm just– I'm excited and I'm terrified
Of what?
I love rap, you know, it's definitely a foot in the door
But I wanna do other shit too, you know
I don't wanna be on stage at fucking fifty years old
Rapping like the vein in my forehead is gonna explode
With the fucking "get down or lay down, hit ya with the Beretta"
Fucking fuck no, man, like
Dude, I wanna sing, I wanna play guitar, I don't just wanna play it safe
I— I'm just a little scared of what people, like
If I— If I make it in rap, what if people expect that of me?
What if that's the image, you know, of
What Logic is or what he isn't? I don't know, I just wanna be able to—
I just wanna be able to do whatever I want
Man, just keep doing what you're doing
Keep spreading that positive message, being positive
The fans are gonna love you, man
And they're gonna love you for putting your heart and soul into this music and making honest music
As long as you keep spreading that positive message, the fans are gonna be with you
It's 2011, who knows where you'll be in ten years?

And now I'm here
Lightyears from where I was before
Mad at the world, ready to leave
I thought I had to be a certain way
I thought I had to act a certain way
Never belonged to begin with
So this is goodbye, this is farewell
To the life I know so well
I'm breaking the chains, I'm ready for change
I've been playing the same old game over and over again
So I stepped away and learned a few things
I thought I hated you 'cause I spoke on things
That you never related to, so here I find myself
It took a lightyear to get past the bullshit
And now I'm right here, unapologetically me
And that's the idea, I wanna do it for free
And never out of fear
I don't wanna try and relive the good years
I don't wanna convince you I'm from the hood, yeah
I don't wanna talk about how good I rap, yeah
I don't wanna perpetuate none of that, yeah, it's all a trap, yeah
It took a lightyear
It took a lightyear
It took a lightyear
To find myself again3Embed

Come on, baby girl, tell me what you want, I got what you need
Said she independent, so don’t get offended if she leave
I said I won’t get offended, I’ll just get some Fendi
And repress my emotions in material shit that can be a distraction
Pussy and money, sometimes I feel the satisfaction
Till I spend that bread and bust that nut and now I’m back, son
After the damage is done
Rearrange the game and let 'em know your name

Touching more pussy than a gynecologist

Baby girl, follow me
She got low, blow my kiss of criminology
And she be loving the way I be flowing
And I know the infatuation is growing
If you catchin' feelings you better be slowin' it down

The fact that we met right here, right now on this night, it must be fate"
Now I’ll be damned, time moves so fast
Couple months back, I had a meeting with my last
Reminiscing 'bout love, discussing matters of the past
Looking in them eyes, but I’m thinking 'bout that ass
I took her for coffee, she took me for granted
Now I show no emotion and my shorty can't stand it
And now you know (And now you know)

Up there with the best of 'em
No style can compare like Marc Jacobs addressing 'em

Yeah, alright, yo—

Couple days ago, I met the illest latina
Her demeanor was unexplainable, you shoulda seen her
Thick thighs, nice ass
Body like an hourglass
Didn’t hesitate to break a brother neck
Second, she passed I was like, “What’s up?”
To which she replied, “How you doin’?”
I said, "De nada momma but your beauty I’m pursuin’
And I said "I’m about to win the lottery"
She asks “How?”
I said, “Your seven digits right now” and made her smile
Now we conversing and she feelin’ my style
I can tell by the way she talkin’
That she down to go the mile
Had a couple drinks, now we headed back to her place
The shade of red from her lipstick all over my face
I’m tryin’ to hit it, split it
Baby girl you gonna let me get it?
She said, “Hold up ok, I don’t get down like that”
I said I know beautiful girl
But I get down like that
So let me heat it up, eat it up
Go crazy and beat it up
“Damn Papi, how you even know I like it rough?”
The way you was feelin’ on me
When kissing revealed enough
I wanna scratch you, provoke you
Bite you, choke you
But just a little, bite your legs
Dig up in the middle
“Hold up, wait a secondNigga, you gotta condom?”
Come on beautiful girl, of course, I’ve got protection
I stay with Magnums and I ain’t talkin’ Smith and Wesson
I keep undressin’
Girl I’m about to teach you a lesson
After I hit it she says
“Bobby I have a confession, I think I love you!”
I said "What the fuck?”
Thinkin’ to myself, "Damn, I shoulda never cuff"
Kissed her on the cheek
Hit the lights, then she fell asleep
So I snuck out the bathroom window on the creep, like

Now I’m out the door
Downtown is where I’m about to go
Got a meeting with my boy Chris about a dope show
So I hail a cab, jump in, but so does some girl
Beautiful, pretty eyes with luxurious curls
I said, “No fair”
She smiled and said, “Why don’t we share?”
What a success, lookin’ at her chest
Thinkin’ if her breasts was a test, she would fail
Fresh tip nails
Type of ass make a brother train of thought derail
As we converse, I could tell that she feelin’ my style
Get the pussy wet, that’s the mission
As long as she listen to my words
Feelin’ on the curves
Only lips I’m thinkin’ bout kissin’ is hers
I can barely fight the urge
Only thing that matter right now
Is these two verbs
I’m talkin’ me and you
So fine, I’d think I’d start seeing you
Her body was a work of art like Hieroglyphics
Too much detail to go into specifics
Now I’m diggin’ shorty
Like an archeologist tryin’ a bone
Searchin’ for a queen to take the throne
The type of girl to love
And call her my own
I’m just a bachelor (bachelor)
Looking for a bachelorette
Baby, maybe you can persuade me
To give you love you couldn’t imagine yet
Kiss you on the neck then I sedate the pussy like a vet
Got the shorty rollin’ like a movie set
Take her to the Rio
I’m not talking about G-burg
I’m talking De Janeiro, spend dinero like its reverb
Expansion
Couple kids runnin' round the mansion
Day dreamin’, getting ahead of my self
Advancin’, but, come on, girl
Now come and give me love
I know we just met but romance is like a drug
You know we go together
Like sympathy and hugs
So I write this girl a symphony
And tell her that I love her everything
Girl, I love your everything
You know I love your everything
I said I love your everything
Yeah, love your everything
Girl, I love your everything24Embed
Dear God, I'm tryin' hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe in

Dear God, I think it's time we had a conversation
These lonely nights is getting to me so my mind is racin'
I think about this life I live and all the shit I'm facin'
More secrets in my mind than a Freemason
I get lonely at times, and then I write these rhymes
I'm only human, I want to hit the club and fuck a dime
But I know that's not the answer to my problems
Lord help me solve them, disintegrate and dissolve 'em
Layin' in bed with a girl I'm pretty sure is my next
Contemplating the sex while I think about my ex
Am I wrong? Yeah
Dear God, am I wrong? Uh (Dear God)
Dear God, tell me, am I wrong?
For livin' the life of a king surrounded by these pawns
Fans telling me I'm the greatest but I never hear 'em
'Cause I ain't hit the pinnacle, yeah, I'm still persevering
Demons whispering in my ears, but no, I never fear 'em
People thinking they on his level they ain't even near 'em
I just want to spread positivity through lyrical ability
They call it selling out but I just call it versatility, yeah
It's my life, my wrongs, and my rights
My battle, my songs, and my fights
Now everybody wanna come around?
Tell me where was you last year when a brother was down?
Not a single one of you motherfuckers believed in the brand
Extended a hand, and now you wanna be my man?
I think not, you quick to shape shift like ink blots
The real Dilla, we cut classic, no fitters
What about the time I was nine and my mama almost murdered me?
Don't think I forgot that shit, it still burdens me
Her bare hands tight around my throat
"I can't breathe" I screamed, "I can't breathe, Mama
Don't you want me, Mama? Don't you love me, Mama?" What the fuck
Where was you then, God? Tell me now
How's a brother supposed to stay sane? Tell me how
Why you let me live but let another die?
Why you dry my tears but let another cry? Gotta know
Set to detonate, I gotta blow, that shit fo' sho
I used to wonder why in the hell you would make me suffer
But now in the end I understand that it made me tougher

Logic

I got a date with destiny
My heart says yeah, but can’t convince the rest of me
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me
I need redemption, no need to mention my past
'Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash
The glitz, the glamour, the lights, the camera, the action
The stage, the fans, the speakers blastin'
You know I want it; I need it, don’t doubt it, I can’t live without it
This is everything I dreamed of, it’s everything I’ve ever wanted
But is it really truly in my plans
Or did God mix up my blueprints?
Did He have it right there in his hands?
Anybody give me a hint
I can feel it now; I know it’s coming
And I don’t give a fuck what anybody say
I’ve fallen, I’ve risen, I chose and selected this mission
Incarceration, through these bars created a prison
And I intend to do the time that the sentence is given
25 to life, yeah, that’s how I’m living
Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever make it
But there’s only one way I'ma know
I’m like a seed planted in the dirt
Feels like I’ve been waitin' forever to grow
And maybe today is the day
And maybe tonight is the night
But one thing that I know fo' sho'
This time, I’ma get it right

Ayy, girl, it's obvious you fine
I just wanna know what's deep inside your mind, maybe we could
Play girl, I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand, but I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
Ayy, girl, I could give you my number
You could give me whatever, we'll have a hell of a time

What up, baby girl? Won't you come here
I put it on my life I seen you somewhere, where you stay at? I'll come there, ha
Ain't no stalking shit, I just wanna talk and shit
Maybe grab a bite then after walk a bit, I just wanna converse
Come on, baby, ain't no need to disperse
Shorty got that type of beauty that inspired this verse, so wassup?
I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't wanna cut, but
It's deeper then that, getting knee deep in the cat
I'm looking for that ride or die type of women, it's what ever
I could be your King, you could be my Coretta
Ain't no better, get you wetter, fuck 'em all
Think outside the box, baby girl, you know I ball
Yes, you know I want it all, so make that shit a double

She a red bone bobby-soxer, I had to stop her
Ha, shorty a dime, so you know I'm tryna cop her
Pop a bottle at our table periodically
Now check the science of that last line, do it logically, no stoppin' me, I
Bet she woulda never guessed I never graduated
'Cause the way I put my words together she infatuated
Mama, I don't want no drama and I'm serious
Pause like a comma 'fore I end it like a period, now
Girl, don't treat me like your ex-man
I'm a beast on the track, but if I am your next man
I'ma treat you tender
Take it slow like one video render
I remember when I seen you for the first time
It was special like when I wrote my first rhyme
So if all I do is grind and never sleep
Then how in the hell is me and the girl of my dreams supposed to meet?

RattPack

So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it, just cease
Got it, capiche? This is my house, you fuckers just lease
Waitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest
Black and white like a nun
These up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn
So follow your father like an apostle
Paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil
Never knowing what's gon' follow
However we never wallow in our sorrow
Just pray for tomorrow
At times my heart could be hollow
Emotions forced to be swallowed
While neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo
This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you
So I'm trying to find her
One moment she'll love you then swallow
You whole like an anaconda
The bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky
I'ma dominate the world like my name is Brain
Spit flame like propane
Bitches I overcame you know the name
Ink in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page
To numb the pain like Novocaine, motherfucker

Murderin' every demographic
Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic
Grip the mic to set the example
While all these muh-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples
Constant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die
Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I
But we persevere force feed enemies truth serum
We want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased
In your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest
Bustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it
I get from point A to point B by keeping it G
Ain't no killer but don't push me
If you grab the heat, you a pussy
Knuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel
I have not a single enemy
Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, in they mind
'Cause I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
And when it comes to dames I catch planes
They catch feelings
Haters keep my name in they mouth like fillings
High as the ceiling
Y'all really don't know who your dealing with now
Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
Thankful for every breath I'm givin'
Fuck social division
On the road to success and there ain't no time for collision
People ask "how you get your flow so amazing"
To which I reply "I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions"
Haters takin' shots but they never graze him
Now if pro is the opposite of con
What's the opposite of progress?
I love my country but that shit a mess
Grew up on section 8, I can attest
And now they wonder why I claim that I'm the fucking best

Now run it back and retrieve it
Till you receive it in your motherfuckin' mind
Only 22 but I feel like I'm 99
Back in 1999, that's when I began to rhyme
Surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine
Daddy was smoking crack, I was raised by a single mom
Fasting every night I ain't talking bout no Ramadan
I was poor as fuck me and my mama, we didn't have a dime
At 16, the school system dismissed him and wished him well
But my mama never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?
So I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own
I left home at 17
Shortly after my mama got stabbed by fucking around in the streets
But she still breathin' which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving
So many rappers biting me you would think they was teething
And now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story52Embed
Without me knowing, they melt my heart to stone

Maybe walk around the park, trust me, girl, I'll stand apart
All women ain't bitches
And all men aren't dogs even though we bark
'Cause I just want to get to know you
Maybe run around and show you what a gentleman is
Yeah, tell me what it do
Shawty, I'm coming for you
Ain't talking about sex, I'm talking about something from above
I'm talkin' 'bout love
I'm talkin' 'bout love, love, love, love, love
Yeah, now that you know that I'm for real
It's the perfect time to kill
Any fear that you may have

This angel has no halo, I don't play no games
You can ask my ex I never eat the box
But if I control her, I may select some freaky shit to start
Then bring it back
We can go for hours, girl I never slept
Tell me how you want it
Face to face or rough and from the back
Just like that, she gon' overwork me if I let her
But I don't give a damn, I just wanna feel better, ayy
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like

"Young Sinatra" "It's like this, man, niggas, man
Niggas know not to fuck around with this shit though
I don't give a fuck how nasty niggas get" "Nah son
Let me tell these niggas something, God
I don't want niggas sounding like me... on no album
Keep it real, get your own shit, man, and be original
"Word up" "That's all, man" "Be a better man"
"And you gon', you gon' come out on your own way
Whatever how you gon' take it, man, fuck it" "Rat Pack niggas"

Ayo, I force MC's to bleed, retreat and recede
That's the Young Sinatra creed, killin' a track with incredible speed
And doin' it like it's nothin', no bluffin', gotta kill it everyday though
Slice MC's like Kato, gotchya head spinnin' like dreidel
Assassinate 'em so fatal, grip the heat and then tell ya to freeze
Gettin' cheddar at negative thirty degrees
I'm talkin' mula, money, euro, dollars, that yen
Blow it, let's spend it again, I'm livin' the life until the end
Can't comprehend what I got goin', never knowin' when Logic flowin'
'Cause I'm creepin', like ether the way that I seep in
Swimmin' in women like the deep end
Chillin' with shorties that smoke reefer and blow like Aretha, uh
Now, Sinatra said the best revenge is massive success
I guess that's women and multiple digits in excess
Ya family broke bread, but my family's bread was soggy
Till my brothers broke bricks like Mr. Miyagi
Now what the fuck…

And if not then let me do my thing" "You are watching a master at work"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think—" (Yeah, uh, yeah) "Logic" (Yeah)

All of a sudden I feel the inner killer emergin'
Never splurgin', bingin' money and never purgin'
Urgin' women to fuck on the rug 'cause it's imported Persian
Then bypass matters of the heart like a surgeon
Now, it's hard to ball when there's problems within the inner circle
One moment they cool as Stefan then flip it like Urkel
Or flip it like keys, yeah, they flip it like ki's
From drug lords overseas that export it with ease
Bitch please, we stack cheese so old, it's mold
I'm 'bout that money, so excuse me if my heart is cold
The magnum deployed, then I destroy mattresses
Late night love affairs with New York City actresses ("Rat Pack niggas")
I broke in the game and destroyed the first couple stages
Visionary takin' over regardless of our ages
Makin' history today to solidify in the pages of tomorrow
The industry is fucked, nothin' but sorrow, but I'm
Playin' for keeps in other words no need to borrow
So you can keep your advances, wack hooks, and pop dances
Don't get me wrong, I'm all about the mainstream
As long as I sign the deal I want and have the same team
And now they trippin' like a flight to Vegas
Tellin' me that I'll never make it and this shit is outrageous
Now what the fuck...
"Bring it on if you think you can hang"
"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"

"Yeah, bring it on if you think—" (Yeah)
(Motherfucker) "Logic"

Therefore you're never mourn like a memory repressed
MC's digest quicker than bullets shot from a gat with the barrel suppressed
One to the dome, two to the chest
If by chance they got a vest, however nevertheless
I'm lookin' for that real deal, shit that make me feel
Pleasure and pain, ain't no way to measure the game
I got haters in fifty-seven languages, watch me vanquish this
The come up, bust quicker than .357 caliber
Sharp as Excalibur, crushin' muthafuckas like Gallagher now
Time is money, something you can never recoup
So stop wastin' mine, hit rewind and then fuckin' regroup
Never messed with them chicken heads, but catch me in the coupé ("Rat Pack niggas")
Never in public 'cause I'm a studio fiend
Rockin' diamonds and gettin' money, we call that ice cream
Now, allow me to give you the scoop, shit, I'll make it a double
I came up around more rocks than Barney Rubble
Murderers and drug dealers, I knew it no rebuttal
Ain't no need to claim it, picked up the heat, but never aimed it
Now Jay gave us The Blueprint, I lay the foundation
Tell ya what I'm facin', bars like incarceration
'Cause my mind is always racin', ain't no time for vacations
I'm never pacin', unless I'm on the phone talkin' business
Get wit' this, best witness like Christmas, I'm fuckin' rappin'
Walk in the spot and all these haters go for the dap and
I never carried 'em, kill 'em with kindness then bury 'em, yeah
I was born with talent, God gave me the gift
And now I pull more strings than guitar riffs
What the fuck…
"Bring it on if you think you can hang"
"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"

Chillin' with my homie SlayDro while he ignites the vapor

Life is a bitch and you cannot escape her
Unless you talking suicide (Sinatra)
What the fuck you mean that I'm changin'? 'Cause I finally got a little bit of money and a Range in my driveway
With a Rattpack smoking on Zimbabwe, crankin' Sinatra, that "My Way"
Bitches they love it, Visionary nothin' above it
Get shorties wet when I rub it, carbon copies they dub it

Lookin' beautiful in it all but I prefer nada (I prefer nada)
Yeah, low maintenance and high scale
Type of shorty that when you get locked up she pay the bail
I used to follow my dreams until I caught up to 'em
People talkin' shit but pay attention to what we doin'
It's never been done, watch me go platinum just for fun
Far from materialistic, but let me stunt, son
You know what I been on, you know where I be at
The proof is within the numbers, they slumber but now they react
I got three tapes, zero tolerance, one of the greats
Put that shit together and what you get, that's where I'm from

We snatch it like interception
Met the girl of my dreams, her love resembled inception
Her sign was a Leo, me, her, and music, that's the perfect trio
Spanish hunny, we met in Rio, future lookin' Cleo
Bitches be braggin', so much money my pants saggin'
VMG is up-to-date but these businessmen be laggin'
Eve bit the apple and Steve changed the world
Gettin' money like Zuckerberg, my bank account is sterol
I am not defined by that in which I do possess
'Cause all it takes is riches to get bitches to undress
I need drive in a lady, not a girl that drive me crazy
Need a girl that don't care if I drive a Honda or Mercedes (Or Mercedes)
Spit fire like Hades, I infect it like rabies
It's all that, shout out to them '90s babies
Never hesitate to supply the heat
What 6ix produces from his chest, we call that shit a heartbeat
I'm a king, you fuckers my pawns
Shortcut to the desktop, I am your newest icon
These bitches they love it, I truly can't stress it enough
Girl, got them daddy problems, that's why she be actin' tough
Innocent in person, but in the bed she love it rough
Runnin' away from reality to sniff coke and puff, so
Let me get it, the second I spit it you know that I did it, everybody wanna come around
They used to hate it, but now they love the sound

Welcome everyone to the Sinatra spectacular
Yeah, yeah, you already know what it is
RattPack boy
Castro
Logic (Logic)
Sinatra
Real all the time

Yeah, pass the mic before I jack it like gore-tex
Bust like raw sex, rappers suck like vortex
The life of a Don- We living like kings, and killing our pawns
Boy, the seconds it’s on, don’t know where we going
I’m flowing and killing this shit from dusk til dawn
Just had sex with a Middle Eastern girl- The pussy was bomb
That last line made no sense like these rappers’ careers
But I make dollars, 'cause I’m all about the fiscal year
Yeah; you don’t like me? I’ll conjure up and summon all your fears
You wanna fight me? I’ll woop my own ass before you get here
Wanna write me? And tell me that my rhymes suck?
Bitch I don’t give a fuck, I’ll stab you in the gut, call it a tummy tuck
You can ask my ex, I bust quicker than two techs
Caressed by a kid with category 5 tourettes
In other words, I squeeze with ease, dot my I’s and cross my T’s
I’m a perfectionist; the lesson is fuck everyone assessing this
It’s hip-hop, not to be taken literally
However on the light of note I stayed with bills like Hillary
My flow convects, murder subjects with little respect
Best protect your neck, before you play my tape better inspect the deck
Fuck every other rapper forever ever forever since the dawn of time
Sike- I’m not that much of a dick when I rhyme
On another level like duplex, bust heads like suplex
Slaughter emcees then ask who’s next
You might also like
Ayo my crew next, but you say you next, so I guess we now
Priceless flow so even if I write, it’s still a freestyle
Never busting gats I ain’t no gangster put that heat down
Then go and grab a mic and see if you can fuck with me now
I got that A plus flow I’m on a roll bitch I can’t fail
Making money with my mind, call that shit a brain sell
Raise hell, like I’m Satan’s daddy while you in here
Catch me in a tinted caddy with a bitch from Cincinnati
With the thickest fatty while I hit the gas, you lick it gladly
With the window down see other bitches blowing kisses at me
It’s a fact that me and Logic rip with vicious rap to list a wrap
We spittin’ crack to keep the fiends, coming back to show world
Reppin' Maryland but I make music for the whole world
Seduce a chick with lyrics whenever she hear it, it make her toes curl
So sick I hope I don’t hurl, if you love me let me go girl
'Cause no pussy come before my flow, just had to let you know girl
Spit it so thorough and in depth, I bet I leave you impressed
RattPack be my family, I fuck with y’all no incest
Only interest is to blow up, and watch they hands go up
'Cause I used to throw shows back then but no one would show up
I ain’t all about the money but I want it homie sho' nuff
'Cause Krispie crazy bout’ the cream, you could say I’m dough nuts

I murdered my manager Chris last night
We exchanged a couple words, he said some things I didn’t like
I said "Okay…" then punched him in the face with a butcher knife
I want more like Ashton Kutcher’s wife
Now can you feel it? They won't (Sinatra)
Gimme what I want, so fuck it I’ma steal it
I’ll dilapidate you, grab the butter knife and decapitate you
Yeah that’s what I said – huh, and bitch I did it
We all have thoughts like this; I’m just willing to admit it
I would never act upon these thoughts now, don’t you get it?
It’s like when a gentleman sees the baddest bitch and thinks, “I’d hit it!”
But he never says it; I’ll dump your body in a dessert
It’s the wrath of a psychopath clutching a razor blade in a bath
Having his last laugh, anticipating a gash- the other night I murdered captain crunch
Right in front of Toucan Sam and a whole damn bunch
That’s life, what can I say? I’m a cereal killer, venereal dealer
And yes you know they ain’t none other iller
It’s Logic
Just last week, I murdered a rock
Injured a stone, Hospitalized a brick
I’m so mean, I make medicine sick23Embed
Yeah

Will I make it? I don't know
From the bottom of my heart I swear to God I gotta blow
This for every time the world told me no
If I don't make it in this game I ain't got nowhere else to go
From the drama to the hoes, from the records to the shows
I gotta make it, and if they don't give me what I deserve
Then I'ma take it, I've been underrated, underestimated and hated
But I can't wait to look back and say that I made it
'Cause nowadays everyone's a rapper and I hate it

Y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh
Said y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh

I had to face my demons and embrace all of my fears
While you was out partying, chilling and sipping on some beers
I was sacrificing adolescent years
Blood, sweat, and tears to find out what music really is
And now I'm feeling, I'm feeling like the moment has arrived
Where Bobby is no longer living and Logic has revived
From his ashes, music, money, liquor, I'm fucking passed this
Lyricism that's driven from a master, you bastards

And now I fuck with bitches just to mask my insecurities
'Cause pussy ain't nuttin', but my heart is sure full of something
Now I'm, colder than ever, pushing through any weather
High score flow, ain't none of y'all close to my level
Mental state of a winner in the shoes of a beginner
Visualizing my horizon through the eyes of a sinner
Noticing how the line between me and fame is getting thinner

Is it a blessing that I'm messing with girls
That wanna undress in the back of my car, or is it just 'cause I'm a star?
Or is it just 'cause I'm a star?
Five-foot-seven, look like she fell from heaven
With an ass hotter than the devil, please call a reverend
She was black and asian, part Hispanic and part amazing
Women they feen' us, merely because we are the keenest
My heart only has one love like Serena and Venus
You know I am the meanest genius with the biggest (hey!)
See, baby girl, I know you got some problems
Just know I'm here to solve 'em, revolve 'em, cock 'em back and dissolve 'em
I swear I take care of all em' but you gotta trust it
Love it, open your heart before you lust it, now bust it, what

But you know what niggas call me?
AKA, Riley Escobar, know what I'm saying?
Cause I be in the streets you know?
I got all kinds of names like HR Paper Stacks
Uh, also known as AKA Horse Choker, uh
Hey, yo, I'll chop you up in sixteen pieces
In front of your nieces, while I'm eating Reese's
And won't even offer them any, yes I spit plenty
This is East Coast flow at its finest
In the studio, where you find us, put a bullet where your spine is
At sixteen I was skipping school and smoking chronic
While you was learning about English, Big L was teaching Ebonics
I spit fire so demonic, writing code like I'm masonic
A Jedi master breaking it down like old plaster
No medication for this track cause this is how a psycho rips
My bank account is like casino vaults, your pockets microchips, uh
Motherfucker, I dare you to test it, hope you're well rested
Whoop your ass and get arrested, in a double breasted
Louis Vuitton diamond encrested tailor made suit
Now that's All Sinatra Everything
I explode like hollow tips on contact
Chronologically murder schmoe there's no bringing Joe back
Puffing cubans and sipping Cognac
Mafietic mentality, introduce me to this beat and it's fatality
I kill mics like Conrad Murray
Sharp like Hanzo steel, the rest is obtuse
I get loose when sipping Goose and rhyme like Doc Seuss
Flow tight like noose, whoop ass like Bruce, no time for a truce
Alphabetical mathematic addict
I spit sixteens so erratic you think it was a semi-automatic
I know by now you thinking "Oh my God, he let them have it"
But that was just a loan, time to collect like I'm Capone
Reap what I've sewn, in other words that is the throne
Chilling while homies smoking marijuan'
If you thinking that this shit is wack well then you're dead wrong
Cause for every emotion and every mood I have a song
For the club, for the streets, for the whip and for the sheets
Cause this is where intellect and versatility meets

I am not a poet, I am just a designer of words
Architect of sentences the way I form and merge
Paragraphs together that force emcees to submerge
With an urge to break free of this biracial jail cell
Feast on my memories, please come and taste this
Papa was a black man, mama was a racist
Growing up she called me nigga, kids called me cracker
While the whites got whiter, and the blacks got blacker
I was hurting, doing everything I can
Perceived as a white boy with the soul of a black man
Goddamn, looking up to Malcolm X
Studying his speeches, underlining text
How can I be white devil if my parents had sex?
'Cause I'm black and I'm white
And I'm proud of every word that I recite
I know my roots, I know my past
I know the issue of my race ain't gonna last
We all breathe the same air and bleed the same blood
And when we die, the same ditch gets dug

I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream... One day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."You might also like18Embed

But I was something all along
Who you know on the come-up doing numbers in Hong Kong?
Got fans in LA, got fans in NY
Got fans down in Atlanta and all the way to the Chi'
We world wide (World wide)
World wide motherfucker
They think we pay for promotion but our strength is in numbers
It's so comical, so hilarious
All these stupid groupie bitches want to marry us
And just a year ago, I had to pay to perform
And now venues across the country dropping stacks to go on
I've been working for years and sometimes I get heated
But those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it
I do it for the fans, they know what the message is

You gotta crawl 'fore you walk, I ball but you block
Share knowledge like it's stocks since the West Deer Park
Back in the days a 9 millimeter strays that grazed
My old apartment
Wherever I dreamed, that's where my heart went
Now, as a baby my Mama was on the bottle
Couldn't wait 'til I was of age to hit the lotto
Or the throttle and I'm gone
Like fuck the world, all I had was music and my girl
'Til that shit fell apart and this life unfurled
Nevertheless, I attest "Am I blessed?" Hell yes
Occasional stress, but I only bite what I can digest
Back in the day it was jeans and white tee's
Now I got so many sponsors I can't keep up with the companies
Now I'm not bragging about material possessions
I'm trying to teach you a lesson about business and progression
And what happens when you perfect the image in your profession
Ain't no second guessing, you know it's all about perception
I used to talk about the things I wasn't really doing
But I had to visualize it before I began pursuing it
Yeah, huh, and now a motherfucker doing it
But business aside, it's been a beautiful ride
'Cause I do it for the fans and brush the haters aside
I can't wait for the day I'll look within the eyes of my bride
'Cause every lion needs its queen to make its children its pride
But these haters really don't know what the message is
(Message is)
Don't know what the message is
Once again, don't believe it? Check the messages

Just a youngin' with a dream
Both his parents were some fiends
Living life behind the scenes
He was destined for that cream
Smoking weed, sipping liquor, skipping school
Falling quicker as he elevates with fame
All the haters they gonna bicker
Yeah, but little did he know
He was set to detonate and surely blow
That's just how the story go
Motivated just to flow
White boy with the soul of a strong negro
Let them know daddy black mamma white that's how he roll
Will he drink from the coloreds?
Will he sip from the whites?
1950s, water fountains , fuck them both that shit ain't right
Now, raised with killers
Wolves and drug dealers
Living on food stamps and sleeping on dirty pillows

I'm living every rappers dream
Motivated by my team
Now lets take it back a bit
2006, that was the scene
Spilling ink upon my paper
High as a sky scraper
Now I'm spitting so hot that I'm salivating vapor
Forced to be reckoned
Spitting at a million mother fucking words per second
With punches like Tekken
The moment the mic beckons
This is everything, all I got
And I'mma be rhyming until they drop the casket
I mastered impeccable flows that could not be captured
The God of this rap shit
I just raptured the game
I'm the man
And you might think I'm cocky but that's not me
I say that I'm the best to envision what I want
While you partied getting' drunk
I wrote endlessly for months
Now I got so many rhyme books they can't fit inside my trunk
Now I got so many rhyme books they can't fit inside my trunk

A natural born killer
Egotistical pistol packing mystical blood spiller
When that full moon hit
Grab the mic and I'mma leave the room lit
For the people that never gave a shit
I'mma give the world hit after hit
This is my destiny
Recipe for success is the best of me
Thank God for blessing me
With a life in this hip-hop world
In the moment that it all unfurl
Ain't no way that I'm looking back
You know I live for this, die for this
Laugh for this and I cry for this
Hip-hop metropolis
Ain't no one toppin' this
Haters ain't stoppin' this
Moment I'm droppin' this
Fans will be coppin' this
Take a moment let it sit and hall of fame is where I'm headed
Set to detonate and bitch I'm blowing up like Armageddon
Oh, I can't wait to say
I can't wait to say

Alright
In the sky it's a bird, it's a plane, nah, who that?
Everybody want me to save 'em, I can't do that
Got a little shine and they wonder where the loot at
The life of an artist, I had to pursue that

Superman all the time, yeah, true that
That's why I laugh, when they ask, "Man, where the suit at?"
I love my family, love my friends
But when it comes down to money see it all depends
'Cause now I got new family, I got new friends
That I never even seen before, where does it end?
See, I got loved ones and I got enemies
But at the end of the day, I don't know their identities
Are they loving entities or people
Befriending me for the fame?
Breaking in the game, life'll never be the same
It'll never be the same, and they all like

You are my superhero
I said it, I said it
You are my superhero

I was gone for a minute, came back in a flash
Spit crack, up a dude's rock, like dash
Any dame, know I got game, go ask
This is my true identity, no mask
Most wish to get it and rub on a flask
I wish to get it and rub on her a—
Hip-Hop, what I'm talking 'bout, you ain't on
And a metaphor, means I am hands on
Out for the green, with a buzz, like Hornet
I ain't rip the game yet, I just torn it
See? The good guy gets the dame
And if a shawty got a donk, like Lois Lane
I turn into the parapalegic, from X-Men
You ain't get it? I'm all about the brain
Step to the mic, he a beast
Hungry in the game, still looking for a feast
All about my dough on the rise like yeast
And I'ma keep going 'til I motherfucking decease
See I stood on the side humbly, like Alfred
But now it's time, to jump in the bat outfit
And I could give a damn, if you doubt it
'Cause when I hit the stage, they shout it
Uh, yeah, they shout it, what'd they shout? They shout

You are my superhero
I said it, I said it
You are my superhero
Know the flow never awkward, man
Stepped in the booth, they like, "I'll be damned"
Kid opened his mouth and shocked me, man
And I get the honeys wetter, than Aqua-Man
See? That's that sex appeal
I guess that'll add another mill', to the deal
But right now, I'm just tryna get a meal
In the Bat-cave, sharpening the skill
With an Iron-Man mindset, they can never steal
Villain on the mic though, yeah, I had to kill it
I wrote this rhyme, in braille, just for you to feel it
Let the flow pour for a minute, but I gotta seal it

Hopefully now, y'all know me, got a grip on the game
Like it was fresh up out the Sony

You are my superhero
I said it, I said it
You are my superhero10Embed
Ahem
You, you, you, you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

Uh, uh, when the vibes is right
Chillin' with the homies, tryna dodge the plight
Rapper by day, but I'm a dad by night
You can have all the money, but your time finite
Uh, yeah, you know we doin' it right
Family over everything's a beautiful sight
Cruisin' in the Bronco on a Tuesday night
Most don't live they lives by the rules they write

Rappin' through the evenin' 'til I see the daylight
OutKast, fuck the crowd and whatever they like
Logic known for tellin' stories like a playwright
Stay Black, brothers and sisters it's how we stay right
This that midnight marauder shit
Flow seamless over the beat, it's kind of like a partnership
Aren't you nervous you aren't the best? I never even thought of it
Ha, yeah
'Cause, see, for me, it's not a contest
I want all my brothers to win, all my brothers to win
For me, it's not a contest
I want all my brothers to win, all my brothers to win (Uh, uh)
I'm pressin' in (Uh, uh), the lesson is (Uh, uh)

Yo, that's Castro's apartment right there
Here he comes
Ayo, for real, like, I kind of gotta talk to him about tonight
Ah, yeah, fuck, what's up, niggas?
What's up?
Oh, what's up, bro, how you doin'?
Bro, I'm fuckin' excited
Me too, man
Man, I can't wait, we gonna kill that shit
Ayy, Lenny, you got a Newport?
Yeah, I got you
You got a lighter?
What? Nigga, goddamn, niggaYou want me to smoke that shit for you too?
Damn, bro
Fuck, man, here
Thank you, what you wake up on the wrong side of the bread?
Ayy, Castro, man, I gotta talk to you about somethin'
What's up?
Look, bro, I love you
But I don't think you understand the definition of a hypeman
What you mean?
What I mean is that— look
It's the hypeman's job to alleviate pressure from the main act, you know?
So, when I come and I say
"My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my"
That's when you supposed to come in and say "grind"
While I take a breath, okay, so I can rap the next part
Nigga, I know what a hypeman is
No, you obviously don't, 'cause you too hype
You be rappin' the whole verse and shit, on stage, what the fuck?
Man, calm the fuck down, Logic
You too hype right now, it ain't that deep
Man, whatever, man, just let me hit that Jack
We'll be at UMD in like twenty minutes
Well, good thing I brought beat CDs
You did?
Duh, Lenny, throw this in, I'm tryna freestyle
Who goin' first?Embed
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'ma get it right now, and never will I give up
Homie, this is food for thought, you better fill up
I'm coming in strong but this song ain’t very long
So I gotta make you understand before the beat is gone
Homie you are not alone, we are in the zone
We are in The Matrix, full of that fake shit
Make you wanna grab the gat and go apeshit
Living in a world of lies I can't take it
Needed someone to save me, Needed someone to hug me
Needed a whole world but nobody would love me
And I learned from this that people wanna buck me
And I've learned from this, to put no one above me
I said I can't take it I know I'm gonna make it
I know I'm not normal but I gotta fake it
I swear I'm not cocky, I am just confident
That when I step on the stage I am dominant and now I am beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darling

Sick of living in the dark so I'm begging for the light
Feeling like I'm in a fight every single time a write
'Cause I gotta make sure that they hear me right
Told me that I couldn't do it so when I pick up the mic
I gotta kill it with something so real that when they hear it
They can feel what's in my soul
Lyrical coke-head, yeah homie I gotta blow
But first, they gotta know who I is
So I'm begging for recognition on the mission just to do it big
'Cause I ain't new to this I'm true to this
Thinking I'ma stand up and roll out, homie that's ludicrous
Not here to play no games, I’m here to stay and make a change
In major ways, so I remain up in the studio for days and days
Spittin' out these razor blades, don't wanna place no blame
But without you, I couldn't get to where I'm heading
So to everybody, I'm beggin'

Yeah, yeah, I said this is my path don't mess with me
I didn't choose this life it was destiny
God tested me to find the best of me
And I know I'm going to make it even without a degree
'Cause the test scores don't mean shit to me
And when you said that I would fail it didn't get to me
Now I'm beggin', public masses, please
I'm way too proud to get down on my knees
But I'm beggin', put me on the level
Fuck Illuminati, that's word to the devil
'Cause I am not about that, I just wanna love
I just wanna grow, I just wanna learn
The passion, it burns to write this music
I'm so late that I just might lose it
But don't ever confuse it, it's all so worth it
I just wanna help hip-hop, not hurt it
And as for my style I don't know how to word it
Why do you even have to categorize me?
Fuck it let 'em hate, let 'em all despise me
Cause I'm gonna take this, flip it up and make this
Something that the whole world cannot imagine
Let alone fathom I'm from another planet
I swear I'm not manic, listen to me damn it
My future's in your hands and so I'm beggin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' You
Put your loving hand out, darling
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you

I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible: Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there’s room for everyone and the good earth is rich, and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls...
"Sinatra" "Sinatra shot ya, goddamn you"
"Is this what you want?" "Logic"
"You are watching a master at work"
"You have interfered with our affairs for the last time"

Many men wish to acquire fame for the wrong reasons
Fans telling me never change, but it's hard to fight the seasons
They hear me on the radio and now they yelling "Treason"
'Cause Logic givin' 'em mainstream verses like Ephesians
But I never sacrificed my lyrics or my flow
There's a time and place for everything, so what the fuck you yelling for?
The fame hit me quicker than previously determined
RattPack, real all the time, fuck a vermin
Motivated by money, sex, drugs and violence
'Cause the era that we living in was built up on defiance
What we need is alliance, but y'all don't really hear me though
So, hip-hop's a chariot and Logic's finna carry it
Stallion, coming for their necks like a medallion
Straight out of Sierra Leone
Motherfuckers it's on, I'm under your skin like cortisone
Ninty-nine percent of these motherfuckers is bullshit ("Sinatra")
But I'm on that Bull shit: Michael Jordan
Cutting records after the show in my hotel while I'm touring
Yeah, and I ain't even twenty-three
But my bank account can vouch, I'm ballin' like an M.V.P
Yes, it's me, L.O.G.I.C, I'm repping MD
Now what the fuck is a vacation? I see no satisfaction
I work twelve hours a day every day with no distraction
Seven days a week, and twelve hours, that's a lazy day
Going seventy-four hours with no sleep, call that a crazy day
"As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours"
This is Manhunt, and I ain't stopping till y'all apprehended
Many years I have attended and finally been commended
For keeping it real, so finger fuck whoever I've offended
Now pull out the MAC and watch them freeze like PC's
I'm Celsius, never graduated, so fuck degrees
I educate 'em with ease, however listener please
Don't knock that last line, school it just wasn't for me
We all different and I'm here to make a killing
So say hello to the villain, 'cause in this day that we livin' in

All my lyricism heads where y'all at?

I spit fifties and shit hundreds, do shit that's undid
Spontaneously combust in these bitches guts
I get 'em wet, no need to touch
Break they back like dutches
Keep em close like the toast I clutch
Never the less, I'm never depressed
I keep feelings suppressed
One of the best but need to listen if I'ma progress
I'm ready to live, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to ride for rap
I said it on a record, now I can't take it back
Stop, I shut it down like a blood clot
Smoke emcees, like a fuckin bumbaclot
Mic check, I come to catch wreck
Death before dishonor so I'm coming for your neck
I pop emcees like hymens
Y'all glass posing as studs but I'm a diamond
I reckon you need to listen, I'm never dissin'
Unless your shit is wack, I'll beat you into submission
Catch me fishin', cause I'm eating for a lifetime
Wisdom in my mind, I'm a star watch me shine
Fucking your bitch from behind

Yeah, turn my headphones up
That's all you sayin' but I'm sprayin' and I can't get enough
Raw, rugged and rough, my alter ego Mr. Tough
I'll call your bluff, face to face never snuff
I murder you with predicate poetic balletic shit
No mercy, 'cause if I grip the mic they might curse me

Why act like you don't want it girl? (Tell me what you want)

Baby girl when it comes to women, I've been around the block a couple of times
But you're the only shorty that's running circles in my mind
And in this day and age that we live in, and it's all defined
Why you so intellectual? Why you so damn fine, now
Hey girl, hey girl yeah I'm trying to get it
Stop with all these games and tell me what up with it
Just take my hand, I'll be your man
We surrounded by infidelity in this world that we live in
But I promise I'll never give in, that's a given
I'm living for you and none other
Just a brother trying to find a lover to cherish until he perish
With honeymoons on the stars and vacations in Paris
Don't be embarrassed if you get addicted to these kind of things

I might as well applaud it
Lord have mercy I'm trying to get it
Rip it and split it, hell yeah you know I did it
Converse then lay you down like a verse, I'm trying to hit it
Baby I want it, always down to keep it a hunnid
With you my feet are never on the ground, no way I'ma plummet
Headed to the summit, so tell me are you really 'bout it?
I never doubt it, you're the one that I need
Apart from you my emotions begin to recede
You're everything that I have wanted and all that I need
So shorty tell me how you feelin', worth feelin', looks killin'

Visualizing the realism of life in actuality

Various women, I'm swimming in, like a shark
Tear the pussy apart, shawty it's on after dark
Step to the mic and now I got ya, call me Young Sinatra
The flow is prominent, hella dominant, on time with it
When I'm rhyming it, several labels itching to sign with it
Now check the women I'm bringing in with these ill synonyms
Softly killing 'em, in other words; I'm Lauryn Hillin 'em
I swear to god if I could I'd never turn the page
Living the rest of my days on stage
Fucking with bitches that never age
I'm so fly that I defy the laws of physics
I ain't think it was possible for a check to have this many digits
Mathematically exquisite, am I cocky—just a smidget
If you want beef then we can supersize it
Freshman in the game
So they wanna haze me like my name Isaac
I killed the beat and dig a ditch just to fossilize it
To make sure none of you bammers try to reprise it what

Life's a bitch and then you die

I'm working a nine to five just to survive, barely staying alive
Hard to stay focused without the drive
See I bus tables and my homie Castro is a waiter
I can't wait to blow and say "I told you so haters!"
Living the life of a egotistical pistol gripper
Isn't a life for me, I'd rather grip mics and undo girls zippers
But not them ho girls, meet me after the showgirls, them take it slow girls, have 'em coming back for mo' girls

Visualizing the realism of life in actuality

Various managers coming up talking 'bout they got me
But really they shadier than Slim in a pair of Versaces
I know you see me shining, and practicing and grinding
While they conform to the norm you'll catch me designing
A different type of sound
While you was stuck inside the box, I had already been around
Inner peace and happiness I'm always tryna' find it
And I kinda got the feeling that a woman is behind it
So I'm always chasing tails the real-life Sonic
And I'm always spitting fire half black, half demonic
Nah, I'm half black and half white
C'mon this sound it had to come from somewhere, right?
Nah, nah, see homie race is not the issue
And if you stepping to me like it is I'll dismiss you
The second you listen, the second I got you
I swear to god I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra
Life's a bitch and then you die

I did it today, I made myself say
And I take back my tears, my sight, my love
No more does your magic work, on my heart
No more will your words ever tear me apart
I know now for certain, nothing's burning anymore
 Days of Summer]
"I love her smile, I love her hair, I love her teeth. I love this heart-shaped birthmark she has on her neck. I love the way she sometimes, licks her lips before she talks. I love the sound of her laugh."

I can feel it now, it's coming soon
It is my world, my sun and moon
Once upon a time, this world was love
But now I know this is everything that I've dreamed of
So take it slow, speed it up
Every time I see you I just want to beat it up
Maybe not, but that's a lie
C'mon baby girl, there ain't no need to cry
Just let me go or let me know
Why the hell you wanna stick around fo'
Arms length, that's all you do
Don't get too close, that is the rule
I remember when I met her back in high school
Science class, sitting on the stool
Now I'm feeling—feeling like a fool
'Cause I cut that tie months ago, this girl is cruel
Or maybe not, just very lovely
No matter what she says I know she still loves me
So can I love?—I've already asked
Who would've known matters of the heart
Would be such a task?

"I hate summer, I hate her crooked teeth. I hate her 1960s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her cockroach-shaped splotch on her neck. I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks. And I hate the way she sounds when she laughs."

She used to be my girl
But now she just a girl I'm fucking
She used to mean the world to me
But now that world is nothing
I would've put a ring on that finger but I couldn't afford it
So I laced it with ribbon, she adored it
Sometimes I wonder if she thinks of me
But my mind tells me to focus on work so instinctively
How could the pussy be that good?
'Cause my feelings involved
'Til my shorty evolved and her feelings dissolved
But that's what happens when you find them young
Treat them like royalty, and they will run
Searching the world for perfect love and realize you're the one
But they fucked up cause now that shit is done
This is a letter to the woman of my dreams
Love what she brings
So listen baby girl cause everything ain't what it seems
You either know me now or I'mma meet you after fame
But one thing's for sure, your life will never be the same
'Cause you're gonna be my wife and my mistress
So understand now I can't be there for every Christmas
I love you more than anything, but I could never risk this
On stage living life, while you're forced to miss this14Embed

I don't give a fuck if your shit went platinum
You can't fathom how in the fuck I'ma combat 'em
We independent, pick up the mic and I'ma vent it
If I said it, I meant it
Came from the bottom and I sent it
Now I think I'm a good father figure 'cause I was sonnin' rappers before I was a father, go figure
My cryptocurrency is in the seven figures
If you talkin' shit I roll up on you with like elevеn my niggas, ready to come and get us
Fuck with us, it's mе and all my hitters
Made a couple pop songs, made a hundred million, gross
Made a life for myself, for every night I need a toast
I was doing the most, said fuck rap, watch me ghost
I been raising my son, blazing for fun, baskin' in the rays of the sun on my face
Took a step back, damn, I think I finally found my happy place
They say it's not a sprint, I say, "It's not a race"
Comin' up in rap ten years ago, I felt so out of place
Shit was different, if you had beef, you did it face-to-face
Check the pace, yeah, it's fly like drum and bass
I been whippin' that Bronco, bumpin' that "Murder was the Case"
Now I'm givin' it up for the real motherfuckers that love rap, no cap

Everything that I have, I'm thankin’ God for it now
I'm takin' all of my trees, proceed to breakin’ it down
Though with fuckin' with ground level, we in the clouds
Stay reclined in my seat, smokin', leanin' it back
Livin' like rock and roll, but still doing this rap music
Movin' through stats, always movin' the crowd
If Wiz Khalifa's on your campus, then I’m probably smokin’ loud
With a bad one comin' out, talkin’ 'bout
Keep your cool so we don't hear the hate and doubt
They just mad 'cause they ain’t make it to the clouds
Tried they best, but they just ain't gettin' accounted for
We ain't goin' back and forth
I ain't just start multiple trends, I open doors
Provided a style for you and yours
I made the class, you studied the course
Game's to bе sold, not told, hope that you could afford it
Make sure thе private plane cold as soon as I board it
More concerned with stocks and mortgages than little boy shit
Famous girl, she on my line, she need a dick appointment

That's hard, haha
Yeah, yeah (Haha)

Tell me who really want it
Everything that they talking about, I already done it
Don't fuck with they narrative and how they spun it
Like Clive Campbell, I'ma set an example
My flow ample over this sample
Leave the beat trampled, never one to ramble
Head to toe in that camo, blowing up trees like Rambo
This is the way, bitch, I'm repping that Mando
Got a lot of money, don't need a Lambo
Back in the day, I was in a minivan, though
Back in the day, I was in a minivan, oh
Sippin' on something and whippin' it slow
2010, I remember when I was living in my godmother's in G-Burg
That's my word
Bumping Mac Miller K.I.D.S., Kush & O-J Wiz
Look in the mirror, I'm hoping it's his day
Give a fuck what the kids say
Logic bringin' it back to the rap shit
That 2 Dope Boyz, DatPiff (Yeah, yeah)
Give a fuck about a rap list, one in a million, I'm on that list
On the map like a atlas, talk shit, get hit with a fat lip
Smoking that buddha then dip in the pussy, we call it the catnip
Run the game like a 3090, leave 'em all behind me

And I'ma keep it up until the tomb
And as for the fame, yeah I know it's coming soon
Cause I'm goin' in raw, finna bust up in your room
I hit a beat and it's ergence to emerge in the game
Pukin Hodukens I'm too sick to spit that Yoga flame
The way I see it, this is rap second renassaince
Spittin' dirty sentences, so ill they affecting medicine
Ha, I'm heaven sent and spittin' fire like a demon
As the internet I let my flow to get to streamin', I'm beamin'
Flawlessly listen in that women in yo head while you dreamin'
Leo Dicaprio flow all up in that bitch schemin'
Tryna' get you to buy that album, tryna get you feenin'
See my vision as I commentate it
You wanna see naked rerun of the bait but the hater ate it
Success is truly overrated
I've seen caster with a blow up to pop and get deflated
See yeah, you made it but all your fans hate it

They gon' be bumpin' me from the burbs to the projects
I get on the mic and excite anybody around me
You're probably wondering why a label has not found me
It's not that easy, I gotta work from the ground
Be the center of attention, look at the people around me
Black on the inside, my outside Ritz
What's a cracker without the cheese?
I gotta stack chips

"Would you care for a glass of grape juice?"
"Nigga, what the fuck is juice?"
"You have interfered with our affairs for the last time."8Embed

Even if you knew the whole clan, couldn’t protect this
Don't deflect it, you motherfuckers is defective
So get back on that assembly line
I'm schooling these emcees with assembly rhymes
I'll bе goated by the end of my timе
More tracks than Amtrak by the end of the line
I'm harder to find, Maryland state of mind
From the womb to the prime
In my room with a pen and a pad and mad lines
Like a theme park
My life is full of action like when the scene start
Think I ain't the illest? You trippin' like when the plane depart
You know I been killin' the game from the start
I'm the reason your kids afraid of the dark
I leave you bankrupt for real
Can't pay your light bill, how you feel?
Stupid motherfucker, oh yeah you got a deal
But you spent your whole advance on a chain
I invested mine in crypto, and now I'm sailin' out to Spain
Hah, my yacht three-hundred feet
Everything that I retained all came from cuttin' teeth
Hanzo flow, I'm so sharp I cut the sheet
Good grief, only undercover if I'm cuttin' under sheets

Ayy, look to my left and see my brother sellin' drugs
Look to my right and see my sister's fuckin' thugs
Ain't it funny how this life go? One moment, you're in the dark
But when that light glow, it's like you're seein' for the first time
As I penetrate your mind like a burst of ammunition that was shot out of a nine
I'm givin' everything I got, so, yeah, it better be my time
They said I'd never make it, that's the reason I still rhyme now
Feelin' like Annie singin' 'bout the Sun
No food in my stomach, hopin' that tomorrow gon' come, yeah
Maybe it won't, but I pray it will
'Cause drug dealers on the corner, they finna spray you at will
And this music is a dream that I plan to fulfill
Starin' at the morgue through my windowsill

Doing whatever the fuck I wanna do when I wanna do it
People thinking they know it, but they never knew it
What it be like, the spotlight, the hot takes and long nights
Yellin' at nobody and winning all of the wrong fights, it's alright
I'm off like a flight, took a left, did it right, what a sight
Knowing everything gon' be alright, likе K. Dot, 2015
It seem the art that I make over thеy heads like the Sistine
It really feel like ain't nobody ever listening
That's why I do it for me and the homies and nobody else
Making beats in my room by myself
Kinda funny how my last studio cost seven zeros
But I make the best shit when I'm all alone in my room
College Park coming soon

Hell is hot and we can make your residency permanent
Several shots, they tyin' up your body with a tourniquet
Let it rock, it's obvious that he don't know who turn it is
Keep my circle tight-knit 'cause people move deceitful
Money and greed will expose you to the root of evil
Already proved myself, not worried 'bout who's my equal
Far from an anti-vaxxer, but I move the needle
Shit got me wonderin' if what I do is legal
Fuck it, I'm goin' a hundred in this Buick Regal
Fuck it, I'm goin' a hundred playin' Beanie Sigel

Only engulfed in darkness, can you see the light like common sense?
But to my defense, that way of thinkin' past tense
Life's a bitch and shit can get screwed like when you campin', that's fuckin' intense
On tour the fans screamin' the West like cravin'
You know I deal with shit that'll make the average man's chest cave in
On the scene daily, this just in, word to Hailey
I write about the world around me like a journalist
It's funny how people that don't listen to me concerned with this
It's 'cause they have to be, these motherfuckers weaker than muscle atrophy
This life feels like a simulation, man, it has to be
Walked through the world, the whole shit is just one giant catastrophe
Speak on mental health, the people laughed at me, that's why I tapped out
Retired 'cause I felt rapped out
Feel like people more connected with shit that's not what rap's about, so I mapped out
Just me and my fam, I don't give a damn
Livin' day to day, just like the normal man I am
Bringin' it back to the reason I began it from the start
Spittin' syllables at will at the open mic, after dark
Hangin' with cats that stay with the iron like they Tony Stark
We recognize when the phonies talk, why?
Real G's fly in silence like gnats, G7 raps
Retired now I'm back, I relapsed, we bringin' that heat back
Like July, that real shit, no two-ply
Bitches I've been plottin' and plannin', fuck whatever they been demandin'
I grab the cannon, and ran in the lyrical phantom, jumpin' out the plane tandem
Flow so effortless it seems like it happens at random
My green expand bigger, I Bruce Banner 'em
I hit you with the buckshot then the Chappelle slug
Hustle music like some of my brothers still hustle drugs
I'm the unsung, did it for money, made the money, now I do it for fun
Music will forever be a part of me
I do this from the heart, from the circumflex artery
My bank account is seven digits like I won the lottery
But that don't navigate the way I shape the game like pottery
So hold up, grab the gat, reload, the Rattpack be my soldiers
Yeah, I'm older but I be wiser
Fucking around, and now open your eyes up
Now these haters claim I fell from grace a couple years back
Still at the top, where I been at

That's why I retired, it's impossible to fulfill
Just a hamster wheel, full of cats that never sit still
On it, for real (Woo, crazy!)7Embed
Umm, so I, I would be able to leave you a message just like this
Just like this, just like this
Just like, right now, like this, and
Or would I, or would I have to call you
And like literally leave a message on your voicemail box?
And also what, what is the general tone of the other people?
Who are, like, are they, are they all like leavin' you voice messages and stuff?
Is that the kind of the nature of all the skits?
Likе, everyone's just callin' you and lеaving a voice message?
I, I ask because if I, if I do what I wanna
I wanna be, I wanna be consist—, I wanna contribute to the consistency of your album
If I do involve myself in it, I wanna make sure
You know I'm a stickler about consistency
I don't wanna be the one guy who's doin' the one different
But I, I wanna understand the concept as good as I can understand it
So that I can function within the rubric of your artistic vision properly
I wanna, I wanna, if, if I'm thee
If I'm on your record, it's not for my ego
I'm on your record, it's gonna be there to serve
I'm there to serve the vision that you have
I'm there to serve the vision, so, uhh
Just let me know what the answer to those questions areYou might also likeEmbed

Yeah, turn the whole shit up, yeah, loud as fuck
You're gonna have to probably extend it 'cause I'ma go off on this bitch, ready?
Outer Space Gang, bitch (Yeah)
Check, that's it
And please keep on sampling

What's the difference between you and me?
Came from nothin', now I'm rockin' Louis V
Suck my dick, it's Doc D
Logic hit me to appear on this final Def Jam CD
I'm the greatest rapper in the multiverse
That's why I got a million multis and a verse
Outer Space Gang, JT, Vorgon and Gordax
Y'all don't want the smoke, bitch, I got more gas
That'll rip your back through your thorax, fuck Sharon
Connected on the block like Bluetooth pairin'
Steady on my grind, peep the bearings
Not a single one of you motherfuckers is comin' close

Still in the game with you, wettin' fools like when the rain hit you
Music, movies, and families, I'm a lane-switcher
Ready to get you now
My flow make you rethink your whole fuckin' style
Nick Cannon on these motherfuckers, Bobby goin' wild
As a youngin, as a child, I was dreamin' for this
Fiendin' for this, listen, lean in with this
I'm the definition of a try-hard, the lyrical miraclе god
Do anything just for the applause
All up in your face with somе shit you can't avoid
Yeah, this black white boy finna push you into the void
I ain't got nothing but time like I'm Christopher Lloyd
And I ain't got time to diss you, I'd rather dismiss you
And sell more records than you did in your first week with a reissue
Claiming you the greatest, but is you?
I do this for Kenny, do this for Cole
Do this shit for the GZA and the whole clan, for sure
I do this for Mos, do this for Thought
Do this for Dilla on the for realer

Spill my blood on the page, blood on the leaves
Blood flowing down my arm from the heart on my sleeve
We keep it real all the time, boy, you best believe
I love rap, but had to leave, meanwhile the media like to perceive
That I was never welcome and these record labels thieves
Sample Tribe Called Quest and have to pay Lou Reed (Fuck)
A hundred percent, pick up the mic, I'm gonna vent (Fuck all that shit)
Yo, ayy, fuck rap, let's dead it
Everything that I could rap about, already said it
I'd rather give you these melodies
Kill the game so many times it's no longer a felony
What the fuck is you telling me? You ain't selling me
Do what you used to do and do it over and over
How 'bout you suck my dick and accept it's over?
This a new chapter, in the country, whippin' the Raptor
The realest I've ever been, it's far from SAG-AFTRA
Really used to give a fuck, but now it's just laughter
Happily ever after, probably not, but I have to have hope
Used to obsess over being dope, but the industry too cutthroat
They less focused on the talent and more focused on the upvotes
One album, I'm the champed, and the next, I'm the villain
Do the thing we like or else it's fuck you and your feelings
I was spread thin, just about ready to let the lead in
Breaking down on stage, that's shit I can't evade
I open up about my feelings, they call me a faggot
Fuck you, I had it, mentality was shattered
Wanna know why I retired? 'Cause I was uninspired
And everything was fuck you, pay me
Speak my mind, they turn around and wanna blame me
Try something different and they say I'm not the same me
You could never tame me
I'd rather fail trying something new than doing the same shit every day
Fuck you (Haha)

Come back, run it back, neutralize 'em like Men in Black
From Stones Throw to Madlib Invazion
Ask any fan on the street, they'll say your shit is amazing
The G.O.A.T., a legend, a god amongst men
Greatest producer alive, number one out of the ten
Egon would say that shit'll prolly make you feel uncomfortable, don't it?
But it might bring you back, won't it?
Quas and an MPC is no match for any opponent
One of the greatest alive, nobody could argue
Just come back, man, the rap cats would never dog you

Rappin' is my passion, I love y'all, man, look
This what I'ma say about Def Jam, look, man
We had some ups and downs, you know what I'm saying?
My first album, I was gettin' sued by some fuckboy
And y'all was tryna get me to change my name and shit
I spent my whole fuckin' career, this who I was
Y'all tryna get me to change my name
Y'all wasn't tryna put out my album so we did the "While You Wait" shit
We went on tour, you know what I'm saying?
But eventually, shit worked out
But even with that, you motherfuckers
You know, you under shipped me and shit
And that's what I'll say
I don't, I really wholeheartedly don't believe that was none of the people I just named either, man
Everybody, I fuck with y'all, I rock with y'all
Any other fuckboys behind the scenes, y'all could suck a dick
Eat my whole fuckin' ballsack, man
This industry is fucked up
The wildest shit, is I'ma say this, man
This whole industry is musical chairs, yo
Cats like Steve Bartels, Faisel, Jeff Harleston, man
They, they the real ones, you know what I mean?
But like motherfuckers be so in-and-out, that's why I didn't stay with Def Jam
I went to Def Jam after ten years on the label, because I owed them that
I was like, "Okay, so what's up? We signing another deal?"
They ain't even get back to me in time
So I went somewhere else and I don't know who butthurt or what
I could give a fuck, man
All I'ma say is I love y'all who rock with me
I love y'all who take care of me
I love y'all who fuckin' drove me from New York to Boston to do
Radio interviews and shit man
Appreciate y'all
It's been a, it's been a dope time on this major label shit, you know what I'm saying?
I've made millions and millions and millions of dollars for y'all, hahaha
And uhh, we've had some good memories
I love you, I appreciate you
My only regret is I ain't get to really fuck with Tunji like that
We doin' this last album, you know what I'm sayin'?
But Tunji, man, that's the God, he's here for the culture
Yo man, you're a fuckin' G bro
Much love to Lucian
I appreciate all the fuckin' millions of dollars that you gave me to make these records, hahaha
Independent shit next
VMG, VMG, Bobby Boy

Logic as a rapper is an anomaly, a person who is out of time
Living in the present, you know, rooted in the past
But a traditionalist who believes in the future
Who believes in what hip-hop was and can still be
So we're here in this modern time
Thinking about and listening to the development of hip-hop and it's future all at once
I think that a lot of people in the modern sense of the word get caught up in how fleeting time is
And they believe that what's happening right in front of them
Is the most immediate thing and it's the most meaningful thing
And they have to engage what's happening in the moment
Because the moment's gonna be gone and then they're not gonna care
Or no one else around them is gonna care
And I think we forget that great experiences in the, in humanity
Go on for decades, centuries, sometimes millennia
Before anybody even really knows how to make sense of them
And so, in the same way that the monks in the dark ages were keeping records and saving books
You know, it is important for us to really make sense of one of Americas great folk musics, and that's hip-hop
And there's very few people who care enough to actually keep the form going while trying to push it forwards
Logic's one of those dudes
And the reason Madlib and I decided that we wanted to work with him
Is because he came through with a true sincerity and appreciation for the form
And for all of the people who make it
And like a true understanding of craft and like, who's doing what
And how their technique is either important, relevant
Something that needs to be preserved or not
And I remind myself that even though hip-hop seems to me
In my mid forties to be an old thing because it's been around since the early '70s
It's actually just in its infancy
And if it's not for people like Logic trying to keep this tradition alive
We're not really gonna know even shortly after, what's supposed to come
This hopefully is an art form that's gonna outlast
All these art forms that preceded it and formed it
And we're only gonna know that if people who truly have the passion, belief
And the proficiency, the musical acumen
To hold the form, hold it dear
And at the same time, not be so reverent to it and push it forward
Are there to show us the way
So hopefully he's one of these dudes, I have that belief2Embed

I've been grindin' since before I could afford a pair of Vans
Recorded this album before they gave me my advance
Sign with another major, nah, no chance
It's like Chicago with no Chance, not a chance
This beat that you'rе hearing is a primary example
Of somе shit you can accomplish not worrying 'bout a sample
I had to clear it, now again hearing spirit
Hit the homie Egon, he send a hundred vinyls
Fuck mixing an album, two track, that's the final
Bobby Campbell and Jerry probably smoking the ounces

But now we homies, I take your criticism and use it
I used to fantasize about murdering you
Choking you to death and watching from your point of view 'til we got friendly
And I realized you wasn't ever tryna end me
One night, midnight, 2020 on the phone
You said the wildest shit that solidified me to stone
You said, you said I built an amazing fanbase and career
I'm successful and I'm fuckin' worthy to be here
And your opinion is just your opinion
It doesn't matter like your legion of fuckboy minions
It meant a lot, friend or not
Honesty is everything, it's fuckin' everything
I remember 2DopeBoyz and Fake Shore Drive
I remember performing before this virus was alive
I remember commenting on Rap Genius threads
I remember arguing on Reddit, HipHopHeads
Way before I was famous and criticized
I was just a member of the community in they eyes
And the craziest shit, I'm still the, still the same kid I was

Like, not doin' work to feel validated
That's a big thing for me at the moment
Like, I don't wanna like, do anything so people can go
"Oh, I like that, oh, that's cool"

I'll rip your intestines out of your abdomen through your asshole and choke you with 'em
I'm sicker than Venom
I'll murder you like OGs in prison do to child molesters and rapists of women

Of the stereo disc and the tape with the earphones
Bass on the left side, singing on the right side

Uh, now, I'm off the hook, so none of y'all can debate it
Started making music, cause I never really related—
To this bullshit, that they spit, claiming that they made it
Similar to a eight guard, cause I can't fade it
Use your logic, you could never evade it
I'm kinda like the Young Sinatra, mixed with Sammy Davis Jr
Already knowing they are, two of the best to ever to do it
Rhyming to improve and take rap
And move it in another direction, spread like infection
Better yet, lice, cause I'm always on their mind
I'm a breed of different kind, yes
I'm ahead of my time when it comes to the rhyme
You can catch me in the booth, from dusk, 'til the sun up
That Super Mario flow, I always get the one up
Yeah, we gun up, laser gotta help me run up
Not really, but it sounded tight, shut up
Fuck around, steal your bitch, just to get the nut up
Really, what up? With everybody looking for a deal
You can call me Indy-ana Jones and I'm headed for the throne
Going on a M.J. beat, leave me alone, this is music
Who are you to tell me how to use it?
Never confuse it, originality, I'll never lose it
Maybe I'm a little psycho, for hopping on the beat
But the logical part of me, telling me, you're feeling B
See? I'm a lyrical entity, blowing minds like Kennedy
With controversial lines, so everybody remember me

One of us wants all the money and fame
The other just loves the game
I've done some slippery things for change
But I made thirty million and my life changed
Finally found happiness when my wife changed
Used to make all my decisions based off the perception of others
Scared to do anything different, I couldn't get with it
Too worried 'bout others, fuck 'em
Yeah, I'ma do me, homie
Say if you was me, you would do it differently

Talking 'bout one in the same, only one of me to blame

True wealth cannot be measured in gold
But in experience, age and everything that comes with it is a blessing
So many of us are chasing our youth, fixated on the wonder years
When every moment they have now is wonderful
Family, friends, having children
And shifting the perspective of one's entire world in the blink of an eye
This is age
So while you look in the mirror thinking those thoughts, just remember
With every wrinkle and every gray comes another day that you're alive1Embed

Can't get enough, no, I can't get enough
Took another route, no, I never ended up in cuffs
Had a gat in my hand, but I didn't wanna be that man
Look in the mirror, couldn't see that man
Pick up the pen, never stick up to men
Only pick up the stick if I need to defend
If I did it back then, might've dropped dead
Know a nigga doin' life 'cause he a hothead
I took a ride through my city the other day
Wonder what would have happened if it all went the other way
Jump in the whip, now I reminisce
On the days when I was runnin' 'round the Ave
Could've never imagined the way that my life would have
Turned out and all of the things that I have
I ain't talkin' material, talkin' about my material
This shit that I'm writin', the shit that I been through
I went through the worst, but I made it out
Like the Alpha Omega, to show me which way it could go
Yeah, he laid it out
Instead of just sittin' on the beach
I'm reconnectin' with the streets
They wasn't payin' attention, I was prayin' for ascension
No need to mention my attention to detail
Homie, we will prevail
Lot of motherfuckers wanna wake up every day
Then they murder their own, but they know it's another way
Fuck all the violence and drugs in communities
This song right here is immunity
They call it the trap, 'cause they trapped
And just take our money, then they don't give it back to us
Black man can't even get himself a bachelor
Dropped out of school then he picked up a spatula
'Cause he never had a good role model, just a hood role model
Now I know that's the old model
We breakin' that cycle
I think I see the finish line
Got a vision now, don't diminish mine
Lot of brothers in the hood doin' good
And I know I see it all the time
But they only wanna push
All the drugs and all the crime on Channel 9
Fuck all that fallacy, this shit right here for my people
People that strugglin', people work hard as they can
But they still don't feel equal
Trust me, I know, I been there before
Trust me, I know, that feelin' don't ever go

And on a beautiful Autumn day in 2011
Logic and his best friends drive through the slums of College Park in a Chevy Impala
Around the streets of Prince George's county
Cruising through an unknown universe
Beginning a journey that would inevitably alter the course
Of not only their own
But the lives of millions of people around the world1Embed

Uh, when I grip the mic, it's like I'm lookin' through the face of God
I can't even begin to understand why I'm so odd
Did everything I could to fit in, man, I really tried
But was crucified
There was days when I wished I was Cole, wished I was Kendrick
Days when I wished I was Lupe, hella eccentric
Days when I wished I was Jay and had the blueprint
Makin' fresh money like a new mint
'Til I woke up one day and realized I'm Logic
Somethin' they could never be, let's not even acknowledge it
I spent my whole career at the heels of their feet
Doin' everything I could to try be who they be
'Til a couple albums back, when I was finally set free
By the realization all I gotta do is be me
Be me, uh
Anime-lovin', video game-playin'
Put that shit in my raps, people like "What the fuck is you sayin'?"
Comin' with assault and battery
Imitation is a form of flattery
Tryna make somethin' so original, you can't flatter me
That'll be the day
'Cause everybody sound like everybody anyway
Man, there's only twelve notes to a scale
Nothing's original under the sun, nothin' new to unveil
It's like perfection (Yeah), it's unattainable
See, it's more about the journey than the destination (It's about the journey, man)
Not to sound like a mom shoppin' at Erewhon

Ayo, my flow non-binary, that mean it never miss
Feelin' meticulous, I'm ready to get with this ridiculous
Vehicular sound, that means that I'm driven, illest around
Yeah, they know me 'round the world, but the flow is still underground
Only boos I get on stage is when I sip the finest
Like MF, most you niggas deaf, that's CON-5
Bottom line, I'm top five, red carpet when I arrive
But most days, I'm feelin' derealized
That's a medical term for feelin' out of your body
Like you lookin' through glass and don't recognize anybody
Like you not even real, anxiety what I feel
Tryna fix the problem, doctors wanna give me a pill
You know, I still think I could do it without that
These professionals really doubt that
Luckily, I found a therapist straight from the outback
She's always there for me when I'm feelin' down under
Most people is too scared of therapy 'cause it's taboo
No wonder why we all fucked up
Intrusive thoughts hit me on the daily, but I know I'll make it maybe
Everybody walkin' 'round like shit is gravy, feelin' wavy
But they really feelin' out of it
The drugs all in they system got 'em adamant they fine
But in they mind, they know they not
So they let the substance in they bloodstream to manipulate endorphins
Cut off the pain like morphine, but this just creates more fiends
Enjoy yourself, but don't escape in a substance
Dealin' with your problems head-on brings rewards in abundance
Whoever feel they in peril, I'm rockin' with you like Geralt
Whenever you fall down, Trigun like Meryl, aw, yeah, yeah
It's too deep now, I think it's too deep now
I know you shallow listeners probably tappin' out 'fore you drown
Peep the sound, hold it down, I think the message over now
Let's bring it back to that old rap shit and start it all over now
My residency in the game is permanent, I'll never move out
Even though you doubt, never make a move for clout
Been real since I moved through the canals
Spit so hard I knock a tooth out
When I did a show with Eminem in Hawaii
I brought the whole fuckin' crew and threw a luau
I might do MSG again just to bring the Wu out
They say your life is a movie, we finna roll the credits on you
Call the medics on you, sicker than the dogs I'm 'bout to sic up on you
Rigor mortis all up on you
Fuckin' around with the boy, in a ditch where you finna be stayin'
You was sprayin', now you layin' in the ground
I'm comin' down just to tell you that I told you so
No, I never sold you drugs, but I sold you dope
Suffer from anxiety, through these lyrics, I cope
Savin' society through lyrics I wrote, what's up?
Been grindin' to get my son's trust up, only thing stuck up
Is the finger in the middle, my lyrics profound
They lingerin' on the riddle, fuck all the little shit
I'm over and out, get rid of it, don't want any bit of it
My last album, I know you bit a bit of it
My shit is dope, now take a hit of it
You'd probably benefit from bein' in the fuckin' thick of it
Flame on wax like the wick is lit, bitch, the heat it on, like Vietnam
Got your life flashin' before your eyes, now you see your mom
First day of school, fast forward, now you wasted at prom
Fast forward, now shit is morbid, you dyin' of omicron
Persei 8, that's a Futurama rhyme
Want the dick and I'ma bend her, if she ugly, I return to sender
I pull strings like Fender, push buttons like Defender, yo, yo
Rack— Rack— Rack— Rack— Racks on racks on racks
I'm runnin' it back, I come for the stack
I'm gettin' this money like James Yancey
If I don't get the bread, I get antsy
Pullin' triggers like Tom Clancy, record label better advance me
They can't stand me 'cause I see what they can't see
My vision go over their head like Klu Klux Klan sheets
I love the energy whenever me and my fans meet
Jump on the beat and nobody ever handed me defeat
Lyrics, they never deplete, I get green like cleats
Please don't test my reach, talk shit, drink bleach
Out for blood like a leech, peep the speech

Not even self-medication, no matter how good the sip
Not the best weed or the things monеy can buy
When I fire up the program, feel likе I can fly
Smokin' dope, listenin' to endless samples on vinyl
My flow primal, it ain't mixed, it ain't the final, but it's still ill
And it still will destroy you decoys
We do this shit in real life, y'all a bunch of motherfuckin' e-boys
We do this shit for MCs, the DJs, the B-Boys that destroy the track
Spent most of my days just tryna avoid the wack

I been tryna drink less
But I feel like when I drink, I'm at my best
Not a care in the world, no stress
Always give the world my everything and no less
I wake up seven days a week and get the job done
You know I'm always there for my wife and my son
And at the end of the day, I love to pour one
More like two, but occasionally three and it scares me
Not because I have a problem
I'm the type of person, if there's an issue, then I'ma solvе 'em
It's more like seeing how this shit has dеstroyed life
Uh, I look at my mom, I look at my dad
And see how drugs and alcohol took away everything they had
And it makes me sad, I found the balance, but I feel bad
I didn't drink 'til I was twenty-seven, then I did from then
And every time I take a sip, I'm scared that I'll become them
We went to Alcoholics Anonymous mostly twice a week
I was just a little boy, but listened when people would speak
Prostitutes, preachers, substitute teachers
Cops and criminals, they all gave speeches
About this addiction and it filled me with conviction
Keep comin' back, boy, it works if you work it
And it did, growin' up, I was a AA kid
I never wanted to make the mistakes that they did
Yeah, sometimes when I sip, you know, I feel survivor's guilt
But I know that what I'm drinkin' could destroy all that I built
So I tread lightly, this shit leaves people dead nightly
Alcoholic, well, it's in my blood, so I might be
Drug addict, well, it's in my genes, so I might be
But I don't use that shit to escape
I deal with my problems head on 'til this day
Addiction to substance, it was my fate, but I broke the cycle

I just don't wanna do it
Man, just hit the blunt
No
Just hit the shit, man
Bro, I gotta be on stage in like fuckin' forty minutes
I'm not tryna perform in the tenth dimension
Havin' panic attacks and shit on stage, man, fuck all that
Bro, this weed ain't even that strong
You'll be fine in like thirty minutes

Fuck no

Loaded up, what the fuck? Always in the cut, eyes never shut
Let the pen bleed, fuck the feed, hopin' they all remember me

Fast forward, the crib got a back house
I remember them girls that went back out
Fast forward, I'm blowin' they back out
Fast forward, I'm throwin' these racks out
'Cause I know that I'ma get it back now, uh
From the cage to the stage
They don't know the songs, can tell by the way that they rage, uh
I'm faced by the shade they throwin'
I'm knowin' that no one can block the rays, uh
Through all of the years
The growin' kept goin', like, how are you not amazed?
Uh, through all of the years
Bein' broke as fuck, we finally got a break

Went from bein' around the block, bitch, to travelin' the planet
Took the treasure with the tragic, up and down, it's mathematics
Matthew C.P., never knew that we were makin' history
Just did it for the love, the future's such a mystery
Real all the time, be real to the grind
Never knew we'd make it through them dark days and shine, ha

Takin' it in, rakin' it in, money, we makin' again
Payin' the rent, now allow me to vent, now allow me to vent
Now allow me to light this straight, but shit can get so bad
Like time and space, feelin' interstellar, feelin' high as a propeller
Like I'm in a novella, like I am in a screen
I'm ready to scream, feel like I'm in between this world
And the next, it's so complex
I'm talkin' 'bout virtual space, I know my lyrics is all over the place

Let me get up on my MPC
When it come to makin' beats, I'm the MVP
I'm the main motherfucker, you're an NPC
Got 'em full of envy, the boy from MD
Destroyed what I see, deploy, then I be
The illest MC, braggadocios flow
Vein like an IV, and I'm all up in the system
Blink once and you might have missed him
Pack a punch like I'm Sonny Liston
Better listen, like I always do the intuition
Never missin', 'less I'm on tour
Then the family, I miss 'em
Come and get some money (Money, money, come and get some)

Well, that ain't the same, I already broke in the game
If you knew hip-hop, then you knew my name
But I was tired of broke
It was time to retire, it broke
I was so sick of bringin' all that fire to folks that wouldn't pay attention
So I made it all from the heart, then I put it on the business
Cap, and the rest is a wrap, from the boom-bap to the trap
Bust like a gat
I did it for the money and I did it for the fame
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
And did it for the kid with the dream
Rappin' in the mirror in his room as a teen
Hopin' that he'd be seen by the world, and he would be (Would be)

Everybody in my business, homie
Give a fuck about you and the critics, homie
Made a couple million, now they all up on me
I remember the days when they wasn't though
I remember the days when I was cookin' crack with my cousin
No, but on another note
I remember all the days in the basement, yeah
I remember no communication
'Cause I was hustlin', stackin' the ammunition
Know the RattPack was on a mission, homie
See the vision, me and my division finna make it out
Now let me travel in time to 2011
And pass the mic to my homie all alone in his house
Talkin' 'bout where we grew up and hopin' we would make it out
Homie, make it out

Hopefully, one day, I get to be famous
Hopefully, one day, I'm hittin' these stages
Hopefully, they gon' get lit to these bangers
We start the set, one of these bitches just fainted
Hopefully we get this shit before we go and get evicted
I keep missin' these payments
Warrant for my arrest, 'cause I done skipped the arraignments
Sometimes I feel like I can't win, yeah, yeah
Plus 'round my way, bro, this shit can get dangerous
'Round my way, they always grippin' the stainless
Spin the block twice if they miss where they're aimin'
Yeah, your chain for your life, and they're quick to exchange 'em
Yeah, that's just the way that it is, don't think it's ever changin'
One day, I'll say that I made it out
Look at my life while I sit in amazement
One day, I'll throw an obscene amount
Out in Nobu, ten band tip to the waitress
One day there'll be no debate about
Who the greatest out, bitch, it's him, no replacements
We'll never choose the safest route
Put it all on the line, it's a risk, then we take it, one day

Hello?
Hey, what's up, bro, you at the crib?

Shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, I don't give a damn
Fuck the norm, liquor got me feelin' warm

I'm headed to space with my team in a fleet of flyin' submarines
Submerge a hundred years into the atlas, then we're clean
When we surfaced, there was no need for money purchases
But my Wiz still has Chanel purses
I had a solid gold diamond encrusted book
The sole purpose was to hold important verses
Claustrophobic, they tried to bound me in COVID
But my strand of DNA, it can not be decoded
I told y'all this, put those laser guns away
Before I black out, bonk, take your whole sun away
My star cruiser with a flux motor, vodka with the club soda
Ice in the cup holder, Bobby be that type of soldier
That I wouldn't fuck over, turn to a supernova
The rap Galactus, five emcees my daily quota
My shuttle's a dream house, spa with a steam room
Pool with a logo and backyard is a screenin' room
Lookin' out my window, every view is a scenic view
They say life's a dream, I say that you could dream it too

We got DaQuan here, come on down
Now, DaQuan is from southeast D.C. 
He says he's willing to sell his soul to make it in the music industry
And today, DaQuan, I believe we can make this a reality
But— but before we make this sa– satanic act a reality
We have to ask, are you ready for the blood sacrifice?
Are you ready to leave your life of love and holiness behind?

I want the world, I want the money, I want the respect (Nigga, come on down)
I want thе gold, I want the chains, I want the— I want the— (Nigga, comе on down)
Never had nothin' but soul, never had nothin' but hustle (Nigga, come on down)
Wanna be loved, I wanna be famous, I wanna be rich (Nigga, come on down)
I wanna be anything, wanna be anybody that I'm not (Nigga, come on down)

Let me get it all, get the money, get the women
Motherfucker, better give me like ten of them
Glock .9's, I got ten of them
My enemies, I gotta get rid of them
Since I was a little boy, I wanted to be loved
Wanted to be hugged, but the streets wanted me to thug
Sweep my emotions up under my rug
Then call the plug to sell me some drugs
And sell to my people that smoke on the nug'
Sippin' liquor by the jug
I'm tryin' to burrow it down, these feelings inside of me
Can't speak on the things that done happened to me as a child
I'm talkin' 'bout sodomy
Oh no, I can't let 'em see that side of me
Therapy, that shit right there for them white folk
I sold crack, like white yolk
Police, they got me walkin' on a tightrope
Want me on sight 'cause I sell dope
So I'd rather just sell my soul, gettin' this money my goal

Wanna be loved, I wanna be famous, I wanna be rich (Nigga, come on down)
I wanna be anything, wanna be anybody that I'm not (Nigga, come on down)

Anyone that I'm not
That I'm not
Anyone that I'm not

Most folks think gangsters like what they do
Think they enjoy killin' their own brothers and sisters
By riddlin' our streets with bullet shells and narcotics
Most people think that shit cool, think again
Why you think they call it the trap, playboy?
We just tryna escape by any means
But we mostly end up escapin' through deathEmbed
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
La-la-la, la-la, la-la-la

Cruisin' through the borderlands, catch a vibe
Fatherhood my hustle, nowadays I'm makin' music on the side
I confide in the page, weed smoke fill the air like sage
Thirty-two my age, I spot a couple grays
Feel my blood pressure raise
No longer are the days of my childhood
My priority nowadays is makin' sure my wife and my child good
Steppin' to me, I wish you would
Lord of the Rings, my bling shine like Elijah Wood (Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, the lows be low, but the highs be good
Beneath the sheets like an Isley would
I pick up the mic, oh my God, he good
Retired and came back just like they thought he would (Uh-uh)
Feel it and face 'em (Uh-uh)
I'm tryna face it (Uh-uh), the rest is basic, uh (Uh-uh)
Ayo, I want you to play this (Uh-uh) and vibe in the ride (Uh-uh)
I'm finally happy with the man (Uh-uh) on the inside
Full of pride (Uh-uh), full of fear
Been a decade, but I'm here, seein' clear
Different motivations, no longer the people that's up in my ear (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I woke up early on my born day like Nasir in '94 (Ah-ah-ah)
Three-hundred-sixty-five behind me now, plus one more
My physical frame made it beyond what they said it would
My debut album did better than Reddit said it would
Made it out the trap, but I got my gat, yeah, that's a fact
I'm runnin' it back, like, "What's up?"
From the cover of XXL to my moment of clarity (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
As I excel at Madison Square, I swear
The rap game will split your shit like an affair
Prepare for the worst
And this business shit can get grimy, got 'em all behind me
Come now, don't try me, 'cause I'm me, the God
Study bitches like I'm abroad
This is dad music, pick up the pen and know how to use it (Ah-ah-ah)
Plenty responsibility in me, know how to use it
Appreciative for what I got, 'cause people could lose it
Take these lyrics and use it (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Take the heart on my sleeve and transfuse it
I'm bleeding as you listen to what I'm reading (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No longer needing approval and feeding into the vision of the public
I'm above it, used to do it how they did it
'Cause I thought that's how you did it, now I do it 'cause I love it
I don't covet everything they got that I don't (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

See, I was born into a world of food stamps and welfare
No dollar for the ice cream man and nappy hair
Raised by a single mom, but in the back of my mind
I thought I gotta have my pops, no cereal
Never had a lot, but now I got plenty material
No longer do I wish for money
'Cause being broke made me stronger, harder, faster, better
So now I alphabetically murder every letter, uh
Feel the conviction in my words like a jail sentence
Murder in the first, do a verse, won't be no repentance
Mama, I'm sorry that I left at seventeen
But I had to chase my dream and get this mafuckin' cream
Only people that I got is the people that's on my team
'Cause when I roll up on the scene I see everyone start to scheme
Talk about they connections, talk about who they know
Then they beggin' me for a feature, but I'm like "Hold up, yo
If you know who you know why the fuck you ain't blow?"
Matter fact, you ain't fuck with me this time last year though
I was kicking rhymes, but you ain't paid no mind at the soul
And now you on my dick riding like the baddest of hoes
You think it's easy but it's not, see the talent that I got?
Determination keep it fresh, if I don't shine then it's gon' rot
'Cause it don't happen overnight, one hit wonders don't keep the spot
And I plan to hold the torch until I pass it and get shot, what

They would decline and in my mind, they was just hatin', hehe
Testing my patience they got me pissed like probation
But I had the mind to keep goin' and the heart to keep racing
And as the world crumbled beneath my feet like a Haitian
I was inspired by them to persevere through dedication
Failure I'm never facin', my lyrics is education
So if you got the tape crank that shit like Jason Statham
Yeah, this is my story word by word as I'm emergin'
Just relax and let me open your mind like brain surgeon, uh
Uhh, fresh in the game they should sign me to Virgin
But me and solo know that I would only get to splurgin'
I see the road to success and now it's time to merge in

Growin' up, there was baby mama drama
Everyday and every way
But not my kids I ain't got none to this day
'Cause a rubber ‘round my Jimmy when I consider foreplay
Hey, ha, back in the day West Deer Park where we stay
I was running around while mama was drinking everyday
But it's okay, I wouldn't have it any other way
'Cause it developed me into the young man that you see today
Through dedication, yeah, yeah
Never follow traditions, you see, I had a different vision
I would skip school and write compositions 'bout my home conditions
You know the usual no money and family division
In specific I remember this time in my kitchen
With my sister's man back
Before he went to prison and got into religion
He showed me how to cook crack at 12 and I ain't kiddin'
After release it then went bad now he no longer living
And I'm pretty sure his last breath was "Lord forgive him"
Now my nephew ain't got a father that'll keep him safe
All I can hope is he a good boy for his mama's sake
'Cause she never did recover from his father's fate
And if he grew into a man that made the same mistake
Well to be honest, I don't know how much more she could take
So to every baby mama that could truly relate
It is you unto this song that I shall dedicate, yeah15Embed
Open your mind, open up your mental
Most of the shit that you worried bout ain’t consequential
Peep the potential
What’s really essential in your feelings like a ventricle?
That’s a cavity, don’t be mad at me
Floating like zero gravity
Not many real spitters left in this great academy
I hear my flows all in they flows, I take it as flattery
Spit with conviction, like, like, I’m at a podium
Mostly people fu- fu- fu- fu- fu-, mostly people full of sodium
Seeing you do what they can’t
I float like a feather, they full of restraint
Far from a saint, that paint
I go hard in, like James Harden
My words falling all over the beat like autumn, I got ‘em going in circles
Shit has been wild, been rapping since I’m a child
I wrote poetry to help people that feel like they in a spiral
You write bullshit, and then hope that it all go viral
I been driven, boy your shot it idle
I’m homicidal word to the G.O.A.T., from the D
And every time you mention the D, you gotta mention that Jay McNasty
Don’t put it past me to go crazy on these kick ass beats
Record half an album then do the show my voice be raspy
That’s all in one day, one way, or another
We gon’ need some rest on Sunday, but knowing me, probably not
Give a fuck if he hot, I be on the block
Testing MC’s, like what he got?
Reincarnated Shakur, I’m feeling like Three-Pac
My beats knock, like Reebok
Nah listen, I said, feeling like Three-Pac
My beats knock like Reebok, that’s heavy kicks
So inspired I’m always switching up the setty-list

Now we get Louis V, back in the day as a kid it was Costco

Rap messiah, me and my apostles
I'm 33 but by rap years I'm fuckin’ fossils
Still kickin', still pushin', still grindin', still goin'
Already knowing that I don't know shit
Walk in the room, knew my intentions ‘fore I spoke it
I took the record and broke it
Feeling limitless, I'm feeling so focused
This is all me, nobody co-wrote this
And I hope this reach you when you need it
Not at your wit's end, feeling depletеd
Keep being you, fake motherfuckеrs we seeing through
This some rap shit, come now feel the flow in this beat
I’ve had my ups and downs, but life ain’t ever felt this steep
Shallow moments in my career, but it's never been this deep
Praise God that I’m alive, moment I wait 'til I see
Ayo, this is emceeing, finally ON-YO like Koreans
Foreseeing I would blow like C4, who want more?

It's hard to stay present when your past was tense
The flow is immense
Weed hit my chest like 450 on the bench
On my MPC2000XL in the front yard
I stay with vintage brakes like junk yards, always come hard
Pick up the mic now En Garde
Try hard, back with another attempt
Don't hold me exempt
Stay with bars like I was held in contempt
Ain't fucking with you like a women ain't giving consent
What's the gift of life without presents?
Smoking an ounce plus the resin
I got the throne, you got the chair
Stay dropping the ball like Time Square
When I'm fried I lose track of time like Phil in Futurama
No time for the drama, only the comma, my money never pause
Rebel with a cause, sound the applause
In the cut like gause
Black and white like Hitchcock, me and the blunt lip-lock
I'ma kick push, you can suck a dick and then kick rocks

Free music ain't had me this inspired in years 'cause
Dropping free music, it comes with many fears
I mean without a streaming service it's hard to catch any ears, but
I'm finally seeing plenty clear
I'd rather have the time of my life sampling anything I want and not make a single penny here
Yeah, I'm retired, record label fired, I'm hella admired
But this whole goddamn industry is fucking expired
"Logic, I thought you wasn't doing albums, you're a liar"

I wish he could meet his grandaddy, I'm so torn
And well, I guess we all got family problems but
My life's good, my wife's good, I made it out the hood
And I'm always giving back like I should
I made it, now they know me

Living life and feelin’ good
Live your life you really should
Feelin’ like you’re no good, but deep down you know you could, make your life better
Life’s a bitch but when it’s hard I don’t regret her
With age I get better, instead of
Obsessing over my youth, I’m over my youth
Give it my all, no I never give it less in the booth
I let it pour like liquor, I never lessen the proof
Shoot ‘em straight, no, I can’t water down the truth
Never felt accepted like college, they wouldn’t let him in
I guess I didn’t pass the test like I’m pissing amphetamine
They think they better than, me and my team rocking stages like we Greta Van
But all that shit they put me through made me a better man
An outcast like Sir Lucious, I murder it so Confucius
He say; the man who says he can, and the man who says he can’t, are both correct

So put that shit down, and keep your chin up in the meantime
This life has a lot more to offer you than screen-time
Let's rewind one time, divine when I spit the rhyme
This is lyrics, when you hear it bow down and revere it
Ain't no need to fear it unless your shit is whack
Got nothing but bars, word to Bourbon Street
Hard as concrete, take a scalpel to your ankles just to show you defeat
Let it register then peep the receipt
You sow what you reap
A lyrical freak far from my peek

Crucify you then hit the motherfuckin' rendezvous1Embed
Yeah

Yeah
Depression, anxiety got ahold of me
'Cause people say they want the older me
Well, I'm thirty, this the oldest me
Behold it's me, the piece of shit that's not good enough
Not black enough, not hood enough
Not rich enough, not poor enough
My heart has poured enough
I been beaten and battered, my confidence shattered
Been broken and tattered
I'm constantly second guеssin' if my profession is worth it on my mental state
Writin' this from a dark placе with humility and grace
Peace, love, and positivity was my nativity
But not when socials are in my vicinity
I'm not runnin' from the internet
My god, I was at its birth, I've been a vet
Goin' berserk like Peter down in Initech, yo, ayy
It's deeper than the surface, I'm searchin' for purpose
I'm tired of searchin' for Logic on Google on purpose just to read that I'm worthless
I remember makin' music alone, just a pen and a microphone
But nowadays it's hard to get in the zone
Writin' rhymes was easy before the fame
Now I'm constantly overthinkin' every line, it's a shame
Rap used to fill me with joy, now it's nothin' but pain
I'm stuck in the game, tryna get back from where I came
I write this letter for the person who's listenin'
Fed up and tired of people dismissin' 'em, I'm with you
I been through what you been through
And no amount of money can take away the feelin' of insecurity
Only through maturity can we overcome
Feel like I've been overrun, feel like it's over, I'm done
Whoever told you success gon' make you happy? You been lied to
All of my dreams came true but I bleed and cry too
Never been perfect, I failed every time I tried to
Feelin' hated and underappreciated
Every time I look in the mirror, I wonder, "Why you?"
Shit, I'd love to end this on some positive shit
Hit you with punchlines instead of some derogative shit
But it's okay to be sad sometimes and tired of shit, I guess

In having this thing, and that thing, and the other thing, and having a swimming pool
A, uh, Ferrari, uh, certain kind of clothes and uh, certain kind of house
And so on, and so on, and so on
And we think, uh, we need all that
Because we haven't asked ourselves whether that was what we really wanted
They all think they gotta have this, they gotta have that
And uh, they don't really want it
If they sat back and considered, "Do I need all that? Is this trip really necessary?"
They would come to the conclusion that it wasn't, ha-ha-ha-ha-haEmbed
Yeah, uh, yeah

I started with just a dollar and a dream
Like Jermaine in '09, know what I mean?
Fresh on the scene like a first take
I dropped my first tape then felt the earth shake
But let's accelerate
Dropped my second tape, 2011, and now we elevate
Def Jam wanna sign me, it's time to celebrate
But little did I know, I had so much further to go
Had so much further to grow
Had so much further, I know
If you feeling down, you know you can call mе
If nobody around, you know you can call me
Yeah, this shit don't need a featurе
Yeah, you know it's all, know it's all, know it's all, know it's all, know it's all, know it's all

What the fuck is up then?
Logic cites Nujabes, MF Doom, RZA, and Kanye West as key inspirations behind his production style

Yeah, yeah, uh
Grammy-nominated, never won it though
Don't need it, but deep down, I want it though
Bank account still on a hunnid though
My bank account still on a hunnid (Ayy)
But that don't mean shit, that don't mean that I'm shit
It's just me and my clique and we bombin' this shit
Ain't no drama and shit, now I'm throwin' a fit
Watch me throwin' a fit and get lit like I'm Evel Knievel
Just me and my people, we call this the sequel to Under Pressure
Ain't no need to measure who the best
Fuck around and know who the best
Who give a shit? I just spit about this and I know what I love
R-A-double-T, I put nothing above like that thing in the glove
From Maryland to LA, I'm a motherfucking boss at the bars
And I'm down for the cause, who's down for the cause?
Take a step back, hold up (L-O-G-I-C)
Put the city on the map with the city on my back
Let 'em know you're never ever goin' back (L-O-G-I-C)
Don't be scared to murk 'em all, hurt 'em all, watch 'em all
Get up all, watch 'em all get a ball (L-O-G-I-C)
When you grow up in a hood without a male role model
And your momma turn to the bottle
Give a damn about status, who the baddest
I just wanna be the raddest dad as I can be
This shit is systemic inside of us B', the media lie to us B'
They tell us we can be whoever we want to be
And then when we try, what they tell us? (What they tell us?)
What they tell us? To live more realistically (Ayy)
Fuck that, get the fuck back, fuck rap and all that noise
Growing up, how I grew up I really never had a choice
Had killers and murderers in my house and they was all of my boys

Mighty Duck shit, I got the mighty bucks, bitch
They love you when you poor but then they hate you when you rich
'Cause everybody love a good underdog story
But deep, deep down, hate the underdog's glory
2013 I just didn't feel accepted
Like hip-hop hated me and purposely neglected
But that shit ain't true, the real ones respected
Like Sway, like Nas, like Jay, like RZA
Like the gods of this shit, I beat the odds of this shit
Years ago was at my wits end
Feel like I ain't belong on this end
And then I had a certain conversation with a person
And this person said "Do you wanna be remembered as a rapper or an entertainer?"
Shit was a no-brainer
In an instant it changed my life and all of my views
Don't change yourself for streams and YouTube views
And the person who gave me that advice is no other than Donald Glover
A person who also didn't feel accepted
So thank you for the talk 'cause deep down you know I kept it 'cause you stayed yourself
Stayed calm, stayed collected
And let me know that I can be myself no matter how eclectic
God damn, conversations with you and fam
Most definitely shaped me into the man that I am
And on the real, I think that's enough said
So thank you for the words that repeat up in my head
And nothing but love to fam for all the life that you shed
Most people never say this shit 'til the other one dead
But we all alive and well, you are appreciated
This was food for thought in a way that I never been fed

Not all addicts come from the streets
It's crazy what some people do just to get high

Just to get high, just to get high, just to get high
People robbing and stealing, murdering, killing
Was destined for better things but somehow turned out the villain
A young boy born in a good home
At the playground he would roam
Mother who cared, daddy was there
Church every Sunday giving the homeless his prayers
Soup kitchen with his momma, he helping her feed 'em
Made him feel great as a boy like these people in there really need him
On a roll, now we older, he the top of his class
4.2, that's what extra credit'll do
But now he sees the other kids, he see a girl that he like
He's scared to talk, but he might
Body changing, hormones rearranging, he growing confidence
Finally engaging, he asked her out
Praise God like a pastor's out, she said "Yes"
Couple months later fucked for the first time
He's hooked like a cokehead's first line
Now he in love on cloud nine
This girl is everything he cares about
She always on his mind, supposed to go to prom
Even picked out a tux with his mom, in touch with his mom
It was the day before the SAT test when he found out this bitch has been fucking his best friend
He yelling and screaming, heat of a demon
His mom and dad telling him "There's many more fish in the sea"
How the fuck can that be? She promised it would be me
Now he slipping, he falling, feel like he can't get a grip and he tripping
House party first time he hit the weed when it's passed, scotch out a flask
At home he's not the same
His parents don't try to ask what's going on, you never respond
School called, said you're never in class
You was supposed to help the homeless on Tuesday but then you passed
The voice of his momma, now his house is all full of drama
He don't wanna help her, they should be praying to God
Let's be honest, they homeless 'cause they don't have no fuckin' job and they lazy
It fuckin' amaze me, feeling crazy
Suicidal, depression, no hope for a good profession
Twelfth grade when he started smoking rocks out a glass, it takes the pain away
Now he finally happy at last with no job to support his new habit
He steal from the same church he used to help homeless with their meals
Oh, how it feels for a mother to watch her baby walk around in her heels
Now we addicted to a substance, she-she don't know how it feels
She tried to save him but he's screaming back and forth with his dad, he's fuckin' had it
His son has become an addict, thinking erratic
This shit is beyond an invention, my intention is contention
Punching his father in the living room, his mother she tried to break it up
He hits her in the process, this is too much to process
His father throws him through the front door
Says, "You don't want no more, don't come back no more"
No place to stay, it's raining harder than Brooks
I'm feeling like a nobody, just a body to put some motherfuckin' pills in
Years pass, he sees the girl from his class
Scared she'll recognize him but she doesn't because his body mass has passed
Emaciation feel like he in a simulation
Never facing the things that brought him in this situation
Met bad people, did bad things
Criminal activities at nights entail that it dreams
He wants to get sober, but he doesn't know how
Been on the street, he's sleeping in boxes and dumpsters for a while
No money for rehab, he mad trying to get clean
He wanna turn his life around, but it ain't easy as it seems
Still falling, his skin crawling, the drugs calling, his body withdrawing
Sweating through the mattress in an alley 1am during summer in Cali
He's starving, he needs a plate, what is his fate?
Soup kitchen he finds himself in, he recognize the place
Looks around the room and recognize the face
It's his daddy, the little boy inside of him is scared
His father says "Even though I kicked you out, I was always there, I'm sorry for what I've done"
"Yeah, I know, son. You're a human at your low, son, it's no fun
I'll help you if you need it, I'll give you a home
Just don't let that cycle repeat it"
He said "Okay, dad, I miss you and mom. Can't wait to see her"
He said "Boy, your mother's been dead for a year"
He couldn't believe it
Last thing he did was strike her down
Spent years away as an addict and now she's underground
Finally found himself but feel like it was too late to break this genetic trait
Pops was there for him like Reddit
Years pass, we gon' dead it
He's finally clean after years in the machine
Twelve months shift at the AA meetings
He's finally seeing the man he always wanted to become
We come from nothing, now he's got a job
And a house of his own, with some crops that he's grown
Vacation on a plane, first time he's ever flown
Anxiety got him shaking, his fingers gripping his phone
Woman beside him said "Don't worry, I get scared, you're no alone
I used to have the biggest fear of flying
Shaking my knee uncontrollably and silently crying"
And then she said "I just let go of all control and let be of what will be and finally I am feeling free
Don't get me wrong, I'm a human, still get a dose of anxiety
But I'm feeling stronger than the prior me"
This made him think and feel better
Before they were done with ascension, they landed
And found out that they were both going to the same comic convention
He could feel the tension inside of him, like a drug
He was done with Mary Jane, needed a Gwen Stacey
He said "You want some company?"
She said "My name is Tracey, it's nice to meet you
Do you have a number where I can reach you?
Maybe show you some anxiety meditation, could teach you"
Felt like she was the only person that could reach through
Became friends then became lovers
She had a big family, two older sisters and three brothers
That welcomed him in, knew his past, still let him in
Loved him like kin and everybody in the family rejoiced when he asked Tracey to marry him
That's when she told him she was pregnant and he rejoiced
But over the months leading to the day, he heard a voice
In the back of his head that said his baby is doomed, genetically fucked
From all the narcotics that you consumed
Intrusive thoughts winning the battle
But his therapist say "This is normal, this is okay, it's okay
It means you care, always gon' be there for your family"
Okay and now it's the day, the day
Now she in labor, "God, I gotta ask a favor
I know I done a lot of bad in this life
Not a lot of good but I was wondering
Could you let my baby and my wife have a beautiful life?
I done a lot of wrong but now I'm making it right"You might also likeEmbed
Goddamn, goddamn, conversations with people
Crazy how one day, the legends forget that they equal
On this Under Pressure sequel
We not taking it back, we keepin' it pushing
People scared of change
But you'll find me deep in the cushion
Even when I win, it feel like I'm losing
Listening to beats, in the Bimmer cruisin'
I think I got another hit, I could feel my body bruisin'
What's the conclusion? Or rather, my hypothesis
I'm darker than Gotham is
Reading Nostradamus at 90 degrees
You better believe
I know how to turn a profit with ease (Suck my dick!)
Diacritical lifestyle, I'm always overseas
Hurricane Bobby in the studio blowing trees
Switch the topic, I drop it
Fuck around then leave them all concussed
When I bust, no thrust, world we livin' in is fucked
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty one
Your new shit ain't good as your old shit
'Til your new shit is your old shit, son
And then some, let me get some
I wear this 24 karat solid gold Rollie for my son
As an heirloom, not for looking dope as I rhyme
As a representation to give your family your time
Searching for love in the industry you'll be let down
They don't love you 'til you dead and then they call you profound
No matter how mainstream you was in the end, you still underground
That's the truth, feeling close to the cliff, like Rick Dalton in the booth
Money ain't the key to happiness and this the truth
Modern day rap is like a golden era spoof
But a few of us were searching within the second renaissance
And I know that my debutantes
Keeping the legacy going
By flowing so involuntarily seamless
Me and my team is finally reaping
What we been sowing like a seamstress
I said I'm on one, I know I'm unsung
Was livin' my life backward like Tariq on Undun
And now they wonder how I got over son (Do you want more?)
Hell yeah, now check the method
I been livin' outside of pages for ages
Now I'm back, Chocolate City, home of percussion, Maryland on my back
From Takoma Park, all the way to Southeast DC
It feel like forever ago, it feel like BC
Everlasting life, kickin' rhymes in the parking lot at night
Inhale, exhale, people hate
Oh well, 2012
Dreamin' I'm a freshman on XXL
2013, on the cover XXL
Livin' life behind these bars with no intention of postin' bail
'Cause I prevail
But that's a story for another time
Story for another rhyme
And on my darkest days, I know that the sun will shine, eventually

I'm tryna get ahead like a fetus, money don't complete us
Or defeat us, it can lead us to depression
Bein' rich is not a blessin', fame is not a blessin'
Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous I learned that lesson
What's the meanin' of life? To live it, what I'm guessin'

Time is undefeated, in the end, it beats us all
My daddy, my momma, myself, we all destined to fall
Currently, the most important thing within my life is balance
I ain't talkin' commas and zeros or monetary (Challenge)
Talkin' self-worth, put yourself first, don't worry 'bout the worst
But when you in this position, it's hard to make selfish decisions
Got enough bread, I'ma eat, but what about the rest, my team?
They good and all, but I mean, if I disappeared from the scene
Then what's gon' happen? What's gon' happen?
In a hotel writin' rhymes before I headline at a festival
But all that’s runnin' through my mind is bottom lines and decimals
So focused on the brand sometimes forget about the Man
Reflectin' in the mirror with this pen in his hand
99 percent of these people will never understand, supply and demand
'Cause I'm in the public eye, they think they know who I am
Oh, shit, it's Logic! Can I have a picture?" They don't give a damn
Soon as they see me, they clench the device that's in they hand
Don't even say hello, more like, "Can I get one for the 'Gram?"
That's when I be like, "Fuck no, but you can shake my hand
Let's have a conversation, talk about life man-to-man
You disappointed, I can read your body language like a paragraph"
"Logic, yeah, that's cool and all, but I'd much prefer a photograph
I mean, can I have a photograph?"
Goddamn, all these people nowadays are so unusual
They'd rather snap a pic with you to get more likes than usual
Than have a conversation, back in the basement with no placement
Couldn't never fathom talkin' to my favorite rapper that wayEmbed

My mentor once told me, that fire cannot be denied, I'm twenty years old, and I've sacrificed the last four years of my life, to create music just for you, my social life, staying in the studio, practicing, grinding, just to give you, a soundtrack for your life, so I'm gonna continue to wake up every day and make good music, and get that recognition

And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it

Now, let me switch it up with some shit you ain't ever heard
Ain't drunk, but the flow's slurred
