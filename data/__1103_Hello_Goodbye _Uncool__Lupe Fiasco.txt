F...N...F

Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye
Hello darkness
You, you, you, you, you, you

All in together, the weather is better than ever
I hope it never ends, I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend that it's
Better than it's ever been
Lie to ourselves
Like the skies, we'll rebel
And it's well, and it's fine
And it's fine if they fell
And you can refine the storyline if you survive to retell
We all targets
Hello darkness
You might also like
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...

They said everything's gonna be fi-fi-fine
Said everything's gonna be o-o-okay, just don't breathe the air

He just sits, and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero, they don't love him no more
There's a blast, every time a ten hit's the floor
His gift, for not fighting another man's war
And if they can get their hands on the mask
That he had wore on his face
They can put somebody else in his place, to restore
The state, the illusion that it's safe
The faith, that being a slave is so great
As gas fills the room
And rockets destroy everything around him
He stands to find himself surrounded
By thousands of soldiers that he once trained
To never miss their targets, heartless
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness
Pleased to make your acquaintance, salutations
Konnichiwa, hello end of the world, how are you, I'm fine

Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness

Hello darkness, hello sunshine
