4 ContributorsKick a Door (80 Gz) Lyrics
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody on the floor, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody gotta go, nigga

Me and Mojo down to kick a door, nigga
Where it at? Better bring it to the door, nigga
Half a million dollars laying on your floor, nigga
On the low, dog, I'm cut throat, nigga
I'm a real killer, I be with street niggas
We love beef, nigga, and we'll deal wit ya
So Icey goon squad, I'll let the goons get ya
See, they don't rap, dog, they just pull triggers
I'm talking Big J, I'm talking Lontae
I'm talking Jon Boy, and Uncle Terry
We never scary, but bitch we thugging
And Mr. Floyd got star status You might also likeEmbed
