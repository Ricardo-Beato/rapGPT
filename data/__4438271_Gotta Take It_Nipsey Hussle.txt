8 ContributorsGotta Take It Lyrics
All Money In and no money out
Scram Jones
Yeah, Hussle in the house
Yeah-yeah-yeah, what
Uh

Never let 'em knock you off your grind
Even if they plot to take your life
You made it through the darkest, you're the light
Now the world is yours

So you gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)
You gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)
You gotta take it

Listen, look
Look
Lil Dickies, black Cutlass, and a gold Rollie
Us against the world, my nigga, it's me and my brodies
My niggas gangbang, ***** move dope
Expect a war every summer like school clothes
Yeah, we smoke good and we stay fly
Big burners on our laps when we ride by
Shoot it out in broad day 'cause it's on-sight
That South Central state of mind'll have you doin' life
The dead and gone so why we're here, we gettin' head n zone
Presidential suite, kush weed, and cafe Patr√≥n
As we overlook the city from the Renaissance
Poppin' champagne, spill it like it's Evian
You might also like
Never let 'em knock you out your grind
Even if they plot to take your life
You made it through the darkest, you're the light
Now the world is yours

So you gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)
You gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)
You gotta take it

My mama drive an S5, my granny drive a Jag
My big brother in the pen, I'm fresh out and that's that
Crime family, taught to stay down and rise gradually
I serve like Agassi just to make my mark annually
Now run credit in these streets
You see my status be untouchable, hustle, no limit like Master P
And God willin', he'll forgive me 'fore he ask for me
But I'ma rich roller so a hoodster's what I had to be
Huh, and crash cops still harassin' me
I'm young and poppin' so these old niggas mad at me
I paid the cost to be the boss, not half the fee
Nigga, who the next on the west? Just ask the streets
And I bet they tell you Nip Hussle
And I counted five hundred grand in a duffle
Bag with my brother and I put this on my mother
'fore I made a rap dollar off this shit 'cause I'm a
Never let 'em knock you out your grind
Even if they plot to take your life
You made it through the darkest, you're the light
Now the world is yours

So you gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)
You gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)
You gotta take it

I'm a gangbanger with a record deal
Fresh out the county jail, worth a couple mil
Ask on the west side, my name ring bells
So many diamonds in my Rollie bezel, you can't see twelve
I see clear through the motive and your false words
Stack Bundle a nigga and do me like Mossberg
For that exact same reason, I get off first
And keep a long clip, somethin' with a strong burst
To back a bitch nigga up like, "Yup" like
Hump bike, loud clap, bright light, night-night, nigga
It's Slauson Ave in this motherfucker
Hussle, Hussle, look
Never let 'em knock you out your grind
Even if they plot to take your life
You made it through the darkest, you're the light
Now the world is yours

So you gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)
You gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)
You gotta take it

You gotta take it, if you wanna make it
You gotta take it
You gotta take it, if you wanna make it
You gotta take itEmbed
