This right here for anyone who ride with me
Heard me laugh, watch me cry, did time with me
In the game, not just on the sideline with me
I'm a sinner, I'll admit it, but I got God with me

Been to Hell and back twice just to feel the burn
If your ass don't fall down then you'll never learn
I just wanna be the best that I can be
I just wanna be me, even if it sound naive
I thought acceptance from others it would set me free
But it didn't, no
Oh, no, it never did
No matter what I say, no matter what I give
Sometimes people make me question if I wanna live
We call that a dark day, such a dark day
But I know tomorrow gon' come, it gon' come my way
And I know in my heart it's gon' be a better day, it's gon' be a better day
That's why I came here to say

Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)

We make plans and God laughs
Feel like the older I get, the quicker time pass
Some people live in the past, others live in a flask
Even your picture-perfect life, it could be gone in a flash
Texting on your way to work and now your brains on the dash
We all powerless
'Specially people think power last
I ain't cowardice, but sometimes wish I lived behind a mask
'Cause facing this world it's such a rigorous task
It feel like the world wanna put me in the casket
Wish I was stronger, wish I could just get past it
If you feelin' how I'm feelin' when the song play, blast it
If you feelin' how I'm feelin' when you hear this, let me get an...

This right here for anyone who ride with me
Heard me laugh, watch me cry, did time with me
In the game, not just on the sideline with me
I'm a sinner, I'll admit it, but I got God with me
Came up on Section 8 and I made it, yo, mom, look
Writin' these raps in a Louis Vuitton rhyme book
I never thought I'd make it out the hood and now I'm shook
I finally made it out my hood, everybody look
I'm across the street waving where the grass is greener
Hating on how far I've come, I don't give a damn, Gina
This a celebration with no invitation
This the last one then I'm done, permanent vacation
Only place I felt I belonged was Babel station
Cooking crack, cooking crack for my generation
Now it's time to conclude the incredible true story, and transformation
