(Ayy, let me hear that ho, Jeff)

I get the bands, count the blue cheese, I do that shit for fun (Beep, beep)
For every mill' I pop a pill, I do that shit 'til I'm dumb (Dumb)
I had your girl, she at my crib, that was a one-on-one (One)
Smokin' a Back' full of that gas, almost lost my lung (My lung)
I don't smoke trash, need a gas mask, this shit smell like skunk
1600, got a couple opps in the city and they all gon' hunt (Frrah)
The FN-57 all on my waist, there’s no need for me to pop the trunk (Trunk, you too)
You keep tryna make me wan' cuff, but you keep playin' with my love (My love)

You should enjoy your whole day 'cause I am good, my love (I'm good, my love)
How you keep tryna make me fuck but you don't even wan' suck?
Both of my pockets they stuffed, uh
Bank account tryna erupt (Woah, yeah)
I can never go bankrupt (Woah, yeah)
I put your bitch in the tub, yeah
I don't believe in good luck (Yeah, I don't)
Knuck if you buck, make her nut (What? What?)
She never slept in my house (House)
Hit it twelve times in my own Bentley truck, yeah
I just get geeked off the drugs, yeah
Sometimes I check on my plug, yeah
I get money with some Crips, yeah
I get money with some Bloods, yeah
But you don't know, uh
You ain't never seen my other side
Complexion, that's from my mother's side
Don't got the waves that's my brother's side (No)
I will give you almost everything (Everything)
You don’t have to just take some of mine (No)
Rockin' VETEMENTS from the summer line (Summer line)
And you know it is the Wintertime (Yeah)
