38 ContributorsUp the River Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, I'm tryna go back in time, watch 'em freeze up
I'm tryna— I'll smoke some herb, mamacita, yeah
Some things you say, I don't believe you, yeah
These just the ways of the world, but we still takin' chances, yeah
These just the ways of the world, but a nigga still livin' (Will-A-Fool, Will-Will-Will-William)

The way I'm shinin' every day, you might get blinded
I'm out my mind every day, I feel like flyin'
If you don't fuck with me, my nigga, I don't give a fuck
I got some partners, they gon' send you up the river
I keep the same aesthetics, I got the fuel unleaded
I never forget it

Hit my numbers, watch it pile up, I could hit the Lotto
I can guarantee you I'm the one they got they style from

Times is gettin' hard and my money got older
Droppin' back the top, I got the world on my shoulder
Over and over, gotta pour up, gotta roll up
Gotta cover up my war wounds, no time to be sober
Flawless clarity blindin' my demons
You givin' life a new meanin' when you dreamin'
On the block, we was schemin', servin' fiends and
Rollin' dice on the cement, yeah
I came from nothin', no, I don't want from nothin'
They schemin' on my blessings, yeah
Could've been the devil, but maybe it was karma
Surrounded by the drama, oh, yeah
Need to get my conscience back
I can feel chronic in my chest
Sometimes I feel like I'm runnin' out of breath
Hustlin' until the sun come
Feelin' like the last Don left
You might also like
The way I'm shinin' every day, you might get blinded
I'm out my mind every day, I feel like flyin'
If you don't fuck with me, my nigga, I don't give a fuck
I got some partners, they gon' send you up the river (Dead)
I keep the same aesthetics, I got the fuel unleaded
I never forget it, never forget it

Ain't got no room for no mistakes, ain't no flodging
It's the road I took, it was cloudy, it was foggy
Pour four and I'ma smoke up like I'm Marley
It was cold I remember days I was hungry
Ran up, gettin' paid, nigga gettin' cocky
Give a fuck what a nigga say, pockets stocky
Came a long way from sellin' dope to ice rocky
All this platinum ice in the face, feelin' godly
When it's said and done, I'ma make a billion like Kylie
Bitches feed me grapes because I'm grateful and I'm stylee
Ain't got time to wait on niggas, I'm goin' to catch a body
Ain't got time to wait on niggas, I'm goin' to catch a body

The way I'm shinin' every day, you might get blinded
I'm out my mind every day, I feel like flyin'
If you don't fuck with me, my nigga, I don't give a fuck
I got some partners, they gon' send you up the river (Dead)
I keep the same aesthetics, I got the fuel unleaded
I never forget it
Hit my numbers, watch it pile up, I could hit the Lotto
I can guarantee you I'm the one they got they style from5Embed
