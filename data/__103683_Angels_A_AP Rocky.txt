15 ContributorsKeeper Lyrics
Don’t wanna leave her, into the bedroom
Let her know I need her, yeah
She telling me go-go deeper, while the sun rising like a fever
She’s a keeper, yeah, don’t leave her she’s a keeper
Don't leave her, she's a keeper
Whatever you want, yeah, I'm onto, yeah
Yeah, I'm onto, yeah, yeah, ayy

Whatever you want, yeah I'm onto (Onto)
Sip a lil' perc', smoke strong boof
We been through thick and thin, but you thick as shit (Thick as shit)
Go dumb on the dick like you illiterate (Illiterate)
Sippin' 1942 up in the VIP (Yeah)
When I pull it out to buss, she eat the kids (Eat the kids)
When her legs on my shoulder, I hit her wrist (I hit her wrist)
Bitch watch out cause my diamonds hittin' (Ooh)
I'm addicted to that mouth, ain't know when I'm quittin' (Ayy)
When I'm bussin' on the pills, I be gettin' jiggy (Woah)
I don't fuck with no hoes, If she actin' mickie (Actin' mickie)
When I'm bussin' off the pills, I be gettin' jiggy (Gettin' jiggy), ayy, ayy

Don’t wanna leave her, into the bedroom
Let her know I need her, yeah
She's telling me go-go deeper, while the sun rising like a fever
She’s a keeper, yeah, don’t leave her she’s a keeper
Don't leave her, she's a keeper

She ain't gone (She ain't gone)
I got the demons and angels on my shoulders
Heard you needed one to lean on
I'm the same one (Same one)
Same nigga going back to back on platinum body
Everything I sang on (Woo)
Fuck love, nigga ain't on one on one, this shit one up (One up)
Every nigga fell in love with a slut once
She gon' ride like a bikeride, but she like me I know love don't excite her (Nah)

Don’t wanna leave her, into the bedroom
Let her know I need her, yeah
She's telling me go-go deeper, while the sun rising like a fever
She’s a keeper, yeah, don’t leave her she’s a keeper
Don't leave her, she's a keeper

Prada and Chanel yeah you got it all (Got it all)
Your nigga had a budget, I buy it all (Buy it all)
I got a AP, she want, need another more (Another more)
Once she deepthroat the dick, she licked the balls (Yeah)

Pop hunnid don P's, just to prove point (Prove point)

A nigg gotta pop smoke 'em like a joint (Baow)
Baby what it is, you my lil' diva

Take you all around the world, you don't need a visa
Bitch I rock Evisu jeans, when I'm in the Ibiza (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Don’t wanna leave her, into the bedroom
Let her know I need her, yeah
She's telling me go-go deeper, while the sun rising like a fever
She’s a keeper, yeah, don’t leave her she’s a keeper
Don't leave her, she's a keeper2Embed
