5 ContributorsGet It Girl 2016 Lyrics
Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Yeah, yeah
Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Hold up, hold up

Bad motherfucker and I know that
Purse come first, fuck a nigga, where the dough at?
Nigga barely know me, baby, I'ma make him more mad
Down south hottie with a whole lotta body
I could probably make him spend a couple racks if I shake it right
Ain’t no maybe bout this money, I be making right
He say I'm dead wrong but he like to keep me right
Put that bitch up on my team if her mind right

I make her take it off then bring that cash back to me
Break 'em off then run that bag back to me
Been a bad bitch from the H to the D
Hit that nigga in his pockets, easy like a damn freak

Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
You might also like
That’s how you gon' get popped
Tryna get that cheaper price
Bring my niggas out erry night, case this shit ain't moving right
Case these niggas wanna act up, case these hoes wanna act tough
Case you acting big mad because my bitches stuck up
And I'm leaning harder than a D'uss and a quarter
Got your momma trippin' cause I turned out her daughter
Twenty five bitches taking twenty five orders
Twenty five bands in my bag by the morning

Take it off then bring that cash back to me (Back to me)
Break 'em off then run that bag back to me (Back to me)
Been a bad bitch from the H to the D
Hit that nigga in his pockets, easy like a damn freak

Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Get it girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Get it, get it, girl, like the way you bounce
You must have learned that deep down way in the south
Way in the southEmbed
