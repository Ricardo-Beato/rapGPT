14 ContributorsSuperstar Lyrics
He's a superstar, yeahhh {*2X*}
(Told y'all!)
He's a superstar, yeahhh

Superstar, blowin smoke at the hookah bar
The bullet wound on my neck is a Ruger scar
Pop bottles yo, but not just 'pagne
You drink Cristal? Well that's a damn shame
I down Ketel One, bottles of that Grey Goose
That white Hennessy, then I smash the booth
A real superstar, check out the booty y'all
Red and white green hair, that's Gucci pah
Look how the jacket matches loafers it's lookin crazy
Dutches pumped up, plus I live in Macy's
This is Theodore, they call me Starkalicious
Cause my tongue game, is a likkle vicious
I got stupid money, so I'mma keep payin
I keep the paparazzi, and the fans sayin

He's a superstar, yeahhh
He's a super, super, super superstar {he is a superstar}
He's a super, super, super superstar {ohhhh, he is yeah}
He's a super, super, super superstar {oh yes he is a}
He's a superstarrrrr yeahhhh

Mink coats, rock diamond wristlets
Bankroll so thick I don't need a wishlist
Chain swing down to my torn meniscus
Red carpet affair, superstar status
Wish Mike was here to tell you I'm the Baddest
Stalked by TMZ, wanted by Oprah
Followed everywhere from the Garden to the Copa
Take some more vanilla bean to the mocha
Toca, Tone be quick fast to poke ya
The Ace of Spade of the deck, use your choker
Glossy, always the center of attraction
And I bring Redman if it's "Time 4 Sum Aksion"
Grimy, consumed on the forest top ten of tree
Beast of the food chain that's how it's meant to be


Award show skyscraper presence in your memories
Spotlight forever reflect on my accessories
Exotic with it 'til your vomit be the recipe
Movin forward ain't nothin at all ahead of me
Legendary remedy 'til it's medical, get it?
Magnetic and be the most incredible with it
More than legend but riddich, mosh pit lyrically
Godsent to the point see the cynical image
Be on the star source, travellin to Venus
Now you look at me as weird while I morph into a genius
Sometimes it's startlin the way that people see us
But the dickride be heavy and be weighin on my penis~!
Funny how the love be fake but I ain't stressin
Thankful for the love that's genuine appreciate the blessing
Rockstar livin while I'm handlin my biz
Shinin brighter than the sun y'all niggas KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS!
