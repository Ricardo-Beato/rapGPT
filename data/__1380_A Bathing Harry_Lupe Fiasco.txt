Catch me I'm balling, catch me I'm balling
Catch me like Spalding, catch me like Rawlings
If he indeed the MC, vitamin like GNC
Can't see me like BIG on CMT
Did a little bit of time on BMG
But this right here homie, this all me
Can you be down, nah, nigga C.M.B
That's cold, that ain't nice G
So what though, little homie remind me of Ice-T
By the way we share the same birthday
The word play is work but pimping is easy
So catch me I'm balling
I'm sick too if you ain't catch me like coughing
Back when I said you should catch me like Rawlings
It's cool, cause most cats that I bump into can't catch me that often
Most times they just end up falling
Ball for a few then end up walking
Catch me in the ball with a Cinderella waltzing
And I do it until it's no longer exclusive
Might go once, might go twice
But never three times like an auction to it
See I, walk into it, I do my thang
And tell a homie that it's cool to let y'all into itYou might also likeEmbed
