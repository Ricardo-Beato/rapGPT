15 ContributorsGrind State Lyrics
Sound glorious don’t it
Victorious don’t it
This what they came to see My Nigga
I told y'all niggas I was gone come back hard nigga

I can count a million with a blindfold
Got them pointer in the bezel and they ice cold
And every time you see me bitch I grind mo
And every time you see me I’m in grind mode
My dream is to make a million in a day
My dream is to make a mill by 12 today
And I can get it done out my mind state
Don’t need you niggas fuckin' up my grind state

Fuck the bullshit nigga get the money I swear
Then you walk up out the Louboutin store with every pair
Nigga weighing all the sacks got the shoes and belt to match
Just a street nigga spending street money up at Saks
I’m a dealer and I’m known to pull up on them dealer tags
Every nigga in the industry done tried to steal the swag
Got suede on your roof and you're sitting on leather
So many hundreds in your pocket them bitches starting stick together
Took the penitentiary chances and I rolled with that shit
Knowin' damn well they find it they gone pose with that shit
Mama A-1 and you know the kids straight
Only thing a fuck nigga can do is really hate
You might also like
I can count a million with a blindfold
Got them pointer in the bezel and they ice cold
And every time you see me bitch I grind mo
And every time you see me I’m in grind mode
My dream is to make a million in a day
My dream is to make a mill by 12 today
And I can get it done out my mind state
Don’t need you niggas fuckin' up my grind state

Just know if there’s a will there's a motherfucking way
When it come to me and mine I don’t motherfucking play
Took them real live chances boy rolled with that shit
Knowin' damn well they find it they gone pose with that shit
Got a message for you pussy niggas I refuse to lose
Super charger with the hemi nigga I refuse to cruise
Left the Rolls at the crib pulled up in the hellcat
When it comes to that bullshit I can smell that
Chandeliers on my ceilings with the hard wood floors
Nigga two-tone leather with the suicide doors
I see you actin real content nigga and I can't fuck with that
Truth is I want it all nigga nothing less than that wussup

I can count a million with a blindfold
Got them pointer in the bezel and they ice cold
And every time you see me bitch I grind mo
And every time you see me I’m in grind mode
My dream is to make a million in a day
My dream is to make a mill by 12 today
And I can get it done out my mind state
Don’t need you niggas fuckin' up my grind state
Lets go, Wussup, my state of mind is my state of grind nigga
It's how the fuck I feel nigga I told u niggas, while you worrying about another nigga
See the tricks got bigger the houses got bigger the walls got bigger
The circle got smaller nigga its what the fuck I do, you know what this shit is
Survival of the fittest nigga Pro what’s happening and I see us surviving
That’s my grind state nigga grind over mind grind over shine yeah!2Embed
