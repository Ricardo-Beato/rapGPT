17 ContributorsBowtie (Postlude) Lyrics
Oh, baby, we really clean
Really sharp
I mean, in person, baby, in person! Haha
Oh, super fly, baby
Oh, all around the world they talk about us
Do you have any idea on how good it feels to be me right now?
Oh yeah, I got them pink ones, too
Oh yeah, but I know how to wear 'em though, baby
Look, watch out, them gators gon' bite ya
Watch out now! Ow
