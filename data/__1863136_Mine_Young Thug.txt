39 ContributorsMine Lyrics
Yeah, how the fuck a nigga gon' try tell me?
'Bout the motherfucking ice that I'm rocking
'Bout these motherfucking bitches that I'm fucking
And sucking and putting them in a bucket, then
Beat that pussy up like it's the twelveth round
Up in niggas' towns with my Zoe Pounds
I don't go around since it come around
Wet diamonds in my mouth, if I kiss her she drown
If I leave a nigga white t-shirt red, it'll be a peppermint or a baseball, nigga
I know they sick and tired of hearing 'bout my jewelry
But if it fall on the ground, yeah, you might just slip and fall, nigga
She a shark, she like a jaws nigga
Your bitch says she wants a tall nigga
You are one midget you too small, nigga (Little)
She suck my dick and rub my balls, nigga
Big money over here, man
Still active, don't let me show all my skills, man (Damn)
Yeah, my jeans they blue dolphin not no SEALs man (Nah)
I run up money, run up gold like a pilgrim

Nigga, how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
I remember on the block I was serving them dimes, yeah
How the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
If them boys didn't have no dope, I was selling you mine, hey
How the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
Little nigga, gon' and tell me what's all on your mind, yeah
All on your mind, yeah
You might also like
Nigga, big bands on my mind, nigga (Ayy)
Nigga, catch these ones like the swine, nigga (Hear)
Nigga, you be cuffing with no ties, nigga (She not yours)
Twin dimes and they mine, fold 'em like a pork rind
I know bloods that rock burgundy, no wine (Trrah)
Told that nigga best believe I'ma stay for real
In the back of the car screaming, "YSL, hold it down" (Slatt, slatt)
Yeah, hold it down 'til he come back off on an appeal
That's the real deal
I'ma eat that pussy down, then I'ma roll up some kush straight out the fields
I told her straight to her face if she don't do it, I know someone that will
You know the deal
I don't want to drink no lean with these niggas if it's not double sealed
And that's the real
Nigga, big B, balling, no budget
And my car is rare like a mullet (Skrrt-skrrt)
I've seen this bitch from up the stairs, she ain't ugly
Bitches bome up to my room and they get slutty
Bitches ball me Jeff and the F stand for fuckin'
One more time for my jewelry, yes, it's flooded (Woo)
Take that dick up out her coochie, then I butt it
All these niggas with me Blooded like we cutted (SooWoo)

Nigga, how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
I remember on the block I was serving them dimes, yeah
How the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
If them boys didn't have no dope, I was selling you mine, hey
How the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
Little nigga, gon' and tell me what's all on your mind, yeah
All on your mind, yeah16Embed
