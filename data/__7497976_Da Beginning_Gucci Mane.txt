Yeah
Huh (J. White, I need a beat I can go off on, ooh)
Go

Like Riddick, I'm Radric the radical (Huh?)
The trap God I took a sabbatical (Yes)
I married the money, it's practical (Yes)
I'm too hood for corporate America (Damn)
I started off Polo and Nautica (Polo)
My ear is on froze like Antarctica (Brrr)
Baptized your daughter, I slaughtered her (Yeah)
My pinkie ring rock, I just bought it bruh (Bling)
The oxycontin lock up her bottom jaw (Ice)
The key it takes, just in the bottom drawer (Grrt)
Brush 'em, we'll come at the bottom bar (Baow)
Double park, take his Audemar (Brrr)
Fuck the law nigga it's martial law (Woo)
I don't give a fuck about Santa Clause (No)
Niggas takin' off likе Marcia Falk
Knife to a gun fight, fuck ya thought? (Huh?)

(J. White, I need a beat I can go off on, ooh)
You might also like
Gucci thе goat, i'm a jack of all trades
Come down the chimney, like back in the day (Brrr)
I'm in the bush, no milk and cookies
I'ma be look, when you not look
GPS on your car, so I know where you lay (Where?)
Don't go to sleep because I'm on the way (Huh)
I'm 'bout to creep, I'm in the Jeep
Mask on my face, and my stick on the seat (Go)
Cut off the power, it's nothin' to see (Power)
Cut off the lights as I turn down the street (Huh?)
Burn down the house and I'm takin' the tree
The Grinch and your Christmas is nothin' to me (Grinch)
Kneel and defeat as you give me the cheese (Cheese)
Honey baked tied up, his neck to his knees (Huh?)
Frosty the snowman, I told him to freeze (Freeze)
Back then, where he? Now his soul 'bout to leave (Grrt)

(J. White, I need a beat I can go off on, ooh)Embed
