You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away (Eh-ey, yeah)

Damage control (Hmm)
The same old tricks won't work no more
Smarter, stronger, hmmm
A nigga gon' make it through
What is to do, I've been low enough
Hmm, who knew I'd make it out?
Been trapped for too long, I'm out of the web

You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away (Eh-ey, yeah)

Calls from the dark
I got hope in my eyes
No help in sight
I'ma swim in the light
Mmmm, she's tryna pull me in
But the same old tricks can't work no more, oh-oh-oh
I'm out on the way
You might also like
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh away (Eh-ey, yeah)


When you're in love
Swim in the light
Swim in your love
Wish me well
