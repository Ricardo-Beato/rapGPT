20 ContributorsJust My Imagination Lyrics
Aha

Wake up in my king size bed
Girls all around me, eyes all red (All red)
The true life of a player kid
It's nice to wake up to a naked bitch (Uh-huh)
Got the finest clothes, diamonds, hoes
Goin' to sleep on a pile of dough
Lacoste, Phantoms, yards, mansions
Piff in the cannons, house in the Hamptons (Livin' it up)
Big parties every night
This is the life of the paradise
My main man Twista told 'em right
I make 'em celebrities overnight (Overnight)
Grammys, Oscars, starrin' in movies
Got a pool house, four cars, and jacuzzis (What?)
On my way up, gettin' my cake up (Uh-huh)
Wake up!

It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away
You might also like
I got groupies who got groupies
And I buy a new car every two weeks (Two weeks)
My chain got diamonds in it
And my whip got a diamond finish (Aha)
Got the MTV j-j-jam of the week (Jam of the week)
Sign autographs when I stand in the street (Uh-huh)
Plus I been all over BET, Columbia Records and D.T.P. (D.T.P.)
Both want me to sign to their label
Plus I got my own channel on cable (Haha)
Always fresh, court-side, best view (View)
Kanye West and beats from The Neptunes (Neptunes)
Stackin' cream, magazines
Kids dressed like me on Halloween
They lovin' my mixtapes, money like Bill Gates
I'm on top and it feels great (Feels great)

It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away

It's truly a dream come true3Embed
