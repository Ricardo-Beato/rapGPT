25 ContributorsCrazy LyricsI remember then
Back in December, it was winter like '89
Shit I must have been 7 goin' on 8
And comin' from da kitchen was an echo from all the bass
And I ain't talkin bout speakers
I saw my daddy in there
I would stare, but I wouldn't touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Shit, I just knew too much
So I stop bein' lazy, and I became creative
And I learned how to create it
And all that pot's for me
So come see, or come eat
And I hope that she is having the ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come on now, who did you
Where did you, why did you
What did you think she was
That's your ho
But does her water help your garden grow? No
Yeah I know that was crazy
But I think you are more crazier than her
'Cause she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
With no seeds, so she can't eat
You might also likeMy heroes had the broads
And the cars with big ol' rims
And I could remember slangin'
Thinkin', "I wanna be like them"
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, I lived life numb
It made so much sense for me to run when the 5-0 come
Cause I ain't dumb
And that shit I hated
Like early 90s, late 80s
I was hustlin' as a baby
You can ask Eagle Street about me
I'm a G
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little I tote my gun
'Cause it made no sense where I was from
To walk around with none
Shit, nigga you would be crazy
'Cause niggas is crazy
And I'm a 80s baby
You should be proud of me
Cause in them streets
I'm hot like the 80s
And my temperature's raisin'
I'm at 100, I'm blazin'
Somebody shower me
Please, pretty please
You can call me Wizzle
Or you can call me Wayne, man either one
But it's Weezy Baby for your slut
I told her Weezy Baby, I told her more than once
But she just say, "Baby", she just calls me "Baby"
She just screams out "Baby!" when she's on top of me
And the sheets be stickin' like pages
And the bed is so stanky
If she say that is my baby, shit it is possibly not for me
