What I'm asking you is, just, you were intimate with her, in any capacity?
I'd appreciate if you let me know
Alright, let me tell you exactly what happened

Uh, I told her straight up (Straight up)
We could shoot the shit for a bit or we could lay up
Act like you ain't come to get hit, you know I wait up (Wait up)
'Cause when I'm on shots of the whish, you know I stay up (Facts)
I know you miss suckin' this dick, ain't gotta say much
Pillowcase full of makeup, soon as you break up with a nigga
Hit me on the wake up (Brr)
Suitcase packed, sneaky links to Jamaica
Hit it from the back like the nigga fuckin' hate ya
Uh, she call me Bada$$ the Backbreaker
Thе Heart Taker (Yeah), thе Bedroom Dominator (Ha)
Best to don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
'Cause when she hit me 'round three (Ha), I'ma slay it for real
She walk in, I cue the Carl Thomas (Yeah)
Turn the lights down, leave on my diamonds (Yeah)
The way she ride it, I could tell that pussy got some mileage
She been to Met Gala, but she never met a gyalis, boy

Welcome back, I knew you would, uh (Badmon, ooh)
That's why you pull up on me (Bop-bop-bop)
To blow your back out like I should (Brr, yeah, like I should, baby)
Don't nobody know your body, yeah, like I do (Yeah, uh, uh)
Yeah, you know who to call, baby, haha
And when we get in that pocket (Yeah, ayy, I got you)
Look what you done started, oh (Look, check it out, uh)
You might also like
It's not my fault you had to double back, baby
Spinnin' the block, yeah, that nigga textin' mad, ain't he?
Right or wrong, take it any way you want it
Nigga, 'cause she ain't comin' home tonight
So don't you wait up, wait up (No)
He had you on the sideline, play to ride with me
This don't gotta be a sign
Girl, this just a little white lie
When he tell you he love you, you know it's fake
She my sneaky link, ain't no tellin' for being faithful
Grippin' on your body and bendin' it out of shape
Love the way we toxic, we playin' a couple games
Never sayin' a name

Welcome back, I knew you would, uh (Yeah)
That's why you pull up on me
To blow your back out like I should (Should)
Don't nobody know your body, yeah, like I do
And when we get in that pocket (Let's get it)
Look what you done started (No, no, no)

Uh, she say she wanna suck me like oxtail (Uh)
Right off the bone, shorty, and it's on her for cocktail
She hit my phone askin' me if I'm at the spot still (True)
She tryna cop a feel, I dropped the pin and shit got real
Now she in my livin' room sippin' on red wine
We unwind for a little bit, then it's bedtime
Take her upstairs, cut the lights, cue the Ginuwine (Damn, shorty)
She tell me that the pussy mines, I can hit anytime (Anytime)
Now that's the type of shit that a nigga like (Nigga like)
She keep the pussy wet all night and she grip it tight
She suck it and lick it right, I eat it like I got a big appetite (Uh)
Then beat it like she the next nigga wife (Ooh)
I even leave on my ice (Uh), I hit the spot so precise (Uh, yeah)
I'm gifted, she so surprised (Uh), she love it, it's in her eyes
Rub on her inner thighs, makin' them hairs on the back of her neck rise
So when she climax, I swear it's the best prize
Welcome back, I knew you would, uh (Yeah)
That's why you pull up on me
To blow your back out like I should (Should)
Don't nobody know your body, yeah, like I do
And when we get in that pocket
Look what you done started (No, no, no)

Spin the block, I won't judge you (Don't you judge my love, oh)
Spin the block, I won't judge you (Won't judge, I won't judge, spin the block I won't judge)
Spin the block, I won't judge you (Spin the block, I won't)
Don't you judge my love, baby, you gon' love me (Uh, spin the block, I won't, uh)
Spin the block, I won't judge you (Girl, you gon' love)
Girl, you gon' love (Spin the block, I won't judge you)
Spin the block, I won't judge you (Girl, your loving, yeah)
Spin the block, I won't judge you (Spin the block, I won't judge you)
Spin the block, I won't judge you (No, make love)
(That's a legendary young man)1Embed
