5 ContributorsAgainst The Grain LyricsYo, remix joint...
(I gots to make a move and make it soon
I gots to take a block and make it boom)x2
Goin Against the grain... Know what im sayin? Ye-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years since when got knocked
Since he got caught
Pumped up like five new blocks, holding down for it
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket is straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Our estate was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
Cause when it's on, it's on (thats my plate!)
He didn't care
It's like slow down baby
The money ain't going nowhere (what?)
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it
Watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go (go down) against the grain
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
You might also likeI never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled
What is strange is the change that niggas go through
When they're locked down and really can't hack it
A motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket
Strap it on my back, niggas ain't built like me
And by the end, niggas was like "Yo, why you killed Mike, D?
Wasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him
Used to be my man, so I let my cousin do him (we open up shop! It's four in the mornin!)
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA
Cause the money comes quick
Half of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him
Mistakes happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him
Got him up out of there and sent him down a little further
Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder (aahhh!)
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (fo-fo!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
Man, listen, money is missing and shit is hectic
Found the safe, checked it
Shit looks detected
Just what I expected when I got no word from him
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (cash long!)
But money talks and most niggas is snakes
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take
Me to where he was at, checked my gat
Threw in a four clip, pumped myself up
Cause I can't go for that bullshit
Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you
Takin' back for niggas in New York and how they told me so
Now I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough
Layin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story
The famous "Oh you didn't know I got robbed!" story
Told it's to me he should be grateful to
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do
Now there's love lost and a double cross
Pointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce
So you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly
Five bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys
Ten g's in the shoebox under the bed
And for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head
And from then, the moral of the story if you missed it
Is the grain will always gonna be there (why nigga?)
Just never go against itEmbed
