38 ContributorsMade of Glass Lyrics
I'm in love with the girl who loves somebody else
And she doesn't pay attention to anybody else

I'm losing my mind, I'm losing myself
I keep cutting off girls 'cause I wanna be with you but you don't even see me
Am I made up of glass? You don't even see me here
I do a million things for your attention and you don't even notice, no

Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

The time we just spent together
That was the best time we had spent together
That was the first time we had spent together
When you laying in my arms it feels like forever
But when you leave it feels like I'll never see you never

I'm losing my mind, I'm losing myself
I keep cutting off girls 'cause I wanna be with you but you don't even see me
Am I made up of glass? You don't even see me here
I do a million things for your attention and you don't even notice, no
You might also like
Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

Red roses, gold skin with your hair
Parted like Moses, I love watching your poses
They posers on the internet, talking 'bout us both, they just vultures
I want your panties wet, wetter than before you were soaker
You a soldier, baby, nothing like that boy, he's a jokester
I know you like me much, but I think you're afraid of the world
They don't like us much, but I'd be proud to call you my girl
I know I ask for much but today, could you rock out those curls?

Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you5Embed
