I'ma take that bitch to college
I'ma give that bitch some knowledge
Understand that your bitch top novice
Just clap your hands, let me get my dollars
Smell the trees in the breeze, in the breeze
I'ma weed, I'ma weed, I'ma weed
I'ma dance, I'ma ki ki ki
In fact, ya mans wanna meet, meet me
Little G, Little G, Little G
I'ma hand you a free CD
Take a chance if you see me beat
Click-clack, I'll dan-ger ya, reap defeat
Bet ya bleed, bet ya bleed, bet ya bleed
Nigga we, nigga we, nigga we
Not a reason to be sneaky
Whipped up ya plan but ya cheeky-cheeks
I'ma-I'ma-I'ma - hit that bitch
I'ma-I'ma-I'ma - hit that bitch
I'ma-I'ma-I'ma read
I'ma read, I'ma read, I'ma readYou might also like2Embed
