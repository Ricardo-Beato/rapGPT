We trippy mayne (Mayne, mayne, mayne, mayne, mayne)

Uh, blue skies, blue skies, I see you with my red eyes
Bust your fucking grape, nigga, turn your shit to red wine
Don't fuck up my high, nigga, I'm too gone, bye nigga
She get dick, weed, and ignored: that's a D.W.I., nigga
My skin crawlin', my walls talkin', the pictures in here lookin' at me
The ground movin', I'm seein' shit, I'm blowin' like I'm stuck in traffic
I'm smoking on that strong, got me coughin' like I'm getting buried
I've been fuckin' Mary Jane, I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary
I'm stoned, Mick Jagger, I can run around Saturn
Eyes rolling back, and keep blinking like hazards
I said, "King me", king me with my mushroom crown on
I graduated to better drugs, my cap and gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse, what I do is my choice
I'm high as the scoreboard, bitch, look up at my points
I'm trippin' out, cotton mouth, I got high and fell asleep loaded
I woke up and got high again, okay, I'm reloaded, uh

Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
You might also like
We trippin', uh
Shoutout to my weed man, shoutout to my lean man
Pussy ass nigga wanna spark something, I'm a gasoline can
I'm high nigga, don't blow it, I trust it far as I could throw it
I don't know if I'm coming or going, T, make my blunt a Samoan
And I see lights flashin', life passin', take a bitch home, fuck like rabbits
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses, shot glasses, hot flashes
My tongue numb, I can't talk, no balance, my spine hurts
My mind surf, my eye jerks, I try different drugs, I'm diverse
Goodbye Earth, farewell, high as Heaven, eyes low as Hell
Keep scratching, keep biting my nails
Keep lighting a L, I'm a kite in the air
I like weed brownies and cookies, I'm straight but seeing crooked
I got my trippy kit, I hope I trip and fall in some pussy
Tunechi

Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit...
Musty herb in a Ziploc, twistin' up top notch
Weed that I smoke, straight off a boat
Six foot bong, tryna see what I toke
This that Cali Kush, I motivate not gloat
All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna get some Becky in the backseat of the Ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then I laugh
In your baby mama ear, and I'm gonna smash
They call me the trippy king, don't try me nigga
Juicy J with the Taylors, Chinese eyes, nigga

Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit

Man, fuck this hating bitch ass niggas25Embed
