Yeah, alright, my flow sinister
This ain't rap music, this straight literature
Small-minded nigga, all your ideas miniature
They tend to hate on ya when they can't get rid of ya
I ain't goin' nowhere, twenty year career minimum
Call Hit-Boy for beats, ask for ten of 'em
I don't follow trends, my nigga, I swing the pendulum
If the bitch bad, good dick, shit, I'm gon' give her some

Let's reflect times, I try to collect minds
From complex rhymes and, by the way, shoutout Tech N9ne, uh
Go and shut the fuck up, just let me talk, nigga (Shut the fuck up)
I'm a time bomb that's waitin' to go off, nigga
Quitе nuclear, amazin' what fame could do to ya
Too peculiar, although I'm truly a Rеnaissance starter
My mind divine, this shit take me a lot farther
Growing up, shit, I really had beef with my father
But why bother explainin' my feelings?
Try harder, but either way, they gon' paint you the villain (Yeah)
Eight months with no phone, dawg, we aimin' for brilliance
Hi-Level maintain in the building, nigga, we makin' a killin', woo (Oh)

Yeah, alright, my flow sinister
This ain't rap music, this straight literature
Small-minded nigga, all your ideas miniature
They tend to hate on ya when they can't get rid of ya
A wise man told me that silence never betrayed him
Keep your mouth shut, 'cause niggas got ultimatums (Yeah)
Stupid situations, the tongue often creates 'em (Yeah)
The motor mouth nigga is usually causin' mayhem

Lil' Tune flow sinister, I'ma finish ya
Many men gon' need ministers, I'm amen-in' 'em
Enemies, I'm the enema, I'ma shit on them
Just like my keys, drop my genitals on her dental work
My thots I keep confidential or it's consequential
Our philosophies unidentical, I'm not into ya
My Siamese brother Benjamin, it's how I stick to him
These diamond B's all VVs, I call em' Vivica
Skatin' underneath a bridge, stay hustlin' as it is
Make money, feed the kids, ain't nothin' in the fridge
Wake up, repeat the sins, eight blunts, I needed ten
Stay muddy 'til the lid, eight-hundred, eat a dick

Yeah, alright, my flow sinister (Yeah)
This ain't rap music, this straight literature (Mula)
Small minded nigga, all your ideas miniature (Yeah)
They tend to hate on ya when they can't get rid of ya
I ain't going nowhere, twenty year career minimum
Call Hit-Boy for beats, ask for ten of 'em
I don't follow trends my nigga, I swing the pendulum
If the bitch bad, good dick, shit, I'm gon' give her some

Yeah, alright, my flow sinister
(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, alright, my flow sinister
Huh, yeah, alright, my flow sinister
Never lied in my rhymes, you can go ask Jennifer
That's my mom's name, I create and find change
My mind frame ensures that forever I reign, motherfucker24Embed
