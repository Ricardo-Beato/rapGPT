5 ContributorsAll the Time Lyrics

Now you can catch me wit' a bad bitch, she a dime
Cause half for the  cartel time
And that’s all the times
For the times I was workin' with a nine
 block was hot, I'm on the grind ()
And that’s all the time
You hatin' ass niggas get in line
I'ma do it 'til you keep me on your mind
And that's all the time
Can't you see that I'm the last of my kind
Fast thing at the club, that bitch mine
And that's all the time

I’m in this motherfucka  strap
Lay your ass down, you need a motherfuckin’ matress
She wanna roll, like she a motherfuckin' actress
 playin’ wit' I bend her motherfuckin' backwards
Tonight I'm with my brown-skin thing
Calling me alone, I ain’t even gotta hit the switch
Reminisce about the times that I bought my first nina
Team  a few time misdemeanor, yo
Okay,  European headlights
When everythin' went wrong
And now we're tryna get my head right
Bakery was goin', and I was tryna get my bread right
12 been tryna stop a young nigga like a red light
You might also like
Now you can catch me wit' a bad bitch, she a dime
Cause half for the  cartel time
And that's all the times
For the times I was workin' with a nine
 block was hot, I'm on the grind
And that's all the time
Yeah, you hatin' ass niggas get in line
I'ma do it 'til you keep me on your mind
And that's all the time
Can't you tell that I'm the last of my kind
Fast thing at the club, that bitch mine
And that's all the time

Chevy truck on 28's, ridin' high all the time
You slippin' for that set, pull a man got a master crime
Game to your main squeeze, now I got her from behind
Think I was a doctor, the way we be tappin' on her spine
, that make me do a lil' time
Now I'm back to doin' me, blowin' loud, we so shine
Still runnin' with chopsticks keep them K's all the time
Ain't no slime nigga takin' nothin' from a  of mine
Still run with the same team, it's the world, bitch
When you see your 
360 , I'm burnin' up 85
Foreign bitch shotgun, she top me off all the time
Now you can catch me wit' a bad bitch, she a dime
Cause half for the  time
And that's all the times
For the times I was workin' with a nine
 block was hot, I'm on the grind
And that's all the time
Yeah, you hatin' ass niggas get in line
I'ma do it 'til you keep me on your mind
And that's all the time
Can't you tell that I'm the last of my kind
Fast thing at the club, that bitch mine
And that's all the time

Okay, alright, you know I'm drinkin' all night
Why these motherfuckers keep askin' if I'm all right
Oh, I'm doin' good, I was just about to take flight
Smokin' what I'm smokin' on, you be on the same flight
All systems go, yeah, guess who the pilot
Coupe dressed up so fresh, got a stylist
From in the cockpit just know I got the Glock cocked
 let the Glock watch
Last call for alcohol, we ain't 'bout to go yet
Rosé king, bring the motherfuckin' 
30 cars and caravans, we we ain't goin' in
Wake up same time tomorrow, do it again
Now you can catch me wit' a bad bitch, she a dime
Cause half for the cartel time
And that's all the times
For the times I was workin' with a nine
 block was hot, I'm on the grind
And that's all the time
Yeah, you hatin' ass niggas get in line
I'ma do it 'til you keep me on your mind
And that's all the time
Can't you tell that I'm the last of my kind
Fast thing at the club, that bitch mine
And that's all the time
