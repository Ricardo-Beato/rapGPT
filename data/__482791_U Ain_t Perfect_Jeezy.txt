4 ContributorsU Ainâ€™t Perfect LyricsYou ain't never had them grams in your fruit of the looms
Niggas playin cops and robbers like in the cartoons
Your uncle grady never stole all your rocks
You never hid 8balls in your socks
And you ain't lost mailman and goldmouth
And you ain't never had the drug task in your house
Yeeeeeaaaaa
Road hot had to fall back
Lost ten bricks had to crawl back
Would gettin to it but thats another episode
Start my drought lost a quarter mil on the road
The only rapper in the hood where the thugs be
So think twice motherfucker fore you judge me
You ain't perfect nigga so how the fuck you gon judge me
You ain't perfect nigga so how the fuck you gon judge me
You ain't perfect nigga so how the fuck you gon judge me
You ain't perfect nigga so how the fuck you gon judge me
You ain't perfect nigga so how the fuck you gon judge me
You ain't perfect nigga so how the fuck you gon judge me
You ain't perfect nigga so how the fuck you gon judge me
You ain't perfect nigga so how the fuck you gon judge meYou might also likeEmbed
