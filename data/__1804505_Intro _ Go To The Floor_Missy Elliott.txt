5 ContributorsIntro / Go To The Floor Lyrics

Yeah, what's the deal, y'all? This Missy Elliott
Givin' y'all magazine writers, radio cats, listeners or plain ol' haters
A small piece of, of my album which is titled Under Construction
Under Construction simply states that I'm a work in progress
I'm workin' on myself, you know
Uh, ever since Aaliyah passed, I view life in a more valuable way
Lookin' at hate and anger, and gossip, or just plain old bullshit became ignorant to me
When you realize in a blink of an eye, you walkin' down a church isle
And that was meant for weddings and happiness but realizing those same church isles are used to
To view a loved one for the last time
From the World Trade families to the Left Eye family
Big Pun family, you know, Biggie family, 'Pac family
To the hip-hop family, we all under construction, tryna rebuild, you know, ourselves
Hip-hop done gained respect from, you know, not even respect from, but just, like, rock and roll
And it took us a lot of hard work to get here
So all that hate and the animosity between folks, you need to kill it with a skillet
You don't see Bill Gates and Donald Trump arguin' with each other
'Cause both of 'em got paper and they got better shit to do
Get more paper
So all I'm sayin' is, let's take hip-hop back to the rope, follow me

Mama say, mama sah, mama, can you do this? (Woo)
Talkin' like you baddest when you just new to this (Woo)
Every time I come out, y'all be like, "Who that is?" (Woah)
Be more like Ashanti and be unfoolish
You don't really want to bring it with me (Yeah)
You wear Dada, I sport the Fendi
My Lamborghini against your Benzi
Dirty diamonds in your ring, see mines, cling-cling-cling (Ooh)
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-da-ding-ding
I used to get so high, they called me Ming Lee (Woo)
Spiked up my hair to look like Don King (King)
Haters keep on hatin' 'cause them don't worry we (Ooh)
Them don't worry we or me, or Timothy
In my SE, slim down my body (Ayy)
Bang, bang to the boogie, ooh-wee
Playa keep on playin', watch me do my duty (Woah)
Go to the floor (Then tell me what you want)
Grab me a drink (Now what you gon' do?)
I came to shake, shake my booty down, down to the beat (Woo)
Stand on the chairs (And dance like who?)
Dance like the freaks (Now what you came to do?)
I came to shake, shake my booty down, hype the party (Set it off)

I'm underrated, glad I made it, independent, operated
I never hesitated, haters keep me motivated (Up)
The beat is penetrated, I'll let Timmy regulate it
And we laid it in the shade, drink a glass of lemonade and (Woah)
Damn, I'm faded
Ain't no other way to say it, ain't that complicated (Uh)
Ain't no other chicks gon' ever make me feel like invaded (Up)
I keep droppin' hits like water breakin', two centimeters and I'm dialatin' (Woo)
Radio impatient, pause, come on, check my translation
From my observation, my fans is real patient
They don't wanna hear the lies, so stop fakin' (Woo)
You're greasy like bacon, keep my stomach achin' (Uh)
If you wanna battle, let there be no more delayin'
I hope you did some prayin' 'cause when I come swayin'
Pop, shh-pop, pop, pop, yeah (Yeah)
Sometimes I flow, sometimes quick
You was on the verge of kissin' ass, so slick (So slick)
I be on the verge of makin' hits after hits
This the kind of shit that tell yo' mammy don't forget (Woo)
Go to the floor (Then tell me what you want)
Grab me a drink (Now what you gon' do?)
I came to shake, shake my booty down, down to the beat (Woo)
Stand on the chairs (And dance like who?)
Dance like the freaks (Now what you came to do?)
I came to shake, shake my booty down, hype the party, oh

Everybody, move your body, now do it (Uh)
Here's somethin' (Chill) that's gonna make you move and groove (New Missy Elliott, y'all)
Hey DJ, keep playin' that song all night, on and on, and on (On and on, and on, and on, uh)
There's the niggas over there, bitches right here (Woo)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah (Uh)
All night long, I hope you all came prepared (Uh)
It's five o'clock and we ain't goin' nowhere
Ah, yeah, oh, ooh, wee (Wee)
And will the guy the cash choose me? (Woo, ah, yeah)
Baby, I got a man I ain't seen lately (Go down to the floor)

Go to the floor (Then tell me what you want)
Grab me a drink (Now what you gon' do?)
I came to shake, shake my booty down, down to the beat (Woo)
Stand on the chairs (And dance like who?)
Dance like the freaks (Now what you came to do?)
I came to shake, shake my booty down, hype the party1Embed
