21 ContributorsTen Toes Down Lyrics
Know how I'm rocking man
Like cut off stockings man
Keep kush in my pocket man
All designer get ya grind on nigga
Got a breitling for the time nigga
Bang!

I got ten toes down, I got shows and verses
I'ma bring 'em to your town
For the right fuckin' amount, you can hit me up right now
Fifty for a show and twenty for a twelve
I'm a loose screw, I ain't no nail
Walk up in the building
She either smelled the loud or Chanel
I think she goin' for the kill
She steady callin' my phone
My battery she damn near killed me
My phone steady ringin'
This bitch damn near killed me

What's on my line, that "Frr-beep"
They be callin' all the time
Bang bang, what's that, my gun
I up this mothafucka, blew it, make him run, better run
Little Gump, run Forrest, run
Three grams in the blunt, we have one on one
I love gettin' money, and I know you know it man
You don't like me then show it, why the fuck you hold it in
I walk in and break the bank, then walk out and close you in
What the fuck you lookin' at, I swear I don't know you man
I'm sayin' I'ma Glo man, I don't need no tan
I pull up, hop out, standin' in my stance
You might also like
I got ten toes down, I got shows and verses
I'ma bring 'em to your town
For the right fuckin' amount, you can hit me up right now
Fifty for a show and twenty for a twelve
I'm a loose screw, I ain't no nail
Walk up in the building
She either smelled the loud or Chanel
I think she goin' for the kill
She steady callin' my phone
My battery she damn near killed me
My phone steady ringin'
This bitch damn near killed me

Skrrt pullin' off, I'm so raw
Ha-ha high a lot, ruff ruff I'm a dog
Chh-chh go my paws
Cause these fuckas itch a lot
Bitch I got my bong, I don't want you, take me home
I be smokin' skunk, got it from the loft
'Member sellin' junkies, now I gotten dope
'Member red monkeys, closet full of Trues
If you lookin' for me, I'm probably on the news
One plus two, that equals a few
I want ten times 500,000 cool
I pull up rude, my jewelry du-du
Brick and balony in my pocket, Milonakis stew
I got ten toes down, I got shows and verses
I'ma bring 'em to your town
For the right fuckin' amount, you can hit me up right now
Fifty for a show and twenty for a twelve
I'm a loose screw, I ain't no nail
Walk up in the building
She either smelled the loud or Chanel
I think she goin' for the kill
She steady callin' my phone
My battery she damn near killed me
My phone steady ringin'
This bitch damn near killed me19Embed
