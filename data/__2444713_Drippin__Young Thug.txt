102 ContributorsDrippinâ€™ Lyrics
Thugger
What you want from me?
It's YSL until we dead, you know, understand
I know
(Ha)

He geeked on beat
Two freaks I just geeked SK Kel-Tech XPD
OG off Codeine, need more lean
Need more weed to proceed
I know B's, I throw B's, tall P's
I know Pirus, I know nine deuce
If I call 'em they gon' kill it too
Call Duke, he gon' shoot
Yeah, Thugger took it too
Livin' bulletproof, if I was you, I would be mad too
Good shooter, I'm a good shooter
And if I wanna see some titties, I go eat at Hooters
Yeah, yeah, I could be your teacher 'cause I got a ruler
My dad ate hunters for 30 years and they call him cougar, yeah
I got ice, baby, fuck your jeweler, oh
I sip Actavis straight out the cooler (Woah)
Girl you know it, I'll do ya
I give you head, I want your Medusa
I need it, I need it (Yeah)
I need it, I need it (Yeah)
I need it, I need it (Yeah)
Turn me up, I need it, I need it (Yeah)

You don't know ting about me, okay?
Leave me 'lone man, I just want the money
I get back with you when I'm done, okay?
Listen up, ayy

I done spent, I done
I done spent a bag, hundred bands on her, nigga
Woah, I'm comin', comin'
I'm comin' in your lane ready to clash with you, nigga
Big six, yeah, six
Six golds in my mouth like an Old English can, lil' nigga (What? What?)
I wrote my verse here with three bars like an Adidas Stan Smith, nigga (Ha)

Nigga, nigga, nigga
Didn't I tell you 'bout playin' with YSL? (Slatt, yeah)
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
Didn't I tell you 'bout playin' with Lil Jeff?
Why you playin'?
Swear to God I got a hundred blues, hundred reds, hundred blacks, on my right and left (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Niggas spent two bands on some Maison Margiela, pussy nigga, watch your step (Yeah)
Bangin' big B's, fuck a Bentley
Do a hundred-fifty just because they think it's rented (Yeah, skrrt)
Bitches from the north, south, east, west, we got plenty (Yeah)
New Uncle Luke inside your town with way more riches (Yeah, what?)
Make me, make me nut and get some new Indian Remy
Ayy (Yeah, yeah), make me, make me bleed, swear to God that I'ma leave a nigga drippin' (Drip)
I'm drippin' from the start to the finish, nigga (Drip)
I'm drippin' with my niggas and these bitches, nigga (Drip)
I got some Raf Simons on, not no trippin', nigga (Drippin')
Dick, dick, dick keep her drippin', nigga (Drip)
Dick on a stick, got her drippin', nigga (Drip)
Dick with my clique got her drippin', nigga (Drippin')
Dick on her lips, don't kiss it (Oh, drippin')
Jump at it, ribbit, ribbit (Drippin')
I done spent, I done
I done spent about a hundred bands on her, nigga (Woah)
Woah, I'm comin', comin'
I'm comin' in your lane ready to clash with you, nigga
Big six, yeah, six
Six golds in my mouth like an Old English can, lil' nigga (What? What?)
I wrote my verse here with three bars like an Adidas Stan Smith, nigga37Embed
