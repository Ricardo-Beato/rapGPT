He think he all of that

He think he all of that
And I know, and I know
I know you ain't with it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pop, pop, pop (Yeah, yeah), I did it

I am turnt up on them cheap-ass niggas (Let's go)
I take an L, keep givin' 'em hell, I ain't ever been a weak-ass nigga (Yeah, yeah)
I ain't really got no sleep, not really
Told mama these niggas gotta see 'bout me, everywhere I go, I keep one with me
Come around me, I gotta see ID (Bitch), ho, you must be crazy
Bitch, I be NBA ballin' (Yeah)
We have an NBA party (Go)
Bitch, sign that
Don't pull out your phone, don't try that (Uh-uh)
'Fore I leave out, where's my iron at?
They know when I came in icy as fuck, I really don't care 'bout diamonds
These niggas can't stand how I'm shinin' (Face it, nigga)

He think he all of that
And I know, and I know
I know you ain't with it
Pop, pop, pop, I did it
He think he all of that
And I know, and I know
I know you ain't with it
Pop, pop, pop, I did it

Now ever since the pandemic, nigga been on lockdown
When you see me movin', probably cruisin' with my top down
Keep an exit plan, right hand for the knock out
DaBaby and the Dogg, motherfuckers better watch out
Doin' overtime for my grind, I never clock out (Nope)
Twenty-five thousand square feet for my rock house (Yup)
Vet her first, met her first, and let her burst
I got it poppin', four hoppin', niggas coppin' real estate up in my metaverse

He think he all of that
And I know, and I know
I know you ain't with it
Pop, pop, pop, I did it
He think he all of that
And I know, and I know
I know you ain't with it
Pop, pop, pop, I did it1Embed
