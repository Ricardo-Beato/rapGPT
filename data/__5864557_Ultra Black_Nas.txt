Nas, Nas, Nas
Yeah
Nas, Nas
We goin' (We goin') we goin' (We goin')
Uh, uh
My pants 'posed to sag, yeah
We goin' ultra, yeah

We goin' ultra black, I gotta toast to that
We don't fold or crack (We goin')
Occasion, we rose to that, fuck goin' postal (Uh)
We goin' ultra black
Watchin' the global change, hop in the coldest Range
Hit-Boy on the beat, this shit 'posed to slap
We goin' ultra black, we goin' (We goin')
We goin' (We goin') uh

Rhythm and blues, pop, rock to soul to jazz
'Til my toes are tagged (Uh)
How I look being told I'm not supposed to brag?
Nobody fault, I tell the truth, I know it's facts, we ultra black
Grace Jones skin tone, but multi that
Multiple colors, we come in all shades, mocha black
Accept where I'm at and not fight me on it (Uh)
Emotional stares like I might be wanted (Yeah)
Pitch black like the night, I'm ultra black
Sanford and Son reruns, jokes are black (Ha)
Oh yes, oh yes, God bless success
We goin' ultra black, like the Essence Fest
Talk with a mask on, the freshest breath
African black soap caress the flesh
Superfly, The Mack, sittin' fly in the 'Lac
Take the boat on the water, history talks with my daughter (Dest')
My son'll be my resurrection (Knight)
Constantly learnin' lessons, I never die, you get the message?
I hope you be better than I, life's precious (Precious)
Two steppin'
Sometimes I'm over-black, even my clothes are black
Cash Money with the white tee and the soldier rag
We goin' ultra black, unapologetically black
The opposite of Doja Cat, Michael Blackson black
You might also like
We goin' ultra black, I gotta toast to that
We don't fold or crack (Nas, Nas)
Occasion, we rose to that, fuck goin' postal
We goin' ultra black
Watchin' the global change, hop in the coldest Range
Hit-Boy on the beat, this shit 'posed to slap
We goin' ultra black (Yeah)
We goin' (We goin', we goin')

We goin' ultra black
Raiders, Oakland hat, I smoke to that
Pre-rolls and 'gnac, what's the results to that?
C-notes and bags (Uh)
She knows I'm classy like I'm Billy Dee Williams (Smooth)
Go ultra black (Uh), Isaac Kennedy films, Penitentiary II
Black like out in the Lou', black don't crack
It's like the fountain of youth, the culture's black
Like Iman, she beautiful, goin' ultra black
To Africa, you say, "Go back"
I stay pro-black, my Amex black (Ah)
Black like cornrows, afros
Black like Kaep' blackballed from the Super Bowl (Colin)
Hall & Oates, I can't go for that
Motown Museum, Detroit, I'm ultra black
This for New York and all the map
No matter your race, to me, we all are black
We goin' ultra black, I gotta toast to that
We don't fold or crack (We don't fold or crack)
Occasion, we rose to that, fuck goin' postal (This a celebration)
We goin' ultra black
Watchin' the global change, hop in the coldest Range
Hit-Boy on the beat, this shit 'posed to slap
We goin' ultra black (Black is beautiful)
We goin' (Black is beautiful)
