14 ContributorsMr. International Lyrics
Hey, how ya doin?
We all gonna be like a bunch of little Fonzies
What's Fonzie? He's cool!
Yup, meet Mr. International
On the runway more than a fashion show, ya know?
It's all love like McEnroe
But sorry, I have to go, one more time, yo
Meet Mr. International
On the runway more than a fashion show, ya know?
It's all love like McEnroe
But sorry, I have to go

I've been so many places in my life and time
And I know, this fo' sho', I'm a life, that's worth living
I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves
I'm international, because of you
I've been so many places in my life and time
And I know, this fo' sho', I'm a life, that's worth living
I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves
I'm international, because of you

Yo, let me introduce you to the Blacksmith crew, we makin money
Go to sleep with a dream and we wakin up hungry
It's a new day, stomach is rumblin oh well
I'm like Lloyd Banks stumblin' out of the hotel
Overseas show, I'm catchin the last flight
Really need to go, I'm hungover from last night
Out with Gina and MeLa Machinko, we get silly
Had a ball, 'bout to call a cab like Wet Willie's
When I'm in commuter traffic, I'm never worried or panicked
First class travel, I'm flyin Virgin Atlantic
I'm already checked in, I'm ready to settle in
Going places I've never been, I get my Rosetta in
Rackin up the sky miles and gettin them upgrades
And you hate the only place that you visit is upstate
Don't be mad cause I'm writin this rhyme on my iPad
Don't be sad cause tomorrow I'm catchin the flight back
You might also like
I've been so many places in my life and time
And I know, this fo' sho', I'm a life, that's worth living
I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves
I'm international, because of you

I'm a travellin man, movin through places, space and time
Think your life hard workin at your 9 to 5
No matter what you do, you can't imitate my grind
24/7 love ain't that rough
When your career is your passion, know that ain't enough
So when you hear me rappin, it's like I'm makin love
Banging your eardrum
Slingin that good uhh, takin over the planet
You follow my footprints, now you rollin with the greatest
I'm gettin to know the neighbors, I'm tastin the local flavor
Chicks from the ghetto were richer than Portobello
My life is like a movie, a novel by Paulo Coelho
Or the Steely Dan song about a bottle of Cuervo
Colombian Gold, take a hit for the road
It's givin me a vision like I was lickin a toad
Consider me so blessed like momma bakin a cake
And the kids is lickin the bowl, the image stick in your soul

I've been so many places in my life and time
And I know, this fo' sho', I'm a life, that's worth living
I've seen a lot of faces, made a lot of moves
I'm international, because of you
I've been so many places in my life and time
And I know, this fo' sho', I'm a life, that's worth living
I've seen a lot of faces, made a lot of moves
I'm international, because of you
It's because of you
I'm international, yeah
Ooh-ooh, ahh ahh ahh
We're flyin high up above in the sky
The wing on our wingsEmbed
