Yeah, I
Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her
With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em
Until then, I'm gettin' dollars, I'm just doin' what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day, homie
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get 'em all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American
(Salute me, shoot me) Shit, we All-American, yeah (Salute me, shoot me down)

I swear to God I put the hero in heroin (Dope), these flows kilos
I could sell snow to a ski slope
I could sell evil to the devil, nonbelievers to a temple
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic
I went pro, made profit, now I keep some dead faces in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week (All week)
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Twistin' my weed, easin' my mind
Why you worry about me? Stop trippin', I'm fine
Swear these bitches done lost it lately
You put the ho in honest, baby, so complicated
And I may be a little arrogant, I'm aware of it
I know (Goddamn,) I know
I got a problem, I'ma take care of it, weight I'm carryin', gotta let it go
It won't hold me down no more

Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her
With some grandkids, she can spoil 'em
Until then, I'm gettin' dollars, I'm just doin' what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day, homie
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get 'em all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah, now we All-American
(Salute me, shoot me) Shit, we All-American

Goin' nowhere, we ain't
Goin' nowhere, we can't be stopped now
'Cause this rap shit for life

Back then I had a dream
I'd get this money, man
I know my life would change
Just need a hundred grand

Couldn't tell me nuttin' (I ain't sayin' nuttin')
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand (Let me get some money)

Yeah, okay
Back then they used to call me little
But now I'm ridin' somethin' clean in a coat made of armadillo
They haven't got the memo, I'm sayin' I'm the shit, though
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple (Simple)
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is (What your dreams is)
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius (I'm a genius)
Sin every day, someone save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees (Uh-huh)
I'm the plug, what you need though? (What you need though?) I'm goin' beast mode
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat (Wait, what?)
I made a mill' before I paid a bill (Okay)
'Cause fools worried about a wave, I'm a Navy SEAL (Okay)
Come with me, I can make your life change for real (Woo)
Always had a dream of stuntin', it ain't nothin' unless you runnin' shit (Woo)
Just a young ma'fucker with a plan (With a plan)
Thought I was the man
Back when I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was the shit (Oh, you the shit?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Thought I was a king (Oh, you a king?)
When I first made a hundred grand
Couldn't tell me nuttin' (I ain't sayin' nuttin')
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand (Let me get some money)
(Time flies) Let me get some money
Let me, let me get some money

I just need some shoes and my nails (Try to catch it)
And then can we stop at Chipotle?

Let me, let me get some money
