14 ContributorsFuck With Me Lyrics
Drumma Boy

I get it’s the clothes I'm wearing (wearin')
Baby girl she keep starin'(starin)
And I'm looking like I've been getting money all day
Your boyfriend run errands (errands)
I don’t want to meet your parents (Nope)
She angry I'm not carin' (nah)
Too high to greet your mom
Do your daddy know what your wearin'? (yeah)
I just can't hold all this gualla (gualla)
Gotta give some to my partna (holy)
Got a stash bag for these hunneds
But I Gotta sneak in with this choppa (bow)
Don’t give a damn about coppers
Local police can't stop us (what)
All my hoes say I'm thoughtful
But my attitude is I'm awful (so)
That’s your girlfriend for life
But the next hour I bought her
Look at all that shit I bought her
She my homie we partnas
She's the realest bitch, a shopper (shopper)
Like a high fashion model (gucci)
Know you broke so she don’t bother
When she call me tell her I got her (got her!)
You might also like
Uh she fuck with me, she fuck with me (I'd fuck with me)
To tell the truth if I was her I'd fuck with me (I'd fuck with me)
A body like that she can't fuck for free (damn)
And that ass so fat you gotta have some cheese (uh)
Do you agree, do you agree? (yes i agree)
She know everything one thousand when she fuck with me (thousand)
Do you agree, (I agree) do you agree?
She's so fine a married man will tell his wife to leave

Go! Go!

She so fine married man and tell his wife to dip (dip)
Momma broke the news and told the kids that daddy slipped
But I don’t even know if dad know what he dealin' with (whatchu getting into)
It costs a grip for these 2012 relationships
Red bottoms, gold bottles
Where she go that bread follows (go)
Had a boyfriend but the feds got em
They ball players we bread partna
I can't lie she got a big posse
Next day she forgot about ya
Stop before she get the Audi out
She's so busy about ya suck the engine out ya
Her home girl a trap star
Could track a bitch like Hershel Walker
Ain't Usher baby its Gucci baby
No moonwalker I'm a smooth talker
You were dead fine when I first caught ya
Fell off so I ain't thought ya
God shames how you looking at me
So I seen you girl but I ain't saw ya
Uh she fuck with me, she fuck with me (I'd fuck with me)
To tell the truth if I was her I'd fuck with me (I'd fuck with me)
A body like that she can't fuck for free (damn)
And that ass so fat you gotta have some cheese (uh)
Do you agree, do you agree? (yes i agree)
She know everything one thousand when she fuck with me (thousand)
Do you agree, (I agree) do you agree?
She's so fine a married man will tell his wife to leave

Go! Go!2Embed
