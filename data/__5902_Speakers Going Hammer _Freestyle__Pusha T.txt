21 ContributorsSpeakers Going Hammer (Freestyle) Lyrics
I wake up, early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up?
And tatted up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because I have the speakers going hammer
(The dough boy version though, yeah)

Back up in this bitch niggas free to go
It was all good just a key ago
Price for the 20 all I need to know
Still moving snow like it's 3 below
You trace hard, while I cake hard
You niggas Lil B's to the Based God
I been cooking, is you mistooken?
Chi town plug got the city jukin'
Givenchy motorcycle leathers
Mad Max, 5 stacks for a look this weathered
Small circle bad bitches all think they clever
The mixed ones whole shape and recycle better
Sit them on a curb when I'm done with 'em
She oblivious her girl wanna come with 'em
Can't blame her; other niggas can't run with 'em
Usain Bolt through these bitches then I'm done with 'em

So Liv
I picks her up, right?
She tells me: Oh I thought I saw you earlier
This guy had a Range Rover just like you
I said Range Rover where? This ain't no motherfuckin Range Rover
This a G55; 130 thousand dollars of winter throwaway money
You must be out your fucking mind
See I could tell you ain't gonna be around long
You ain't doing enough motherfucking homework on your nigga
