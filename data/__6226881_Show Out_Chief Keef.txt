Yeah

If you get it in, then you know you ballen
Love to hit the mall  shot calling
Get a lotta bands, pockets on swole
See the racks off in your pants, show out

Show out

All the girls show out

All the boys show out

Let me see you show out

All the girls show out
Show out
All the boys show out
Show out

You might also like
I got hoes, they keep my pockets swole
And when I got money, I blew it all on clothes
I'm a pro
Bitch I'm ice cold
These niggas make me sick, I sneeze, let me wipe my nose
Show out
I do it when I show up
, I said "Hold on bitch, slow up"
It's a low life, so you knew I had to go up
Shawty let's coast, like a motherfucking roller
I told ya
 cowabunga
She say  call me Mr. Willy Wonka
I'm a monster
Riding in a tonka
Why you on my dick?

I'm fly like a bird
The reefer calm my nerves
Chief Keef shawty, get around like
