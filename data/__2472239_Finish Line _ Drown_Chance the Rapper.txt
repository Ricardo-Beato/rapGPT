194 ContributorsFinish Line / Drown Lyrics

Do-do-do, do-do, do-do (Huh)
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do (And we back, and we back, and we back, and we back)
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do (Huh)
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do (And we back, and we back)
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do (And we back)
Do-do, do-do, do

They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter, I was acting a fool
But who would think the raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head, I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body, can't rely on myself, oh, no
Last year, I got addicted to Xans
Started forgetting my name and start to missin' my chance
L.A. for four months, end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city, bitch, I sleep in my hat, uh
I felt hogtied ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there, he just sit and he wait
I'll be racing up the stairs, I'ma get to the gate, singing

Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do, do

Oh, all my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh, I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine, yeah (Hey)

Gimme the water, gimme the water, I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just tryna make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray, I got to pray, like Hammer after "2 Legit"
I got the power, I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrape off stupid shit, I stand up like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much, you'd think they drive an Uber whip, damn
Queen said, "Why we in a queen bed?"
I said, "It's yours, don't worry, lil' beanhead"
I'm just here to catch my breath, I got the world tattooed
She said, "Cool, just bring me some food"
Oh, all my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh, I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
I'm gonna finish mine, yeah

Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do, do

Alright, we got it


The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God, seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love

Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
Never, never, never (Chance, let me in, come on)
This thirst in my soul (There's a thirst in my soul, it tell me)
Where else can I go? (Where?) but You? (Come on)
I may cry a river (I may cry a thousand tears, but)
But You take each drop and You wash (You wash me new)
Me new (People sing)
This water is deep (Yes, yes and I need You to)
Jesus, rescue me (Come on, save me, I need You to)
Take me to Your mountain (Hallelujah)
So someday Chicago will be free (Someday, we'll all be free)
Be free (Say)

The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown20Embed
