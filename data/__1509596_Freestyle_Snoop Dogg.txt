4 ContributorsFreestyle Lyrics
Yea man, I heard you wasn't gonna do it no more
They said it was overwith for you
Overwith? shit nigga I ain't going nowhere
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere

Snoop Dogg this is me
Back up in the place to be
I walk a bit, I blaze a jay
I talk some shit, hey hey hey hey
I'm going at baby
Listen close we gon' dream
And we gon' toast, this that year
When things was bad this that time
When I'm gon' smash getting cash
Is all I know, I think the year was '94
Or was it later really don't matter
Cause I gets cheese , I gets cheddar

Funny style, funny niggas
Funny style, funny niggas
Funny style, Kurupt in the building
They funny style, aye Snoop
Punk motherfuckers in disguise I can tell
Soon as I see them when I rise in the spot
Gotti in the building everybody realized
Looking in my eyes niggas is surprised
What the fuck is cracking don't they know what's happening?
The next time this nigga get close, clap him
This nigga like a bitch moving so slow
You might also like
Just bring the beat back and let the shit bang
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I came to bang
I don't come to play I come to drop heat
And niggas like you get dusted in the streets
You just try to rap about what you know
And I'm gonna keep this shit way on the low
Me man my clique me and my crew
We come through this bitch and banging on you
You think you can fuck with us
But I don't think you'll fuck with us
See we the shit DPGC
For 20 years and thats all me

Bitch, run through the spot
Tipping the hit
Run and get all my money nigga I get
The bitches they love me and they stay on my dick
I'm rolling with dabs, little half 
Me and big Snoop getting that bread
Make them pussy lips spread
Bitches is crazy, they all on my dick
Loving my Mercedes what up bitch

I'mma show you motherfuckers whats a poster G
And let me get these niggas close to me
You can size me up, you can picture the frame
You can study my style you can write down my name
You can change up the beat and you can slow this shit down
You can try to get close but this is still Dogg Pound
We be fuckin it up, we be smoking the dope
We be on the tour bus from coast to coast
Got all my money, all my hoes
Every corner, all my hoes
All my homies, all my souls
Like what's crackin, and they know
In a second niggas get hit then it's over
Look look, why these niggas trippin all over
In the spot with my homies deep with heaters
Looking at these suckers pulling out they millimeters

So y'all should know when you stepped up
You got fucked up and that's what's up
See this is true we gray and blue
DPGC I thought you knew1Embed
