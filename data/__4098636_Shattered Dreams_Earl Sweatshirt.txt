Imprecise words
Yeah, chief, get it 'cause we mean it
Ease up, free smokin’, niggas need it
Mask off, mask on, we trick-or-treatin'
Back off, stand-offish and anemic
Yeah, my nigga Ish told em it's a feelin’
Blast off, buckshot into my ceilin'
Why ain't nobody tell me I was bleedin'?
Please, nobody pinch me out this dream

I said peace to my dirty water drinkers
Psh, nobody tryna get it clean
Why ain't nobody tell me I was sinkin'?
Ain't nobody tell me I could leave
Yeah, weed win again, seethin' within
Seen teeth on the floor, leakin’ again
We hold the door, uh
We build the bridge, we hold the courts
Send a cease and desist to your thieves, nigga
Please do abort, I could feel when you’re forcin' it
Still in a bore riddim
Boy, I take the tour chips and go and get some decent decor
Is you gon’ ribbit or will you jump?
Get some more ribbons for the born winners from the junk
Niggas don't listen 'til they whole mission was a bust
No sit-up, but it's crunch time, shootin’ in the clutch
The midsummer sunshine found me on my ones, face drippin', uh
Hate swimmin' through your bloodlines
Motherfuck the judge, same goin' to the one time, yeah
Come and take a stroll in the mud
Dip a toe in it, heard the hammer like a grudge
When you holdin' it close, we was on the cusp
It was holes in the boat, we ain't make a fuss
Uh, it's chosen
You might also like
Imprecise words
Yeah, chief, get it 'cause we mean it
Ease up, free smokin', niggas need it
Mask off, mask on, we trick-or-treatin'
Back off, stand-offish and anemic
Yeah, my nigga Ish told 'em it's a feelin'
Blast off, buckshot into my ceilin'
Why ain't nobody tell me I was bleedin'?
Please, nobody pinch me out this dream
