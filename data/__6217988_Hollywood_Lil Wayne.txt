18 ContributorsHollywood Lyrics
I just flew to Hollywood
Gettin' racks, I'm good (Racks)
Just like DaBaby, they Suge
I made money, you made books
I just flew to Hollywood
Gettin' racks, I'm good (Racks)
Just like DaBaby, they Suge
I made money, you made books
They just mad 'cause they broke
They know I'm the G.O.A.T.
Ice on my wrist like, woah (Ice, ice)
My dreadlocks hang low
Shoutout to my bros
Your girl call me Naruto
Goku, Super Saiyan, yo
Now call your girl Amber Rose

I'm takin' off like a spaceship
All these kids be hatin'
I float on this beat like I'm Jason
That girl emo, call her Raven
In a fast car, I'm racin' (Vroom)
All you rappers clout chasin'
Why are people so racist?
BLM every day, man
Pray to God, say, "Amen"
That dude so old, call him a caveman
But I'm gettin' to school with the cavemen
I steal your girl, now she's my baby
I'm countin' these racks on the daily
I stay lit, I go crazy
Y'all rappers sound like babies
Y'all just look like the candy, cry babies
Prayer hands, yeah, I look up to God
2020 is the worst year so far (It's bad)
I might take your girl to the moon and the stars, yeah

I just flew to Hollywood
Gettin' racks, I'm good (Racks)
Just like DaBaby, they Suge
I made money, you made books
I just flew to Hollywood
Gettin' racks, I'm good (Racks)
Just like DaBaby, they Suge
I made money, you made books
They just mad 'cause they broke
They know I'm the G.O.A.T. (The G.O.A.T.)
Ice on my wrist like, woah (Ice, ice)
My dreadlocks hang low (Low)
Shoutout to my bros (My bros)
Your girl call me Naruto (Naruto)
Goku, Super Saiyan, yo (Yeah)
Now call your girl Amber Rose

You are a baby, yeah, you need a diaper, yeah (Wah, wah)
