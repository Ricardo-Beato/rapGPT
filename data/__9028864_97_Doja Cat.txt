Pull up in the '97 Benz (Baby, get up in)
Sexy with that fire-truck red (With the windows tinted)
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley (You so ignorant)
Looks like we don't give a shit (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (Looks like we don't give a shit)

Yеah, I ain't got no skeletons in my luxury walk-in
They ain't know I'm innocеnt, baby, look who is talkin'
They ain't even ready-spaghetti, baby, they sauceless
Speedin' through the city, we medicated the horses
You could hit up PETA, the paint on me make me gorgeous
I'ma take the geese-and-chinchilla coat on a walk and
Don't forget the cheetah print, speed up, come here, record it
If that shit ain't bleedin' and screamin', I do not want it (Take it back)

Pull up in the '97 Benz (Baby, get up in)
Sexy with that fire-truck red (With the windows tinted)
Smokin' while I cruise through the Valley (You so ignorant)
Looks like we don't give a (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Said looks like we don't give a shit (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (Looks like we don't give a shit)

Yeah, said these are clothes, motherfucker, what are those?
You look like a butter face, butter body, butter toes
I put Can't Believe It on my early morning butter toast
Y'all cannot believe I'm not a fiend and that it wasn't coke
You look so uncomfortable
You could have a seat and several hundred mo'
Hop up off my D just like a bunny go
Hop up out the scene and now they want it mo', I don't know
I like when they plead, "I'm beggin' please, now where the fuck is Doj?"
Pull up and they smiley instead (Actin' stupid)
Like they wasn't tryna fight me in threads ('Bout some music)
In a tweet that I'ma probably still stand by (I'm ruthless)
Keep ya money, funky bitch, 'cause I don't play about (The rumors)
They gon' buy it, they gon' pirate, they gon' play it, they consume it
If you're scootin', let me know 'cause that's a comment, that's a view
And that's a ratin', that's some hatin', that's engagement I could use
And I could teach y'all how to do this, but I'd much rather be cruisin'

Watch me pull up in that '97 Benz (Baby, get up in)
Sexy with that fire-truck red (With the windows tinted)
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley (You so ignorant)
Looks like we don't give a shit, said (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, hm (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, yeah (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, huh (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, ha (Looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't
That's 'cause we don't
Motherfucker, that's 'cause we don't
Lil' bitch, that's 'cause we don't2Embed
