7 ContributorsMijo Lyrics
It was a dark and stormy night
Puddles of rain reflected the stop lights
The world fell asleep, but I'm wide awake
Listening to traffic on the highway, from half a mile away
I'm looking up in my family, kaleidoscope
I'm trying to float with some harmony, hit some higher notes
And I don't know if I'm supposed to cover your eyes
But I chose to hold your hand and watch the sun rise
Live within the gift
Recognize the warnings
Memorize the answers
This is a recording
I love you to the moon and back
There's nothing new 'bout that
It's just a proven fact
And somewhere my dad is listening to the engine purr
Someday I'm gonna finish my verse
I inherited that free-refills-type thirst
I'm counting on my children to break this curse
It goes

I don't know how much time we have left
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath
I'mma exhale and remember your birth
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth
I don't know how much time we have left
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath
I'mma exhale and remember your birth
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth
You might also like
It's funny right
Our only reason that we're trying to find this money is to buy us some time
Rise and shine, I gotta weigh these fish
To educate my kids, on how to bait they lines
I wonder if this is how the aliens felt
Just 'cause the hate theyself, don't mean they change theyself, nah
Still chasing after gratification, at this point I ain't even know what that would take
Don't make a mess in your drawers just to get some applause
You don't wanna be the bullet that your ex has dodged (haha)
Another bumper sticker, but it's enough to consider not to jump in the river
I can play the xylophone out of a pile of bones
But sometimes can't even find the stones to dial your phone
I built a whole kingdom out of styrofoam
And you can have it when I'm gone

I don't know how much time we have left
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath
I'mma exhale and remember your birth
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth
I don't know how much time we have left
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath
I'mma exhale and remember your birth
It's never too late to get some heaven on earthEmbed
