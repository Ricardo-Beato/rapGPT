89 ContributorsHigh All The Time Lyrics
Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

Every time I roll up, niggas holler, "Roll up"
Then I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money
You ain't smoking in my Benzo, twenty inch Lorenzos
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holler at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holler get 'em, girls, daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's (Yeah)
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny (Yeah)
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis (Woo)
They was just harassing me 'cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud
You might also like
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
But I twist that lye, lye-lye-lye

I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Now let me show you how to greet me
When you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holler, "G-Unit"
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I could go at Nas and Jigga both for the throne
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

Now, who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines?
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach 'em how to buck them .380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog (Woo)
My team, they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga? Go 'head, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

G-Unit, are you ready?
G-Unit, are you ready?
G-Unit, are you ready?
Nigga, ready or not, here I come, come, come22Embed
