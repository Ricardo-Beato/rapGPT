Don't look at that skeleton too long, might drown (Swim, swim)

Donatella on the bootstrap (Versace), whole crew got a T.R.U. tat (Yeah)
Whole crew got a T.R.U. chain (Yeah), Maybach, not a Mulsanne
100 thousand in the Blue Flame, cross a nigga like a spiritual (Cross)
Before rap, I was in the trap, and my record was criminal (Uh)
Baby girl got that water park, when she get up, she left a water mark
Black Patek Philippe (Uh), motherfuckers like Armor-All
Okay, now all in all (All in all), got it from wall to wall (Wall, wall)
Took it from mall to mall (Mall to mall), dropped it from stall to stall (Shittin')
Shittin' on niggas subliminally (Uh), all of my shoes are from Italy (Ill)
Hard-top coupes, no Kennedy, she'll pay cash, no penalty
Marble all my floors (Yeah), blue strip all my rolls (Alright)
If the money fold (Woo), that mean the dope ain't sold (Sold)
I like it straight (woo, uh), that mean ain't gotta debate (Uh)
Ice on stakes (Uh), pull up with a serious face (Skate)
The way these hoes like to film a nigga, Larenz Tate (Quavo Larenz)

Swear they shakin' like some dreads (Shakin')
Oh, that mean we got 'em scared (Scared)
Look up at your man's head (Look)
Tell me what color that dot is (What?)
Dot on his head is red (Red)
Get popped for some shit that your brother did (Brrrp)
I love my mama, never changin' on her
So I gotta let his mama live (Mama)
I beat the pot up like Adrien Broner
Make him vanish, David Copperfield (Copperfield)
Came in the game and was independent
We was screamin' out that we ain't got a deal (Fuck a deal)
Said I ain't playin', this the face I make
When I call my plug and he ain't got a seal
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, my name is Takeoff, I'm outta here (Gone)
Open the door and then got in there (Got in there)
Quiet, I pick up the silencer (Shh)
Shoot it up 'til they acknowledge us (Brrrp)
Ballin', but they keep foulin' us (Ball)
And ain't no stoppin' us (No), try it to see the apocalypse
Said I got a big scale same size as his scale, yeah (Yeah)
We too playa (We too playa)
Yeah, we too playa (We too playa)

New Moncler (Drip), throwin' salt on a playa (Salt)
Save the salt for the snails (Salt) or the rocks in my ear (Rocks)
Put you in the Bentley (Skrrt), brand new Selena (Selena)
She a bad bitch, I seen her (Bad), I'm flooded, call FEMA
I do it the best (Best), I am too playa to stress (Playa)
Drip like the mayor, more or less (Drip)
I like your bitch, I caress (I like her)
Dry down the stick nigga, hush (Hush)
Codeine syrup a must (A must)
Wraith with the peppermint guts (Wraith)
He sweet, he keep holdin' nuts (He sweet)
Your bitch is a throwaway mutt5Embed
