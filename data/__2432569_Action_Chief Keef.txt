Got my toolie, don't make me...
Got my toolie, don't make me...

I got my toolie, don't make me use it
Eating shit up like baby food
Smoking on this good (dope)
Baby, my life is a movie (action)
My niggas going for action
Spot 'em, got 'em, clap 'em
I'm the CEO, king Almighty, and I'm the captain
Bitch this my ship, I'ma sail it

We come through, firing shit up
Yo mama shit, frying shit up
Smoking on a big blunt of tika
One ounce got me ticked off
Cause I don't wanna have to kill 'em
Cause he think it's chocolate vanilla
Smoking OG, but I'ma gangsta killer
Come through shootin' shit like Cranked lil nigga
Glo Gang, I glo, you can't, lil nigga
Smoking dope and sipping drank, lil nigga
That bitch should've liked me cause my bank a lil bigger
And I'ma Glo Gang, same with killers
I'm searching
All these toolies with us gon' go gah
Let a nigga try the Glo, we gon' go bang
Bullets can't stand one thing like my mans
You might also like
Got my toolie, don't make me use it
Eating shit up like baby food
Smoking on this good (dope)
Baby, my life is a movie (action)
My niggas going for action
Spot 'em, got 'em, clap 'em
I'm the CEO, king Almighty, and I'm the captain
Bitch this my ship, I'ma sail it

I got diarrhea, I just shit
Fuck boy, for you I got a proposition
Go spy on the oppositions
Tell me what they lock and kick it
Go on they block and kick it
We ain't going through, bitch we send bananas and bitches
And they play too much damn Call Of Duty
Chopping shit like Martha Stewart
Nigga, I'm that dude
Hate on Lil Sosa, that's all they do
Cause I make a mess when I'm coming through
Driving fast, they wish I found a wall and run into it
Bitch, I'm embalming fluid
Don't make me fire you up and start burning you and
Place them bullets in your face, bitch, furnace you
Mac eating niggas Big Macs and baby food
I got my toolie, don't make me use it
Eating shit up like baby food
Smoking on this good (dope)
Baby, my life is a movie (action)
My niggas going for action
Spot 'em, got 'em, clap 'em
I'm the CEO, king Almighty, and I'm the captain
Bitch this my ship, I'ma sail it1Embed
