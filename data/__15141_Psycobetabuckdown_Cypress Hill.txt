I increase my throttle, uplift my shuttle
Tribe in a huddle, pilot on auto - bro
I'm not a role model, more like a psycho
A Bates type of psycho, cuttin' you like Michael
Halloween character, or computer wizard
Hit you with the blizzard, cut your circuit with my scissors
Shorts'll get crossedwired, you're in the crossfire
You get blasted, you dumb-ass bastard
See you need the day-ta, better I say dah-ta
You're looking at the Tribe, and you're a hater
Comin' from inside, means I come better
Or should I say rather, together I'm gonna set ya
Head in the casket, your body in a basket
A tisket, a tasket, I told ya I'm gonna blast ya
When I'm on the psycobeta, state of
Mind over magnum, you know I'm gonna tag them
You're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
What you're runnin' from is a psycobetabuckdown!

 Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
 Psycobetabuckdown baby!
 Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
 It's a psycobetabuckdown! Huh!
 Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
 It's a psycobetabuckdown!
 Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
 Somebody's gettin' bucked down
You might also like
See I'm from South Central, bustin' out my metal
Rapid-fire petal, fuck is making me get mental
Yo, it make no sense, so here son the scalpel
Sen start the massacre as I get nasal
The phase'll be like a murderer's maze yo
You won't find B-Real, inside any kind of cage yo
Sen is the gangsta, me I'm just a pimp
Broads swingin' off my dick like a chimp, simpin'
So what's the story, you come looking for me?
Better just scatter, or you're gettin' leaded
I'm the one who said it, boy it doesn't matter
You're gonna get splattered with my funky ill juice
Cause I'm "The Phuncky Feel One", makin' you get real loose
My intellect, dialect, dialogue, intellect, catalog
From what you want me to select
Different forms of beta, psycho for alpha
The way I stay in control of myself
I'm not one of many penny ante on the gauges
In the stone ages, make minimum wages
Show me where the stage is, I come to get the brain on
HEY MAN, get the fuck off the 'caine bro!
You're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
What you're runnin' from is a psycobetabuckdown!
 Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
 Psycobetabuckdown baby!
 Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
 It's a psycobetabuckdown! Huh!
 Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
 It's a psycobetabuckdown!
 Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
 Somebody's gettin' bucked down

Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
Yo where's the hooda?
Hahaha, funky, yeah
I don't like that crazy shit man..Embed
