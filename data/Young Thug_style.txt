Nowadays I take my thoughts, then I'm down like a wrestler
Work hard like a slave but live better than the master
And what we do it wrong, why it feel so right?

And that ass I got to have, I’m not grabbing, we can share it
Baby girl don’t take it personal, but I can never ever ever propose
But them M’s I can post those, and I’m smoking indoors outdoors

And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it's worth

So I never made love, never made love (Ayy)
