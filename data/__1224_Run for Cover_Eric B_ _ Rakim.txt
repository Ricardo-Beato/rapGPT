Here I go again, ready to flow again
Better hope my mic don't blow again
Warned by alarms when the mic gets warm
Crowd'll get critical, can't keep calm
Jet for the exit, why hang around?
Words that I found make the mic melt down
If you stay, better cooperate, cuz I  amputate
And whoever don't break, I'mma suffocate
Leave em with asthma, you better pass the
Mic to the massacre master that has the
Power to build and destroy at the same time
So track the wack and the right and exact will shine
Make the beat overheat, but I won't stop
So evacuate the spot when the mic's hot
Switch it from one hand to another
And that's a hint, my brother, run for cover
Because I'm armed, my brain contains a bomb
As if I escaped from Vietnam
Some people label me lethal
Lyrics I made then put beats to
Format, collapse your lungs, twist your tongues
You can't bump your gums off of none of the drums
Words that I made'll create an iller scene
Eric B-eing the fly human being on the guillotine
Hook 'em up to a respirator, cause it's the mister suffocator
What I write its like shoving a mic down your windpipe
Don't let him bite rhymes Rakim write
No mic-to-mouth resuscitation is necessary
No obituary, and nothing left to bury
As he strikes on the same mic twice and then
Cut it on, and I'mma strike again
I meditate off the break, till the place shakes
Then I make rain, hail, snow and earthquakes
Speak the truth, tear the roof off the mother
The stage is stomping grounds -- run for cover
You might also like
Evacuate the building, danger, cause I came to explain a
Strategy that'll be tragic automatically
Havin' me to cause another catastrophe
All you gotta do is give Rakim the
Microphone and the crowd'll yell timber
Buildings collapsin', rappers getting trapped in
Areas closed off, no one gets back in
So set up roadblocks, barricade the cross-fade
Put a detour sign on the stage
Hold my microphone as evidence, the weapon I use
And been using ever since
The days in the park when, rap was an art then
Plus I was dominant, determined and dark-skinned
Making it hard to walk the streets at night
For those who talk the weak beats on the mic
Whoever's living large better wear camouflage
Prepare to be bumrushed when I yell charge
Surround by the sound of the beat-down another brother
This is stomping grounds, run for cover
Wheels or foot better not stay put
Whole place shook till the mic's unhooked
Then you got seven minutes to vacate the premises
Lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes
Don't act wild, single file to the door
No need for an encore, just clear the floor
Cause my mic's about to self destruct
The stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt
So make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned
Cause minutes from now it won't be standin'
Then send out an A.P.B.: All Poets Beware of a brother like me
Now how many rhymes could your man manufacture?
How many biting MCs can I capture?
Trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth
Take over they route, play 'em out like a cub scout
So leave trooping for MCs at war
And if it's a battle let the crowd keep score
Cause me and the drummer make drama, and that's word to mother
