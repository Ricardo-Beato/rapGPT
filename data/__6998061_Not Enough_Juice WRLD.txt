She said it's not enough
Oh-oh-oh, uh

Now I've been drownin' in this liquor bottle, but drowning's not enough
They tell me that I won't live to see tomorrow, but I don't give a fuck
I'm running out of patience, out of pleasure, and runnin' out of luck
I'm really scared that we won't stay together
What if you run out of your love? You run out of your love

I hope you know, if I said it, baby, I meant it
Straight lovers, we ain't goin' to a friendship
Fell for you, I don't know how it happened (Uh)
When we kissin', I taste all the passion
Time worth more than money, but I'll spend
All of it on you, me and you, until the end
No talking, baby, I'm about that action
All these othеr hoes are so irrelеvant, honest
You taught me what real love is

Now I've been drownin' in this liquor bottle, but drowning's not enough
They tell me that I won't live to see tomorrow, but I don't give a fuck
I'm running out of patience, out of pleasure, and runnin' out of luck
I'm really scared that we won't stay together
What if you run out of your love? You run out of your love
You might also like
I need you
To make it through

My bad for all of the stressful times that we had
I know you scared that I'm gon' relapse, I love that
Where the drugs at? You know that I love that
Let's go out tonight, where the clubs at?
Endless drugs, I remember dub sacks in my blunts
Now we sippin' Wock' out a double cup, yeah
That's codeine love
You fill me up like the drugs do
Ink on my brain like a tattoo
Glad we ain't meet in high school
Wasn't real love in high school

Now I've been drownin' in this liquor bottle, but drowning's not enough
They tell me that I won't live to see tomorrow, but I don't give a fuck
I'm running out of patience, out of pleasure, and runnin' out of luck
I'm really scared that we won't stay together
What if you run out of your love? You run out of your love

I need you
