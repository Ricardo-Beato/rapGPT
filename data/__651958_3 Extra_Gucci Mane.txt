11 Contributors3 Extra Lyrics
Huh, yeah, yeah
Its Guwop
Yeah, Guwop
Trap God
Textin, smokin' and flexin' at the same time (Brr)
Huh, its Guwop (Its Guwop)
Pick ya weapon, nigga
AR-15, Mac-11, nigga

I if you a Blood got beef with Guwop I wouldn't wanna be ya
If you a Crip got problems with me I wouldn't wanna see ya
LV's  all over me, no Vice Lord though I Louis V up
Big up to Jeezy but the twelve disciples they betrayed Jesus
RIP to MLK he was a born leader
Malcolm X, Mandela, them my damn people
Its a revolution second graders smokin' reefer
And killin' people, God, deliver me from evil
My momma told me in the county jail in visitation
That she's not sad I took a life she's happy that I made it
I buried the trash they threw at me and now its my buried treasure
And every hurdle in life I leap, it make me more successful (Wop)

Life so stressful, niggas they gone test ya
So Icey and you can't make a diamond without pressure
Just to wake up and breath, man I'm blessed for
I used to pay my momma rent with the extras
Dope man, bitch want a bag I got extras
Don't measure lean pour up, and don't measure
Dope man burry a mill, its buried treasure
Extra extra read about it, bitch I'm in the paper

Extra, extra, Gucci the dope stretcher
Extra, extra, homeboy in a stretcher
Finessed the college out a loan, dropped out the first semester (Fuck 'em)
Took 'em two-thousand and shelf, I bought a deuce and I'm on Gresham
Guwop on the bricks too flexin, call me a wrestler (Lex Luger)
White girls fourteen, fifteen now, call me Chester Molester
I bought a fifty pack and put 'em back, ZayT on bricks (Zaytiggy)
And I'm not no producer, but these niggas gettin' remixed
I trick a six out my tour bust, crowned it with bricks, now its a Sprinter
Took a hundred pounds from ya just to smoke it with my niggas
Private jet, Guwop, the pilot call me "Mister"
Still the same nigga with two AR's on that picture (Pow pow)

Life so stressful, niggas they gone test ya
So Icey and you can't make a diamond without pressure
Just to wake up and breath, man I'm blessed for
I used to pay my momma rent with the extras
Dope man, bitch want a bag I got extras
Don't measure lean pour up, and don't measure
Dope man burry a mill, its buried treasure
Extra extra read about it, bitch I'm in the paper4Embed
