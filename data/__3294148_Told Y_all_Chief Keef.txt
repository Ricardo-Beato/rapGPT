22 ContributorsTold Yâ€™all Lyrics
I'm in a new whip, you ain't seen it (Nah)
Finna hit the Sprite with the remix (Lean)
All this fuckin' Fendi, I'm the cleanest (Huh?)
I'm so wavy, make a bitch seasick (Let's get it)
I can only pipe a bitch if she thick (Yeah)
Pistol beat like Bankroll & D. Rich (Bitch)
Two grand on these LV kicks (Louis, Louis, Louis)
Couple hundred horsepower, eat this
Okay, you niggas wanna sneak diss (Huh?)
Chasin' after money leave me sleepless (Ftftftft)
Type of nigga fall off for a weak bitch (Beep, beep, beep)
I took her to the crib, let her eat this
Billie Jean, told a bitch to beat it (Yeah)
Up, how she let a nigga beat it (Bang)
Would've told her she'll make a good parent (Yeah)
Until she swallowed my semen (Catch up)

I told y'all I was gon' ball (Swish)
I told y'all I was gon' shit, no stall (Swish)
I told your girl, I was gon' call (Huh?)
Didn't hit her number back 'cause it ain't happen at all (Nah)
I told y'all I was gonna rock designer (Yeah)
I told y'all I was gonna get them bands (Ftftftft)
And if you wanna get super fuckin' rich (Beep, beep, beep)
Then only thing you need to stop fuckin' with is friends
I told y'all I was gonna eat good (Yeah)
I told y'all I was gonna make it out the hood (Let's get it)
I told y'all I'ma count big racks (Huh)
Opp in my lane and I'm grabbin' the wood (Bang, bang, bang)
Told y'all that I got the MAC, Steve Jobs (Yeah)
All this motherfuckin' horsepower, yee-haw! (Skrrt, skrrt)
Bitch, I got bigger guns than T.I (Bang, bang)
He told y'all that I don't, then he lied  (Bang, bang, bang)
You might also like
I just hit this blunt so motherfuckin' hard (Dope)
Your bitch just jumped in my motherfuckin' car (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I'm authentic, you's a motherfuckin' fraud (True, true, true, true)
And my clip is a motherfuckin' large (Let's get it)
If I take the pedal in this foreign (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Oh can't you tell 'em, I'm ignorant (Huh? Huh? Huh?)
Used to be slidin' down St. Lawrence (Yeah)
If we catch you lackin' then we scorin' (Bang, bang, bang)

Pull up in that all-white like a Nazi (Skrrt)
Lookin' out for police and paparazzi (Yeah)
This bitch hotter than a Taki (Huh)
Told her give me that asap, Rocky (Bitch)
Pull up in that all-white like a Nazi (Bitch)
Lookin' out for police and paparazzi (Bitch)
This bitch hotter than a Taki (Yeah)
