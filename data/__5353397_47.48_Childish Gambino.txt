Little girl, thirteen, broke down
The violence
Little boys playing 'round, shot down
The violence, the violence
Baby girl, baby daddy, he's had it
The violence, the violence
The violence, the violence
Cut him up, in the gang, did the same
The violence, the violence, oh

Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
The violence, the violence
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
The violence, the violence

Beat him up, keep him down
Light him up, the violence
Never say what you see, keep quiet
The silence, the silence

Little boy, little girl
Are you scared of the world?
Is it hard to live?
Just take care of your soul
Let the beauty unfold
You'll get through it
You might also like
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
The violence, the violence
The violence, the violence
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
The violence, the violence
The violence, the violence


What do you love?
I love... who do I love?
Yeah, who do you love?
Me?

Does mommy love herself?
