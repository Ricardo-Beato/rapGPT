Ruby red, bright, bright
Diamonds on shine, should be legally blind
The smile pearl white, white
Diamonds on shine if I ever can't find 'em (Shine)

Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun-dun-dun-dun (Shine bright)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun-dun-dun (Shine)
D-d-dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun, d-d-dun-dun (Shine bright)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun, d-d-dun-dun (Shine)

Diamonds on shine and they all mine
Yeah, I fuckin' mind, I ain't got time
Dick was hella mean, slipped in some' nice
Skating on my rings, slipped on some ice
Tryna live like me, bitch won't survive
She ain't got the juice, this won't suffice
You know who your queen, it's no surprise
It's no mystery, bitch, fall in line
Yeah, turnin' off the lights, they go, "Ooh-wee, that's tight," uh
Slept the whole way, that's a bougie ass flight, uh
Spent a hundred K on that coochie last night
I said, "Spank you very much," that booty ruby red bright like
You might also like
Ruby red, bright, bright
Diamonds on shine, should be legally blind
The smile pearl white, white
Diamonds on shine if I ever can't find 'em (Shine)

Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun-dun-dun-dun (Shine bright)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun-dun-dun (Shine)
D-d-dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun, d-d-dun-dun (Shine bright)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun, d-d-dun-dun (Shine)

What's that drippin'? No, baby, I'm not cryin'
Baby, that's my diamonds, everything so vibrant
Say it like I mean it and I says it like I'm Simon
I read her like she fine print and beat her without violence
Man, it's heavy on me, it's like a brick on my ring, yeah
Baby on me 'cause I got red in my genes, yeah
Work 'til I cry, bitch, I ain't barely got sleep
Kept the ice on my grill for me to get all of this heat

Ruby red, bright, bright
Diamonds on shine, should be legally blind
The smile pearl white, white
Diamonds on shine if I ever can't find 'em (Shine)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun-dun-dun-dun (Shine bright)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun-dun-dun (Shine)
D-d-dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun, d-d-dun-dun (Shine bright)
Dun-dun, d-dun, d-dun, d-d-dun-dun (Shine)
