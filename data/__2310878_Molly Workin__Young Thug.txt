13 ContributorsMolly Workinâ€™ Lyrics
I'm geeked up right now, I think molly workin'
Pour another couple just cause molly workin'
Stack for my surface like I'm molly workin'
Move, there's no purpose, you ain't molly surfin'
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
I won't tell nobody, I won't tell nobody

I'm geeked out my muhfuckin' mind
I got a whole lot of shit, ain't paid a dime
I take everything, I steal the scene
I take nigga's bling, cause money talk like Charlie Sheen
I got horse lookin' bitches
That move a lot of weight like I sponsored them with fitness
But I sponsored them with chickens
And they trick you niggas to the bait like fishes
One time for all of my J's that
Treat me like a king, but my queen is a maid, I
Don't play no games but I'm bool and I'm higher
Fired up so many blunts, I need a new lighter

I'm geeked up right now, I think molly workin'
Pour another couple just cause molly workin'
Stack for my surface like I'm molly workin'
Move, there's no purpose, you ain't molly surfin'
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
I won't tell nobody, I won't tell nobody
You might also like
Yeah, molly everywhere like a feast
Call me Screech cause I'm a muhfuckin' geek
At the monster
Dive in that pussy like cowabunga, woah, woah
Geeked up, pull a no show
Cause I been had a check, first .44
Look at him, he tryna save her, that's a no-no
Just for that I'll let the lil boy crow
Hocus-pocus
She let us fuck her everywhere, holy moly
My team red like Ravioli
They'll cut your hair like Sam, no Sosi

I'm geeked up right now, I think molly workin'
Pour another couple just cause molly workin'
Stack for my surface like I'm molly workin'
Move, there's no purpose, you ain't molly surfin'
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
Gone take the molly, I won't tell nobody
I won't tell nobody, I won't tell nobody1Embed
