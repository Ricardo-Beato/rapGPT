And the kids sing (Ooh)
Yeah, I like that, I like that
Yeah, kids sing

We will understand if they don't (Louder)
We don't want they bullshit no more (Yell louder)
We will understand if they don't (Yeah, yeah)
We don't want they bullshit no more (Yeah)

Alright, alright, she take too many martinis
She slip straight out bikini (Straight up)
She let me grand slam outside the Denny's (Straight up)
How we gon' get Oscar proud if they pay us pennies? (La Flame)
I'ma need my dollars now, stack it 'til they envy
Ya feel me? (Skrrt)
The kids, they need that
I get that feedback, sit back, relax (That dope)
I'm on that relapse
Your ass gon' die if you blow my high
I been over Coastin', just was beatin' in my Lotus (Straight up)
All that loud talk like your dope, we never noticed (La Flame)
You ain't feelin' it, nigga, 'cause you sober (Straight up)
I'm ballin' in the game with players, you behind the coaches
Come take a trip on my lair by the Third Coast and
Come floatin'
La di, da, di, da, di, all the kids shout at the party
You might also like
We will understand if they don't (Yeah, yeah)
We don't want they bullshit no more
(Yeah, I like that, I like that, yeah, kids sing)
We will understand if they don't (Yeah, louder, yeah)
We don't want they bullshit no more (Yell louder, yeah)

You know when I was fourteen
I wanted to do a lot of kick ass shit
Yeah, ah

Pornographic, so dramatic, cinematic
Diamond flashes, so jurassic, dress so classic
Roll that cabbage, get put in casket, you dope fanatic
You the baddest, I'm sarcastic, we both laughin'
I'm the baddest, I'm out in traffic, four engine backin'
Stuffed in Suburban, twelve bitches straight out the beauty pageant
You know Reebok keep La feet hot, they be shipping package
GL 600 or the Palace, that collab with Classics
Tell me what you need, I got everything green
Money, money, money trees, I buy everything
That bitch need no wedding ring, she need a bean (Uh)
That boy walked in mall, that boy he need a beam (Don't)
I done fucked her twice, you bought her Fendi things
I done sipped the Act', now I'ma leany fiend (Don't)
I can do this by myself, don't need no team (No)
I got all these kids and all these kids gon' sing
We will understand if they don't (Yeah, yeah)
We don't want they bullshit no more (Yeah, mm!)
We will understand if they don't (Yeah, yeah)
We don't want they bullshit no more (Yeah)43Embed
