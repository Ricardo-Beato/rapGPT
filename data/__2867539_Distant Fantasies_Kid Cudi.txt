Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey, uh
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey, uh
You fronting for that new nigga and, and we know it, hmmm
You keep fronting for that new nigga and- and we know it
You blew it

Uh, I know you still think about me
I could tell he knows, he probably saudy
No more dodging this shit, the cat and mouse
Finding love in the shadows, ready to pounce
They yearning for my return
Laying next to him, you daydreaming of my meat
You remember when I said, "Put it on my face"?
Damn, girl, when will you learn? There's no escaping me
Passion never dissipates, no soul without your mate, relate
Man, I could've never fathomed
Hate you mingling with these corny niggas, though I don't care how it happened
It's cool now, 'cause I'm home
Sloppiest sex, the best way, we're both giving dome
Uh-uh, until the break of dawn
I gotta, getcha, getcha, getcha on, on
You know I'm the only one to get you revved up
Spread it open, pound it 'til it's numb, yum
In bed you would play a vision that's too thotty
Like, what's on your mind, babe?
One blink and you're caught lying
You might also like
Lying, lying entirely to everyone
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying entirely to everyone
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
Yeah, quite like I, quite like I
(Quite like...)

"I'm so through with him," she says
"I hate her," he says
The makeup sex is electric
He smiles her gazes
Her sun on gray weeks
Translates her heartbeat
"My leg's shakin'," she says
He grabs the back of her neck
And they live a little, mmm
And they live a little
Give a little

Lying, lying entirely to everyone
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying entirely to everyone
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
You fronting for that new nigga and, and we know it
Hmmm, hmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

The curse of once dating an awesome nigga
Can't duck my energy, ever
Such a curse is a curse if you make it so
Which means we in control until forever
So stop wasting your fucking chi
Stop searching, chasing your tail
Running in circles to no destination
Remember we once saved each other from hell?
I'm never tryna persuade
You gotta figure what you want in you
I'll be clear, I'm a hell of a man
Flaws and all, somebody would love to have me, too
But you can tell I'm bored with these hoes
Sex is weak when there isn't a glow
Takes a man longer to see this fact
Women are quicker with this type of shit, we know
Uh, uh, show me the lane, dude
I'll be speeding down that bitch, I'm going straight to you
Uh, always knew you still thought about me
Now cut the doubt
Lying, lying entirely to everyone
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying entirely to every one
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
Yeah, quite like I, quite like I
(Quite like...)11Embed
