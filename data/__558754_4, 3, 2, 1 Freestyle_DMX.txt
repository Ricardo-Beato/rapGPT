1 Contributor4, 3, 2, 1 Freestyle LyricsNiggas is puss
Keep me runnin from the werewolf, owww
Howling at the moon on the roof
Eh, ah, no, get em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him (Wooo!)
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Trieed to strike back
Left him like that, layin up with the white hat
Gettin right back at ya when I snatch ya (Aight!)
Up out the grave, nuthin but bones and ashes
Hittin niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red (Heeey!)
But this girl gave me head for free
Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003 (2003!)
That Nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that
I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinkin and eventually
Found that's what you get for stinkin
Blowin up the spot when you rot
Plus if it gets hot they know you dipped
For four squared blocks
Hit em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill
Yet still they don't know I'ma rob who
That dog DMX is a muthafuckin problemYou might also likeEmbed
