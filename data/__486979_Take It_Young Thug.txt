14 ContributorsTake It Lyrics
Yah, yah
Stop playing, I really don't like this beat, DK like this beat
So I'm on here full blooded you know what I'm talking bout
Loyal to the love, nigga

Where you at blood? Let's go take it
One seven seven, watch me take it
Pull up on you with the shit, I ain't waving
Draw a nigga wit' a sack just to erase 'em
Let that chopper sing to 'em like Pandora
And I hope you got insurance on your daughter
I be turned up in the city, they want my lawyer
You know when everybody shine they want yo brothers

You bitches wanna fuck me, yes indeed
Water, water dancing, hundred bands inside my jeans
Kiss 'em one time then don't ever let 'em past yo knees (Boss)
YSL slime balls crooked like the dean
Suck me 'til I'm dead, get a pound red loafers
If she suck it good we may dill just like kosher
Everybody giving shit away like we know Oprah
And you know I'm 'bout that bread, DK run the toaster
Hunnids bands inside of my ears
Let yo bitch run me 'round like she a deer
Got a red backpack full of presents
When I text her back she smile ear to ear
Even though I killed a pussy nigga, I hope he go to heaven
Yo old lady is hot, she hot, she hot like the fuckin' 911
You might also like
Where you at blood? Let's go take it
One seven seven, watch me take it
Pull up on you with the shit, I ain't waving
Draw a nigga wit' a sack just to erase 'em
Let that chopper sing to 'em like Pandora
And I hope you got insurance on your daughter
I be turned up in the city, they want my lawyer
You know when everybody shine they want yo brothers

If I fall for her I spend bands on her wardrobe
Real big ol' blood, I won't 5 just like flakko
I don't give no fucks, she can pull up in your auto
She gon' suck and fuck, only thing I buy Moscato
Get lil' mama drunk she'll fuck a elephant trunk
She gon' suck him why she beat you
I just call lil' mama trunk
Got a bitch that look like new new
When she beat me we do oovoo
Snort that line on the table
I look crazy, I look cuckoo
You try to rob, boy, it's not going happen
I know bitches that were roots and they not' wit nappy
Smokin' fruit, Uncle Luke, what the fuck brackin'
Choppers ringing niggas be like what the fuck clapping (Me, bitch)
Where you at blood? Let's go take it
One seven seven, watch me take it
Pull up on you with the shit, I ain't waving
Draw a nigga wit' a sack just to erase 'em
Let that chopper sing to 'em like Pandora
And I hope you got insurance on your daughter
I be turned up in the city, they want my lawyer
You know when everybody shine they want yo brothers3Embed
