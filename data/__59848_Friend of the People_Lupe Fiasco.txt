Friend! Friend!

Lu, coupe, no, more doors
Porsche or, no, more doors, sedan
Hmmm, 4-more, no, more doors
More doors than that Lord of Rings that Frodo went to war for
You'll see more war than World War 4
Or Lord of War when Nicolas lost his brother
Brougham, no, man, too slow for my program
Need punk rock, not slow jams, mosh pits not hold hands
Or slow dance, or romance, I'll take this bitch like Lo Pan
Put her right into Do’s hands, tell her how this gon' go, man

Animals, animals, we are more like cannibals
Follow rules, what rules? We don't ever answer to
No King Tuts, no presidents, this is more like a ritual
What am I scared of death for? Life is just an interlude

Let's begin this interview, I know they got a lot of questions
I dont have on a unitard, but I can answer the detective
None of these dicks can trace me, I don't go that direction
This is the beginning of a massacre, I'm tired of getting treated like a step-kid
This where I step in, 'cause this Dosage from Philly and he so sick
And he my friend, so he your friend, it's who Lupe Fiasco with
They wanna know if I'm insane, I just don't accept defeat
But since I'm nominated this is gonna be my acceptance speech
Your big bro requesting me
'Cause I'm a friend of the people and I'm next to be
In the game, I don't hear the referees whistling technically
Dixie, let me sing!
(I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times, they are not forgotten!
Look away! Look away! Look away!) I forever see
Don't go back or forever be a slave to the nation
Touché, Lupe, this is history in the making
You might also like
We so in Smithsonians when the story ends
We was there when the story started, making history before we's artists
You know we's targets: Tar-get, we always start shit
Or shall I say hot-wired, ride around reckless and double-park it
Look how many fines that the car get
Take the boots off it, throw the tickets in the garbage
Then go to court just to get up on some smart shit
Tell the motherfucking judge it's all ours, bitch6Embed
