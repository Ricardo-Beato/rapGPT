8 ContributorsIn Love With the Moula Lyrics
Yeah
I want you baby
I'm glad you here
I'mma take good care of you
I'm gonna put you right there, yeah, right there
That's right
I ain't letting you go this time
Nah you gonna stay right here
I'mma call you money baby, money

It started bout 7 when I realized ya worth
Sold drugs just to get you all, along with it's perks
Took a backseat, cause family came first
Holes in my sneakers and shirt
I turned 13, now lil' niggas selling coke
50 for 11's, yeah, I copped 'em for them hoes
But you left without warning, I guess it was a lesson
Had you but you showed me no affection
Got withdrawals, took you to the malls
The more I got of you, the more I got spoiled
Now my toes curl, let's have a baby boy or girl
Had you in Switzerland, half across the world
You a good investment and you, can you double?
Came back around when I bubbled
Now I'm in trouble, took the wrong turn
Let my homie borrow you, now he won't pick up his phone
You might also like
Where you going, baby? Where you going?
Talk about money this is money baby, where you going?
I can hold you baby, I can hold you
Let me hold you

The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down
You give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours
The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down
You give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours

You give me sex, you give me gifts
You give me head from every baddest bitch
You make me happy you make me sick
Cause baby you my drug and I need my fix
If I ain't have you, how would I live
To get you, I'd risk that time in prison
To get you, I'd take risks that'd mean death
I'mma love you until the end
It's all about you, my precious, I'd never ignore you
For a bitch again, I'd put that on my organs
Got these other niggas jealous cause you all over me
In public, you be all inside my jeans
Took me all over the planet, places like Europe
Taught me new tricks at them banks out in Zurich
These niggas, back in the hood
Could never have you like how I do
The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down
You give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours
The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down
You give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours

I need you
I need you in my life
Stay right here with us
Ain't nothing over there for you
Stay right here with us, you in good hands right hereEmbed
