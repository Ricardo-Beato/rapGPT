4 ContributorsGood Music Lyrics
Yea...
One, two, check us out yo..
Fantastic, Spinna waddup?

Yeah, we come from everywhere - Brooklyn, New York
Boston, L.I., everywhere you walk
We put it on the line with intensive rhymes
Everytime a DJ put his hands on a Numark
And cut it up like "..like this"
Don't take your eyes off the team, you might miss
Righteous hip-hop done with a slight twist
Hand in the air, leather glove in the right fist (c'mon)
Y'all don't understand who's up in the building
One day, you'll comprehend but until then
Keep it par for the course (fresh)
I know you dreamin 'bout +Big Things Poppin'+ out of job with a boss
But rap's a fairy tale that'll put you to sleep
I ain't 'bout what you can cop, it's 'bout what you can keep
Lauryn Hill told me that shit and it's so true
And rap life, these be the things that we go through
One two...

Yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!
From yuh hear it yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!

Yo, I'm just tryna live
Won't "trust a big butt" like DeVoe, Bell, and Biv
And show initative, but some choose to try
To make me lose my step, turnin off my light
But I use my ear, nose and hands
To command me through the night, IT'S IN MY HEART TO FIGHT
But baby it's time to move on
Passin off my pen like passin off batons
The game is SO cold and bitter
Treat ya like ya name was SO old and litter on the pavement
Like if I should be stuck, then one era away
While you act like you don't surf and don't care where the wave went
Sleep on us if you want to, we'll be giving you NIGHTMARES FO' SURE!
And even when you wake, your thoughts you caught our break
From the dream, nigga - we'll be RIGHT THERE FO' SURE!

Yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!
From yuh hear it yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!
Yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!
From yuh hear it yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!
 (DJ Spinna Scratching)
YO!!! Apparently, y'all dudes is just a parody
No clarity for popularity, stop comparin me
Similarities, is a rarity
Cause poverty been preparin me for prosperity (Yeah)
F the sparities I know ya hearin me, apart
Never tearin me I'm a man with family
See I never wanna shoot ya
Diggin up the past only muddies up the future
So we chew emcees like Bazooka
And watch 'em get smoked like a hookah
Rap's like Bush, full of Bull
Give and take, ying and yang, push and pull
We get on stage, and act a fool
Easy to get angry, but harder, to keep your cool
We got winners
Ace, Edo, Plug One, and DJ Spinna
It's for the classic old heads and new beginners
True rap not you pretenders
We livin not like some do (M-M-M-M-Microphone check one two!!!!)
Yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!
From yuh hear it yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!
Yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!
From yuh hear it yuh dun know a good music......AY!!!! AY!!!! AY!!!
