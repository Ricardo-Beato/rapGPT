25 ContributorsProject Roach Lyrics
It is absolutely silly, and unproductive
To have a funeral for the word "nigga"
When the actions continue
We need to have a movement to resurrect brothers and sisters
Not a funeral for niggers
'Cause niggers – don't die

Uh, yeah
Yo, I'm creepy and crawlin', in your sink and your toilet
I be drinkin' from your spit, anything 'cause I'm more or less
An insect with four legs; people come in, I fake dead
Correction: I got eight legs, climbin' on top yo' plate, bed
Wherever I smell food, it could be even jail food
Stale food that's molded, a roach is what I am, fool
The ghetto is my land, fool, I'ma never be able to
Fly like a bumblebee, try not to be underneath
Your sneaker, pitiful creature, I'm not afraid of
Your pesticide or RAID 'cause in heaven's my Creator
I love it when the light's off, eating from same knives, forks
From, any man's dinner, see my antennas
You can't win, you can't stand the crunchy sound I make
If you squash me, learn to live with me
How much your roach motel costin' you in the city?
But yo, we everywhere, check your house good, I bet we there
Look there

Niggers are like roaches – they're never gonna go away
Learn from them what we should not become
'Cause niggers – don't die3Embed
