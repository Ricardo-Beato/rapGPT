8 ContributorsDoin It Lyrics
Doin' it
Doin' it, doin' it, doin' it
Doin' it
Doin' it
Doin' it, doin' it
DP on the beat
Ayy

Hop up in my whip, I'm doin' it (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Don't let me catch your bitch, I'm doin' it (Bang, bang)
I just got a fifth, I'm doin' it (A fifth of Henn', motherfucker)
Let your bitch in and we was doin' it, doin' it (Bang, bang, bang)
Doin' it, doin' it (Doin' it)
Doin' it, doin' it, we was doing it (Bang, bang)
I let her hit it, we was doing it
Doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it

Niggas talking, they ain't doing shit (Doin' shit)
I talk it 'cause I really do that shit (I really do the shit)
Ridin' in that car super fast (It's super fast)
It's super fast, super fast, super fast, Superman
Rollin' in that Batman (Batman), ayy
And I got my mask, man, yes, man (Man)
I ain't no damn yes-man (No yes-man), ayy
Choppers come from 'Ghafstan, yes, man (Bang, bang)
I walk with them gats, man (Gats, man)
Try me, you better have your best man (Yes, man)
Ben Franklin my best friend (My best friend)
I'ma spend it and then get it back again, yes, man

Hop up in my whip, I'm doin' it (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Don't let me catch your bitch, I'm doin' it (Bang, bang)
I just got a fifth, I'm doin' it (A fifth of Henn', motherfucker)
Let your bitch in and we was doin' it, doin' it (Bang, bang, bang)
Doin' it, doin' it (Doin' it)
Doin' it, doin' it, we was doing it (Bang, bang)
I let her hit it, we was doing it
Doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' itEmbed
