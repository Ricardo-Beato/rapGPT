Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed, indeed, just what I need
How I feel, upon a time, so recent in time, made me sad
When I recollect how it used to be
Like David and Goliath, kinda like me
And the Devil tryna rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no-no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in Hell

At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me
(Yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying, if you were trying
(Yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yeah
You might also like
Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't see ahead of me so I move in stealth
Hide and seek within a dream, I seem to glide above my horror
Though I feel I'll never be complete inside the dark I borrow
To proceed and remain intact, my mental is so unstable
And they talk and judge a man
They have no clue of what I'm capable
'Til I show a side of me no one had thought could be within
I told you, no I'm not a loser, I'll see you in Hell

At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me
(Yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying, if you were trying
(Yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yeah

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
The heart of a lion, the heart of a lion
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
The heart of a lion
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
The heart of a lion, the heart of a lion
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
I'm just a kid who needs no help
I've achieved a bigger thing
No cash or check could be more blessed
And if you had ever seen the things I've seen up in my slumber
You'd be shook, stay awake
No need to run, your fate would follow
You should know, not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward
It's a goal, a simple code, I stay on the grind to the 25th hour
And I know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within
I told you, no, I'll never let you drag me down to Hell

At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me
(Yeah, yeah, no)
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying, if you were trying
At the end of the day, day
(Yeah, yeah, no)
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah...36Embed
