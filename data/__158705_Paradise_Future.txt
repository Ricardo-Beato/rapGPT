8 ContributorsParadise Lyrics
What up Grandma like
Told you I had to do it
I'm just scared for you baby

I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise

I got some money but it’s all dirty
I got a partner doing a James Worthy
And I done took my heart through so many surgeries
Last night I woke up ‘round 4:30
It's hard to go to sleep sleeping with the birdies
These niggas play for keep the streets they real dirty
You have to practice what you preach gone take courage
Your pain running hella deep don't get discouraged
You in the belly of the beast don't get worried You know these niggas play for keeps you still working
You gotta pack miami heat they always lurking
You can't think about the gifts its so many curses
You might also like
I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
We go through hell to get to paradise

When you in the game playing foul
I hit a lick for hundred eighty-thou
Blow it in 3 months I'm going out of town
Get two bad bitches and hit Grey Hound
I had to cut the couch down
They tried to burn the cross down
They even tried to bring God down
We shooting for the stars now
We live above the ground, fly from town to town
Riding round the city they treat you like Diddy
With all the crimes you done committed this must be winning
This only the beginning and we ain't even finished
I came from the highway riding with a life sentence, this ain't the ending

I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
We go through hell to get to paradise
I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when I talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
We go through hell to get to paradise1Embed
