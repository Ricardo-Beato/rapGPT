12 Contributors8 Mile: Cheddar Bob Freestyle Lyrics
Cheddar, I can rip you to a shred of
Cheddar cheese, there's not a better MC than me
I'm B-Rabbit, bitch, sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly, what am I? So what if I
Cut a guy? Did I s-s-stutter, guy?
Leave you punch drunk from lunch truck
To Shelter, you never felt the wrath or felt the
Skelter, melt ya, got the belt for the welter-
Weight champ, you got in wit' a fake stamp
Garbage bag full of clothes
Still pullin' hoes, rip you from head to toe
From leg to bullet hole, next gun, pull it slow
And aim at the Free World 'fore you let it go
Instead of "Oh, I just shot my dickhead"
And yes, you do got a big head
I can't call it, Cheddar, where's your wallet?
You're so drunk, you can outdrink the alcoholics
Make 'em say, "Damn, Cheddar's the man
He needs a can surgically removed from his hand"You might also likeEmbed
