Pick it up (x5)
Money flyin' in the air
Make it rain (flex!)
20s 50s 100s, bitch I'm ballin' LeBron James
(3!) Pick it up
Pick it up
(Swiss) Pick it up
(Swiss) Pick it up
(Squat!) Money flyin' in the air
Make it rain!
(Flex) 20s 50s 100s bitch I'm ballin' D. Wade!

Hol', nigga, what did you want?
How could I help ya?
Play with me, chase yo ass, fast
Leopard, get, get em
Catch her down bad burn ya up desert
Bad bitch pickin' up ones
She was German, no shepherd, woooh
She gon' suck me to sleep, oh mi gosh, a freak!
Whatcha wanna eat? Take ya to McD's
All four pockets got cheese
And I'mma B, L, O O D
Shoutsout to OG, hop in the fleet
So much sand on me, I look like I'm on South Beach
Been a few weeks, I ain't even been to sleep
I'm just bitin' down on my teeth
I got mollies that stack like a mountain
We can get ski'd as we get geeked
1 0, 1 7, down with them, yeah, they with me
If you play inside these streets
You gon' make looser of the week
Bleaw!

Tell the owner of the club to bring them bags out
Hoes filling big bags like they taking trash out
30 minutes from the A I got a stash house
Bitch I cash out, and them rubber bands my mascot

I'm the main attraction, sitting back and relaxing
Bricks steady coming in, know they getting taxed
If I put them goons on ya, you know you getting wacked
You gon need GPA, bitch you know where I be at
I pull up in that Rari, 
Ho get on your knees, get this money and pick it up
 3 niggas in a  truck
Got them choppers up,  come pick you up
Pick it up (x5)
Money flyin' in the air
Make it rain (flex!)
20s 50s 100s, bitch I'm ballin' LeBron James

Pull up and I drop off
Benz with the top off
Red bitch with her top off
Shining like 
Money on the E way, 20's, 50's, hundreds
 money,  what I'm coming
Fill up in the strip club, made it rain with hundreds
Chopper hold a hundred, all my niggas keep it a hundred
Pouring Lean like it's coolade, diamonds look like coolade
Molly got me rolling like it's 
Rocking 
Throwing back pink 
My young niggas crazy
Thunderstorm warned ya, Imma make it rain
OG!
Pick it up (x5)
Money flyin' in the air
Make it rain (flex!)
20s 50s 100s, bitch I'm ballin' LeBron James
(3!) Pick it up
Pick it up
(Swiss) Pick it up
(Swiss) Pick it up
(Squat!) Money flyin' in the air
