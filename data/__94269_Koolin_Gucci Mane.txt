Catch Me In The 6 Koolin' Koolin' (Koolin')
Catch Me In The 6 Koolin' Koolin' (Koolin')
Catch Me In The 6 Koolin' Koolin'
Catch Me In The Club Women Droolin' Droolin'
Whip And Let It Dry Now Its..Koolin' Koolin'
Stupid Jewelry On Koolin' Koolin'
Bottles Of Champagne Koolin' Koolin'
Top Back In That Thang Koolin' Koolin'
Stupid Jewelry On Koolin' Koolin'
Bottles Of Champagne Koolin' Koolin'

Crank Up Thru The Velvet Room Million Dollar Chest Piece Hoes Grabbin' Me Release Me Cause Y'all Mutts Are Beneath Me
Higher Than A Palm Tree, And Flyer Than A Jet Be And If You Disrespect Me My Shooters Will Correct You
Freaky As An Old Man, Sneaky As A Car Thief Way Im Rollin' Broccoli You'd Think I Was A Marley
She Can't Keep Her Eyes Off Me, Her Boyfriend Wanna Off Me I Pull Up In That Rarri Same Color As Coffee
Yeah I'm Goin In Zay...Club Goin' Crazy, Ace Of Spade Bottles Everywhere Like A Parade Be
Wanted By The Police But They Gone Have To Catch Me, Better Call For Back Up Cause I'm Not Goin' Back See
Ima Run My Stacks Up Yella Bones Attract Me, Dark Skin Girls Be Fine As Fuck I Don't Care If They Text Me
Yo Girl Won't Leave Me Lone Holmes, Sexually Harass Me..She Need To Go Head On Jones Can't Let Her Distract Me...It's Gucci!!

Catch Me In The 6 Koolin' Koolin'
Catch Me In The Club Women Droolin' Droolin'
Whip And Let It Dry Now Its..Koolin' Koolin'
Stupid Jewelry On Koolin' Koolin'
Bottles Of Champagne Koolin' Koolin'
Top Back In That Thang Koolin' Koolin'
Stupid Jewelry On Koolin' Koolin'
Bottles Of Champagne
