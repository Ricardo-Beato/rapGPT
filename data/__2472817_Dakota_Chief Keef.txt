19 ContributorsDakota Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bang, bang-bang
Bang-bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Gang-gang, bang-bang
Sosa baby
Blood Gang, baby
GBE, baby

I roll up a 14 and smoke it
Lying, saying getting money, man, you bogus
I'm off this drink, smoking dope, I'm so focused
Pop a X and I feel like hocus pocus
Gamble with your life, boy, this ain't no poker
I'm laughing at these niggas like the Joker
Pull up flex, what?, yeah, stoned, I'm a roller
Count some checks, get some neck from a bitch named Dakota

I flex, yeah, get some checks, hoe say I make her kitty wet
I got craft and I be havin' it like Kravitz, yeah, that Lenny, man
I'm the type that piss on all my fucking mini, man
My neck looking pissy, got these niggas looking shitty, man
I'm sipping on this drink, let me calm down before I O.D, man
Got my best friend but I'm still the fucking Gloly man
Since I hit the top I swear I'm a lonely man
Got a 100 shots for 20, 30, 40 men
Don't bring me Qualitest, I don't want that in my tummy, man
Future Codeine Crazy, bitch, I'm Breitling crazy, fuck your Rollie, man
Riding in that great white, slap your ass like Mick Foley, man
I walk up in the party and do my Glock .40 dance
You might also like
I roll up a 14 and smoke it
Lying, saying getting money, man, you bogus
I'm off this drink, smoking dope, I'm so focused
Pop a X and I feel like hocus pocus
Gamble with your life, boy, this ain't no poker
I'm laughing at these niggas like the Joker
Pull up flex, what?, yeah, stoned, I'm a roller
Count some checks, get some neck from a bitch named Dakota

It's G-L-O-G-A-N-G, you say Glo, you gotta see me
Want a verse? P-A-Y Chief Keef
Your hoe will be glad to meet me
Hold up, my car got to pee-pee
Pull up, what I'm repping BD
You know that I got the tree tree
Like Dexter, I got the DD
In my watch I got the VVs
Gang on my back I got the GG
Phone ringing got the Keke
Phone ringing got the Tee Tee
IÂ´m too turnt yeah I'm so TT'd
Pistols sound like a TNT
Pull up on them niggas, beep-beep
Let the Glock show them his Wee Wee
I went to go and pick Riri with my other bitch named Tee Tee
In the process met a hoe named Lee Lee, she's pleased to meet me
I'm riding in that ugly Mitsu
She gave me top, it was a sweet thing
I told her bitch don't try to read the tats on me they're not for reading
I roll up a 14 and smoke it
Lying, saying getting money, man, you bogus
I'm off this drink, smoking dope, I'm so focused
Pop a X and I feel like hocus pocus
Gamble with your life, boy, this ain't no poker
I'm laughing at these niggas like the Joker
Pull up flex, what?, yeah, stoned, I'm a roller
Count some checks, get some neck from a bitch named DakotaEmbed
