Yeah, I told you niggas (Welcome Back)
I told ya'll I was gonna be back nigga (Welcome Back)
I wasn't gonna let you have it for long homie
Welcome Back

Guess who's back and he's shinin' on you niggas (Welcome Back)
Guess who's back and he's stuntin' on you hoes (Welcome Back)
Yeah I'm back and I'm shinin' on these niggas (Welcome Back)
Yeah I'm back and I'm stuntin' on these hoes (Welcome Back)
I been on my grizzy, but now I'm back in the place
And if you show me the money, I put this brick in ya face
And if you ain't got my money, I put this strap in ya face
And dont believe in these niggas, that's like a slap in the face
Welcome Back

Guess what (guess what) I don't give a fuck
None these niggas real as me, pick 'em out, line 'em up
Fuck ya man, he ain't shit
What ya say, suck a dick
Excuse me if I'm being rude, let me check my attitude
Excuse me Mr. Attitude, why you got an attitude
Can't stand these rappin' niggas, fakin' ass trappin' niggas
These never (ever) never (ever) never had a pack niggas
I'm telling' you, where they do that at
What's happenin' (what's happenin) what up dude (what up dude)
I been done, you too slow
I'm too fast, movin' like slim fast
Keep my Ronald Williams cash in a black gym bag
Welcome Back...

So kind (so kind) thank you very much
What the fuck is goin' on, they actin' like I lost touch
I ain't never lost touch, damn sure ain't lost much
Matter fact I still got it, yea you know I'm still ballin'
Catch me in my black tee, but I'm a business man
Catch me at the kitchen table weighing out my business plans
Young what's your business plan, none your fuckin' business man
What's wrong with you pussy niggas, need to mind your business man
Ha ha, Ok here we go again
Street said it's necessary, start talking blow again
Got the bureau askin' if the nigga sellin' blow again
Streets think it's necessary that a nigga blow again

Welcome Back

And my yayo in my kitchen, Scott Storch everywhere
White vette, black top, Kung Fu Panda Bear
Call me sensei, I got the tae kwon dough
On my Angelina shit, I want that Brad Pitt's dough
I say it's so funny, same time so money
Ain't nothin' funny bitch, I'm on my money shit
A movie star bitch, we can make our own flick
I just came to beat it down, you play with your own shit
Yeah, Ok I'm bout to wild out
Call it a V-neck (why), took a nine out
750 Left, 750 Here
But yall don't even know what 750 is
