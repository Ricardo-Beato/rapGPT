6 ContributorsGreen Goblin Lyrics
How you running from the sack?
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz

How you running from the sack? Michael Vick (A-ha)
Chop like Foot Locker, bitch got all kind of kick
Yeah, you threw the ball to the ground, you spiked the bitch
I'm a safety, I ain’t do shit but light the pick
Back the fuck up, I'll Ray Rice a bitch
201 fire up at Enterprise, sliding whips
Yeah, like a credit card, boy, I swiped yo bitch
I don't really like friends, I just like my stick

I don’t think she like me, she like my kick
She tryna get a threesome, she like my bitch
Gretsky with that stick, I'll slide on shit
Like an old-ass whip, got all kind of drip

Tron and Tay B? (Ayy)
That's damn near like 'Bron and AD (Ayy, ayy)
Run up on me? I'ma drop his KD (Pow, pow)
By the end of 2020, I'ma rock a AP (All facts)
You might also like
Ayy, Tron, these broke niggas can't spell "AP"
By the end of 2020, they gon' be up eight G’s
Three tone masterpiece, they don’t make these
Just got some head from a white bitch named "Raycine"

Triple S, I'll stomp doggy face in
I don’t sell sauce, I'll give yo ass a fake BIN (A-ha)
Super Ham, I'll tuck doggy cape in (Pow, pow)

Like you died at nine years old, you can't make ten
Punch God at the set, hoes harassing me
Iron on my side, I got Tony Stark attached to me
Bitch, no, I can’t be your nigga, stop asking me
You looking for a Romeo but I ain't Master P

I don't think she like me, she like my kick
She tryna get a threesome, she like my bitch
Gretsky with that stick, I'll slide on shit (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Like an old-ass whip, got all kind of drip

I think this a classic Tay
Hit the site with that, then the package came (Ayy, ayy)
GOAT with the punches like Cassius Clay (Punch)
Feel like Venom on that dark web, I'ma activate (Ayy, ayy)
Call me "Adonis", I got the baby Drac'
You ain't got no bricks, newborn, you got baby weight
You wanna save yourself? Nigga, save the plate
Stop playing with yourself like you masturbate

I don't think she like me, she like my kick
She tryna get a threesome, she like my bitch
Gretsky with that stick, I'll slide on shit
Like an old-ass whip, got all kind of drip

Euro step like Harden and I keep rocking (Ayy, ayy)
Talk shit in this tech like Rasheed Wallace (A-ha)
Fuck up the web like the Green Goblin (Punch, punch)
Stop talking 'bout a bag, you ain't seen profit

Ha, you ain't seen profit
Ain't gon' lie, yo dirty-ass never seen profit
Ha, all facts, no liesEmbed
