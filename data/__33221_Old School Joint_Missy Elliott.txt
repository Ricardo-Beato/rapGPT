6 ContributorsOld School Joint Lyrics
Flip the beat
Oh yeah, I'm feelin' this one
You remember back in the old school days? (Yeah)
You used to have joints like this
And you'd be up in the club dancin like your moms and your pops
Haha, I know y'all know what I'm talkin' about
So we gon' flip it like this, ooh, ooh

Before you take me out, let's have a conversation
No touchy-touchy 'cause it might lead to havin' relations
Let's get to the point, boy, no abbreviations
Don't wanna give it up too quick, I wanna build up anticipation

Once you get me, will you know how to act?
Will you do me right? (Ooh, I need to know, I need to know)
Once you get me, will you keep my pockets fat?
Keep me lookin' tight? (Ooh-oh, yeah, yeah)

I wanna give it some time and get to know each other
Let's be friends before we think about bein' lovers
Ain't no need to rush it if this is forever
If you wait on this love, I promise it'll get mo' better and better
You might also like
Once you get me, will you know how to act?
Will you do me right? (Do me right, oh-oh)
Once you get me, will you keep my pockets fat?
Keep me lookin' tight? (Lookin' tight, oh-oh)

Flashlights (Flashlight)
Neon lights (Neon light)
Party rides (Oh), all night (Oh)
Love me right, keep me lookin' tight (Lookin' tight)
So nice (So nice)
That's what I like (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once you get me, will you know how to act?
Will you do me right? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Once you get me, will you keep my pockets fat?
Keep me lookin' tight? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Once you get me, will you know how to act?
Will you do me right? (All night)
Once you get me, will you keep my pockets fat?
Keep me lookin' tight? (Lookin' tight, oh-oh)Embed
