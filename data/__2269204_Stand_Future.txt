(Mike Da Rock Man)

I like to stand on em
Make a nigga drop them bands on ya
I damn near wanna put a ring on ya
She looking good with them jeans on ya
All because we can stand on em
Every dude with them bands wanna
I like to stand on em
Make a nigga drop them bands on it
You damn near wanna put a ring on a
She looking good with them jeans on it
 stand on a
Every nigga with the bands on em

 you get so much attention
You're perfect from the back you look just like a model twistin'
I put you in a photo, your standing in  Manolo
Fuck around and drop a bankroll
I take you out of this world
I wanna show you the world
You're standing like a horse
You need to get no trust
I put you right in that Porsche
We smoke the best of the kush
You sip champagne if you wanna
I got a real ass nigga in your corner
You looking good if you wanna
Ooh, ooh, everybody gonna know to shoot
I'ma tell the whole truth, I'm gonna tell the whole truth
I love the way you pose, I make your finger close
You ain't never gonna climb a pole
Uh
You might also like
I like to stand on em
Make a nigga drop them bands on ya
I damn near wanna put a ring on ya
She looking good with them jeans on ya
 stand on em
Every dude with them bands for it
I like to stand on em
Make a nigga drop them bands on it
You damn near wanna put a ring on a
She looking good with them jeans on it
 stand on em
Every nigga with the bands on em

Shawty so bad in them jeans, that's just how I flex it up
Wanted to just get her a ring, but I can't get close to her
All about money with her, 50 free bands on us
20 free bands I mean I'm fucking with her
Young Scooter baby black Migo world
A million dollars still wouldn't make you my girl
I give ya anything and I buy you the world
In the game finessing n***a out here said
Fully loaded whips, we got checks on us
Jug with you baby, no body live like us
Ride through to Mexico, where I run bands up
Yeah, run your bands on her
I like to stand on em
Make a nigga drop them bands on ya
I damn near wanna put a ring on ya
She looking good with them jeans on ya
 stand on em
Every dude with them bands for it
I like to stand on em
Make a nigga drop them bands on it
You damn near wanna put a ring on a
She looking good with them jeans on it
 stand on em
Every nigga with the bands on em

Them citizens, the 7s
The way they fit your frame
I wanna have you to my self, I'm tryna show you with no lames
You shining by yourself you so much better than these dames
I wanna take you by yourself and go hop right up on a plane
Lets go play by the sea
Pick the brauds you can see
I like them Tory Birch that fashion and how they complement your feet
You so bossy you a boss
Bruh she shitting on Kelis
These niggas wanna drop the bands, And all she wants is me
Lets go lay up in a suite
Lets go sweep you off your feet
Lets go take a shopping spree
You like Fendi? (?)
You ain't fucking with BeBe
You look better in CC
I can spot you across the street
The way you stand is so unique
I like to stand on em
Make a nigga drop them bands on ya
I damn near wanna put a ring on ya
She looking good with them jeans on ya
All because we can stand on em
Every dude with them bands wanna
I like to stand on em
Make a nigga drop them bands on it
You damn near wanna put a ring on a
She looking good with them jeans on it
 stand on a
Every nigga with the bands on em1Embed
