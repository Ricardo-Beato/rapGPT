75 ContributorsAll Night Lyrics
Come on, big fella, you drunk, big fella
Two sips and now you wanna trip, big fella
You not a drinker, I can see it all in your leg, big fella
You wobbly, big fella, you finna fall
Sit down, you drunk, big fella

All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ayy, ayy
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking all night, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Tryna get in)

Everybody outside, everybody outside
When I pull up outside all night, though
Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no
Oh, now you wanna chill? Oh, now you wanna build?
Oh, now you got the bill? That's cool though
Oh, now you got the gas? Oh, now you wanna laugh?
Oh, now you need a cab? That's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships
Shut up, start dancing, ho
You might also like
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ayy, ayy
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking all night, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Tryna get in)

You just wanna spill fries in the seat
Sprite on the seat, come ride on the seat, ayy
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a Lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money?
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space now
I need you to slow down, it's not a race now
Can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up, start dancing, ho

All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ayy, ayy
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking all night, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ayy, ayy, ayy (Tryna get in)24Embed
