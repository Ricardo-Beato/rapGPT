45 ContributorsWallace Lyrics
Hot lava, hot lava
Hot high Lady Lucid, the city
What, what up? Rottweiler?
I might take ya to it, get ready

Friar flyer, I’m the Nostra-dyme and I say, say I says how do ya?
I cloud all day and night, outta sight
I’m miss “so-high” so I wore some eye wears and tie-dye
Alright, young blood, nice to know ya
Should I give my name, if I think ya knew it already?
What a brave design, what a time
Ay, Monsieur I’m so live and so world-wide-wide

If that's what ya know
Wallace I say "Yo, come and talk to me, beam me up!"
When I beat that drum do you, wild out, I suppose
I been hot in Europe, yep
Tel Aviv, Istanbul, Seoul, London, Tokyo
Dawn is dusk to me, believe it, yep
When I beat that drum boy go
Wallace, I say "Yo, come and talk to me, beam me up!"

He said it's just me Miss Bank$ a.k.a. Nestlé
A.k.a. best he, ever had sex he
Ever got licked, but he never got swallowed
Bitch, you know that nigga in the sugar-pop lotto
He was on her Twitter, but he never got followed
Imma chin-up with that win, I get the Yen and pop bottles
And um, official with the hitter-hop, y'all know
Ocie-beachie bathing with that, that top model and um
He already know what it does
I got hair for ya nigga, keep it deep in the fuzz
I chat-cheek-cheeky chickle, sip a giggly-grape
Yes, I jiggle when I wiggle-shake it, shook up the bait
Best to get her mister, for ya best one do
The jet-setter with the pleasure and the wet pum-poom
The Black-Cherry on her tickle when her breast undo
Ya lick the left one ya gotta lick the right one too, nigga
You might also like
Yeah, I'm styling a starlet a scene
Carve a diamond tiara, pour tea
One time for senora cherry, oh yeah
Yeah, I'm lilac and laurel a tease
You’re a giant, I saw all your teeth
Rottweiler, let’s barter, let’s see, let's see, oh yeah

Bow-Wow yippee-yo yippee-yay
Poochie, you big dog, then bite for a taste
Kitty in many cities, you licking for a lay
Claiming the big ticket then pay what you say
Benji’s and Euro-izzy, The Yin for the Yang
Touring the world, crazy make rottweiler gray
Bottles of Gold frizzy, she’s frosty and chaste
Dead doggy-dog belongs in the grave

If that's what ya know
Wallace I say "Yo, come and talk to me, beam me up!"
When I beat that drum do you, wild out, I suppose
I been hot in Europe, yep
Tel Aviv, Istanbul, Seoul, London, Tokyo
Dawn is dusk to me, believe it, yep
When I beat that drum boy go
Wallace, I say "Yo, come and talk to me, beam me up!"
If that's what ya know
Wallace I say you come and talk to me, beam me up
When I reach that one do you, wild out, I suppose
I been hot in Europe, yep
Tel Aviv, Istanbul, Seoul, London, Tokyo
Dawn is Dusk to me, believe it, yep
When I beat that drum boy go
Wallace, I say you come and talk to me, beam me up
Hot lava, hot lava
Hot high lady Lucid, the city
Rottweiler, rottweiler
I might take it to you get ready
Hot lava, hot lava
Hot high lady Lucid, the city
Rottweiler, rottweiler41Embed
