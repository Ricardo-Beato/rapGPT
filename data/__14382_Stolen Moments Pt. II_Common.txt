17 ContributorsStolen Moments Pt. II Lyrics
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation

Extra salty 'cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snapping, my guy tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggas was over my crib getting smoked out
No telling who had the place scoped out
Dot had brought over some niggas I didn't know
I'm asking who are you, they said I'm here with them all
If it was them, soon I'm a collide with them
And they better not be rocking no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car he would know
Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib?
They had a set of keys, but that I wasn't trying to believe
But I couldn't put it past him or those other bastards
It'd be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
'Cause whoever did ain't gon' admit it
The blunt and dirty disses is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface
Cause telling the law, Joe, is worthless

Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are
