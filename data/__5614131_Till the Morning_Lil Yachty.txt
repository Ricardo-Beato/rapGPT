I'm talkin' Gucci Gucci 'cause we don't do Huaraches
Can't wife no thotty thotty, man, she want X and molly
And she caught two new bodies, I'm talkin' Thug and Yachty
I told her call me when she horny
Why you put the feds on me?
I cover the tats with Gucci long-sleeves
They got my back forever, broski, yeah
