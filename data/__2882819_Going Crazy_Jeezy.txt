15 ContributorsGoing Crazy Lyrics
Yeah, ha
What's Up
You know what it is when you hear that, hann
Crazy!
Jizzle!
Yeah!
It's Montana from the bottom of the trap

Heard that new Jizzle, boy he going crazy
Dropped some new shit, and boy he going crazy
Dropped it in the spot and they was going crazy
Brought it back from the top and they was going crazy
Real bitches at the spot and they was going crazy
Real nigga back on top, you know we going crazy
Bitch it's Jizzle from the block you know he going crazy
When they play this at the spot that bitch be going crazy

Said I'm just that nigga, bitch I'm just that nigga
And this is me talking, bitch it ain't the liquor
Diamonds in my damn chain, I'm going fishing
I talk to your bitch here like a politician
Told her give me brain, take me Mulsanne
You know that nigga wanna try some new things
You know she ate it up just like a carnivore
I'm counting old paper, call it dinosaur
Got a bitch in Oakland, got a bitch in Fresno
Said she like the taste, she drinking like Prosecco
I'm killing with the field, I'm Charlie Manson bitch
Exactly what you want, I'm strapped and handsome bitch

Heard that new Jizzle, boy he going crazy
Dropped some new shit, and boy he going crazy
Dropped it in the spot and they was going crazy

Real nigga back on top, you know we going crazy
Bitch it's Jizzle from the block you know he going crazy
When they play this at the spot that bitch be going crazy

Montana from the block got 'em going crazy
My youngins slanging white like it's still the 80's
You claim that you the realest when your watch fugazi
Show me whose your jeweler man, that boy crazy
She tried to charge me for the box, man this shawty crazy
I ain't tryna blow your spot up but this bitch is crazy
All I wanted was a mil' and a new Mercedes
Now I'm jumping on these niggas like the new McGrady
White House, black Rollie
In South Bronx they know me
You can't talk, gotta show me
Them brown bags, y'all owe me
Take these then call me
That brain freeze ain't on me
You can't hate, can't hold me
I whip foreigns like I stole 'em
Montana!

Don't smoke up on my weed, lil bitch I'm serious

You know I'm in that bitch just like expensive suits, money
Bitch I'm in that mansion just like the Yeezy boots
I got rich off butter bitch, that Betty Crocker
Bitch it ain't my fault just like I'm Silkk The Shocker
