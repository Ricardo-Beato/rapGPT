14 ContributorsPolice Lyrics
Ayy, I don't talk that much
I observe niggas, I read niggas
'Cause me...
Moms ain't like you if you was slow and...
She'd beat yo ass if you was slow
I always have my eye open when I got them on my mothafucking pillow

Don't let us catch you lackin', catch your ass in traffic (Bang bang)
Shit is gon' get hectic (Bang), ridin' with that Mac-10 (Skuduskuh)
Woop, there go the police (Whoop), act like you don't know me (Nah)
Smokin' 'til I OD (Yeah), bankroll never foldin' (Nah)
I done seen some bitches (Yeah), pulled up then I get them (Skuduskuh)
Tell them bitches get in (Skrt), if you wanna fit in (Yeah)
Four thousand for this Moncler (Bands), I buy 20 a year (Bang)
Don't give a fuck if the sun come (Nah), bitch I'm the sun's son (Bitch I'm the sun's son)

Something like a light pole, ridin' with my 'Sciples
Them Black Disciples, in case you ain't know
I ain't got no jet yet (Nah), finna go and get that (Yeah)
I buy it, I fit it (Yeah), throws out, I shit it (Ffff beep)
Ridin' in the Range Rover (Skuduskuh), all I do is change clothes (Yeah)
All I do is change hoes (Yeah), all I do is change bros (Yeah yeah)
I can't have the same bros (Nah), niggas act like snake hoes (Yeah)
Bouncin' like a kango, but they wanna hang tho (Huh)

Don't let us catch you lackin', catch your ass in traffic
Shit is gon' get hectic, ridin' with that Mac-10
Woop, there go the police (Woo-Woo), act like you don't know me (Nah)
Smokin' 'til I OD, bankroll never foldin' (Nah)
I done seen some bitches (Yeah), pulled up then I get them (Yeah)
Tell them bitches get in (Skuduskuh), if you wanna fit in
Four thousand for this Moncler, I buy 20 a year (Yeah)

Ridin' in a red truck (Skuduskuh), lookin' like a damn Blood (Woof)
Suwu to them damn Bloods, cuz to them damn Crips (Yeah)
My niggas comin' doin' hits, don't give no fuck 'bout no camera (Nah)
When I look in the mirror, I see a rich nigga (Yeah)
'Member when I was broke on Front$treet, sellin' D
And catchin' felonies, now I get paid to make melodies (Front$treet, yeah)
Aye, still Dipset (Dipset, bitch)
Since 20-O-8 (2008)
Now it's 2014 (2014)
Ayy, bitch, and I get my own cake (My own motherfuckin' cake)
Get my steak and I eat my own plate (My own motherfuckin' plate)
I smoke my own blunts (I smoke my own motherfuckin' blunts)

I run my whole clique, nigga (I run my whole Glo)
And I'm the youngest nigga (I'm the youngest though)
I got the mothafuckin' largest check (Got the largest bankroll)
I got the fuckin' finest bitch (I got the fuckin' finest damn hoes)
Nah, Ball got some fine bitches too
Ball got some dime bitches too
Me and Ball, we ball, ridin' in Lambo
Lambo like Hello (Hello, hello)

Done it all, bitch, I'm mellow (I'm mellow, lil nigga)
Pull strings like a cello (Like a Cello, lil nigga)
I ain't blue bitch I'm yellow (I ain't blue bitch I'm yellow)
'Bout my green mothafucker, bitch, I'm ghetto (Bitch, I'm ghetto)
You ain't talkin' green don't call my cello (Don't call my cello)
'Bout green then I push it to the metal (Push it to the metal, skrt skrt skrt)
Then I roll me a 'rillo3Embed
