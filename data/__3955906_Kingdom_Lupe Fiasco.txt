Facts from the 'Raq
Yout!

Port-au-Prince is a kingdom, Kingston is a kingdom
New Orleans is a kingdom, South Central is a kingdom, yah
Freedom, free men without freedom
Black life is a kingdom, why kill yourself for no reason, for?
(Facts from the ’Raq)
Why kill yourself for no reason, for?
(Yout) Chat to dem with no meaning, fa

Hold the sword like a hand should
Rights of passage into manhood
Heightened malice in the land, look
Like the lights of havoc do no damn good
Half sleep from being overpreached
The other half sleep cause the Xan good
A chief would take his hand like a thief
And make him stand like a man would
In the face of an ambush
To the back of they attack
Front of they frontline, out the plane
With no parachutes in they backpacks
Choppin' weed then droppin' seeds
Then flowers grow where they land at
Proper deeds on top of these
To make power flow from they handclaps
Suicide, it’s a suicide
You and I, we're the new divide
Who arrived to see you survive, that means
Two would die to make you alive, it means
You should ride for the two that died, that means
You will ride with the youth inside your king
You are lying with the truth beside the things
Wise to the lies that the youth provide and bring war
You might also like
Does a king make a kingdom, or the kingdom make a king?
Is it free when it's freedom, or being dumb mean you free?
Does a king make a kingdom, or the kingdom make a king?
Is it free when it's freedom, or being dumb mean you free?

Port-au-Prince is a kingdom, Kingston is a kingdom
New Orleans is a kingdom, South Central is a kingdom, yah
Freedom, free men without freedom
Black life is a kingdom, why kill yourself for no reason, for?
(Babylon ain't no kingdom)
Why kill yourself for no reason, for?
(Babylon ain't no kingdom)

Well if man was meant to fly, Jah woulda made us all with wings
Well he made us all with crowns, that mean seh every man a king
Your mind it is your castle, mind cyan govern how you think
The ghetto is a kingdom, care not how the gully stink
No one can change my mind, no I am thoroughly convinced
My woman is a queen that bring forth more princess and prince
And if you add up the equation, it must mean I'm royal since
Everyone in my surroundings is of royal heritage
Not everyone of royal blood dress up in a mink
Whole heap of king and queen with dem roof make out of zinc
So Jah bless the baby mother washing nappy in a sink
And ah raise the generation weh ah take it to the brink
Does the king make a kingdom, or does a kingdom make a king?
This hidden empire have kings and queens that no one's noticing
Does a king make a kingdom, or does a kingdom make a king?
This hidden empire have kings and queens that no one’s noticing

Port-au-Prince is a kingdom, Kingston is a kingdom
New Orleans is a kingdom, South Central is a kingdom, yah
Freedom, free men without freedom
Black life is a kingdom, why kill yourself for no reason, for?
(Babylon ain’t no kingdom)
Why kill yourself for no reason, for?
(Babylon ain't no kingdom)

Only fools would feel proud of a dead man
My mind is an excellent weapon
I will not die for a label, let’s come to the table
And put together all our blessings
Our blessings religious, our blessings ability
Our blessings materially, identify enemy
Disconnect from the mentally
Put all of our energy into the kingdom
Back to the front on my way now
God has to show you your way 'round
Tired, I watch while you lay down
You go while I sleep, I put heart to the beat
Take a part of my piece and inherit the heritage
We're not American dreamin'
We’re realizing a kingdom
Only fools would feel proud of a dead man
My mind is an excellent weapon
I will not die for a label, let's come to the table
And put together all our blessings
Our blessings religious, our blessings ability
Our blessings materially, identify enemy
Disconnect from the mentally
Put all of our energy into the kingdom
Back to the front on my way now
God has to show you your way 'round
Tired, I watch while you lay down
You go while I sleep, I put heart to the beat
Take a part of my piece and inherit the heritage
We're not American dreamin'
We're realizing a kingdom2Embed
