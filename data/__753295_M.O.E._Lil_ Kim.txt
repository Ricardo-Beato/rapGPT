4 ContributorsM.O.E. Lyrics
You need work?
I needa see the money first
You wanna verse?
I needa see the money first
Yeah, I needa see the money first
You wanna verse?
I need see the money first

It even cost to have beef now a days
I'm paying for the bullets then I'm paying for your grave
I'm paying off the judge, then I'm laying in the shade
Just shipped a hundred keys and I'm praying that it ain't it

You need work?
I needa see the money first
You wanna verse?
I needa see the money first
Yeah, I needa see the money first
You wanna verse?
I needa see the money first

I done had to rent a hunred hearses
245, stuffed in my purse, bitch
Your bank account, I got that money in my purse, bitch
Plus you know I stay fly, no bird shit
Tryna hang, I needa see the money first
You looking thirsty, I needa see the money first
My niggas bang, don't even see the money first
Uh-huh, fuck you, Pay me
I'm in that Phantom getting ghost like Swayze
Presidential rollie, I'm the first lady
But I ain't Michelle, they call me Kimmy Belle
La mafia have that, ch-ch-chopper chopping you
And I  got that fish scale, they call it tilapia
Call me Mrs. Frank White, the queen is on top of you
Meet me at the plazza hotel, I got a job for you
You might also like
You need work?
I needa see the money first
You wanna verse?
I needa see the money first
You looking thirsty
I needa see the money first
Eat so much
Swear it make my stomach hurt

Same old me, somethings don't never change
M.O.E, money over everything
Past customs, just stepping overseas
2 keys, baby, I dont mean double D's
Suga Mama, huh, Ms. Kimmy Blanca, huh
One, zero, zero, zero, bitch then a comma
Zero, zero, zero, bitch then a comma
Zero, zero, zero, uh-huh, then a comma1Embed
