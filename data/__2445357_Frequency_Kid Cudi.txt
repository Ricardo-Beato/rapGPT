Wicked, Wick-Wick
Wicked, Wicked Awesome

Yeah, yeah, widen your view
And tune on into the frequency
Chill on out, love is the rule
Follow it to the frequency

Couple girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms, hmm
Couple girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms, hmm
Couple clubs and I'm in the zone
Rather take the party home, to get in the groove
Wet sex passionate in a dark tomb, in a dark tomb
Intertwine inside then hold tight never let it loose, wet it up
Couple girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms
Couple girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms
Couple girls, couple girls make a nigga feel less alone
I trust them, my riders
Easing my frequency, ahh
Curiosity is the key to my frequency
Explore what you find, and now

Yeah, yeah, widen your view
And tune on into the frequency
Chill on out, love is the rule
Follow it to the frequency
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ooh, boo

I'm done up 'til sun up
I'm done up 'til sun up
I'm real close stroking in another room
Done up 'til sun up
I'm done up 'til sun up
I'm real close stroking in another room
Wet and passionate
Real close, shed tears and the sweaty groove
And I love the love
Hot sweat in the sheets never speak on cue in the psych room
Cyclone, wit, uh
A couple trippy girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms
Have a couple nudes, sucking boobs
Seeing double, seeing double in the zone

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ooh, boo

Yeah, yeah, widen your view
And tune on into the frequency
Chill on out, love is the rule
Follow it to the frequency
Yeah, yeah, color outside the lines
And tune on into the frequency
Chill on out, love is the rule
Follow it to the frequency
