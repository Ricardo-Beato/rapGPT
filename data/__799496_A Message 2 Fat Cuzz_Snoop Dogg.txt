5 ContributorsA Message 2 Fat Cuzz Lyrics
Ya,uh
I was once told
You get your freedom
By letting your enemy know that
Youll do anything to get your freedom
Then youll get it
Its the only way youll get it
When you get that kind of attitude
Theyll label you as a crazy negro
Or they just call you a crazy nicca
They dont say negro
Or theyll call you an extremist
Or a subversive
Or a setatus
Or a red or radical
But when you stay radical long enough
And get enough people to like you
Youll get your freedom
So dont rum around here
Tryin to make friends
With somebody whos deprivin'
You of your rights
Their not your friends
NO.. they ya enemys
And treat them like that
And fight them
And youll get your freedom
And after you get your freedom
Your enemy will respect you, and will respect you
And i say that with no hate
Cuz i dont have no hate in me
I have no hate at all
So i say to you, Big Man
Im the man you think you are
If you want to know what ill do
Figure out what youll do
And ill do the same
Only more of it NICCA
(damn... shit)
