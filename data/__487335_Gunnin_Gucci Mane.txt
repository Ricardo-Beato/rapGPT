16 ContributorsGunnin Lyrics
Shootin' for it, gun, gunnin' for it
Guwop, so high, I could skydive
Shootin' for it, gun, gunnin' for it
Guwop

I'm so high that I could skydive
I ain't wore Leviâ€™s since '89
My tree-house like it's teatime
But tea time is lean time
So I'm rich, kiss my behind
My verse so hard, make you rewind
Got 8 artists, but meantime
Matter fact, naw, it's Thug and PeeWee time
Watches on, it's freeze time
Going in like PE time
Sell seashell, I got C4 and if I see a hater, then it pulls out
Fuck a bird and a bitch, I need a bird in the hand
Turn your bitch to a camel, make her walk through the sand
Jump on the plane with 10000 grams
Cookin' up dope, 10000 hands
Cookin' up dope, 10000 pans
I just fucked my 10000th fan
Got 10000, 10000 bands
Got so much money that I'm hurting my hand
Cut 'em off, I don't need you man
How you bite that hand that feed you man?
Like I feed that nigga, I bleed that nigga
I don't need that nigga, I bleach that nigga

All my niggas they shootin' for it
All my niggas they gunnin' for it
MPA, I'm shootin' for it
BSM, I'm gunnin' for it
1017 I'm shootin' for it
Dirt Gang, nigga, I'm gunnin' for it
All my niggas they shootin' for it
All my niggas they gunnin' for it
MPA, I'm shootin' for it
BSM, I'm gunnin' for it
1017 I'm shootin' for it
Dirt Gang, nigga, I'm gunnin' for it

Nigga don't know about 'Wop? He better learn somethin'
Gucci Mane got them young niggas, them young niggas gone burn somethin'
Niggas say that time'll tell, but time gone tell I turn this nigga
Time better tell I'mma burn that nigga
Gucci Mane, you better learn somethin'
You can earn somethin', come duke out with me
Run up on 'Wop, come shoot out with me
Gucci Mane ain't no wicked nigga, my clip out here hold 150
Many men wish death on me, so Guwop feel just like young 50
3 tear drops, gotta get 3 more cause I can't go out like Pac and Biggie
I'mma shootin' for you 'for I talk to you
Chalk ya 'for I talk ya
I'mma (?) 'for I dap ya
I'mma nap ya 'for I tap ya
'For I smurf you, I'mma hurt you
'For I meet you, I'mma murk you
'For I call you, I'mma call on you
I'mma smoke you, close coffin
All my niggas they shootin' for it
All my niggas they gunnin' for it
MPA, I'm shootin' for it
BSM, I'm gunnin' for it
1017 I'm shootin' for it
Dirt Gang, nigga, I'm gunnin' for it
All my niggas they shootin' for it
All my niggas they gunnin' for it
MPA, I'm shootin' for it
BSM, I'm gunnin' for it
1017 I'm shootin' for it
Dirt Gang, nigga, I'm gunnin' for it5Embed
