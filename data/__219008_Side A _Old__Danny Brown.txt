52 ContributorsSide A (Old) Lyrics
In the kitchen, oven open for the heat
Got my young, light-skinned ho rolling up the tree
Wearing jackets in the house, it's a Michigan winter
Boiling water on the stove, Ramen noodles for dinner
Dope fiends out the halfway house and they still sniffing
Homie mommy's 50, smoking and still tricking
Still talking shit with this loosie, I'm ash flicking
See my breath when I talk, but nigga, I ain't tripping
Landlord is, the nigga tryna put us out
Selling all the samples, can't afford to give 'em out
Just copped a half-track, see my nigga tryna get it
Standing on the baseline, Scottie Pippen pivot
Needles in they arms just to keep the lights on
Shit, fuck around, be on hardcore pawn
Tryna get this shit off, the window, we snuck in
Won't live for anything, but might die for nothing

They want that old Danny Brown
To bag up and sell a whole pound
Might have to go and get my braids back
Matter of fact, go and bring them AK's back
They want that old Danny Brown
To bag up and sell a whole pound
Might have to go and get my braids back
Matter of fact, go and bring them AK's back

In the Cutty same color as steak sauce
Eyeballed the work, but was just a .8 off
Vet in the game, first seed in the playoffs
Meet me at the Coney, gotta get this weight off
Balmains fitting like a nigga went swimming in 'em
I'm waxed and I'm shining, hardwood floor
Whore want it hardcore, squirt it on her jaw
Looking at the whore like "What you came here for?"
Linwood nigga, heat on him, no stash box
Turn a gangbanger's bandana to a rag top
Old head, dope fiend, cooking up the yay
Young boys'll shoot your face for them Cartiers
Came a long way taking three for a nick'
Cop an 8 ball, tryna stack for the zip
Now I'm in the rap game, verse worth a brick
Fiends lining up for a hit of this shit
(And I reps that shit, right now and forever)

They want that old Danny Brown
To bag up and sell a whole pound
Might have to go and get my braids back
Matter of fact, go and bring them AK's back
They want that old Danny Brown
To bag up and sell a whole pound
Might have to go and get my braids back
Matter of fact, go and bring them AK's back12Embed
