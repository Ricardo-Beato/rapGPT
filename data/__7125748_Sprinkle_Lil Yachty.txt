(Damn, Ryder)

Damn, back like I never left
Every nigga hatin' suck a dick, put 'em on the shelf
Niggas didn't help when I was down, I don't need help
Fifty thousand dollars old hundreds look like sea kelp
Strappin' up your seat belt (Blatt)
In a coupe tryna figure out how D felt
Yeah, big diamonds in my ears look like sea shells
Couple millions dollars unclaimed in my email

Oh, now you wanna see me?
Ridin' round late night with a star like LAPD
Big flights, ain't even left the home, we be geeked
Everything we do bе in 3D (Blatt)
I want Vlone
Six hoes, no phones
Sleepin' with that chromе, I ain't lackin', never
Big FN tucked in my Coogi sweater
Ayy, get the fuck off my dick though
Truth be told, we was the first ones on Rick though
Uh, heard what you said, you not slick, ho
Not Big Bank, but we'll make this a shit show (Boom)

Damn, back like I never left
Every nigga hatin' suck a dick, put 'em on the shelf
Niggas didn't help when I was down, I don't need help
Fifty thousand dollars old hundreds look like sea kelp
Strappin' up your seat belt (Blatt)
In a coupe tryna figure out how D felt
Yeah, big diamonds in my ears look like sea shells
Couple millions dollars unclaimed in my email4Embed
