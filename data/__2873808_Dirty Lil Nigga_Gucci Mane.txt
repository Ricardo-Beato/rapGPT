Ha, niggas, it's Woptober
Guwop
Southside
It's that season, Wizop
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Came up in the hood lil' dirty lil' nigga
Dirty lil' nigga, he a dirty lil' nigga
Might break in your house, he a dirty lil' nigga
Dirty lil' nigga, old dirty lil' nigga
Ain't shaved ain't bathed, dirty lil' nigga
Dirty lil' nigga, he a dirty lil' nigga
On the block for days, old dirty lil' nigga
Dirty lil' nigga, he a dirty lil' nigga
Came up in the hood lil' dirty lil' nigga
Dirty lil' nigga, he a dirty lil' nigga
Might break in your house, he a dirty lil' nigga
Dirty lil' nigga, old dirty lil' nigga
Ain't shaved ain't bathed, dirty lil' nigga
Dirty lil' nigga, he a dirty lil' nigga
On the block for days, old dirty lil' nigga
Dirty lil' nigga, he a dirty lil' nigga

Dirty lil' nigga, he a dirty lil' nigga
Catch him in the city, bout 30 lil' niggas
Keep a cup full of lean, he a muddy lil' nigga
Got a knife on a chopper, he'll cut a lil' nigga
He a bad lil' jit with a bad lil' chick
Tryna hit a big lick and come up fast real quick
Put a mask on quick then take your shit
Know these dirty lil' niggas don't play that shit
10 out of 10 got a tool on 'em
Tryna catch a sucker slipping with them jewels on 'em
Wolves foaming at the mouth, got drool on 'em
Young nigga with a bunch of tattoos on 'em
Got a Mossberg, Metro Boom on 'em
Like a nigga walking 'round with a broom on 'em
Catch a nigga with them bags then zoom on 'em
Fuck homework, see 'em then move on 'em

It's something that we doing ain't working nigga
Cause these lil' niggas be murking niggas
Project baby, no father figure
Only 15 and he a father nigga
Spend all day tryna rob a nigga
20 lil' jits and they mobbing with 'em
Lil bitty nigga with a big extendo
Don't nobody want problems with 'em
Dirty lil' nigga, he the runt of the litter
His dope fiend auntie was his baby sitter
Hardhead mama can't do nothing with him
But get on her knees and pray the skreets don't kill him
The skreets don't kill him, then the law gon' get him
Better listen to me kid, it's a fucked up system
Y'all might don't feel him but I damn sure feel him
Cause I was just in a jail cell fucked up with him
