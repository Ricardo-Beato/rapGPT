Zaytoven
Ayy, Cyclops
I'm goin' Cyclops, nigga
I'm goin' Cyclops, nigga
Cyclops, nigga
I'm goin' Cyclops, nigga
I'm goin' Cyclops
I'm goin' Cyclops, nigga
Let's get it
I'm goin' Cyclops, nigga
Let's get it
Cyclops, nigga, bang

Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Magneto
Pull up like Professor X and I got my grey jeans on
I ride up like Iceman, I hop out like Sabertooth
I come through like Rouge, boy, I ain't finna play with you
X-Men (X-Men), X-Men (X-Men)
X-Men (X-Men), I think I'm with X-Men
I think I'm with the X-Men (X-Men)
I'm an X-Men member (An X-Men member)
Nigga, I'm an X-Men member

Since you blue, you can be Raven Mystique
This bitch Toad how she's licking on me, ayy
Bitch, I'm Pyro, therefore heater on me
Can't trust a bitch, she do you like Jubilee
I don't care if she's fine as Jean Grey
I know she got that Kitty Pryde but she gon' let me bang
That bitch is a Lady Deathstrike
You should know X-Men like left, right
You might also like
Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Magneto
Pull up like Professor X and I got my grey jeans on
I ride up like Iceman, I hop out like Sabertooth
I come through like Rouge, boy, I ain't finna play with you
X-Men (X-Men), X-Men (X-Men)
X-Men (X-Men), I think I'm with X-Men
I think I'm with the X-Men (X-Men)
I'm an X-Men member (An X-Men member)
Nigga, I'm an X-Men member

Bitch says that she's bad I'm like, "Stop it"
That's like saying Batman versus Robin
I know we talking X-Men, but I'ma switch it over
I pulled up laughing like Joker, your bitch, she's doing yoga
I know that I'm a X-Men, ain't I?
But my car got a Batman fender, ayy
That bitch, I been hit that, man
I got her in my car and she hoppin' out like she got some Batman in her
I come through Kamehameha like Goku
I'm flexing like Gohan at a damn photoshoot
If I turn to Piccolo, you tofu
Bitch my name Vegeta, I don't know you ('Cause you so fu')
This the trilogy and you the last man standing
Days of future past, you's a damn origin
My life's a movie, widescreen
I think I got an X on my timepiece (Bang)
Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Magneto
Pull up like Professor X and I got my grey jeans on
I ride up like Iceman, I hop out like Sabertooth
I come through like Rouge, boy, I ain't finna play with you
X-Men (X-Men), X-Men (X-Men)
X-Men (X-Men), I think I'm with X-Men
I think I'm with the X-Men (X-Men)
I'm an X-Men member (An X-Men member)
Nigga, I'm an X-Men memberEmbed
