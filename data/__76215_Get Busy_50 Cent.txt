12 ContributorsGet Busy Lyrics
I’m insane, yeah, shit changed
I’m the head of that bank, bank in a weird gang
Make it rain, trick, make it rain
I hold onto mine and buy more cocaine
Off the chain, nigga I ain’t playin'
I get him with the semi, nigga stunt I let it ring
He rap, I rap, but we ain’t the same
He love a dame, I run a train
Canary yellow rocks in my ring
Everything private, my hoes and my planes
Hurry now bartender, more champagne
I shine like chrome ‘man’ terra’s on the range
I stunt when I want, I ain't never gonna change
That gold little wood in my cartier frames
This what happen when a bebe kid
Blow up, I'm on out this bitch

I ball out bottles after bottles 'till I fall out
I stunt, I do it my way
I'm on now, get my money long now
Looky here, nigga, you ain't got it like me
If you don't like me
(Get busy, get busy)
Do something
(Get busy, get busy)
If you don't like me
(Get busy, get busy)
Do something
(Get busy, get busy)
You might also like
Tell me why you don't like me, my chain too icy
The diamonds on my Breitling striking like lightning
Throwing cake on your wifey, she licking the icing
And uht's not even my birthday
She telling me she love me, I don't wanna be her pimp
Plus your ass ain't 'sposed to be here in the first place
Nah, dance the Ali Key, let me hold some
Look Nigga, cause I know you I don't owe ya nothin'
With your broke ass, cold ass
Type of nigga gonna get wild with no mask
Rider gang thing play the bench and watch us ball
It's my night, boy, better luck tomar
I'm a boss plus walking big balling
Shit talking, Benz parking, wrist glossing, clique flossing
Tell the waitress drain the bottles with the towels sparkling
They say money talk, nigga my shit hawking

I ball out bottles after bottles 'till I fall out
I stunt, I do it my way
I'm on now, get my money long now
Looky here, nigga, you ain't got it like me
If you don't like me
(Get busy, get busy)
Do something
If you don't like me
(Get busy, get busy)
Do something
(Get busy, get busy)1Embed
