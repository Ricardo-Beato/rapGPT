Well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me
Keepin' my two fingers crossed, but I'm still lookin' for peace
I been lookin' at the clouds, maybe they'll listen to me
Can't talk dirty to myself because the mirror's too clean
Tryin' never to look back because the light always green
It's safe to say I lost my way, but I never lost the lead

And if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

Every time it beat, it break apart
I really think it's all my daddy fault
I can't find the keys to my heart
Think I'ma need the automatic start
Out there lookin' for love after dark
Then I get tired and it's an afterthought
Where's the love? Five question marks
Eat your heart out, I had to starve
It's the saddest part
I'm questionin' myself, I ain't gotta answer yours
Baby, that's for sure
I take a look at myself and then I just pass the torch
Baby, back and forth
I ask can we get together just to break back apart
Baby, that's the cure
Me, myself, I, my iPhone, Fantastic Four
Never knew 'take it or leave it' could be so literal
Never knew takin' a breather could be so physical
Never knew takin' it easy could be so difficult
Never knew takin' these drugs could be so spiritual
Never knew the chemist like how I know the chemicals
Never knew takin' a life could be so minuscule
Never know takin' chances will be individual
Never know takin' advantage would be inhospitable, how pivotal
Never knew the shit I never knew would be minimal, how cynical
Never knew love and hate were similar, identical
You might also like
I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me
Keepin' my two fingers crossed, but I'm still lookin' for peace

And if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
If you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep

I can't find the keys to this life
Picked the locks, I might be a'ight
Close my eyes, I might see the light
Life is a bitch, she might be my type
Death is a bitch, she might be tonight
Haters kiss and dick-eaters bite
Tables turn every day 'n night
Three-sixty, three-sixty-five
I can't find no leaks to my pipe
Police can't find nor reason nor right
Been tryna let shit happen on the fly
But I can't find a seat on that flight
There's a private plane, that's simple and plain
Tickets at a more reasonable price
Sometimes, I don't know how it's gon' end
Even though I done seen the movie twice
Pop a wheelie, new motorbike
Some people like to live a slower life
Some niggas like to live cutthroat
I'ma be the nigga that hold the knife
You girl wan' hold me tight over night
Who am I to tell her wrong from right?
I'ma give her more dick than advice
You give her more strings to a kite
I just found a needle in a haystack, bitch, it's payback
I found myself talkin' to myself with nothin' to say back
And I just found the keys to a Maybach I had way back
Tryna find everything but my way back
Yeah, well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
I been lookin' at my posse with a look of belief
I been lookin' my closet and it look like Paris
They been lookin' for your body, they been lookin' for weeks
They find you dead with your eyes open, lookin' for grief

I been lookin' at the clouds, they say they look up to me
Safe to say I lost some sleep, but I never lost my dreams
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep
They lost5Embed
