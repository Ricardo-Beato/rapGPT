50 ContributorsBe11a Ciao Lyrics
Una mattina mi sono alzato
O bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao
Una mattina mi sono alzato
E ho trovato l'invasor-sor-sor
O partigiano

This shit I'm doing is bigger than you, do not interfere
I'm so far ahead of you niggas, it look like I'm not even here
Although my road is not even clear, I don't see no other option than steer
I'm going out as a legend, you know it, my envious enemies droppin' a tear

You should know I get it poppin' by my name, I do
Man these hoes ain't never rockin' with no lames (Who's that?), that's you
Bitch I'm married to this motherfucking game (Damn right), It's true
If you really think you got me in your aim then shoot

Let's go
This isn't love, no sir, although I appear to bе grinnin'
You get in touch with my bad side, that's a bad ride, I'm sеverely demented
Check out the trophies, I seriously did it and you just vicariously winning
I'm kinda weird I admit it, bitch I'm in the building but I don't stay near any tenants
Lane on my own, the label is cold, we raking in gold, I'm labeled the G.O.A.T
You borrow my style and can't even pay off the loan
You phony, you fake, you a clone, I'm ape with the flow
You think you the greatest but no, put down the cocaine and Patrón
I aim for your dome, pow, I'm digging your grave, there's no other way it can go
Look bruh (Look) it's too late, the beast has been woke to confront your ass and greet your kinfolk (Hah!)
I'm strugglin' to fight this evil impulse, when I'm writing this shit down on the sheet, the pen smokes
I needed to bounce back, achieve the tenfold
Now the roof coming down with debris and lit coals
Should've been known H-O-P's a gemstone
Pay your homage, and send me the fees through Venmo, nigga
God damn, where the fuck has all the time gone?
Creepin' up but then I'm strikin' like a python
I'm the boogeyman, you better keep the lights on
I was plottin' on this living at a night time
Overseas, blowing all my fuckin' Thai Baht
Backstory, it'll probably make your mind rot
I'm using it as gasoline to make the fire hot
And that's the reason niggas never takin' my spot
You might also like
This shit I'm doing is bigger than you, do not interfere
I'm so far ahead of you niggas, it look like I'm not even here
Although my road is not even clear, I don't see no other option than steer
I'm going out as a legend, you know it, my envious enemies droppin' a tear

You should know I get it poppin' by my name, I do
Man these hoes ain't never rockin' with no lames (Who's that?), that's you
Bitch I'm married to this motherfucking game (Damn right), It's true
If you really think you got me in your aim then shoot

Okay I dabble in sin (Yeah)
Revenge, oh yes I do care to get even
Wait, my mental state is about as stable as legs on a paraplegic
Clearly I'm very mischievous, I got my reasons, no good at burying demons
See my name, you should carefully speak it
Or you better prepare for some grieving
That's on my momma, I like irrational drama
I got a passion to slaughter, pass the katana
I murk these niggas and wear they skeletons like jackets and armor
Badges of honor, then repeat it after I summons they soul to come back in a conjure
Can you imagine a monster as savage and bonkers, actually ponder (Talk to 'em)
I been poppin' in total ghost mode
I ride streams like a solo rowboat
If you think Hop ain't got no more dope bro
Then you big cappin' like Mojo Jojo
No fake views through my promo's homegrown
This your world nigga? Oh no, no, no
You telling niggas that you so cold and iced out
I'm finna put a fuckin' flame on your snow cone
How do I do it is beyond us to be on such a level
I believe I'm just the Elon Musk of rap
Yes indeed I must, but read on up
I'm breaking through like ÆonFlux
You probably wouldn't agree on much, especially the way that I verbally beat on Trumps
And if you ever run into a nigga saying
He put a stain on my name, I'm willing to bet you he woke up
So keep dreaming
'Cause this shit I'm doing is bigger than you, do not interfere
I'm so far ahead of you niggas, it look like I'm not even here
Although my road is not even clear, I don't see no other option than steer
I'm going out as a legend, you know it, my envious enemies droppin' a tear

You should know I get it poppin' by my name, I do
Man these hoes ain't never rockin' with no lames (Who's that?), that's you
Bitch I'm married to this motherfucking game (Damn right), It's true
If you really think you got me in your aim then shoot

If I don't make it to see tomorrow
Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao
If I don't make it to see tomorrow
Put some respect on my name
If I don't make it to see tomorrow
Put some respect on my name12Embed
