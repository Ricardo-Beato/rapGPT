26 ContributorsServe On Lyrics
Guwop, Guwop, Longway, Longway, Quavo

Ridin' in the 'Rari man, I'm gettin' my swerve on
No limit trapper, call me Mr. Serv-On
Talkin' on the cellphone, real real hood
Junkies hit the dope and say it's real real good
Ridin' in a 'Rari man, I'm gettin' my swerve on
Talkin' on the phone, call me Mr. Serve on
Junkies hit the dope and say it's real real good
PeeWee, Quavo, Gucci say we real, real hood

Ain't no limit to this shit
Handlin' business with this shit
And that bitch ain't worth a dime, I got some pennies for that bitch
Hit the dentist with the bitch
Got a grill it for the bitch
You know I dip my hoes in diamonds, pay 9 mili for the bitch
Spell Guwop in all capital letters cause I'm really rich
You a disgrace to your family, you know your son a snitch
You was mistaken to be born man, you shoulda been a bitch
Niggas know not the Wop cause Gucci man straight mafioso
Got one baby, 10 baby mamas, Gucci like la vida loco
And he worth 10 million, what he doin' in the Coco Loco?
Foxy lady in the Lambo, man that was 2000 fizzo
I lost my mind, I drop my top, you find it call me four oh fizzo

Ridin' in the 'Rari man, I'm gettin' my swerve on
No limit trapper, call me Mr. Serv-On
Talkin' on the cellphone, real real hood
Junkies hit the dope and say it's real real good
Ridin' in a 'Rari man, I'm gettin' my swerve on
Talkin' on the phone, call me Mr. Serve on
Junkies hit the dope and say it's real real good
PeeWee, Quavo, Gucci say we real, real hood

Silkk the Shocker chopper
I get lots of guala
Pull up in that gray Audi, look like a koala
Green pinky ring, yea, it look like avacado
Yup, yellow diamond chain, call it Troy Polamalu
Gucci CEO, young Quavo a trap scholar
I got the bricks yesterday, finesse the plug tomorrow
Niggas in the hood - they be pitchin' enchiladas
Got hundreds of soldiers, my niggas get boulders
You pushin' Corollas
My niggas in 'Rovas, my nigga be remixing Coca
My nigga got eggbeater spatula, my niggas, they play with the soda
You a fuck nigga, you'll fold over
I knew you couldn't handle the pressure
My Mac-90 come with compressor
Got black and white diamonds, Cruella
Ridin' in the 'Rari man, I'm gettin' my swerve on
No limit trapper, call me Mr. Serv-On
Talkin' on the cellphone, real real hood
Junkies hit the dope and say it's real real good
Ridin' in a 'Rari man, I'm gettin' my swerve on
Talkin' on the phone, call me Mr. Serve on
Junkies hit the dope and say it's real real good
PeeWee, Quavo, Gucci say we real, real hood

Junkies at my door, they need that white girl just to feel good
They call me Mr. Serve on, 'Rari's smash and swerve on 'em
Keep work, I don't search for none
Three amigos, I purchase from
Got a bad bitch and her purse salon
I mean Céline, I'm on lean
Uno Dos cup my styrofoam
On the same shit Lil Thugger from
But I'm piped up in camouflage foams
100k for me to whip up
Ferrari cars and a Bent' truck
Longway on dope boy shit yuh
Drop Narcs and pick up racks uh
Smokin' on stuffed crust swishers
Longway you a neighborhood crip, huh?
Banging on Slauson Ave, duh
Longway don't need no pass, yea
Double down, I’ll bust ya ass, playa
Ridin' in the 'Rari man, I'm gettin' my swerve on
No limit trapper, call me Mr. Serv-On
Talkin' on the cellphone, real real hood
Junkies hit the dope and say it's real real good
Ridin' in a 'Rari man, I'm gettin' my swerve on
Talkin' on the phone, call me Mr. Serve on
Junkies hit the dope and say it's real real good
PeeWee, Quavo, Gucci say we real, real hood10Embed
