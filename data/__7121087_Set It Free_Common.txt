3 ContributorsSet It Free Lyrics
Yeah, I do believe
You got it, yes, indeed
Kept under lock and key
Why don't you set it free?
Yeah, I do believe
You got it, yes, indeed
The right to set it free
Here goes your jubilee

Set it free, set it free, set it free, set it free
Set it free, set it free, set it free, set it free
Ooh, ooh

Precious is your presence
You can feel the essence
The iridescence of your light, no question
Destined to bе
A blessing to somebody
Even if hе cannot see
The lock, key for you to set it free
No man can take from you what's heavenly
Just be you and you'll forever be
Your beauty tells stories like ebony
It comes from the inside
Truthfully, a place where some men hide
In your eyes, I can see that you're inspired
To find your way to love so you can live by it
If you love you the way you want a man to
The right one'll come that'll enhance you
And you can dance to love's melody
It sounds so good when you set it free
You might also like
Yeah, I do believe
You got it, yes, indeed
Kept under lock and key
Why don't you set it free?
Yeah, I do believe
You got it, yes, indeed
The right to set it free
Here goes your jubilee

Set it free, set it free, set it free, set it free
Set it free, set it free, set it free, set it free
Ooh, ooh

Your beauty is the day you illuminate the way
It's on you, it's what you believers say
You blooming in a way, so who are they to say?
It's your heart, stay in tune every day
No mate or hate can carry it away
The truth is yours, don't bury it away
It's fair for me to say you a jewel again
You wear your own crown, not ruled by men
Where it fit in is where you begin
And know who you wanna be, know who you been around
Sometimes, you gotta settle down
That's when the fly ones, they leave the ground
Had to lose them so that you could be found
A centered you is a joy to be around
Now that we've found love's melody
How good it sound when you set it free?
Yeah, I do believe
You got it, yes, indeed
Kept under lock and key
Why don't you set it free?
Yeah, I do believe
You got it, yes, indeed
The right to set it free
Here goes your jubilee

Set it free, set it free, set it free, set it free
Set it free, set it free, set it free, set it free
Ooh, ooh
