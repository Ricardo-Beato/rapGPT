6 ContributorsDance With the Devil LyricsC'mon.. * echoes *

Swing your partner, I'm about to start the
Dance across the land, the Kane will scar the
People of our community, 'cause we're soon to see
The future of the world to be without unity
So brothers and sisters, let's check our history
To reveal what's been hidden a mystery
Because we're headed for self-destruction
And you know that the government, doesn't give a (fuck) when
One black brother sells another one dope
And he can't cope, so he dies without hope
Many of us live on this level
Mislead victims who dance with the devil

"Dance with the devil"
"Dance dance with the devil" * repeat both 4X *

Guns are bein' bought over the counter like candy
Comin' in handy for chumps to act manly
Once before they were only for the law
But no more for sure, lookin' at a L.A. gun war
Even in Brooklyn, lives are bein' tooken
The Bronx is dyin' while the rocks is steady cookin'
Capsule after capsule, settin' a trap to
Destroy all our kind without a hassle
I couldn't kill my brother, about a color
Or cocaine, not even over a rope chain
In this world I'm considered a rap rebel
To correct those who dance with the devil
You might also like
"Dance with the devil"
"Dance dance with the devil" * repeat both 4X *

There's no survival
Bodies come in D.O.A, Dead On Arrival
Every time someone ships in artillery
Begins the game wonderin' who will the killer be
There's no war, so the Navy must wanna see
Drugs and guns shift into our country
So we can shoot each other and sell each other death
And imprison all the other ones left
So it's time to start to rise
We can't be uncivilized, we gotta realize
That bein' the baddest doesn't matter when your life is had
So let Michael Jackson be _Bad_
No time to devastate, we gotta elevate
To a higher level.. than dancin' with the devil

"Dance with the devil"
"Dance dance with the devil"
This is the dance with the devil!
"Dance with the devil"
"Dance dance with the devil" * repeat both 4X *

Lookin' at the fall of our new generation
Makes me wonder about the Emancipation Proclamation
We're considered to be free, but did slavery devour
When we're still slaves to mental death and power
Misled and unknowin', people are goin'
More and more beneath, instead of growin'
+Express Yourself+, was said by N.W.A
So stop givin' trouble a play
Because those who chose to oppose never rose they all froze
At thirty-two degrees to enemies
That already tricked em and made em fall victim
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm, just look at them
What we need is peace and love and more love
But I don't see none of the above
So one for the bass and two for the treble
(come on y'all) Don't "dance with the devil"

"Dance with the devil"
