Notorious
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your gat (Uuuuuu)
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your gat (Uuuuuu)
(Swizzie!, Swizzie!)
Spit your game, talk your shit(Y'all ready?)
Grab your gat
Call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your gat
Call your clique
(Where Brooklyn at? Hey, King of New York B.I.G., Twista, Bone)
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us Notorious
Thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling
Up in restaurants with mandolins, and violins
We just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew, what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
Sure caught beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with motherfucker, better duck quick, cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit
Grab yo' gat, call yo' clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas I got ta fight one
All them hoes I got ta like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run?
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
(come on)
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one

(Ladies and gentlemen, Twista)
Making money, living marvelous
In God we trust
Don't too many niggas wanna start with us
Got big guns in the cars with us
Bust at any motherfucker acting hard with us
They really wanna show you what a G.I.B
I'd rather be sipping Remy in V.I.P
We can hear the music and that'll be by me
Twista with the legendary nigga B.I.G (Uuuuu)
Brooklyn to K-Town, when you checking out the flow
You know it's gon' reign with persistence
Two legends on the same track, two different planes of existence
Let's get it cracking, I love to bust flows
Hit it from the back cause I love to fuck ho
Do it for the city, I love Chicago
Calico's bumping, I love to bust dough (Jeeesus)
You think you could spit on the mic like you Biggie and flow just as steady as I
Shit, it's real, you know you love em, you ain't got Ready To Die
Life After Death, give it to you however you want it nigga
Got it, they got ya, give it to you, however you want it nigga (Huuuu)
Cause the shit it get deep
So I carry big heat
Screaming "come and get me"
Twista and Biggie on the Swizz Beat (Swizzie)
Free mils, I love to make one
All these cars, I love to ride one
All these hoes, I love to cut one
A tribute to Big, I love to bust one

(Them Bone boys is back! Them Bone boys is back! Let's go)
In the middle of it I'mma
Bring niggas more drama then they baby mamas
Nigga wanna battle I'mma bomb ya
One man, but attack like a pack of piranhas
Like terracotta, niggas always ready for the war
But they really don't wanna see a nigga though
We can get em in a minute then we finish with the venom of the rhythm of a nigga with a sick-o-flow
Doing it with Swizz, oh no!
You niggas is in some trouble
Somebody better call po-po, it's gonna be murder when I get to serving them verbally (Yeah!)
Nigga y'all heard of me
Wig splitter, killer nigga, word to me
And I'm classic like Bird and Magic with a tactic to snatch his rep back and stack some platinum
Dumping on them at random
With the bullets I brand them
Fitting to hold the game ransom, running up in your mansion, cash demanding, flashing cannons (Let's go)
Niggas ain't ready for this one cause (C'mon) I'm on a mission to get even better believe it
I'm heavily heated, it's easy to see me
If you want to see me, let that be the reason (C'mon, B.I.G.!)

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique

Squeeze your clip
Hit the right one

Pass that weed I got to light one

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks
