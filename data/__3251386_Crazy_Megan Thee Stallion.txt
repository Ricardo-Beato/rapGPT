Get up in my web, I'ma snatch you up
Long ass legs, I can wrap you up
And now I got you in your bag like a sack of lunch
You know I want you, don't need you
Really, I just came to feed you (Ayy)
I hop on that face and stampede you (Ride)
And then I start over like re-do (Ah)

I give you some time to redeem you
You know I ain't scared, I'm a freak too (Ooh)
And really, I really could teach you
He like the way I smell
He like the way I slick my bun down with the gel
He like it when I get up in that suit and dress well (Dress well)
He like it when I throw it to the side, give him hell (Ah)
He like it when I'm out here getting money, I can tell
He wanna be down so bad, I can tell
And he don't want nobody else to get it, I can tell
And he know anybody after Megan is an L
I knew right when we start talking, might not talk again
You got way too many problems, way too many friends
You got way too many issues, way too many moves
I got way too much experience with these type of dudes
