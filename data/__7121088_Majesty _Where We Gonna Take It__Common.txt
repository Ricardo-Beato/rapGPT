7 ContributorsMajesty (Where We Gonna Take It) Lyrics
Baby, please
Come spread a little lovin' in the middle
Baby, woe is me
Swimming in an ocean, I might have to let it carry me
It ain't nothing wrong with a little bit of chemistry
Oh-oh, oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh, where we gonna take it?
Where we gonna take it, baby?
Where we gonna take it, baby?
Ooh, where you wanna take it?
Where you gonna take it?
Where we gonna take it, baby?
Ooh, where we gonna take it?
Wherе you gonna take me?
Wherе you gonna take me, baby?
Ooh, where we gonna take it?
Where you gonna take me?
Where you gonna take me, baby?

What's the science for the day?
We the giants of the day
Your majesty with mine is like the highest in a way
You too fly to fly away, you could be my Mary J
We good people every day, this is my season every day, now, now
I'm in tune with you, thoughts consumin' you
You my destiny, you my destiny
Unusual, beautiful, my desire is moving through you
You my destiny, you my dest—
You seekin' peace?
We can find a hideaway
Where you can do yoga and be on your namaste
I'm a modern-day, Renaissance, royal piece of work
Been working on myself, girl, you can see the work
I know that we can work like Ossie and Ruby D
I'ma treat you, the way the Lord created you to be
Staying true to you is staying true to me
Your love language, I speak it fluently, majesty, uh
You might also like
Baby, please
Come spread a little lovin' in the middle
Baby, woe is me
Swimming in an ocean, I might have to let it carry me
It ain't nothing wrong with a little bit of chemistry
Oh-oh, oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh, where we gonna take it?
Where we gonna take it, baby?
Where we gonna take it, baby?
Ooh, where you wanna take it?
Where you gonna take it?
Where we gonna take it, baby?
Ooh, where we gonna take it?
Where you gonna take me?
Where you gonna take me, baby?
Ooh, where we gonna take it?
Where you gonna take me?
Where you gonna take me, baby?

Peace to the Earth, what I see is the birth
Of a new nation, communication, seein' your worth
I'm a leader, you a leader, but I'm leading you first
To the kingdom, I got the keys, I put in the purse
Of your mind, I'm the sun, you the moon, we can shine
Stars align, we combine, we define space and time
New beginnings our way, new beginnings our way
Them emotions like the ocean, girl, they swimming our way
Supremacy, your energy want them in my day
Time's expensive, I'm aware of how I'm spending my day
Our auras touch each other, we explore, we discover
There's a heart in the house, in my room there's a lover
Uncover raw feelings, we feel in our navel
We willing and able
Independent but with symbiotic labels
This is chemistry, no need for periodic tables
You got that light, so don't let nobody weigh you
Baby, please
Come spread a little lovin' in the middle
Baby, woe is me
Swimming in an ocean, I might have to let it carry me
It ain't nothing wrong with a little bit of chemistry
Oh-oh, oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh, where we gonna take it?
Where we gonna take it, baby?
Where we gonna take it, baby?
Ooh, where you wanna take it?
Where you gonna take it?
Where we gonna take it, baby?
Ooh, where we gonna take it?
Where you gonna take me?
Where you gonna take me, baby?
Ooh, where we gonna take it?
Where you gonna take me?
Where you gonna take me, baby?Embed
