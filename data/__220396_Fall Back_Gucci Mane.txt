11 ContributorsFall Back LyricsShe ended up being with him, should've been with me
I thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be
If it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see
But until then I'mma fall back like a G
I think I need to fall back
I think I need to fall back

Why you say it way back? You can say it up front
I don't think I'm all that, I'm just kinda laid back
22s on the bed, 20 Os in the front
Had them hoes hang hard, tryna make it, think so
Put a rock on you, big, it's like a cruise ship
So don't call me Gucci Mane, so don't call me ...
Ever since people in Beverly Hills sending you gifts
Use your crown, no hate, he don't ware enough, baby
We can rent our crustaceous, take a vacation
Fly to Bora Bora, call you Dora the Explorer
Doors can't give a ball, it's all involved
Haters can't crawl cause they know you're their boss
You done make it who you are, you was born to be a star
Watch your wrist like that, you deserve a new car
Me only copping that but I love you copping that
You started copping that but you acting fine so I think I need to phone back

She ended up being with him, should've been with me
I thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be
If it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see
But until then I'mma fall back like a G
I think I need to fall back
I think I need to fall back

Bang, bang, titty, I done bang, bang nitty
Most girls are the same, I was saying you was different
All your friends with you, they be like 'bitch, you tripping'
If you wasn't, I be with him, I'm a YM fly nigga
Can't fall in love with a stripper but I just love the way your face fall on my zipper
I ain't no tricker, but love got me tripping
Might have to tip her if she show me titty
Bad to the bone, baby, bad, hop on my lap, cause she want with my cash
She doing too much and I'm moving too fast
Damn, a nigga need to fall, fall back
Fall back? No more chilling, how your day go?
I'mma A ho, O, cause I'm single, no bitch, you play, don't play me
Like a Lego so yeah, I'm gonna let go

She ended up being with him, should've been with me
I thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be
If it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see
But until then I'mma fall back like a G
I think I need to fall back
I think I need to fall back

I'm in my Bentley, ocean rider, won't you jump off in my lap
You wanna get no Channel, clicking crabs outside
I need to fall back cause she got me all trapped
Try to throw me y'all test, said you met your real love
Make the head go, when she see me panics up
I have her walking out of filth, you got her walking out of church
Don't be quick, that loser chose her, ruler, come and get a chop
Baby, I don't think you want it, boo, but you should see what you count, Gucci
She ended up being with him, should've been with me
I thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be
If it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see
But until then I'mma fall back like a G
I think I need to fall back
I think I need to fall back1Embed
