And people who threw dirt on your name

Since ten, I been feelin' lonely
Had friends, but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', "Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?"
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?

That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me

Hello, old friend from the road
I wanted to write a note
To let you know that all in all, it ain't all what it seems
I feel like I've hit a low
One I've never hit before
Lately, I've been feeling small as the salt in the sea
Oh, it's so much to do in so little of time
I feel like I fell a little behind
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
It seems so out of reach
The place I want to be
Whoever thought I'd get there anyway?
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live

Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
See, I'm getting tired of the way I've been living
I'd rather die than to live with these feelings
Stuck in this world where there's so much to prove
Every win gives you more room to lose
It's too many ups and downs on the ride
I spent inordinate 'mounts of time
Trapped in a lonely, loner life
Looking for love where I'm denied

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live

I've been living in my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been living on an island made from fate
Can't go running back to home, I can't face her face
