(*Gunshot*)
"Ain't nobody talkin' when I'm talkin' fellas, so shut the fuck up!" (And who the fuck are you?)
Oh, stepping up in my motherfucking, uhh... (And who the fuck are you?)
Chuck Taylors, Knick-kickers, Wallabee's
On my ass, I got the, umm, um, Khakis, 501's (And who the fuck are you?)
On my back I got the, uhh, sweatshirt
You know, with the fat three creases
Uhh, my t-shirt, Slingshot, uhh, Khaki shirt (And who the fuck are you?)
Umm, and I got the Cake cutter in my—in my pocket
Uhh, got the Afro, the braids (And who the fuck are you?)
Motherfucking, uhh, rollers
You got to believe in something
And I just ask my motherfucking self, uhh
Why not believe in me? (And who the fuck are you? And who the fuck are you?)

"To G or not to G?", is the question
And like Smith told Wesson
I'm shady with the .380 old school diploma
I'll leave that ass in a coma, so
If you got a herringbone, "Welcome to the Terrordome"
Two-eleven, sorry, Reverend
Oh, my god, getting robbed
Reach for the smog, "Atomic Dog"
Hard to swallow, janky as Rollo
Count to ten, and don't try to follow
'Cause just like Waco, I can take four
ATF, to they death
Bust a left on Western, go and get a room
Don't want to be a felon like Stacey Koon
Get the right bitch, hit the light switch, here we go
Tap that ass like this, really doe
You might also like
You got to believe in something
West Side, Lynch Mob
Why not believe in me?
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' G
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin'...
(And who the fuck are you?)

Thirty in a holding tank, catch the vapors
Make me a pillow out of toilet paper
Concrete bench kickin' off the hemorrhoids;
Éses deep, don't fuck with them boys
Phone check, collect call from the baller
Her mama said, "Please don't call her"
Do-Wah-Diddy, far from New Jack City
Seen one of my peers, "What the fuck you doin' in here?"
He said, "One-eighty-seven on the enemy
And they treat me like I just shot a Kennedy!"
Deputy bitch thinks she's the Queen Bee
Ink on my thumb, index, and pinky
"Sir, what set you from?" Play dumb
"General popu-la-tion"
Mama, put your house up, and I can bounce up
Out this motherfucker, that's why I love ya
Out like a boss, with a half-pint of sauce
Got the shit sewed up like Betsy Ross
What a friend know? Buy some indo
Never fuck with a silly hoe, really doe
You got to believe in something
Really doe, bitch
Why not believe in me?
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' G
Goddamn, I'm a motherfuckin' G
You got to believe in something
Yup, that's right
Why not believe in me?
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' G
Goddamn, I'm a...
(And who the fuck are you?)

Knock you out like NyQuil, I'll kill you quick
You sucker-for-love-ass trick
So don't run up with ya gun up
'Cause I got the backbreaker, double pump rump shaker
'Cause we can play hookie in the Aqua Boogie
With concrete Nikes, ya gets no stripes
Living unforgiven with the mic on
And punks running like roaches with the light on
And that's all the shit I'm starting
Bust a cap (Ka-kow-pow!) like Jerome on Martin
You looking for a punk with benefits
'Cause you got a baby, that take many shits
And you know I got a grip like a baby on a tit
Scopin', hopin', thighs open
But I kick back, sit back, and hit the Phillie slow
Hooker hoe, really doe
You got to believe in something
Ice Cube, yeah
Why not believe in me?
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' G
Goddamn, I'm a motherfuckin' G
You got to believe in something
Really doe, what?
Why not believe in me?
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' G
A motherfuckin' O, motherfuckin' G
You got to believe in something
East Side
Why not believe in me?
Fuckin' G
(And who the fuck are you? And who the fuck are you?)
You got to believe in something
South Side
Why not believe in me?
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' G
G, G, G, motherfuckin' G, G
You got to believe in something
West Side
Why not believe in me?
Heh, know me
(And who the fuck are you? And who the fuck are you?)
You got to believe in something
Why not believe in me?
(And who the fuck are you?)3Embed
