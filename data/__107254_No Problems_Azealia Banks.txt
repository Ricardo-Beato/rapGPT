25 ContributorsNo Problems Lyrics
She like my new talk
My new style, my new walk
This new whore
Open her mouth and I'll bruise jaws
Like ooooh awe, really like
Who her I'm a true star, this butch broad got blue balls
Hard pressed cause I took off, I'm farm fresh from New York
It's like because these wanna be's wanna be buzzed
Angels need Jesus, angles, features
Live show, PR then maybe baby, you could be us
That New York, That nuiance, that new star
That ... that ah
212 to that blue blood, beautiful in my own hood
Up the hill It's all good, up the bills
I been born too, You're from fuckin' where, who are you?
Bad queen is my pedigree, bad bitch is my legacy
You mad bitch, you average, a rap bitch I'm rackin'
Stackin', money makin' Manhattan, mama cakin' that cash in
You ask them or ask him, I get it in
Harlemite citizen
You sloppy dyke, you wanna lick a bitch
You probably bite, I ain't about it bitch
You not my type, I need a hotter bitch
From New York with it, born and bred to get it
A home grown widditch,- I flip 'em and hit that spinach
Ooooooh y'all bitches and greatin' em with that fiddith (5th)
Ooh y'all bitches they grievin’' ya
