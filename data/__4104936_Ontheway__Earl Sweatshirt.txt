Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Do you niggas know?
Alright, check it out bro, bro, bro, bro
Look, uh, yeah, yeah
Uh, shit, uh, yeah

My mood really swinging, I peruse like a native would do
What I'm thinking I should do for the sake of myself
No games with this cash, go play with yourself
We stay on your ass
Your sense of safety melt in a flash, bang
Don’t know what I'mma say
'Cause I don’t label the bags, I stay in 'em
See you shooting but your angles is trash, don't play with us
I revisit the past
Port wine and pages of pass
Momma say don't play with them scabs
It's safe to say I see the reason I'm bleedin' out
I need you now, closed lips make the mouth breathers frown
Two's a team, three a crowd
12th street, I kept some lean around
Help me, it’s been a minute since I seen a decent count
The wealth be the labor’s fruit
The loop hold up the belt, G's felt
All praises due, the juice unobtainable
Like Tang in the booth
Dark face on the news
Clouds grey on the move
On the way like the truth (Truth)
Yeah, yeah, uh
You might also like
I said the dark face on the news
Clouds grey on the move
On the way like the truth (On the way like)
Yeah, clouds grey on the move
