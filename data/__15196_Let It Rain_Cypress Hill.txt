13 ContributorsLet It Rain Lyrics
Fuck all y'all
I'm comin' of the wall
I got a nigga from The Source
Swingin' from my balls
Ugh!
Ya want me to set it
Well my MAC-11 takes unleaded
Let it rain
And jackin' out fire
What you're seein' when I'm takin' shit another level higher
Now it's on
Ain't gettin' domed
Buckin' all these niggas 'til they all gone
Now we can roll to the east side of town
And I'm lookin' for a fat boy and a lotta (State of clown)
You better move your ass to this MAC-11
Pointed at your ass for the one eight seven

"Yeah motherfucker, gonna break your back with this shit. Hey motherfuckas:
Move back! Yo, B-Real.."

I'm the head-hunter
You goin' under
Make a trophy
Call it the two-headed buster
On my mantle
Back in the temple
Givin' up the family
Up and down Central
Butt bloody
Anybody
Lookin' for a wide body
One body
You might also like
Somebody
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson

I ain't fallin' off like Humpty-Dumpty
Nigga you still wanna bump me
Still got the hand on pump
And now I'm thumpin' on 'em
Thumpin' on 'em
See
Somebody, anybody scream
When I got the gatt with the big red beam
Now what if I moved it up right between your eyes
Now your chances are never
When you're lookin' at the slug at the of the barrel
Where ya gonna run when ya can't move further
Seven 81 redruM with the Murder
Tie him up
Throw him in the trunk
Let the funk
Blow his eardrums out
'Til he's bleedin'
Then let's get him weeded
It's the punk Buddha
Let me do the
Ceremony up with the hoota
And the shooter
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & WessonEmbed
