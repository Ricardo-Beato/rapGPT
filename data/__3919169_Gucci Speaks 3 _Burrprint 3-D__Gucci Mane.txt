3 ContributorsGucci Speaks 3 (Burrprint 3-D) LyricsMy feature price is so fuckin' high
You niggas had to put my features on Layaway
For what it is, Big Cat is still a bitch
A fat pussy, bankrupt records
"Hi, my name is Big Cat aka the fat bastard
I'm so fuckin' fat and ugly
I'ma get a plastic surgeon make me look like Gucci
Gucci, I'm sorry, please, don't fuck my girl again
I know i'ma snitch but I'm sorry
Shit's not my fault, I was born this way, ha"
