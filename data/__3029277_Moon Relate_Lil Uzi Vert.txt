Pain, I done got numb from the pain (Yeah)
All of these girls is the same
Who is the one to blame?
Nowadays it's not the same
I flood my wrist out today
I hit your girl in my Wraith
I hit your girl in my Wraith
In a spaceship, outer—
Pain, I done got numb from the pain (Yeah)
All of these girls is the same
Who is the one to blame?
Nowadays it's not the same
I flood my wrist out today
I hit your girl in my Wraith
I hit your girl in my Wraith
In a spaceship, outer—

Super geeked up, walking on a tightrope (Yeah)
She think she in love, but just want my dough (Huh?)
I'm numb from the pain, all these girls are psycho (Yeah)
Drivin' in the Lam', swervin' 'round the potholes (Huh?)
Know I got my gun everywhere that I go (Yeah)
Tatted up my face, I look like a psycho (Ayy)
She think she in love, but just want my dough (Huh?)
I'm numb from the pain, all these girls are psycho (Cry)
Rockin' my suit like a mobster, rockin' my suit like a model (Yeah)
None of these girls are my problem, none of these girls are my problem (Slatt)
Call that girl, suck, chew, and swallow, call that girl, suck, chew, and swallow (Blatt)
Numb to the pain 'cause I'm honest, only worried 'bout the dollar, yeah
You might also like
Pain, I done got numb from the pain (Yeah)
All of these girls is the same
Who is the one to blame? (Huh?)
Nowadays it's not the same
I flood my wrist out today (Blaow)
I hit your girl in my Wraith (Vroom)
I hit your girl in my Wraith (Vroom)
In a spaceship, outer space (Phew)
Geekin' on Mars yesterday
Now I'm on Pluto today (Huh?)
I look the moon in its face (Yeah)
I look the moon in its face (Yeah)
Me and the moon relate
Me and the moon relate (Yeah)
Me and the moon relate (Huh?)
Me and the moon relate

I gotta stack up my cake
Gettin' them chips like it's Lay's (Lay's)
Man, my dough nuts like it's glazed (What?)
Man, my dough nuts like it's glazed (Yeah)
You know she told me you lame
Me and you, boy, not the same (Lame)
Don't give a fuck what you bang
1600 what I claim (Bow)
Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot

Nowadays, these niggas do anything just for the fame (What?)
You got a stick, I got a chopper, these bitches don't hit the same (Bow)
Don't hit the same, like, no, they do not hit the same (Bow)
What is you sayin'? Like, turned to a fool with the K (Yeah)

Drivin' so fast like we race (Skrrt)
Pain, I done got numb from the pain (Yeah)

Who is the one to blame? (Huh?)
Nowadays it's not the same
I flood my wrist out today (Blaow)
