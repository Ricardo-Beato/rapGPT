34 ContributorsThrill Is Gone Lyrics
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately
You might also like
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces, circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like MacGyver, cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple of years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls

Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

Check
And nowadays, some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it, see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing, ger reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone1Embed
