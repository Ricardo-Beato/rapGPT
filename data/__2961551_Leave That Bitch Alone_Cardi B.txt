17 ContributorsLeave That Bitch Alone Lyrics
Cardi
Cardi B

Leave that bitch alone
Leave that bitch alone
You knew that I was crazy
Why the fuck you took her home?
Now I'm goin' through your phone
Seein' all these hoes
You knew that I don't like her
What type of crazy shit you on?

You want me to come to your crib and get comfortable
What if I wanna move in and shit?
I will show up on some random shit
Don't let me catch a bitch, you wanna chance that shit?
You should just dead it
I swear to God you gon' regret it
Watch when I start askin' you:
Why the fuck you take so long to answer my message?
The fuck you gon' tell me?
Oh, you with the homies?
Don't even think you can curve me for some other pussy
'Cause it can get ugly
Boy, I be on some other shit
Just lettin' you know wassup
'Cause if I ever find out 'bout that other bitch
Boy, you gon' get that bitch cut
You might also like
I'm not the one
I don't know why would you try it
Trust me, my nigga, just know I will beat all of them judges
I swear I'm not lyin'
Pussy was good
Pussy was perfect
But watch when I pop all ya tires and key up ya whip
Like, "I hope it was worth it"

Leave that bitch alone
Leave that bitch alone
You knew that I was crazy
Why the fuck you took her home?
Now I'm goin' through your phone
Seein' all these hoes
You knew that I don't like her
What type of crazy shit you on?

What if I tell you I wanna be wifey?
What you gon' tell me, I might be?
Then I'ma want ya password to ya Twitter, ya Facebook
And even ya IG
Boy, it's a wrap
'Cause I got the gat
And I will blow all them bitches that's all in ya DMs
Just don't call me back, nigga
Please don't be dumb
My hair always in a bun
You know what that means, I'll be ready for war
And remember I got a gun
I be on some other shit
Just lettin' you know from now
So when that time come around and I do catch you lackin'
Move outta town
I'm tellin' you
I don't be with all that crying
If I get her or you fuck with motions
I'm gon' light ya girl on fire
Pussy was good
Pussy was perfect
But if I ever pop up on you fuckin' that bitch
Boy, you gon' need a surgeon

Leave that bitch alone
Leave that bitch alone
You knew that I was crazy
Why the fuck you took her home?
Now I'm goin' through your phone
Seein' all these hoes
You knew that I don't like her
What type of crazy shit you on?

Leave that bitch alone2Embed
