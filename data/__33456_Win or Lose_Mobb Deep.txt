9 ContributorsWin or Lose Lyrics
"Here I go again, whether I, win or lose"

Another day, another dollar, it's 'bout getting money
Then you can give me a holla, my nose runny
I've been out in the cold, hustling for so long
My hands numb, but bet I feel that paper in my palm
It's like ahh, shit it's on, time to go shopping
For cars not fashion, my whips be the bomb
My clothes, be the same shit that we had on
And fuck looking cute, save that for the broad
It's the H-A-V-O-C, dump and reload
Knock-knock, answer that, I'm blasting through the peephole
Body charges, pay lawyers so we beat those
But get locked and I'm slutting lady C.O.'s
And we the only niggas you know, that fuck they P.O.'s
They push our files to the top, you still on parole
We got, money to roll, no time for penitentiaries
Too much dollars to fold, it's bulging out our jeans

But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world
But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world

Y'all like bitches â€“ the chit-chattering
Stay not liking a nigga but giving dap to him
Hav' don't change for no chick, and they adapt to him
Never get cool with you niggas, I end up clapping 'em
Federal note fetish, you fuck with my niggas
Franklin and Grant, get your ass blammed with the quickness
Y'all niggas is finished, you overdosing the world
With that cute shit, it's time for this realness
And here I go again, letting the mac blow
Slugs bubble up in your stomach like lactose
I'mma date shorty, put it up in her backbone, for real
Put it on her like a track I rapped on, for real
Know what? We outlive labels, and distributors
We run laps around every artist on your payroll
Then hop up in a Range Rov', jet black with the black rims
Killing your bitch in her a-hole, uh-oh!

But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world
But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world4Embed
