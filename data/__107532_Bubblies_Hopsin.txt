Record Label Exec.:So? What can you do for our label Mr. Hopsin
Hopsin: Oh huh, well I got the bubblies
Record Label Exec.: The Bubblies?
Hopsin: Well, yeah

Check it out
Yeah I'ma little out of it
I don't even really understand what the problem is
I think it's because I'm the man wit the hottest shit
Satan offer going if I can I demolish it
Then people noticing that's why my name bubblin'
They speak about Hop they like "Nah, you can't fuck wit him"
You ain't up wit him these niggas just ain't touchin' him
You want him out the game distract to straight bustle him
I know it's necessary because I'm ahead of every
Upcomin' MC and they don't wanna be secondary
So they sendin' these threat messages to me just to scare me
They see I'm very capable of being legendary

There's something wrong wit me
I'm feelin' kinda ill don't fuck wit me (Yeah)
I think I might have the bubblies
(I got the bubblies)
Oooh, Hes got the bubblies yeah
Bubblies (Yeah)
Yeah, bubblies (Yeah)
Yeah, bubblies (I got the bubblies)
He's got the bubblies
You might also like
Like a fat man wit diarrhea problems
Who been takin' way too many bites of peach cobler
If I get in the game yup I probably will rob em
"Hes takin' over the world we gotta freakin' stop him!"
Listen up and listen good, only I can Stop me
I'm not gone stop me til my damn dick is iced and rocky
(Wow) And now you tryna defeat me, your styles sloppy
Then again if I was in yo shoes I would not be
Probably the same way, I'd run up on me and take fade
Then lie to the cops wit a straight face
Then right when you thinkin' that shit is just perfect
Hop would take it outta some rappers who didn't deserve it Just to make me feel better, send threatens and kill letters
To every rapper who I think is droppin' a ill record (Pow!)
I'm comin' you dumb if you not runnin', I'm gunnin'
OH! Whats up wit my stomach?

There's something wrong wit me
I'm feelin' kinda ill don't fuck wit me (Yeah)
I think I might have the bubblies
(I got the bubblies)
Oooh, Hes got the bubblies yeah
Bubblies (Yeah)
Yeah, bubblies (Yeah)
Yeah, bubblies (I got the bubblies)
He's got the bubblies
Excuse me sir wheres the restroom?
Excuse Me sir wheres the restroom?
I have to use the restroom (Find the way, nigga!)
Excuse me sir wheres the restroom?
Excuse Me sir wheres the restroom?
I have to use the restroom (Find the way, nigga!)

Ehh, MCs tryna roll on opponents
Just to boost up they career when they old and Corroded
I got plans don't be thinkin' that your flow will decode it
It's my spotlight and I ain't lettin' go of the moment
And if you really feel you've had it, You want the mic so bad Well motha fucka I suggest you come and snatch it! (Aaah)
Even if you did it wouldn't make a difference
'Cause the people you tryna attract ain't listenin'
These bubbly wubblys suddenly buggin' me
Stomach be rumblin' mumblin' when I have to confront MCs
It troubles me but the honeys be lovin' me
Some will be fiesty, but in the end I'ma feel on her double Ds
I'ma have to end this dang song pretty soon
And I ain't sayin' it just to be cool I really do
For real man, all my dang time is runnin' out
Oh too late, it's already comin' out!

There's something wrong wit me
I'm feelin' kinda ill don't fuck wit me (Yeah)
I think I might have the bubblies
(I got the bubblies)
Oooh, Hes got the bubblies yeah
Bubblies (Yeah)
Yeah, bubblies (Yeah)
Yeah, bubblies (I got the bubblies)
He's got the bubblies
I've been waiting for this my whole life
Oh yes, the feelin' is so right
Yeah, yeah, bubblies
Huh, hah, ooh thank God yeah
Bubblies, haha1Embed
