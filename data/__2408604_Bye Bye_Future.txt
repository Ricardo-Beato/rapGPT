Some of this astronaut shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah (I swear)
I spent sixty on her watch, she call me dada (Daddy)
I might fuck her on the couch and tell her bye-bye (Bye)
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye (Adios)
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent eighty on her watch, she call me dada (Yeah)
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye (Yeah)
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye

I was cookin' up an ounce until it dry-dry (Yeah)
I be stackin' up this paper 'til it dry right (Yeah)
I can tell she had a toe, she gave me side eye (Yeah)
Told that bitch don't waste no time to give me five-five (Yeah)
When they give it up this quick, nigga why try? (Why?)
Got a girl and made her switch, call 'em bi-bi (Bi)
We just turned and made a flick, you need a sho-ot (Huh)
Poppin' tags and smokin' kush, that's that la-la (Hold on)
Eighty on a watch, boy don't know why-why (Say why)
I made it off the block where niggas die-die (For real)
Two-thousand for some trousers, when I fly, I'm fly (Ayy)
I pour it out the bottle and get sky high (Sky high)

Custom made every piece, she call me papa (Do)
She gave me real nasty mouth, Lady Gaga (Uh)
