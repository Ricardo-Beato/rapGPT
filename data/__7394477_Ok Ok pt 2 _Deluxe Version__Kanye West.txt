18 ContributorsOk Ok pt 2 (Deluxe Version) Lyrics
Okay, now they got me wanna rap again
Healed up wound and then you stab me in my back again (Uh)
You the type to play the joke and try to hide your hand (Uh)
Not the type to come around and try to play your friend
You the type to cut the grass and snake your bestest man
I'm the type to close the deal and cut my **** in
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Grrr)
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Baow)
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T. (Baow)
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T. (God body)
All you rap **** sound like me, can't tell who is who
You got no real identity, can't tell you from you
Pricе went up (Yeah), angel invеstor (Yeah)
Price went up (Uh), angel investor

Okay, okay, I'm not okay (Not okay)
Think you're good, it's not okay (No, they all away)
Okay, okay, not okay (I'm not okay, uh)
Think you're good, get out the way
(Ah, Shenseea, uh)

Nuh trust any and any man (Any man)
Pree dem man, mi play along (Play along)
Watch how dem ah sing mi song
Suddenly dem tun ah fan
Aim with precision
Fi number one position
Write the plan, right my wrong
And look, now I'm the boss in charge
Used to talk down 'pon me, now me on top
Left mi inna struggle suh nuh badda come back
Tek mi fi granted, tek mi fi soft
And if yuh play hard
If yuh let me down, mi nah have nuh food fi give yuh, right? Yuh know mi lock di shop down
Mi did like when you show luv to mi face, then chat behind mi back
Nuh trust people, cyaan trust people
From dem eat the fruit, mankind tun evil
Get cut off, you will get cut off
Mi nuh cyar how much memories we have in the past
Yuh bruk up wid yuh ex, still in love, suh yuh single
Mi bruk up wid mi ex, him dead to me, I'm a widow
Get cut off, you will get cut off
Mi nuh cyar how much memories we have in the past (Hmm)
Bruk up wid yuh ex, still in love, suh yuh single
Mi bruk up wid mi ex, him dead to me, I'm a widow, uh
You might also like
But it's okay, we gon' be okay (Not okay)
Only show up when we cut the cake (No, they all away)
Showin' love, but we okay (I'm not okay)
Find God 'fore it's too late1Embed
