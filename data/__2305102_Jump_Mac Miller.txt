Yeah
Who's that on the other end of the phone?
Didn't hear nothin' when I said my hello
Oh well, to hell then we go
So high, lookin' at heaven below
You know me though from coast to coast for smokin' dope
Overdose with the holy ghost, but hold the phones
I hold my own, was local grown
Been killin' that shit since row the boat
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest
One more drink, I'ma be an alcoholic
I don't wanna think like better unconscious
Need fresh air, everything so toxic
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war
Told my mama, "You ain't need no drama
And you ain't gotta cry no more now" (Now)

It'll be alright
My mind on the run, I won't sleep tonight, it's like
When it all goes up in flames, who gon' hold me down? (Down)
And I'm the chosen one
Lookin' all around, what has the world become? Um
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground (Ground)
I've been gettin' paid
About four or five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'ma drown (Drown) (Yeah)
You might also like
You've never been better than me
From this prison, I'm settin' 'em free
Open eyes, I'ma let you see
This world just like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm runnin' to the edge
And when I get there, best believe that I'ma jump, jump
To see if I can fly, fly
I wonder if I jump, jump
Do you think that I can fly, fly?

Yeah
It's the life of a entertainer
I need that check, go and get the waiter
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode
And these explosions don't need detonators
I met my maker in a elevator, he was headed to the top floor
We're quite similar
We just did our work, but we were in it for a lot more
We would try to change the world, but we got bored
When I rip this show, got a encore
Back when we were still in school
We didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies, "The top so lonely
But we ain't gonna die, not now" (Now)
You gon' make it here, live free tonight 'til the day appear
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile (Pile)
How do we get rich? If she actin' crazy, you don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now (Now)
Go on and on, knew I had this shit all along
Take a breath, feel this moment, hold it just so you can (Can)
Look where we at and look where we came from
When will we wake up? Lost in translation

You've never been better than me
From this prison, I'm settin' 'em free
Open eyes, I'ma let you see
This world just like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm runnin' to the edge
And when I get there, best believe that I'ma jump, jump
To see if I can fly, fly
I wonder if I jump, jump
Do you think that I can fly, fly?11Embed
