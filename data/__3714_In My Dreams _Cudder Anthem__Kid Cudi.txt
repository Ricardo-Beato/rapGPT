Yeah, yeah
What up, what up
You're in my dreams
I can have anything and everything I ever wanted, yeah
I can think of anything and everything I ever needed
Right here in my dreams
Everything is A-okay
I don't worry 'bout anything
'Cause every day, every day, every day is sunny
Here in my dreams now
Welcome, yeah
Welcome
You're in my dreams
This is a dream come true
Finding the perfect words to sing to you
Here in my dreams
Everything plays out
Exactly how I want them to
Everything turns out dope
Right here in my dreams
Welcome, yeah
Welcome
You're in my dreams now

Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone
Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too
This is the story of the Man on the MoonYou might also like26Embed
