My right hand to God, I ain't never heard a Uzi Vert song that I can say, "That's Uzi Vert"
But I know he a sissified lookin' nigga that put fingernail polish on his motherfuckin' nails, and wear dresses
How he gon' talk about somethin', nigga?
Thank you, Lil Uzi Vert
I don't know, I don't know
Where the fuck am I?
Ahh
Woah
Fuck you, and fuck your bitch
I don't give a fuck about none of y'all niggas
Y'all niggas tried to ban me from this shit, but I came back
I do what I want, I do anything I please

I feel like, bitch, I'm The Crow (Woah)
I feel like, bitch, I'm The Crow (I'm the—, ah)
I feel like, bitch, I'm The Crow (I'm The Crow)
I feel like, bitch, I'm The Crow (I'm the—, ah)

And if you not new, who you let go? (Woah)
Young nigga just count up all this dough
I get money like a CEO (Woah)
I get fivе hundred thousand a show (Bitch)
Tat my name on your ass, and your toes (Bitch)
I'm likе Chief Keef, like Sosa, I'm Glo (Bitch)

I put spikes all on my head just like I'm Goku (Bitch)
She looked at me in my eyes, said, "Be the old you" (Bitch)
Suck my dick, you dumbass bitch, she said, "You so rude" (Bitch)
I ain't Trinidad, I go big world like Crow do (Bitch)
They say they want Lil Uzi Vert on them old loops (Bitch)
I'm reptilian, I'm not normal, my soul threw (Bitch)
My mama don't know me no more, 'cause I got new blood (Bitch)
Got a new bitch, but she don't suck like my old slut (Bitch)
I don't like a natural bitch, yeah, I like fake butts (Bitch)
Ten million dollars from Live Nation, bitch, that paystub (Bitch)
I don't work for Lil Debbies, but I'm caked up
Six-six-six, satanist, that's why they hate us
I ain't satanist, but they say I am, so let's do it (Bitch)
My Dominican bitch don't speak English, but so fluent (Ha)
Fucked two Spanish bitches next to each other, they congruent (Lil Uzi)
