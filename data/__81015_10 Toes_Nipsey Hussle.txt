15 Contributors10 Toes Lyrics10 toes in these chuck t's
When it come down to it
Still getting more money, more bitches
More love than a nigga screaming fuck me
It's so beautiful, it's disgusting
When you figure it out, niggas wasn't all in
So them niggas is out
Shit hit the fan see what niggas about
I heard misery loves company
It's no lie, you get lonely at the top
It's a chance you can drop, so, they don't try
And I won't judge you, I know why
So don't shoot me down when I fly
On the road to the riches
It's a whole grip of niggas that will wreck they cars it won't rise, fuck it
Call some hoes up and roll this weed up
And turn the lights down and pour this drink up
My last shit sold out I'm bout to re'up
Tat on my neck, face, chest and sleeve
Where the cars are world I like foreign features
I get 10 for shows and 10 for features
I've been in the hood and on them beaches
I've been in the game and on them bleachers
Now I see my lane and the shit I speak on
Where I'm standing, motivate my people
In the ocean, blue range with nico
If I'm drinking champagne, it's probably clicquot
Bossa Nova, we should probably eat bro
Got a couple of zones but we gon probably need more
We gon probably need more
But first, let's eat bro
Order me a steak and rice another early morning, another late night
Doing 7 days a week, can you ever get to sleep?
That's 25/8 life oh, get money
Take flights, go for full throttle, no brake lights
Make all the bad bitches wanna play nice
And all the broke nigga wanna hate life
Yo badYou might also like3Embed
