Is it ever enough?
Is it ever enough?
Is it ever enough?

Okay, what do you want from me? What do you need?
I'm only a human, baby, and we all bleed
Never live with vices or destroy with greed
I'm a man with pride, I won't beg or plead
Just ask, what do you want from me?
Is it ever enough?
Okay, what do you want from me?
Is it ever enough?

Ayy check it, check it, check it
Men and women are quite different though our vision is jaded
We originated to coexist however you play it
Woman was made from that man's rib, that's why we can't live
You be the judge, but ain't no Uncle Phil without an Aunt Viv
Mother Nature and Father Time, moonlight and sunshine
Everything's interconnected and it's all by design
Yin and yang and since the big bang, ain't shit change
Sometimes I feel like Russell Wilson, other days I'm Rick James
Life is a balance, duality is one of my talents
If you ask me to express myself that's gon' be a challenge
When I bought that Birkin bag I had to ask my accountant
He said "Hell nah," but mustard seed faith move mountains
Bad decisions will derive from you just being in love
She ain't the type who out all night that you could see in the club
We both share the same problems, we got too much pride
What do you want from me? Got nothing to hide, girl, come on now
You might also like
Okay, what do you want from me? What do you need?
I'm only a human, baby, and we all bleed
Never live with vices or destroy with greed
I'm a man with pride, I won't beg or plead
Just ask, what do you want from me?
Is it ever enough?
Okay, what do you want from me?
Is it ever enough?

Ayy check it, ayy yo
Okay, sometimes I fantasize about life then I analyze
The missing pieces, this written thesis, I can't advise
Improper inner circles, gotta sanitize
I clean house 'cause some only like to vandalize
Plotting on your downfall although I plan to rise
Life's your biggest fuckin' test and this ain't standardized
Quite remedial, the type to see it through
I write for me and you, accomplish shit that isn't feasible
Now what would Jesus do? Fish and bread to the masses
In terms of gettin' head I was the head of my classes
Yin to my yang like the feds and harassment
Everything good, my nigga, like why you asking?
Beware of ulterior motives, deeper desires
My whole catalog, I'm keeping the fire
My mom still go to work everyday, can't wait til she can retire
I keep it real and that's what people admire, they ask
Okay, what do you want from me? What do you need?
I'm only a human, baby, and we all bleed
Never live with vices or destroy with greed
I'm a man with pride, I won't beg or plead
Just ask, what do you want from me?
Is it ever enough?
Okay, what do you want from me?
Is it ever enough?

I'll, I'll give you the world, world
I'll give you the world, world

'Cause I'ma keep it G real. I don't fuck with you, cuz. You disrespected me. You disrespected my hood by telling me to take off my flag, asking how gangsta I was, nigga. You lucky on that day I was acting cool, cuz. I told you I ain't got time for that, my nigga. Today I got time, cuz4Embed
