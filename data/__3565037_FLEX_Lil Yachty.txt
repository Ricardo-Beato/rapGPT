34 ContributorsFLEX Lyrics
And you hate when I do this shit, skate with extended clips
House got too many whips, let that ho get something fierce
30, you a fool for this one
I might ice my AK out, I might ice my steerin' wheel
Give that bitch the dick, dickin' in it like a power drill
I might cop a crib where the back got a Ferris wheel

Flex for the fuckboys, hate 'cause you suck boy
Flex for the fuckboys, hate 'cause you suck boy
Yeah, you look just like a fuckboy
Flex for the fuckboys, hate 'cause you suck boy
Flex for the fuckboys, hate 'cause you suck boy

Bitch, yeah you stay up on my nuts, boy
Get your guap right, get your mind right
Denim Japanese, waist fits super tight
Fuck that bitch, Netflix and chill, let me crack like a seal
I got niggas servin' deals, to my niggas that shit real
404 'til I'm killed, give a fuck 'bout how you feel, uh
My bitch love it, my bitch love poppin' pills
Why? 'Cause it makes her geek for real
Lil Boat

Get her done, get her done, get her done
I was buyin' diamond, you was waitin' for tax refunds
Lame nigga, shame nigga, anything for fame nigga
One diamond chain nigga, hate me 'cause my name bigger
Yeah, diamond rings too insane nigga
R.I.P. to Kurt Cobain nigga
1993 I bring that pain nigga

Flex for the fuckboys, hate 'cause you suck boy
