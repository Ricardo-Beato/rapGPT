Black magic, voodoo power, cast a spell upon these tricks
Yes, I'm kind of crazy since you niggas talking petty shit
Black magic, voodoo power, cast a spell upon these tricks (Uh)
Yes, I'm kind of crazy since you niggas talking petty shit

Uh, she havin' nightmares sleepin' next to me
Wakin' up unexpectedly, maybe somebody hexin' me
Questionin', blessings on me protect me from weaponry
Hopin' she gon' have the same success if she don't let 'em in
I meant to set the alarm, she dreamt of all the whips
High speed chase, turned the TV on, I saw that shit
Dreamt she saw me bleeding like a True Blood was cornered in
And it's crazy that I really woke up and bought the whips
Tapped her on her shoulder, don't believe in
Superstitious thesis, 'cause I'm amongst the demons
Cross on me, first time I got tatted, these cards I was handed
I'm accessin' the damage like the whole Jackson 5 dancin'
How I slide out, super squeaky, always keep my sneakers clean
Back home, late night, iPhone on DND
Shorty's sleeping next to me and it's not even sexually
I think she might be scared, she hope nobody put a hex on me
Black magic undefeated, Black magic undefeated
Undefeated, undefeated ('Feated, 'feated)
Nasty bitch, bad as fuck, don't ever try to play with me
And I got that trait in me to give yo' ass the vacancy
Never got a wedding ring, the life that she engaged to
Chains, cars, nightlife, that's what she a slave to
Now it's time to feed her, eat it up like every day
Evil in the atmosphere, let's hit it with the sage

Black magic, voodoo power, cast a spell upon these tricks
Yes, I'm kind of crazy since you niggas talking petty shit
Black magic, voodoo power, cast a spell upon these tricks
(Walking skyscrapers, walking, yeah)
Yes, I'm kind of crazy since you niggas talking petty shit

No good deed goes unpunished
It's the bummiest, dumbest, life got bad luck in abundance
Look how happy these lames be whenever lies get slung at
The God, why they so angry like they wishin' they can just run with
Anything when it come to Nas? The desperation it shows, Devil is inside of you
Black smoke, Black magic on your back, it's riding you
If I was you, I would watch who I give my power to
I don't make no coward moves
My solution's, fuck ton of positive is what I'm producin'
Thought patterns convoluted
Your witchcraft won't do nothin', my Jesus piece is too flooded
Rosemarys, rose Cubans, the world addicted to Black music
Black culture, that's Black magic, it's way more than fat asses
Who chain bigger? Who car the fastest?
New contracts, I autograph it, new haters, that's automatic
They ain't see this comin', they got hit with the new wave
Evil in the atmosphere, let's hit it with the sage (Sage)
God in Heaven, please protect the G's
Protect my ladies out there, and the children1Embed
