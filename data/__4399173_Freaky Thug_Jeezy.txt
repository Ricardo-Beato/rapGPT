5 ContributorsFreaky Thug Lyrics
I see you looking at me baby, licking your lips
But I'm really loving the way that your shaking your hips
By the way I'm Lil J  on the west side
 Imma keep it real girl
I got a couple of hoes that take my style sometimes
I got a couple of flows 
In all types of shit
I need a bitch that'll traffic all types of bricks
She gotta suck all types of dicks
A dike bitch that like to fuck all types of chicks
I rob a nigga, put me on all types of lists
When she hit the mall, buy me all types of kicks
I'm bout to get a table up in here in the VIP
I know you hear me talkin girl, but do you feel me though?
You gon take a sip of Hen, hit this dro

Hey ho, I'll freak ya, I'll spank ya
 heard you like gangstas
 gangsta
Hey ho, I'll freak ya, I'll spank ya
 heard you like gangstas
 gangsta

 run in a single second
Pots without the chicken
A Sunday blessing 

 dirty dancer 
Peanut butter 
 clean my flow

Conversation, meditation, 
Not America 
Told ya, Imma have to fold ya
Sorry gotta keep it 
Give you sexual healing
Understand the game, 

Hey ho, I'll freak ya, I'll spank ya
 heard you like gangstas
 gangsta
Hey ho, I'll freak ya, I'll spank ya
 heard you like gangstas
 gangsta
 I'm tryna reach ya
It's 2:00 
Hit when you're ready, don't think I need ya
 I know I'm the one
Whip 73 Impolla with a big o'l gun
Slang shit like I know what I'm talking about
 shit in my mouth
Cause all we do is bust a couple of 
Take you to the hideout 
Feeling super freaky like Ricky, I got a lotta hoes
I got the Remy Martin, and I'm high off the dro
 ready to go
You know you rolling with a player, don't ya? You're damb right
I be the only thing on 22's sitting outside

Hey ho, I'll freak ya, I'll spank ya
 heard you like gangstas
 gangsta
Hey ho, I'll freak ya, I'll spank ya
 heard you like gangstas
