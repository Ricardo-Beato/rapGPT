15 ContributorsBest You Ever Had Lyrics
Ain't never been with a chick this bad
I ain't worried 'bout that
DJ Chose

You ain't never been with a chick this bad
I ain't worried 'bout them other girls that you had
If I catch 'em lookin' at my baby, I'ma laugh
He gon' keep it real, I ain't worried 'bout that
You ain't never been with a chick this bad
I ain't worried 'bout them other girls that you had
If I catch 'em lookin' at my baby, I'ma laugh
He gon' keep it real, I ain't worried 'bout that

I be actin' up right before he come to see me
He be like, "Why you always tripping for no reason?"
Told him, "'Cause you put it on me better when you're mad"
Hand around my neck, hit it hard from the back, yeah
I'ma cook a meal for him and play the game with him
When somebody ask, yeah, I'm with the same nigga
Pussy keep him knocked out like a painkiller
And if a nigga bag me, you know he a winner, ah

You ain't never been with a chick this bad
I ain't worried 'bout them other girls that you had
If I catch 'em lookin' at my baby, I'ma laugh
He gon' keep it real, I ain't worried 'bout that
You ain't never been with a chick this bad
I ain't worried 'bout them other girls that you had
If I catch 'em lookin' at my baby, I'ma laugh
He gon' keep it real, I ain't worried 'bout that
You might also like
Yeah, I know you like that, when I talk to you like a freak
I wanna feel it deep so I rode it on my feet
He say he feel intimidated when he talk to me
I got that hardcore but he want that R&B, ah
Boy, we can make sweet love for hours
Open up for you like flowers
The deeper you go, I get louder
Make it rain on you like showers

You ain't never been with a chick this bad
I ain't worried 'bout them other girls that you had
If I catch 'em lookin' at my baby, I'ma laugh
He gon' keep it real, I ain't worried 'bout that
You ain't never been with a chick this bad
I ain't worried 'bout them other girls that you had
If I catch 'em lookin' at my baby, I'ma laugh
He gon' keep it real, I ain't worried 'bout that

I'ma hold it down for you, and put it down on you
Can't nobody else ride how I ride for you
And if a bitch get slick, knock her down for you
And if you're lookin' for me, I'ma be around for you
You got a diamond, boy, you better act like it
You fuckin' with the baddest, you ain't gotta cap like it
He know I'm the baddest bitch he ever had
Post me on the 'Gram, got his old hoes mad
You ain't never been with a chick this bad
I ain't worried 'bout them other girls that you had
If I catch 'em lookin' at my baby, I'ma laugh
He gon' keep it real, I ain't worried 'bout that
You ain't never been with a chick this bad
I ain't worried 'bout them other girls that you had
If I catch 'em lookin' at my baby, I'ma laugh
He gon' keep it real, I ain't worried 'bout that (Mwah)1Embed
