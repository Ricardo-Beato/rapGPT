Give 'em what they want 
Give 'em what they want 
Give 'em what they want
They all can't get it
Give 'em what they want 
Give 'em what they want 


Cats slide to the hood, but I walk through it
Holdin' my fuckin' dick and that's all to it
This ain't no new shit, told you when I met cha
Show some fuckin' respect, knock before ya enter
Bet cha, if its me that's comin' to get cha
Its gonna be a back down on that stretcher
For real, ya'll niggas don't know pain
Cause ya'll niggas don't know me
And well that's my name
Ain't a fuckin' thing changed still the same
Y'all got dope but rob niggas
So be mob niggas Y.O be hard niggas
School street I rep that , beat and scar niggas
Respect that and step back
Come at me sideways and get laid down where you stand
**bla-dow!** with the cannons
So stop all the dirty fuckin' looks
Cause y'all niggas ain't fuckin' crooks fuck around and get took
You might also like
I make moves, I break rules
Pistol whip Niggas if they got fake jewels
I take tools 
I make pools 
Fuckin' with that nigga Earl Simmons
Will have you in the middle a The ocean...swimming
Up to creek with no paddle, y'all niggas fuck
Right when u should of bucked, y'all niggas ducked
Stuck 'em down that's your muther fuckin' luck 
Clown! what now!? keep fuckin' playin'
I'm gonna keep a nigga 6 feet deep layin'
Shit keeps sprayin' what y'all sayin?
Don't want nothing'...
Y'all niggas known for frontin'
Stop.. black! we don't take the kindly to them acts
Please don't remind me a That
