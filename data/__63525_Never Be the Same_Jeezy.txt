7 ContributorsNever Be the Same LyricsHook:
And I ain’t look at you the same no more my nigga
You will never be the same no more my nigga
I don’t wanna play the game no more my nigga
You will never be the same no more my nigga
I don't look you’re the same money no more nigga
You will never be the same no more my nigga
I don’t wanna play the game no more my nigga
You will never be the same no more my nigga

And I say this is for the hustlers and every nigga like that
Married to the game i’m here to tell you don't wife that
You can go to jail or go home is your choice
Every nigga from the ghetto dream is the Rolls-Royce
Condo on the top floor bad bitch cooking
Hittin' her from the back another bad bitch looking
Campaign dreams Cartier wishin
Almost done with the yay bag it up wash the dishes
And all the niggas seenin is feinds and broken dreams
Broke niggas, thousandaires, and triple beams
If we’re dancing with the devil
Then at lest teach us how to dance
It wasn't design to make it out
It like we never had a chance
You might also like(hook)

You niggas think you know you have no fucking idea
Lookin how I made a here I have no fucking idea
See I started from a dime rock flipped it to a dime spot
Hit it so hard that a nigga need a time clock
Nigga over time over grind yeah you know you know me
I try to overshine
Yeah that’s brighter than the stars and the sky
And even brighter than them flakes in the pie
Luxury cars yeah I lust em
We can discus them talkin that convertable hard top
Shit will discuss em back and ..
Pack of tums for my niggas behind the wall sick
The game got my dogs locked behind the wall, Vick
(hook)

I say what they hittin for
’cause you know they sky high
Niggas do bitches do but them numbers don't lie
Live forever through these words, 'real niggas don't die'
Even if they ant even birds a real nigga gonna try
The penitentiary ain’t never scared me
Either im going or I ain't that’s just how is goin be
They want top dollar and the shit get step on
Got a nigga feeling like I'm getting slept on
Sleep it for the weak when the work came cheap
Now it all taste sweet but you can't be weak
They say what don't kill us only makes us stronger
Until they buld another case to lock us up longer
