40 ContributorsLa La La La Lyrics
Ahem
Hey
Coming to you from a packed studio
(Haha) Haha, uh

I'm goin' in after hittin' this ganja
Out to dinner with the homies, private table at Nakama
I'm a new millennium Sinatra
Coppin' marijuana from the neighborhood Rastas
Chiefin', feastin', king of the new school
I'm speakin' in tongues, try translatin' voodoo
Hold up, let me start again
Undefeated shirt, Levi's and a Mr Rogers cardigan
It's a hell of a feelin' bein' this fresh
Spit seem to sit upon my lips, call it Blistex
Peddlin' this medical, the presence of a general
Magazine centerfolds, they all up on my genitals
Got the game in the palm of my hand, it's itchin'
Wylin' out, better talk to your man, he bitchin'
'Cause I ain't got a lot time for these weirdos
Talkin' shit all up in my earlobes
I just live life, try and do it right
Everyone that hear me say "The boy is super nice"
Put a bitch up on a flight, she gon' be here by tonight
Get some afternoon delight, only eat it if it's ripe
Call me Stanley Steemer, I be givin' her the pipe
And when I'm outta town she wanna see me so we Skype
She might get obsessed and keep callin'
Thirty-thousand feet, Tom Petty, free fallin'
Just layin' back, lettin' gravity take its course
I wanna tell all of my haters that we made it, boy
From basement studios to some official shit
From stressed out all the time to I don't give a shit
Used to dream about it, boy, now I'm livin' it
412, it's the Most Dope syndicate
Had a normal life but now I'm sick of it
Try and spend money just to spend and it's ridiculous
Young and so mischievous

And then, uh, Rell wants me to sing a hook like this:
A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la
La-la-la, la-la

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la
