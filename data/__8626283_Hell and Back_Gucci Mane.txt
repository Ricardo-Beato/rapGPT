4 ContributorsHell and Back Lyrics
(Zaytoven)
(I done been through hell and back)
Shoutout to my niggas goin' through hell right now, man
Free everybody, real talk (I done been through hell and back)
Keep your head up at all times (Hell and back, uh)
Yeah (I done been through hell and back)

I done been through hell and back, I sold hella crack (On God)
I done jacked a lot of niggas (Grrah), karma paid me back

Shoutout that boy 21, glad that nigga back
21 salute the gangsters (Grrah), R.I.P. the rest (Yeah)
Courtside shorty now ('Wop), Gucci got them racks
Ran off and got rich on 'em, still ain't paid 'em back (Nah)
Left me for dead, shot in my head, stuntin' so hard, they hate that shit
What you thought, I wasn't gon' straighten that shit?
East Atlanta niggas don't go out sad (No)
If you want smoke, my foot on the brake (Skrrt) while punchin' thе gas (Skrrt), now you do the math
Fresh off parole, pockеts so swole, I drop the bag, they cut you in half (Grrah)
Laughin' (Ha)
Hate these niggas with a passion (Fuck 'em)
Smashin'
Trappin' like smash and grabbin' (Wop)
You might also like
I done been through hell and back, I sold hella crack (On God)
I done jacked a lot of niggas (Grrah), karma paid me back
(I done been through hell and back)
(I done been through hell and back)

Gucci Mane is in the Fulton County jail this afternoon after a judge denied bond for him today
Well, Gucci Mane, real name Radric Davis, was denied bond on two felony aggravated assault charges not just because of what he allegedly did, but because of his past
Mr. Davis has a— a history
You know, we're not gonna skirt that issue
A judge ordered a well-known Atlanta rapper handcuffed and taken to jail today
It also didn't help that Gucci Mane was arrested in July in Henry County for DUI marijuana possession and possession of a firearm by a felon
I was in a maximum security prison (Wow)
People dyin' daily (Damn)
Death everywhere, you know, it's serious
You know, federal prison, maximum security, it's— you know, it's nothin' like that
And for me to see that, you know, I didn't know that world existed
I never knew so much violence and death and just depression
It's serious
You know, it's not a lot of people trying to help 'em
You know what I'm sayin'?
Like, look at me, I went and actually, I bettered myself
So it can happen, you know what I'm sayin'?
So you can't just lock somebody up, I feel like, and just throw away the keyEmbed
