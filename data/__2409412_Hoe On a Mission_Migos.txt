I put my hoe on a mission, I put my hoe on a mission (hoe on a mission)
I put my hoe on a mission, I put my hoe on a mission (back in business)
50 thousand on me, I got a thousand homies
When you throwing up your squad you better ride on it, yeah
Yeah we at the top like we just climbed some stairs
Yeah we on the block, tryna get out of here
The streets only gon’ love you if you keep it real
That just how a young rich nigga feel

I know that a nigga can’t stand it
I know that a nigga can’t stand it
I know that a nigga can’t stand it
Ay ay ay
Put a ho on a mission named Brandy
I feel like I’m balling with Kansas
And I bought her some hair called Remy
I’m liking my ho with extensions
I bought her Céline, she ain’t want it
She rather go get her some chonies
She don’t fuck with no bitches that’s phony
She rather walk around lonely
She telling her best friend, how I just piped her down
Now her and her best friend, we having a threesome now
She was with me when I had all these pounds
She was with me when I kicked all these doors
She was with me when I was on the nawf
She was with me when I was on the nawf
She ready go out and rob for me
She ready go take a charge for me
Put her on missions across the country

I put my hoe on a mission, I put my hoe on a mission (hoe on a mission)
I put my hoe on a mission, I put my hoe on a mission (back in business)
50 thousand on me, I got a thousand homies
When you throwing up your squad you better ride on it, yeah
Yeah we at the top like we just climbed some stairs
Yeah we on the block, tryna get out of here
The streets only gon’ love you if you keep it real
That just how a young rich nigga feel

I put my hoe on a mission, she got to play her position
I got a thousand niggas, stay with some ammunition
They got revolvers on ‘em, they got some rifles on ‘em
They do anything for them chonies, and I’ma put prices on you
I got some racks in my sofa, I put the codeine in my soda
Pulling her hair while I fuck her and choke her
Hit her one time, girl you know that shit over
Kicking Activ, me and Takeoff gon’ toast it
Ain’t got no time for no playing no joking
I’m tryna get money, I gotta stay focused
Putting these plays in motion
Put me in the game and I’m gonna score
Gotta get money, more money, more more
Ain’t got no time to be chasing no whore
They come and they go and I can’t put ‘em on
All of my niggas directing my army
I put ‘em on missions, go pick up your gun
Ain’t got no job but they still getting paid
Them boys they gon’ play with that dick on AK
I put my hoe on a mission, I put my hoe on a mission (hoe on a mission)
I put my hoe on a mission, I put my hoe on a mission (back in business)
50 thousand on me, I got a thousand homies
When you throwing up your squad you better ride on it, yeah
Yeah we at the top like we just climbed some stairs
Yeah we on the block, tryna get out of here
The streets only gon’ love you if you keep it real
That just how a young rich nigga feel

My niggas been keeping it real
Nigga been having dab, that’s before the deal
Takeoff, I been worth an M&M
My mansion look like a galeria
Shitting on niggas, got diarrhea
Little bitty bitch with a large rear
Went and signed ‘cause my dogs here
Not from the nawf, you don’t belong here
It’s only one god I can fear
Wake up and I look in the mirror
Went and paid ten a piece just for my ear
Living a dream, Yung Rich Nation the gear
All of my niggas been here from the start
When I thought that nobody would never be here
Ain’t talking bout Visine, I see this shit clear
Grandma ain’t here so I shedded some tears
Bitches tryna get up under ya for a mil
Got your own partners tryna kill
Tryna steal, nigga is you for real?
Fuck around and get your cap pealed
Some of my niggas in the bando still
Making money off of vacuum seals
I take your main bitch, make a film
When I get through, I’ma pop a seal
I put my hoe on a mission, I put my hoe on a mission (hoe on a mission)
I put my hoe on a mission, I put my hoe on a mission (back in business)
50 thousand on me, I got a thousand homies
When you throwing up your squad you better ride on it, yeah
Yeah we at the top like we just climbed some stairs
Yeah we on the block, tryna get out of here
The streets only gon’ love you if you keep it real
That just how a young rich nigga feel2Embed
