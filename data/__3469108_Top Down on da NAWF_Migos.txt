Please help me

Top down on da NAWF, I'm home
I can never get lost, no no
I play the field and the coach (I play the field)
And they know, that's why I'm Huncho

For some reason I can't cry, cry
For some reason, I am not tired
For the gang, I gotta bring it home
For my grandma watchin' in the sky (grandma)
You probably can't tell me nothin'
You probably gonna see me stuntin'
You probably wanna see me run
You probably wanna see me run on 'em
But I got my top down of on da NAWF (yeah, yeah)
Believe in what I did and what I saw (yeah, yeah)
Stand on my word by law(yeah, yeah)
Mama prayin' on the devil, shake 'em off (yeah, yeah)
Boulders on my shoulder, weights on me
I will never fold up when it's on me
Stash a whole mil' in the backseat
Just to move them thangs down the backstreet

Top down on da NAWF (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), I'm home
I can never get lost (I can never get lost), no, no
I play the field and the coach
(I done played the whole field, for real)
And they know, that's why I'm Huncho

I done survived the gun smoke (survive)
Some of my niggas ain't survive, God bless your soul (yeah, yeah)
The codeine eased in my mind 'cause my eyes on the road (my mind, my mind)
The Patek is rose, we hide in the flats and bandos
I'ma pull up on that nigga with the five then
If I could go back, I would whip up a pie again
I got the hood all on my back and they ready to die for him
Dope, trappin' up out of the gym, 2Pac is above the rim (devoted)
Watchin' me like I am a film, they want the chips, the drip
The sauce, my hoe, I look at the niggas like shrimp
Fuck these niggas, these niggas ain't come from the NAWF (NAWF)
85 nawf the route (yeah) and I'm not leavin' 'em out (nah)
Yeah, shippin' 'em out (ship), don't let the money run out (hey)

Top down on da NAWF, I'm home
I can never get lost (I can never get loss), no, no
I play the field and the coach (I played the field)
And they know, that's why I'm Huncho
No question we come from the NAWF, they know we the boss (NAWF)
Only site, no map involved, I cannot get lost (no)
And we know you flaw, everything you say is false (false)
I'ma scrape his jaw, pay the ticket, you get off
No navigation needed or GPS at all (no)
My neck and wrist conceited, full of Fiji and it costs (ice)
Mirror, mirror, who the richest niggas of 'em all? (Mirror)
The mirror spoke to me and said, "No cap, I think it's y'all"
Takeoff

In the night time, we can ride then
I'ma slide on that bitch outside then (slide, slide)
I'ma make sure my wrist all iced in (ice)
I'ma make sure my wrist on fire then (fire)
I'ma make sure my wrist on fire then (fire)
I'ma make sure my wrist on fire then (fire)
I'ma make sure my wrist outside (outside)
I'ma make sure my wrist outside then (outside, yeah)
Have you ever swam with sharks in the deep blue, huh?
Ever been in the dark when there is no sun, huh?
Ever been on the NAWF with hundred round drum?
With a hundred round drum (NAWF, yeah)
Drum (NAWF, yeah) drum
Pull up on me, show me outside then (yeah)
Pull up on me, show me let it fly then
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ohhh (NAWF)8Embed
