Like a moth in a flame, when you burn, you learn
Rush to mistakes, but just wait your turn
Get what you need, what you want, you earn
When it's time, then it's time, but that ain't my concern
Like a moth in a flame, when you burn, you learn
Rush to mistakes, just to wait your turn
Get what you need, what you want, you earn
When it's time, then it's time, but this ain't my concern

This rap shit a lay-up, I'm going for a dunk
Going big like bitches panties on that time of the month
If it's an easy way to get it, tell me where to sign up
Ain't no shortcuts, a process you can trust
I done came up, nigga, on a grip and a half
Thirstin' for a better life, so I pour me a glass
Slicе a humble pie, look myself in thе eye
You can never trust yourself when you're livin' a lie
Like a few of these rappers I know, always following trends
Never stick to the code
Back in the day, they sold their soul for Rock'n'Roll
But with this rap shit, a nigga sell his booty-hole
What you doing over there, we doing this over here
My aunt died, was on tour, couldn't shed no tears
Had to go, won't stay, so I'm turning the page
We can wish all we want, but this ain't back in the days
Gotta move on, nigga, leave the past in the past
Never know when it's over cause this life won't last
New nigga in your spot, now he punchin' the clock
Shit getting out of hand, tell me when will it stop
This little pink pill tasting like it got sugar in it
Done so much coke, it's like a gram on my booger, nigga
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, nigga, let her wake up
It's a million ways to get it, better make 'em pay up
Don't stay up, sleep real well
Stopped worrying 'bout you niggas, started caring 'bout myself
Looked in the mirror, started staring at myself
Told myself, I'ma get it, fuck everything else

Like a moth in a flame, when you burn, you learn
Rush to mistakes, but just wait your turn
Get what you need, what you want, you earn
When it's time, then it's time, but that ain't my concern
Like a moth in a flame, when you burn, you learn
Rush to mistakes, just to wait your turn
Get what you need, what you want, you earn
When it's time, then it's time, but this ain't my concernEmbed
