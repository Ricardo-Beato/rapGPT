Lets Go

Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what
Get up (Get up), say what
Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what
Get up (Get up), say what

Now may I kick a little flow for y’all
That’s slow and raw
For niggas who thinking the west coast fell off
But first, I’d like to give a little toast to all
Who’s souls was lost up in the rap flows in all (Gee)
Back to my original topic
Fuck the bullshit you should be getting with Hopsin
On that real rap shit man forget the imposters
Y’all destroyed hip hop - Good! (Mission accomplished)
Now I’ma make them regret this shit
Bringing back all the elements
Making these fellas swell up
And tell them that fucking hell is hit
I got to focus though
And come down on all my zoning's yo
Because I’m prone to blow
And destroy all my lyric chromosomes
I told you folks that it’s over
So go and roll up your soldiers
And be up out this bitch like hocus pocus
I’m so ferocious I had the potion but no one noticed
And now I’m about to blow up even bigger than my nose is
You might also like
Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what
Get up (Get up), say what
Break it down (down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what
Get up (Get up), say what

I’d like to bust another verse if I may
The mess I made, make rappers want to catch my fade
I’m just not sane, all y’all affect my brain
So don’t be running up trying to put me in headlocks mayne
It’s like I pin 'em like a poster, get 'em and then roast 'em
When it comes to this verbal abuses, do not approach him
I toast 'em, bury them in an oasis
Then write a book on how I did it like OJ did (Stupid stupid)
I’m that new nigga all the kids gonna look up to
With a middle finger in the sky screaming “Fuck school”
You don’t want your child bumping Hop? Nigga fuck you
Who’s a better dad? You or me? Let your son choose
Girl, why you acting so passionate?
You smiling at me like I was attracted to fat women
Shit, go dance your ass up in the cut with your big butt
Come to think about it, never mind I could use a nut
Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what
Get up (Get up), say what
Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what
Get up (Get up), say what

Still the same nigga, still using Fruity Loops
Play this shit up in the club, watch what her booty do
I ain’t got to fuck with all the high tech shit
I keep the kitchen grimy cooking up my next hit
I guess it’s how I was raised, and now I get paid
To go and write some bullshit a couple hours a day
I just pop a tune on and the music will move me
My message is deeper than this shit if you listen closely
Yo, I got a habit for smashing faggots
In fact I’ma dashing rapping savage
Assassin who has a passion
To just see 'em, read 'em, eat 'em
Beat 'em, flee 'em then feed 'em to muselina
I seem to be the most heated speaker
I’ll defeat your leader
Freak your diva then freaking leave her
Hopsin, he a demon
Y’all knowing he a beast (what!)
How the fuck am I supposed to act?
The west coast is back! (Westside!)
Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what
Get up (Get up), say what
Break it down (Down down down down…)
Gotta get up (Get up), say what
Get up (Get up), say what1Embed
