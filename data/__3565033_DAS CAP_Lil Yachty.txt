48 ContributorsDAS CAP Lyrics
Yeah, you ever looked at a nigga, like, who was just poppin', poppin' shit and you just knew he was, knew that nigga was broke?
Broke ass nigga

Thas cap, talkin' online you get papped
My young nigga keep a strap, drive with a strap on his lap
Fuck postin' up in the trap
I'm finna cop me a island, yeah, and put myself on the map
Rich and it ain't 'cause of rap, yeah
Bitch I ain't rentin', I hop in a Bentley, it ain't got no ceilin'
You mad? Fuck ya feelings
Bitch I ain't rentin', I hop in a Bentley, it ain't got no ceilin'
You mad? Fuck ya feelings

All of my niggas be wildin' (Wildin')
Stay with the cannon, the gang wildin' out
Nigga don't talk about stylin'
I stay with the drip, put it all in her mouth
New coupe, it came with twin turbo
Sendin' 'em bullets like Tony Romo
Put that bitch on the syrup, it's slow-mo
Pullin' off with the gang in a four door (Skrt)
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check it out, uh
I'm with the static like radio, why do your pistol shoot vertical?
You might also like
Man, you niggas ain't shootin' at nobody man
You niggas shootin' in air man
All these niggas do is flodge, flake, and beef through texts
Man these niggas is hoes
Niggas ain't gettin' no goddamn money man
And thas cap, these niggas ain't, these niggas ain't gettin' no fuckin' money

Thas cap, talkin' online you get papped
My young nigga keep a strap, drive with a strap on his lap
Fuck postin' up in the trap
I'm finna cop me a island, yeah, and put myself on the map
Rich and it ain't 'cause of rap, yeah
Bitch I ain't rentin', I hop in a Bentley, it ain't got no ceilin'
You mad? Fuck ya' feelings
Bitch I ain't rentin', I hop in a Bentley, it ain't got no ceilin'
You mad? Fuck ya' feelings

Okay, I'm tryna fuck a new bitch
I'm tryna make a new flip, hittin' home runs like Chip, huh
Yeah, fuck with a nigga (Fuck it)
Fuck with my money, we might have to cut us a nigga
Ain't no debatin' with none of y'all niggas
22 diamonds, that shine in the picture
Menthol, shorty blow dick like Newport (Newport)
Hundred thousand dollars in the Jansport (Jansport)
Stackin' money tall, make a camp fort
Fuck it
Man, man you know the world would be a lot more truthful if you had to pay a lie man
These niggas be lyin' out they ass man
Just talkin' for no reason
Cappin' this, cappin' that, I don't understand that, you never capped on nothin'
I'm the youngest nigga, I mean everything I say, I do what I say you feel me?

Thas cap, talkin' online you get papped
My young nigga keep a strap, drive with a strap on his lap
Fuck postin' up in the trap
I'm finna cop me a island, yeah, and put myself on the map
Rich and it ain't 'cause of rap, yeah
Bitch I ain't rentin', I hop in a Bentley, it ain't got no ceilin'
You mad? Fuck ya' feelings
Bitch I ain't rentin', I hop in a Bentley, it ain't got no ceilin'
You mad? Fuck ya' feelings

Hop in the Maybach, hop in the hop in the Maybach, yeah
Hop in the Maybach, hop in the hop in the Maybach, yeah, skrt5Embed
