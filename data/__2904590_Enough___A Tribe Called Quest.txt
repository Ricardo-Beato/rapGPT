71 ContributorsEnough!! Lyrics
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Enough, enough, enough

Yo, I'm savant with the game
Gon' tell Robi yo' name
Provide words that's heard, setting your body aflame
Ooh, you off the chain, I'm handling your terrain
Your valley h-has me standing down to the follicle
'Bout half of this bottle full of reasons for us to ball
Palming violations and travel vacation, ma
Lace your fancy bra, gon' take them vestments off
Skin and my lips involved, I'm licking a place that's soft
Jedi

Is this enough?
Is this enough love that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Is this enough time that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Is this enough?
Enough, enough, enough
You might also like
Is it an issue if I make you nut?
But there's no quality time 'cause I forever grind
This is not an excuse, I just wanna get loose
That's old nigga jargon, girl, you're making me hardened
To a stone or granite statue, I'm prone to get at you
It's hard to break your defense, I guess I have to leap fence
Or scale wall, and break fall on a tree right by your window
Reward me for my efforts by rolling this indo
As I nibble your neck naughtily, sex is a big part of me
Agencies want to audit me, searching, snooping for sodomy
My thrust bust artery, I know you're on to me
Just wanna have shenanigan
Don't wanna make you mad again
So focus on the flattery you feel when I fling it
Acknowledge that I got it and you love it when I bring it
Dirty talk loud but they saying, "Fuck the shit out of me"
At the Queen's request, if it's gotta be, it's gotta be

Is this enough?
Is this enough love that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Is this enough time that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Is this enough love that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Is this enough time that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Is this enough?15Embed
