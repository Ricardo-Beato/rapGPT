Mhmm
I got some killers so don't push me, Juicy J be on some mob shit
Waiting by your doorstep, hidin' in the bushes (Mhmm)
If it comes down to it, ain't no thang but to do it
Got a vest on, got a gun that can really do it (Mhmm)
You niggas playin' with real niggas' money, get fronted
One day you is the plug, next day you in the dumpster
Couldn’t keep it one hunnid, you thirty-two percent (Mhmm)
The police got you on a leash, nigga, you a bitch

Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (Sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (No Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Quit playin')
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin'
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (We sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (Ain't no Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Playin', nigga)
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin' (We winnin')

You don’t know 'bout this life, nigga
Earnin' all of these stripes, nigga
Kilograms, Peter Pans, pack holders on bikes, nigga
Throwin' bitches on flights, nigga
They ain't know that they dyke, nigga
'Til the money’s out and the bottle's pourin'
They’re in the midst of they life, nigga
Rose gold on my wrist, this Rolex like Devil's piss
This Daytona illuminate, y'all think I'm talkin' that Devil shit
This fifty racks, no bezel shit
Like blood diamonds, it's rebel shit
This mo' guns, this mo' bodies
We call shots, they nobodies
They fuck niggas, they owe prolly
Who fuckin' with me? Nobody
When the guns drawn, they so sorry
Sprayin' niggas, now the Lord got 'em, rrrah!
Bullets out the barrel make your body jerk
Fuck with my money and I'll hit you with that body work
You might also like
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (Sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (No Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Quit playin')
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin'
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (We sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (Ain't no Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Playin', nigga)
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin' (We winnin')

Bad bitches on deck, nigga
Money, power, respect, nigga
Cop, cook, collect, nigga
You was never no threat, nigga
Everybody be rap dissin'
I catch niggas, I check niggas
These goons with me don't spit no verses
Just limo service, they stretch niggas
Black 'maro 2 S, nigga
Couple birds on my neck, nigga
Every time them hoes see me
They like, "Meek Milly, you a mess, nigga"
Two gats, no vest, nigga
Strapped up like I'm a cowboy
Stand tall like that Yao boy
I got a bad bitch and she 5'4"
This gold Rollie that's on my wrist
Leprechaun prolly die for
Young boys that's on my strip
Will kill anything I say ride on, bow!
T-tell them niggas call us if they out of work
'Cause we liftin' weights but we don't do no body work
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (Sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (No Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Quit playin')
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin'
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (We sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (Ain't no Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Playin', nigga)
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin' (We winnin')

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Shout my lawyer all the crazy shit I ever did
Know we love that KK sound, you know we not backin' down
Hunnid drum like, "Hold that doe", diamonds flash like Kodak though
Straight cash, nigga, fuck that loan, seven digits on that phone
Money so long, smoke a whole zone
Getting blood money, tryna put my cuz on
Bitch, I'm on fire, got my jaw wired
Sex, money, murder, Petey Rollack (Soundview, whaddup)
Body work, chopper work like a techno song
Twenty thou' a show, I just hope my nigga Max come home (wavey)
Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain in this bitch, Hurricane Irene

Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (Sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (No Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Quit playin')
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin'
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (We sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (Ain't no Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Playin', nigga)
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin' (We winnin')3Embed
