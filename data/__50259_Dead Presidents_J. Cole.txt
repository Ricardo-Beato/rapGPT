41 ContributorsDead Presidents Lyrics
Let me try this
Uh, Yeah
Money coming soon
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
Omen what up nigga?
Yea niggaaaa, yea, uh

Gimmie my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding? (Right)
Out for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining? (True)
I'm glowing, knowing that the flow intact
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first 'mil I'm blowing that (haha)
Like fuck it, I know I'll grow it back, shit, it's nothing
Funny how blacks they spend dough on mad shit for stuntin' (yea)
But shit, that's all we know man, thats how a niggas raised (true)
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid (uh)
And you should be gettin' laid by the time you in ninth grade
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea
In class dreamin' bout having these nice things (uh)
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin' but them whites ain't? (Hmmm)
I brush it off like, "fuck it, it's motivation" (yeah)
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take 'em (yeah)
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin,' I gotta go for mines
My little godsister pregnant now, I put in overtime
On my grind, yeah, just like the nigga making Folgers
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won't pay 'em attention (nah)
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition (aha)
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition (yup)
While these fake niggas ain't about doing, they into wishin'
You might also like
Yeah
Uh
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm talking Benjamins, nigga
Grants nigga
From Washingtons, man
Tired of those
Yeah!

Till I'm rich, ain't no reason to settle, nigga
Its greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese
You niggas couldn't think at my level, even with trees
You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave till I'm hot
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth
Out grindin' while you reclining on your couch
I'm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo' mouth
And you gonna find what I'm about, nigga!
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain't gonna parlé with y’all
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher
But check, them checks is all a nigga thinking
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln
BLOW!5Embed
