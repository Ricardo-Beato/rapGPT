9 ContributorsGraffiti Lyrics
I wrote this one when I was still alive
Hey you, yeah you, listen
And if I had a horse
To climb up and ride off into the warmth
I'd never turn around
I'd just kick up this dust 'til I find where I'm found
And If I qualified as a genius
Maybe I'd live out my dreams and die dreamless
These voices in my life are all make-believe
Trying to find a way to exploit my choice of pain relief

It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply
You make me wanna understand your graffiti
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me

I'm examining the clouds like I'm looking for a sign
I hope you're having a good time
If you wasn't afraid, would you lie so much?
You got your tail between your legs chasing fire trucks
You can tell I'm not the best at expressing how I felt
That's why I hide it inside the words I spell
I mix the medication, it fixes whatever ails them
And now she treats me like a snake oil salesman, huh
Well, thank you for your vote of confidence
I don't give a shit about how it figures into all your politics
Still believe you gotta make your art, play your part
The world waits for you to break my patient heart
Now let me find a road by the airport
To park and watch the planes arrive and think of what I'm here for
And I ain't tryna kill the vibe, but I'm grateful that you're still alive
Now gimme a high five
You might also like
It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply
You make me wanna understand your graffiti
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me

And that's what we s'posed to do I guess
Spread love 'til you've used your last breath
No matter what the challenges hold
I was bold because I knew that we could handle the cold
And just in case I don't say this enough
Thanks for the love, I love the way that you love
And I ain't making this up, you put some change in my cup
And then you gave me a hug, it's like you came from above

It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly
And when they come to divide, we've gotta multiply
You make me wanna understand your graffiti
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs meEmbed
