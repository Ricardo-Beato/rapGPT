I'm two kinds of potential
Plus new ice house to sweat you, warm
One, two, I'm Count Contessa
Yup, boo, I'm House Princessa
Come to my town to get you
Come to ice house to get your coin
Hustle, I'm proud professor
Muscle, I'm high adepta
And in time, I suggest you
Learn to like House Princessa one
One, two, I styles the besta
Until I'm cunt perfecta
Just new ice house Contessa
Want to my sound? Go get your own
Yup, boo, my styles'll test you
Come to ice house, I'll wreck you

And they'll agree, Miss Crystal Panty
Little bam's the potential-tential candy
Sand to the sea, so sensual and free
From Milan to Japan with Miss Romancy
If you can't dance and if you can't sing
Put your hands in the air, up out your damn seat
Stamp-to-the-pede, present your campaign
Do your dance to the beat with little Bambi

Hey

Hey, hey, hey
