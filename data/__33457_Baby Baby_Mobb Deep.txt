1 ContributorBaby Baby Lyrics
"Shot fired"
"Give it up"
"That's right, everythin' B"
"You gotta" - "Give it up"
"Yea, well"
"It looks like they gon' fight too"
"It's serious"
"Give it up"
"Yo hold up dawg"
"Everythin' B"
"Give it up"

Ayo it's 52 states and we hittin' all of them
Party e'yday, hotels suites and shop
They eatin' food like Kings, Barbarians rather
We corner stray Vultures cause we all savage
Goin' Apes on the chicks, we did the girls foul
But they likely gon' bananas on the stage
Wit madd bottles or the Henny rock, the crowds gon' crazy
Ayo there's million fifty-two dimes, you can't hit all of 'em
Just get you a nice ass boo and you'll be on dunn
But y'all niggas so thirsty 'til that Virus bite you on your ass is dirt
I seen people die Aids my Pops is one of them
I seen people get clipped with shots that were sprayed
And that hell fire blaze, cause people wanna throw all their weight
Only the Creator know what took place
You might also like
Ay baby? Ga'head make me rip baby
Madd bullets in your shit baby
Plus you get stomped in baby, babe-babe-baby-baby
Say baby? Get your mind off me baby
Keep your mind on your ring baby
And bets stay where you be baby, babe-babe-baby-baby

Why I need madd guns? When my nine worth fine, my AR's plus
They talkin' 'bout vestin' up, nigga come how you want
I got some for you fucks, I don't black out
I pull conscious murder, I'm perfectly insane and fully aware I'm hurtin'
Sumtin'
It could pop off 24-7, it's nobody safe, its no one for help
You gotta go through your own things
Handle your shit; make your own gun ring
Me? - You better send nines, I'mma shoot the first .4-5 Mary J Blige
R&B niggas, they singin' the blues cause we more uppin' them niggas baby
You fuckin' wit the wrong set of dudes
But my songs speak for itself, the choices is on you


"Eh-huh"
"Eh-huh"

"Eh-huh"
"Eh-huh"
"Give it up"
"Eh-huh"
"Eh-huh"
"Give it up"
"Eh-huh"
"It looks like they gon' fight too"
"It's serious"
"Give it up"
"Eh-huh"
"Eh-huh"
"Give it up"Embed
