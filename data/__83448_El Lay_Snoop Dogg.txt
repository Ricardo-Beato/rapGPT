9 ContributorsEl Lay Lyrics
LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali
Don't go 'less you go hard
Go 'less you go hard
Hollywood, downtime and back
Life is always good
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood
You knew that it never would
Knew that it never would

Lakers, Dodgers, Ducks, Kings, Angels, Clippers
Real set trippers
Clarify ride, we bonafide dippers
ESPN, you know Sports Centre
Spooned and groomed, dipped and wet
Home of the NBA championship
Purple and Gold, homie let the story be told
It's the city where you shoot your favourite television episode
And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard
But you gotta have a Low-rider car
With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin'
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon
That's how we represent it though
Birthplace of Chevrolet '64
Yeah I love showing it out
First things first my nig', you better know where you at
You in...
You might also like
LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali
Don't go 'less you go hard
Go 'less you go hard
Hollywood, downtime and back
Life is always good
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood
You knew that it never would
Knew that it never would
Riding on the 405
On my way to pick up baby
85 in the winter time
Man, this place is crazy
I love it, love it, love it, love it
Southern surfer Cali

Rollin' down Fairfax
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes
I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues
About 9 o clock stop by the record shop
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history
Stop by my dispensary
Give me some kush and pusha
Put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk
But it's all legal in LA
Everybody taking a hit from the politicians
Athletes and even the teachers
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher
He say "Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya"
Yeah, I love showing you now
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at
You in...
LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali
Don't go 'less you go hard
Go 'less you go hard
Hollywood, downtime and back
Life is always good
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood
You knew that it never would
Knew that it never would2Embed
