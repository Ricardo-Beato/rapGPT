6 ContributorsI’ll Do Anything Lyrics

This for the bitches, nigga
I'll, do, anything for you
I'll do anything you want me to (I'll do do do-do do do do)
I'll do, anything (anything for you)

Me? I done been around the world six times
A bad bitch in every part of the world's been mine
But you can change me, baby, you can change me
Oh shit, look, I'm already not the same, see?
Shorty, you make me feel brand new
I'm not running game, girl, I swear you do
You're too cold to hold and too hot to handle
Me and you girl there's nothing we can't do
You like girls, I like girls too, we got something in common
Now how the hell could that be a problem?
Shorty let's laugh, let's dance, let's drink, let's fuck
Right here, right now, shit, we only live once
I should not be reprimanded, I cannot be blamed
My lust on level 10, I'm trying to get it in
I'll have you cumming down your candy walls
Get it wetter than Niagara Falls 'til you climax, that's all
You might also like
They think I'm a fool
Cause I'd do so many things for you
I'll, do anything, I'll, do anything
But they don't know the reason
It's why I do all the things I do for you
I'll, do anything, I'll, do anything
I'll do

I keep a bad bitch on deck
We retro drinking, yeah, sippin' Moët
Look man, my shawty got ass for days
I smack it, sit and watch it wave
When it's stress on my brain the head games relax the pain
So good I get to buying her things
Like tennis bracelets and chains, studs and diamond rings
I'm giving her the finer things
That's why she don't complain
I kinda got her open, mane, I stroke that thing
On different ends of the globe
We international now, whoa

They think I'm a fool
Cause I'd do so many things for you
I'll, do anything, I'll, do anything
But they don't know the reason
It's why I do all the things I do for you
I'll, do anything, I'll, do anything
I'll do
That's me and you, you know? (I'll do)
They ain't supposed to understand it (I'll do do do-do do do)
You know I say some shit I ain't supposed to say
But you know how I feel (I'll do)
I should be a asshole whenever I feel like it (I'll do)
After - look at the shit I bought you, man (I'll do do do-do do do)
C'mon man, don't give me no headache, man
You a bitch when you on your period, right? (I'll do)
Don't come at me with that bullshit, man
(I'll do, I'll do do do-do do do)
Do anything for you, girl
I'll do anything1Embed
