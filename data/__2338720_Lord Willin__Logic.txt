Okay now, this how I'm feeling, lately I'm like the villain
Cause while they on that other shit
I been posted, out here chillin'
Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5
You know this that shit that you bumpin'
In your whip while you drive
I've been living life and I hope that you do the same
'Cause if you ain't doing what you love, it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game
'Bout time that they know my name
Numb it down for the pain, this music my Novocaine
Lord willin' we overcame, it's time to get over man
I've been around the world and back
And I swear it's all the same
And what I learned; a prophet don't do it for the profit
Gon' get off it, check the topic
Watch me drop it, can you top it?
I don't know I've been at it on the low
Never did it like this here before
But I'm still here and I just hope
I'll make a difference, make a killin', Lord willin'

Lord willin', make a difference
Lord willin'—uh, Lord willin'

I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell em—

I guess I'm back at it; I ain't done, I ain't had it
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic
For this rap shit I'm an addict, but can't fuck with that dramatic
I've been busting my ass, they probably think it's automatic
Yes sir, I've done this shit before
Like your baby momma momma
I'ma tell 'em like it is, I'ma tell 'em like it is
Life ain't picture perfect, we use the negatives to develop
I'm well up, I'm way up
Nothing but net, fuck the layup, I'm way up
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions
Can't fuck with they delusions, I'm on that 101 cruisin'
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way
But no not quite like this, living like that
In a way, guess you could say made me wanna write like this
Not quite like this, on my level, I'm unique and I'm a rebel
Like you listening? I hope that you're listening
This feel like it's summertime; waiting for the bus
Number nine, through the city all alone
Not a worry, not your phone
We just vibing, maybe flying 'round the world
Man, I hope you see the world
And all your dreams will unfurl
Just don't never cash your pearl
Go out there and make a livin', take this advice that I'm givin'
Make a difference, make a killin', make a killin', Lord willin'
Lord willin', make a difference
Lord willin', Lord willin'

I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell em—65Embed
