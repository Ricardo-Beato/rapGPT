18 ContributorsSYLVIA Lyrics
Baby, what the fuck is really up?
Baby, what the fuck is really up?
Baby, what the fuck is really up? (Ayy, ayy)

Baby, what the fuck is really up?
All my girlfriends like to be rebellious (yeah)
Tattoos with the belly button ring
She a bad little 'ting, look just like a Sylvia (yeah)
And I think its really us (yeah)
PG-13, them my damn affiliates (yeah)
I ain't really with the silly stuff
I'm a real buddy, when it's late I still be up (yeah)
R-r-eal buddy, when it's late I still be up

And you're insane (insane)
Like the wind change
Motherfuckers do too, but a couple friends stay, yeah
In-state, how she got her tuition?
Retail, but she got some commission
I don't listen when they talk from a distance
I'm on some new shit, ayy, you can't relate (woo)
I'm the man for the job, I'm the new candidate
We in the runnin' now, ayy
I'm about to dumb it down for you, just so you can explain
To someone else that wanna know
You can't help me with this flow
'Cause I got it on my own
Yeah, I got it on my own (yeah)
You might also like
Baby, what the fuck is really up?
All my girlfriends like to be rebellious (yeah)
Tattoos with the belly button ring
She a bad little 'ting, look just like a Sylvia (yeah)
And I think it's really us (yeah)
PG-13, them my damn affiliates (yeah)
I ain't really with the silly stuff
I'm a real buddy, when it's late I still be up (yeah)
R-r-eal buddy, when it's late I still be up

Hey, ayy, call it how I see it
She gon' come and scoop me in her Prius
Take a flight down south, changing seasons
I might just go and read her rights for no reason
She sit that ass on the sink, it's deceivin' (ayy)
But she gon' buss it open whenever I need it (ayy)
I told her that I needed space, she bought a heater (ayy)
She expect me, but she know I'm sick, anemic
Baby girl, it's cold out, so this hoodie won't do
VIP grillin' when it ain't nothin' to do
I ain't got nothin' to lose, so she said the party sucks
So I hit her like

Baby, what the fuck is really up?
All my girlfriends like to be rebellious (yeah)
Tattoos with the belly button ring
She a bad little 'ting, look just like a Sylvia (yeah)
And I think it's really us (yeah)
PG-13, them my damn affiliates (yeah)
I ain't really with the silly stuff
I'm a real buddy, when it's late I still be up (yeah)
R-r-eal buddy, when it's late I still be up
I'm on some different type-of
Might dip and get hit with snipers
I know they out to get me, it's attempt when I'm in the Chrysler
I leave once a week to pick a bag up and pick a vice up
She the type of girl to make me feel like I'm indecisive
I take her out to eat and she demand that we split the price up
I been goin' crazy, might just have to go hit the psych up
Been askin' for a time that we can get in and get my life together
I can't trip, I can't trip
Take it slow for the evening
Take a sip, take a sip
They like, "Oh, there go PG, they're the shit, they're the shit"
You should know, I'm 'bout to kill
I got hits, I got hits
Yeah, yeah

Baby, what the fuck is really up?
All my girlfriends like to be rebellious (yeah)
Tattoos with the belly button ring
She a bad little 'ting, look just like a Sylvia (yeah)
And I think it's really us (yeah)
PG-13, them my damn affiliates (yeah)
I ain't really with the silly stuff
I'm a real buddy, when it's late I still be up (yeah)
R-r-eal buddy, when it's late I still be upEmbed
