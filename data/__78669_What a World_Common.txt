What do you see when you look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit that make a robot twerk, that’s what's in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning out
So I'll keep climbing and won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world
A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star
And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car
Though his mama used to say to him, “Aye boy just go to school”
But whether it was old or new, in school he broke the rules

What do you see when you look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit that make a robot twerk, that’s what's in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning out
So I'll keep climbing and won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world

Now his whole life he told his boys, “Hey y'all I'm going to rap”
So when he got a rap contract, it wasn't no turning back
Now his mama she would say to him, “You need to get get back in school”
And all the trash that the peoples say, he was using that for fuel
You might also like
What do you see when you look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit that make a robot twerk, that’s what's in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning out
So I'll keep climbing and won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world

And the story goes on and on, it goes on and on and on
They say, “Hey boy, you rap real good, but you ain't making no hit songs”
So he'd tell him self, "Yo yo yo, self, you gotta do it the way you do
And make this music from your soul and make it fresh and new"

What do you see when you look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit that make a robot twerk, that’s what's in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning out
So I'll keep climbing and won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world

Then the game it started to change, they say music, it ain't the same
Though he remained, the song he sang is, "Keep your drive stay in your lane"
Inch by inch the people came, they started to know his name and say, "Do your thang"
Now the whole whole world singing his song from Chicago a star is born
What do you see when you look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit that make a robot twerk, that’s what's in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning out
So I'll keep climbing and won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a worldEmbed
