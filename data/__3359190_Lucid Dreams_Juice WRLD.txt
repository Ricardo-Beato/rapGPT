I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless, regardless
I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target
Click, clack

She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin', nonsense, claiming she was leavin'

Not gonna happen
If I can't have you, no one can
'Cause if you leave, I'm not breathin'
I'll show you how it feels to not breathe, breathe
Inhale, exhale
You're the best, well
You're the worst, but
You're the best hell
I ain't ever, ever gonna lose, lose
Tell me what I gotta do to prove to you
Five seconds from losing my head
Now it's time to show you what lunatics do
You might also like
She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin', nonsense, claiming she was leavin'
I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin', nonsense, claiming she was leavin'

Hate it when you tease
Where you think you're goin'? When you comin' back to me?
You walked in, I'm listening to "Stan" on E, yeah, ecstasy
Matter of fact, there's a bridge that my car wants to meet
Road trip on me, it'll be fun, you'll see
But you don't gotta sit in this trunk, you can sit next to me
For me and Stan, we alike, but he ain't nicer than me
He was drunk drivin', me, I'm just straight Perc-ules

My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
As we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make-believe
My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
As we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make-believe44Embed
