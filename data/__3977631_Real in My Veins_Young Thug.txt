Tell them pussy niggas take a look at what they done created
Ooh
Mario

I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVSs in my chains
Remain the same and change up domain
And most these niggas change up for change

I’m just sayin' tell them pussy niggas take a look at what created
Tell the hoes take a look at what they done created
Tell the cops they gon' start chaos if they raid it
Commanding war, made somebody bleed
Now I ain’t worry 'bout you gettin' past these fuckin' bouncers
Tell the critics that they talkin' 'bout the fuckin' founder
Tell Scott I'm on the way, I’m gettin’ fuckin' faded
Call your mama, Thugger, tell her that you fuckin’ made it

Came from the ground to the top, uh
I'm 'bout to rob me some rocks, uh
I'm ’bout to set up a shop, uh
I'm 'bout to buy back the block, uh
I got respect for the 'Wop, uh
First nigga gave me a knot, uh
I put some keys in the pot, uh
She got Versace on her crotch, uh
It's purple, but this is not Watson, uh
I make that bitch squirt, it's a thot, uh
I turn a lil' bitch to a lot, uh
My watch on the floor, need a mop, uh
Rob Jack if he come out the box, uh
I got a tail on, it's a fox, uh
I'm banging that fire, fox, uh
My bitch get wild, uh
Bloody cross on like a pastor
Cooking fish scale with no batter-er-er-er
Chains on me like Jerry Springer beads, ay
I repent for my sins everyday
You might also like
I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVSs in my chains
Remain the same and change up domain
And most these niggas change up for change

You keep playin' and you get knocked off
I hate to say it but I'm ready for the pop off
Got lil' mama outta drama, I'm talking topped off
She said she ready, let's get it, I got combos
I'm talkin' jumbo, eat me up like mumbos
Beat it up, got me jumpin' off the top rope
Beat it up, got me slidin' off the sliding board
Leave it stuck, man, lil' shawty ain't cleaned out though
I got my money up and I heard that you want some
Nigga moon walkin', Michael Jackson moves
I got latitude, I got gratitude
And if you look up at the moon, you'll see my attitude

I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVSs in my chains
Remain the same and change up domain
And most these niggas change up for change
I'm just sayin' tell them pussy niggas take a look at what created
Tell the hoes take a look at what they done created
Tell the cops they gon' start chaos if they raid it
Commanding war, made somebody bleed
Now I ain't worry 'bout you gettin' past these fuckin' bouncers
Tell the critics that they talkin' 'bout the fuckin' founder
Tell Scott I'm on the way, I'm gettin' fuckin' faded
Call your mama, Thugger, tell her that you fuckin' made it

Yeah, I got real runnin' through my veins (Through my veins)
I heard they tryna find us out in Vegas (Out in Vegas)
Different frames, I got fifty shades (Fifty shades)
I called my dad and told him that we made it (We made it)
Lately, I've been riding in a Ghost (In a ghost)
So much stress, they thinking that I'm gonna overdose (Dose)
You talk shit, and you get comatose (Comatose)
All this money, we gon' need a vault (Need a vault)
My bitch is bad, so designer, she gon' need it (She need it)
C at the bottom of her feet like she Jesus (Chanel)
Pussy water, so I'm seasick (I'm seasick)
And we done made it out the struggle, best believe it (Best believe it), ayy

I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVSs in my chains
Remain the same and change up domain
And most these niggas change up for change
I'm just sayin' tell them pussy niggas take a look at what created
Tell the hoes take a look at what they done created
Tell the cops they gon' start chaos if they raid it
