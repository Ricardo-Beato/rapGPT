37 ContributorsMad Luv Lyrics
Freeband Gang (Fuck you mean, nigga?)
Damn, DJ Plugg, you just killed it (Fuck you mean?)
Put a Rollie on, oh, yeah, yeah (Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Might put a Rollie on with reverse doors
They got mad love for us, we getting mad dough
Tryna sabotage a nigga, gettin' cash flow
We don't respect none of you niggas, we gettin' mad dough
They got mad love for us, it's gon' stay that way
We got mad goons on deck, they gon' spray that way
Outside niggas infiltrating, don't play around, don't play with me
Outside niggas come around, we gon' spray 'em down like firemen

Whipping the dope like it's Anna Mae
Shootin' a nigga like John K (Blatt)
Got mojo on mojo, I assassinate you (Assassinate)
Driving the boat on them Xans (Fut')
Pour out a four in Japan (Woo)
Selling that dope out in France (Let's go)
The molly is great with a tan (That molly)
The presi', it look like it's dancin' (That Rollie)
Diamonds is Mediterranean (Exotic)
This for the ones who abandoned me (Abandoned me)
My heart is so full of some anger (Anger)
All of you niggas in danger (Danger)
Drinking on Texas like I'm a Ranger (Ranger)
I wouldn't've text you if I wasn't famous (Sheesh)
I be with Russians so fuck you complaining? ('Plaining)
Straight off the lot, going straight to the jeweler
Straight out the Range and jump straight in the Masi' (Ballin')
Can't fuck with these niggas, they sheisty (They sheisty)
Run in the bank on some robber shit (Some robber shit)
Laying you down like a carpenter (A carpenter)
We go to clubs and stand on the sofa, nigga (Sofa, nigga)
I toast it up with all my day one niggas (Freeband Gang)

They got mad love for us, we getting mad dough
Tryna sabotage a nigga, gettin' cash flow
We don't respect none of you niggas, we gettin' mad dough
They got mad love for us, it's gon' stay that way
We got mad goons on deck, they gon' spray that way

Celine, Celine, baby
I got the rings on me like Pippen
Machine, machine, baby
I'm in that foreign machine, baby (Skrrt, skrrt)
I blew some steam, the real in Decatur (Ayy)
I put a two in the back of Pyrex
And thirty-somethin' six O's, nigga
I'ma pull up in a Rolls, nigga (Hold up)
I'ma sell me a whole chicken (Hold up)
Ice cubes on me, no freezer (Diamonds)
Same color as a wifebeater (Woo)
Platinum jewels make the ice cleaner (Sheesh)
The Actavis make the Sprite pinker (Pour up)
That's your bitch? I'ma go'n mingle (Hold up)
I got my BM pushin' a Bimmer (Roll up)
Gotta keep M's like it's nina (Hold up)
Nine millimeter my little nigga (My lil')
I'm true to the game, baby (Baby)
I'm true to my gang, baby (Freebandz)
Keep a tool like a man, lady (Splatt)
The bezel so froze 'cause I represent money, nigga (Money)
Smashing on these hoes, toasting with my day one niggas
Might put a Rollie on with reverse doors
They got mad love for us, we getting mad dough
Tryna sabotage a nigga, gettin' cash flow
We don't respect none of you niggas, we gettin' mad dough
They got mad love for us, it's gon' stay that way
We got mad goons on deck, they gon' spray that way
Outside niggas infiltrating, don't play around, don't play with me
Outside niggas come around, we gon' spray 'em down like firemen

We got mad love
They gon' stay that way
Got mad dough
We gon' brrt, brrt
