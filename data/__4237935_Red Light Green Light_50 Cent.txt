Niggas stop at the red light
It's a infrared beam, I go hard for the green
Cause a homocide scene
Green light
So go get the dough
Nigga move, finna jux, so let the 40. cal blow
Red light
Nigga, you don't want it, you ain't on it like I'm on it
For that paper I smoke something
Green light
Nigga, it's a go
You already know for sure, my trey pound blow

I walk the streets with the banger like a nigga in the yard
Whip the soft and the hard, I'll whoop ya ass, swear to God
Grams on the digi scale, coins in the wishing well
Shoot a punk pussy tail, my niggas get me out of jail
Buckshot, sawed-off, miss your head, hit your legs
Had the drop, getting popped, now I bet you wish you dead
Highways, three lanes, switch gears
Six gears, Chevy, 'Vette, shit yeah
Don't worry which year
New money, everything new I got
New Bentley, new bitch, new clips to pop
I got murderous intentions, you knew that shit
That's how you knew to hit the ground soon as I come around
You might also like
Niggas stop at the red light
It's a infrared beam, I go hard for the green
Cause a homocide scene
Green light
So go get the dough
Nigga move, finna jux, so let the 40. cal blow
Red light
Nigga, you don't want it, you ain't on it like I'm on it
For that paper I smoke something
Green light
Nigga, it's a go
You already know for sure, my trey pound blow

Niggas know how I give it up, stacking that bread
Make you a peephole through the back of your head
Yeah, you don't want niggas hopping over yard gates
Red lights in your face like car brakes
Pop shit like a coked up Scarface
Exotic chronic, fucking up my heart pace
Get out of line, be a body on the rucker
I'm a cold-hearted, soak-bodied, grimey motherfucker

Ayo, broad daylight, hit your ass with the trey pound
Buck, buck, buck, take that with you on the way down
Y'all niggas got the audacity
My gun game like Omar on that balcony
I turn a killer to a casualty
I'll kill your whole family off for some cheese and half a ki
Boy, you know when the iron hit 'em
Hollow split 'em, the k make it look like a lion bit 'em
Niggas stop at the red light
It's a infrared beam, I go hard for the green
Cause a homocide scene
Green light
So go get the dough
Nigga move, finna jux, so let the 40. cal blow
Red light
Nigga, you don't want it, you ain't on it like I'm on it
For that paper I smoke something
Green light
Nigga, it's a go
You already know for sure, my trey pound blow

Turn of the lights, , my bitch and she a dyke
She eat a nigga ass up on any given night
I been on one, lowkey staying out of sight
Hit a homerun, one flight, got my money right
Bitch, I'm back now - ain't no braids under the hat now
Only grenades and blades, guns go brrat now
I holla a peep, niggas getting wack now
50 say, "get 'em, Buck", niggas stack now

Niggas stop at the red light
It's a infrared beam, I go hard for the green
Cause a homocide scene
Green light
So go get the dough
Nigga move, finna jux, so let the 40. cal blow
Red light
Nigga, you don't want it, you ain't on it like I'm on it
For that paper I smoke something
Green light
Nigga, it's a go
You already know for sure, my trey pound blowEmbed
