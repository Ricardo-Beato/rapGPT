3 ContributorsDa Greatest Lyrics
Many have tried but they can't bring me down
I'm so high that I can't touch the ground
I'm the greatest, they hate it
To see I made it
I'm on top of the world

More money, more problems, more haters, more guns
Somebody go and find the waitress and I bet you I need some more ones
I'm saying I gets it done and ya'll don't do enough
I said it's going down so what the fuck is up?
On top of my Benz on top of a bitch
No Jordan no Sherman I'm on top of my shit
I'm not dancing I'm all over the place
Remember back when residue was all over the safe?
Take them back days I went five days
120 hours, chef nigga getting paid
Not one time, I sold every dime
And my joy and my pain nigga every line
Said fuck the hygiene I want some fly jeans
That's what the bitches like, you like the bitches, right?
But why they call you Snow? Cause im the Christmas type
You see that nigga's neck? Shine like some Christmas lights
That Merry Christmas ice, that Wayne Gretzky ice
I wouldn't trade this nigga for Wayne Gretzky's life
I'm good in any Projects nigga every block
And if I have it nigga I'll front a nigga every block
Go where I want to go, do what I want to do
Smoke what I want to smoke, screw who I want to screw
Drive what I wanna drive, say what I wanna say
The streets love a nigga, say what you want to say
You might also like
Many have tried but they can't bring me down
I'm so high that I can't touch the ground
I'm the greatest, they hate it
To see I made it
I'm on top of the world

You see what I'm up against? You see what I'm going through?
A million gazillion pounds
I can't let it get me down
My patience just keep me up, my blunt will get me high
If we talking a half a pound then that's just to get me by
Sometimes I feel so alone, a nigga can't even lie
Before that you start to trip just let me explain why
My niggas in graveyards, the rest penitentiaries
And they're never coming home cause they're doing centuries
Sometimes I look at the sky and stare at the fucking stars
Was it really all worth it for jeans and some fucking cars?
Maybe it should be, maybe it could be
But it ain't though I'm just thankful
That's why I drink more, so I can think more
Think a lot when they're hating on you, bottom is waiting on you
These niggas get in these magazines these niggas say anything
And if they get jammed up they'll probably tell everything
I put that on everything if I say anything
You can believe that, and you can believe that
These niggas pray on my downfall they want me to fall hard
But Jeezy be Bruce Willis cause bitch I'mma Die Hard
Bitch I'mma go hard then I'mma go harder
Bitch I'm a go getter, that makes me a lot smarter
Think they want me to change but I want to stay the same
The more that you stay the same the more that these niggas change
Many have tried but they can't bring me down
I'm so high that I can't touch the ground
I'm the greatest, they hate it
To see I made it
I'm on top of the worldEmbed
