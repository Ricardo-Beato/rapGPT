21 ContributorsTill I Get There Lyrics
Album on hold, whole world on hold
The crowd is like, "HO!", operator's like, "Hold" ("Please hold")
Man, now ain't that cold
I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie that's up in the hole
And homegirl not tryin' to be a ho, even though she on a pole
Can she get a second chance? No
Whoa, like the opposite of go
That ain't how it's supposed to be or butterfly
But for the sake of rhyming, let's just say butterfly-ee
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali
I tell 'em, tell 'em, don't homicide me
I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
Fightin' for his fans and fightin' for his folks
But the boos from the crowd can become so loud
If I can block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and
Dance around the ring but until then I'll sing

I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh

Doctor, doctor please, the fame ain't painless enough
"That's cause you ain't famous enough
You got a little game but your name ain't ringin' enough"
He said "Take two of these, put some change in my cup"
I said I wasn't poor, he gave me some more
Prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door
Out, ouch
I'm tellin' you this all from a therapist's couch
"Tell me about your mother, what she's all about"
Prescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce
Damn, jeez
The world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skis
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees
Rendered unconscious, they rushed me to a concert
Instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup
They fed me magazine covers and video shoots

I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh
And when I finally make it, I'ma stunt so hard
Evil as Knievel, I'ma jump so far
Way up in the atmosphere, I ain't comin' back
Be a jerk to them jerks, yeah, that'll make 'em hurt
"Huh?" said a young boy in the mirror
A young version of me, so I started to tear up
He said "You need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up
You're already here, just be yourself from here up"
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar
Somethin' I was taught, somethin' I had lost
If you are afraid or fear that you gon' change some
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from

I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh9Embed
