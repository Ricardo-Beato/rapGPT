I hope you can s-p-e-l-l
Nigga please you don't know me that well
I got a truck sittin on sprewells
My flow tight as h-e-l-l

If you is a h-o-e get a j-o-b
I'm h-o-t on the t-o-p
Mister Mosely get the b-e-a-t
Dont copy this here cause I done d-i-d
It could get h-e-c-t-i-c
F-i-s-t in your f-a-c-e
Y'all don't know how crazy Missy be
Don't t-o-y me I'm outta y'all league
Yes I'm bulletproof
Bitches I ain't foolin' you
You better learn a thing or two
You don't really want it boo

I hope you can s-p-e-l-l
Nigga please you don't know me that well
I got a truck sittin on sprewells
My flow tight as h-e-l-l

My flow tight as h-e-l-lEmbed
