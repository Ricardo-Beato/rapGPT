Yeah, uh

I said, "Baby, don't worry, I'm way too numb to apologize"
And we both feel sorry sometimes, it's okay to feel sorry sometimes
And my momma told me keep distance 'cause all you do is wreck my mind
And we both feel sorry sometimes, it's okay to feel sorry sometimes

We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes

You been canceled, come see the exit
Save face for the broken
Had you last, threw you back, took your heart and wrecked it
All pain, no emotion
Grab 'em by the neck, don't let go
Baby Keem been top five, what you smokin'?
I could put a wish on her tippy toes
No more opinions, I'm done bein' open
I need one, hand in the air for the switch, you don't
Two, hand in the air for a nigga, you don't
Three, hand in the air
Four, for the man in the mirror
And I won't make it official
I just hope we confidential
Back and forth in a rental
I pray to God that he sent you
You might also like
I said, "Baby, don't worry, I'm way too numb to apologize"
And we both feel sorry sometimes, it's okay to feel sorry sometimes
And my momma told me keep distance 'cause all you do is wreck my mind
And we both feel sorry sometimes, it's okay to feel sorry sometimes

We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes

I want you to pray for me (Pray)
Go out of your way for me (Way)
Are you ever gonna pray for me? (Pray)
That ain't nothin' to play with
Love tree falls down
It don't come back around
I can't stop now
I can't stop now

I said, "Baby, don't worry, I'm way too numb to apologize"
And we both feel sorry sometimes, it's okay to feel sorry sometimes
And my momma told me keep distance 'cause all you do is wreck my mind
And we both feel sorry sometimes, it's okay to feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes
We all feel sorry sometimes, we shouldn't feel sorry sometimes3Embed
