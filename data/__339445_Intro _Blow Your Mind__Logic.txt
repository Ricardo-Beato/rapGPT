30 ContributorsIntro (Blow Your Mind) Lyrics
*laughing*
Psychological

Hello?
Yo
Yeah, what's up man?
Ayo, what's goin' on?
Bro, man, it's just- uh, I heard a couple of tracks on the mixtape, man
Sounds phenomenal, dude
Uhh, keep it up, aight?
Be safe! Keep making them hits, baby!

I blow your mind like cocaine, nah
I blow your mind like Cobain, rest in peace
Sucker emcees deceased
Rise on the East, I'm the sun bringing heat for sure
I've been making tracks on the low
Waiting for my time to shine and then blow
Like Johnny, Depp, increase the rep
Like a bench press set, homie, yes, I get repped
Paid my dues but I'm still in debt
'Cause I have no credibility in the game yet
Gotta apply, and run a background check
But I bounce, 'cause I ain't done shit yet
Right now, that's what I'm trying to do
Stay spitting rhymes whenever I roll through
Call me the Grinch, homie, I don't give a hoo
Any emcee, yes, I gotta kill you
But don't take it personal, it's business, fool
Do like Travolta, just be cool
And nowadays, everybody sound the same
The Price is Right, but I don't play that game
Won't never stop till they all know my name
Gotta grind to the top, Rodriguez with the fame
Homie, if I kill you, accept that you're gone
This ain't Call of Duty you can't respawn
Had your girl down talking on jive
Till I hit you with the MP5
Suppression, I really hope y'all learned your lesson
And never forget that I'm the unsung freshman
