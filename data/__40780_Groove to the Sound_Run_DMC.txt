4 ContributorsGroove to the Sound Lyrics
Groove to the sounds of Jam Master Jay
The high-potent, super-charged
Spiritual lyrical miracle, of a man
Damn, you can't understand
The fulfillment, of the prophecy
The epitome, the legacy, of every MC
Understand, to be the man
You got to beat the man
Got somethin to say, let the music play
Groove to the sound of Jam Master Jay
It's the real, real deal
Don't you feel stupid?  Reel to reel, and we looped it
Takes it around, we threw the sound
Threw down, now scoop this!
Here we go, like back in the days
The true heroes, MC's, DJ's
The Hollis Crew, we rocked the spot
Fe-male grou-pies, they jock a lot
Ugly hoes jockin, don't give em no rap
Sack ?? or not, cause my posse's strapped
Don't deny us, the flyest guys in town
Punks, try us, you get beat down
The 40 Ounce Crew and Afros is in charge
We N.F.L. - that's Niggas Fuckin large
And we drive big cars
Our entourage, is rollin hard
We don't play uh-uh no way
Groove to the sound of Jam Master Jay
Ah let's go now..
Ya don't stop..
You keep on and..
Rock the house!
You might also like
So slam for the jam, fast, if ya can
Damn I never ran, cause man I am
Gonna keep the beat complete (complete)
Compete defeat (defeat), and serve suckers a seat!
And now you're lazy crazy, a daisy don't faze me
Here's my nine now raise me
Another vic to stick and lick so quick
You got your ass kicked now get off my dick
Pull up to the bumper baby
And kiss my motherfuckin ass!

As we come, together, forever, whenever
The clever get better (better) so get yourself together

And listen to the rhymes I'm about to say

And groove to the sound of Jam Master Jay
Ah let's go now..
Ya don't stop..
You keep on and..
Rock the house!
Now I kick a lyric live, rip rockin rhymes
A line on time, a fine design
All the girls, look my way
All on mines and they always say
"D.M.C. - you look so cute
In your Carhart suits, and Adidas boots"
I'm not souped, I just troop
Loop the loop, for my crew
I hold the fort, fly rhymes I sport
I fought then brought you the knowledge you sought
So listen good, and listen well
Cause I +Raise Hell+ with the stories I tell
Which I say and play, day by day
When I groove to the sounds of Jam Master Jay
So let's go now..
Ya don't stop..
You keep on and..
Rock the house!
And aiyyo!  I just wanna shout out to my home-BRO, from Tokyo!
And check this out, if you're a critic, you can get the DIDDICK
Just because I pop a lot of SHITTIT
All the way, to L.A
And to my homeboys, Ladi Dadi
I just wanna know, why you rock it so hard
And to the Hollis Crew, the 40 Ounce Crew
And the Afros too, just wanna let you know
This is what we love, TO DO!
(Yeahhhh babyee) AUGGGH!Embed
