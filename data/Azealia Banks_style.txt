First lady on the floor, move sexy in Dior
As we, go on and on and on from the dusk till the dawn
Fully vampin' on the song, it’s a ball not a prom
Have a pour at the bar, at the promenade- yo shorty lookin' gorge
The allure of a star
They applaud and in awe...
The chips in her palm, what’s a pigeon to a swan?
A queen to a pawn?
Luxury is on looking to explore, the Bambi on the lawn
Red carpet to the car, in a garment from the gods
I drips and Bogart - you're a target from the start
Assassinate the look - murdering the gown
Fashion-Killa, the body dipped in brown
Get the picture, nobody fit the crown
She’s the winner, (in) the lobby with a smile!
Jet black weave bout the length of a mile
Jet black feet while I clever craft styles
Miss I’ll flip this and dip-dip twaow!
Miss, I been this, you must’ve missed out
Dope when dressed up, ya boy strung out...
His Girl is pressed, now behave, calm down
Sip on old grapes and be laid lounge...
Baby you look late, come peep my now
Giving them good taste, the great’s don’t have

Shimmy it on stage, i’m giving them good face...
Somebody on her page, somebody is amazed...

I'm so cold, I'm dripping icicles
I go and take your man, that nigga might miss you
Spent his whole commission on my neck and ear
To stand around me need to have your winter gear
Pay me coats and Benzes, it's that berg-ice
That's why I do not feel these bitches, frostbite
Grown money, ever since a youngin' made my own money
You broke, honey, and they call me Banks 'cause I can loan money
Colder than December, my diamonds on Anna Wintour
So that's fly ice in my life
I don't see no limits so I strive and I shine twice
I ride around and get it, just listen for a minute
That was only one thought, let me finish
Competition, I'ma beat 'em so relentless
I'ma be legendary when I end this
They rise when I arrive in this
"All hail the Supreme Ice Princess"
Tell the carriage, hurry up and come and get me
Tell the haters run along, you can miss me

That's the way that our love can grow
(Can grow, can grow, can grow, can grow)

Carolina H fits, hottest bitch from the block
Used to puff Phillies 'n' Duchies 'n' Stuff Nicks
Now I light doobies, the cutie from five fifth
Life like a movie, she typing her own script
What's this? Young sis
Made it from the cement, start pushing her own bricks
Put on for her city, I pop in Metropolis
Hold this, chocolate and focused
Know this, vocal and chosen
Opponents, leave 'em dead in they own crypt (Ha)
Murder she wrote, she prefer it in cursive
The purse sick, the verse is perversive
They worship, making the words skip
Superb witch in demand, she perfect
Understand the plan, the blueprint
Hundred grand in the hand, it's on grip, nigga

That's the way that our love can grow
Make the play and then not too slow
Gimme a chance, I will have to make you dance
Make a play upon the dance floor
I'll be a-waiting there until knock the door

You deep in the rear while I'm knocking it forward
Impressing the pair, but three get 'em a charm

If you gimme a, gimme a, I'ma give you a lot
Many Benji's from Penny's bet you can't hustle a fox

Phony homies and any and who happen to plot?

While you cream of the crop

Make the play and then not too slow
Gimme a chance, I will have to make you dance
Make a play upon the dance floor

Llévate el dinero y ese bandolero
Nada me hace falta y yo a él no lo quiero
Toda mi vida ha cambiado, estoy mejor cada día
Lamento informarte, no funcionó la brujería
Mira como baila la nena morena
Mira como baila, sin llanto ni pena
Mira como baila la nena morena
Mira como baila, sin llanto ni pena
Libre independiente, me dice la gente
Rebelde y caprichosa, pero eso es otra cosa
Yo mucho pa' ti, tu muy poco pa' mí
Ahora más que nunca me siento feliz
Actitud positiva, la regla de mi vida
Si no me conviene hacia mí no viene
En control me quedé, estoy a cargo de todo

Dome fucking up a nigga home, call a bitch S.W.A.T

Cause she wanna kiss, nah
I tell her she could lick this box
Cause I ain’t really with that dick-swap
Even if you switch socks
Bitch is fishier than Chip Shop
And he was praying that her shit pop
Every time I say deeper, I get it warmer than a space heater
No ordinary taste either, it's that candy
He was tryna lick it off the seam of my panties
I was tryna kick him out, but he was like can he-
Eat a little dinner, want to sit with my family

A passion for life, fantastic
Nest egg in a gold basket, next to go
I'ma hug and kiss the good life, X n' O
Hey, feel better than X and Blow
Get high from my line, turn text to notes
Get these niggas gassed up like Texaco
Watch your bitch pop like Pepsi Co
Ever since I was an embryo, had magic flow
Young dynamo, young killa
Young illa with the finer flow
Young rapido, never will, never half a hoe
Came to celebrate and have a toast
Young sis is living fancy, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Close to the moon, boy me and you
Oh, so close to the moon
If that’s okay with you, close to the moon, and
I wanna take you so close

Fast forward, lived half your life
No wrong ‘cause the cash was right
Have a bitch blink twice like hazard light
More the great way, pass suffice
Non-believers all asinine
Bring the fever like fahrenheit
Round the world like satellite
Baby girl got, baby girl got options, right?
PJ to the PH, pass the light
Far from the passive type, I excite your life
And that’s it, better than your average
Status: captain, mothership to the bliss, imagine
Anything you want you could have it
Trip-trip-trippy on the magic
Do you really really want the access
Of the phoenix fire and ashes?
Coin and the cash in, no quote and no ration
Numbers on the masses, wonders of the na-tion
Anything you want is established
Anything you want you can have it

Life is a series of choices
What you eat, how you look
Whether you do drugs or not
See, only you can decide because the only person responsible is you
And if you make the right choice, there’s nothing you can’t accomplish
If you make a wrong choice, all of the other decisions are made for you

Close to the moon, boy me and you
Oh, so close to the moon
If that’s okay with you, close to the moon, and
I wanna take you so close
Fantasea
I’ll be your fantasea, I’ll be your fantasea

Bambi, belle of the ball
Banjee, better than them all
Never been a flaw
Pretty kitty manicure the claws, silly
Never been a draw
When I purr bet he wanna paw
Cause a stir when she on the floor
Giving it her all
Champagne always on the pour
Some happy, others can applaud
Bum bitches aggy, but of course
Mermaid coming on the shore
Take the prince crown and the coin
Shut it down then a bitch is gone
'Nother round of Dom Pérignon
Downtown vampin' to the song
Tiara on my head when it's worn
Style get the critics and amor
Physically shawty is the bomb
Whether blue weave or the blonde
Harlem or Milan
Banks break the bank and the bonds

See, I used to think I was fierce
’Cause I was in all the houses
I won trophies
I used to munch trade for dollars too
But see I’m fiercer now
’Cause I got a job, I got an education
And I got somebody waiting at home for me, goddammit
Now one queen asked me the other day, was it?
She told me, "Miss Thing, you think you’re fierce?"
I said, "Of course"
She said, "All queens think they're fierce"
I said, "Miss Thing, all queens ain't me!"

Witness the baddest bitch alive
Reporting from the belly of the night
Gorgeous, plus the world is mine
A girl with a twirl and a rhyme
Diamonds and a pearl on the shine
Welcome to her house in the sky (House in the sky)

The house, the house
Work me, the house

Back at it again
My only bad habit's, my addiction to win
She only mad, I did it better than her friends
You better have cheddar to attend
Wang gown with leather on the trim
Get together with the slim
Mermaid who came on the swim
Wave to the gents
Do my dips and the spin
Turn tricks for the fucking ends?
You turned dick for the fucking gem?
You a bum bitch to the end
Come again, come again?
You running with the wrong sip, rum to the gin?
Bambi work it out like felons in the gym
Hey fella, f-fella I'm better than a ten
Eleven in the denim, 'bout twelve in her skin
Young mademoiselle, the devil wears Prada
I'm giving them hell, you bitches getting nada

Went to France and Ibiza, hundred grand for the trip

Tonight's the night, the mood is right
Anything I choose he buys
I observe by his shoes and ties
He prefer the exclusive kind
Converse over blues and wine
Tonight's the night, the jewels is bright
Any way I move he likes
He is searching for cutie pie
He could scoop and sign
Keep that blue dress down to my Louboutins
Keep my calm, keep my cool
Heard you got a girlfriend but she's a deuce
Wanna see the little Bambi in the nude
Chocolate candy, liquorice too
Wanna book a ticket, get physical soon
Head of the class, but I got principles too
Arching my back give him a view
He wanna taste the cinnamon too
Sex is a race, I'm winning it too
I'm a rude bitch but I like gentlemen
Who spend dividends, benjis, residuals too
When he put it in, not remembering you
Who's his girlfriend, never a clue, what? (what?)

Girl if it's alright, Hello?

Let's get it on, Yeah
