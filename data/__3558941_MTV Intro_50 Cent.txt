Whoo Kid

Hi I'm Gideon Yego with MTV news
Four weeks strong at number one and The Eminem Show is still outperforming almost every other record released this year
One shady fellow not included on the DVD but who we're sure to see alot of soon
Is the newest soldier of Eminem and Dr. Dre's Shady/Aftermath army, 50 Cent
50 Cent is a highly touted acid tounged Queens, rapper
A staple on New York City's mixtape circuit
He's already in the studio working on his upcoming album with tracks
produced by Dr. Dre, Sha Money, and Eminem himself
Get psyched
That is the news for now
