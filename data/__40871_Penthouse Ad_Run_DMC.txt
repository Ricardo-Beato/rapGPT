Run-D.M.C., the Kings of Queens
And we in this month's Penthouse, Magazine
You can find out things that you never knew
About Run-D.M.C. in the April issue

Like, I was a kid, this is what I did
I grabbed a Penthouse, and then I hid
I peeked at the pictures, but never knew

There are a lot of def articles to read, too

You'll find out in our interview
About what is a lie, and what is true
So now I read it, instead of just look it
You know you'll need it, to know what's cookin
So grab your April Penthouse, and put it in your hands

It's available now at your favorite newsstand, RRRR-AHH!

Also, in the April issue of Penthouse
A special edition of Four Magazine, absolutely free!You might also likeEmbed
