3 ContributorsThe Ride Lyrics
Late night on the block, I was slangin' the rock
Had the hammer on cock if you tried taking my stock
It only takes one pop if you want it to stop
If some bodies gotta drop, I'd rather not
I'm living numb to emotion, just coastin' like I'm in slow motion
You ain't got a notion of what it is to be in the ocean
Red and blue rags flying like flags and held high
CRASH coming at you from every side and some die
A mother cries, a father is gone, revenge is on the rise
See it through my eyes, another's demise
It's like you're paralyzed, frozen in time, stuck in the mind
Walking a path and blind, doing nothing for mankind

"Some people tell me that I need help"
"Some— some— some— some— some— some—, some people tell me that I need help"
"Some— some— some— some— some—, some people tell me that I need help"
"Some— some— some— some— some— some— some— some— some pe—"
"Some people tell me that I need help"

If I could rewind the hands, I don't think I could change
Anger and depression, they had me enflamed
I was the cause of pain of others and missing my brothers
Couldn't bring 'em back as bad as I felt for their mothers
Little E, Bird and Stoffer are gone
But I could see their faces as I keep pushing along
So many years gone by, I could never deny
The many tears from my eyes when my homies had died
Yeah, I wish they were alive and a part of the vibe
But I could feel their presence here as they witness the ride
I'm laying back daydreaming and reminiscing with plenty visions
Thinking 'bout the many missions, questioning many decisions

"Bring it down" what they tell me when I'm in the venue (Yeah)
So let me set the table, ain't no need to see the menu (Nah)
I put it on a silver platter, homie, what's the matter?
Give you slapper after slapper, fuck a toe-tapper (Fuck that)
Smoking out the building, yeah, you got the feeling
Came a long way from gangbangin' to rhyme-killing
Time heals wounds, you're needing it soon (Come on)
'Cause knowledge could be found in the Temple of Boom
Let in settle in better than anything that's ever been
Open up the doors and they let you in, you gettin' in
Elevation comes with the sound of the drums
We all connected no matter where you're hearing it from
