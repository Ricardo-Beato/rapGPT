14 ContributorsFalling on the Floor Lyrics
Pop tags, fuck hoes, rock shows
Dodgin' hoes and I'm dodgin' narcos
I'm in your city and I've got my pole
It's a 50 bitch, call 5-0
Pint of the drink, got me movin' slow
All this fuckin' dope, all this fuckin' smoke
I think that I'm Kobe how I'm ballin' on a hoe
Hit the court, bitches fallin' on the floor

Slam dunk, layup, pull up, three point, what up
Boy, you're such a woulda coulda shoulda
Pull up on you in a what the uh uh
Rollin' up a egg roll, do you want some?
Run down on you, time to make you fumble
Let off ten shots and I made you stumble
Got that Ric Flair, do you want to rumble?
I am Tarzan made it outta jungle
Now I'm feet up countin' stupid paychecks
If you got a problem, nigga, say that
Sharper than an axe, cleaner than AJAX
Be worried about how many shots this K got

Pop tags, fuck hoes, rock shows
Dodgin' hoes and I'm dodgin' narcos
I'm in your city and I've got my pole
It's a 50 bitch, call 5-0
Pint of the drink, got me movin' slow
All this fuckin' dope, all this fuckin' smoke
I think that I'm Kobe how I'm ballin' on a hoe
Hit the court, bitches fallin' on the floor

Hey bitch, what's your name?
Hit the party, yeah, the gang's here
We finna leave, these niggas lame here
I'm finna hop up in a reindeer
I'm finna pick up a lil' slut hoe
I don't really wanna fuck though
I kill you with my own hands
Fo'nem would want me to bust though
Bitch, I'm still with that street shit
Clip longer than a fuckin' selfie stick
Be in your grass, yeah, I'm still on that creep shit
I'll hop out in your hood and take a pee bitch
Let's get it, catch up

Pop tags, fuck hoes, rock shows
Dodgin' hoes and I'm dodgin' narcos
I'm in your city and I've got my pole
It's a 50 bitch, call 5-0
Pint of the drink, got me movin' slow
All this fuckin' dope, all this fuckin' smoke
I think that I'm Kobe how I'm ballin' on a hoe
Hit the court, bitches fallin' on the floor1Embed
