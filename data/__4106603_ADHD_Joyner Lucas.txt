It kinda feels like, I'm dyin’ on the inside
It kinda feels like, I been tryna get by

And I been this way since day one
I don't need no medication
No, I don't need no drugs
Or maybe I’m different, and maybe my ADHD got me trippin'
And maybe I'm just everything that you missin', yeah

I feel like I'm dying inside
Why do I seem crazy?
Someone save me (Save me)
You can't blame me (Blame me)
It's my ADHD, yeah

My mind racin', I been paranoid
Overthinkin’, maybe that’s a void (Woo, woo)
Don't cut me off like I don’t have a voice
I think I was born different, I ain't really have a choice, yeah (Yeah)
Class in session, you a hour late (Hour late)
Don't play with me, today is not the day (Oh yeah)
Pay attention, I am not deranged
I could tell you what I'm thinkin’, I just don't know how to say it
Maybe I get on your nerves, I mean what I say (Oh yeah)
I been a man of my words, eon wide awake (Yeah, yeah)
Maybe a lil' disturbed, but that's just me
You don't bleed the blood I bleed
I wear my heart on my sleeve, nigga

And I been this way since day one (And I been this way since day one)

Or maybe I'm different, and maybe my ADHD got me trippin'
And maybe I'm just everything that you missin', yeah

I feel like I'm dying inside
Why do I seem crazy?
Someone save me (Save me)
You can't blame me (Blame me)
It's my ADHD, yeah

It kinda feels like, I'm dying on the inside

Yipee-yipee-yih-yoh-yipee-yah-yah
Staring at the fire, kumbaya
I'ma take you higher, take you higher
I'ma take you higher, take you higher
Too many things on my head (Yeah, yeah), what am I thinkin'?
How come I can't go sleep in my bed? (Oh, yeah)
I hear them talking, everyone stranger
They leave me for dead (Oh, yeah)
'Cause they want me gone (Yeah)
This that shit I be on (Yeah)
Ain't no one to lean on (Yeah)
