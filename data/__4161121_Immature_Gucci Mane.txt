The Commission
I'm coast to coast, propose a toast, brag and boast to this
We cookin' up, too turn't up, and I'm too rich to th-
Coast, propose a toast, brag and boast to this
We cookin' up, too turn't up, and I'm too rich
Coast, propose a toast, brag and boast to this
We cookin' up, too turn't up, and I'm too rich to this

I make a hit, smoke a blunt, and then I take a shit
Shark alert, that chick a shark, she wanna bite my dick
I got a stripe down a tiger, I'm a Falcons fan
Bought a diamond helmet just to rep the land (Bling, blaw)
If you ain't four fold then you just might not understand (Burr!)
East Atlanta ridin' with me all the way to Japan
And the way I ball out I should be named Durant
I gotta down then everybody on the Birds and Saints
Don't try to stop me, 'cause Gucci all what you ain't
I got a new slogan, this year is money in the bank (It's Gucci!)

I got money, I got money in my pocket
I got money, cash money in my pocket
Fuck a wallet, young nigga, no wallet
Four pocket, totin' guala, whole jockey, Gucci

Ride with me, no amateur
Don't fuck with him, he's immature
My rims are based, his immature
His price too high, mine's immature

Why you fuck with him, you know he a hater
Always on my feet like a motherfuckin' gator
Engine in my car like a motherfuckin' tiger
Try me on the highway, my  (Holiday season) look like a lion
I am not trying, I can take you out, but baby, I am not buying
Psych, you can get it how you live it
But just as fast as you can get it I hope you can give it
European auto, press a button, auto start
Cut that motherfucker up, they ain't ever heard of 
I don't layaway I'll pay today
That boy you fuckin' with immature, he can't be laid
Ferrari, Jag, kit matchin' the ratchet, that's black on black
Kush, pass it, its smokin' like acid, I fuck with that
New York in my heart, A-Town on my fitted hat
Baby come and ride with me I'll show you where my city at

Ride with me, no amateur
Don't fuck with him, he's immature
My rims are based, his immature
His price too high, mine's immature
