19 ContributorsShit Wouldn’t Happen Lyrics
Legend, legend, legend
It's Gucci, GuWop
A to the bay you know
East Atlanta

They tried to send your boy to rehab I didn't listen
First day out of rehab sent me to prison
Left the hospital man these crackers be trippin'
They said my diamonds was too crazy and I should be committed
If you ain't throw her out the truck why the fuck you plead guilty
Cause I'm the boy that cried wolf so they gone think that I did it
I took them 3 months to the chin then got back to the business
First day out of jail man I bought me a bentley
Me and Keyshia, smoking keisha cuz I’m handsome, she pretty
I got Ka'Oir lipstick all over me but stay out my business
R Kelly 12 Play home making love to a milli
Let’s make a tape, R Kelly-rated, yellow diamonds I'm pissin'

Shout out to 40, water, molly water, 3 different bitches
When you may Sprinkle Me Man, I swear to God I was pimpin'
When Jeezy first met me, man I swear to God I was trappin'
If you ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
That shit would not happen
That shit would not happen
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
When Jeezy first met me, man I swear to God I was trapping
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen

Rapping really ain't my passion, I’m really into trapping
I’m a real street nigga and I don’t know how it happened
I was going back to Cali, yeah I was getting that package
I had a sack when I met Big Cat I didn't need no one to back it
I had a Chevy with the rallys, I'm lien' and I'm flyin'
Had a Regal with them aces and bows and that was '99
Maybe 1997, I'm two years behind, If you a Industry ass nigga
Then you not no friend of mine
Got them young niggas with me
I keep them hittas with me
I don't make a move unless I got some killers with me
Man the tryna come get me, I feel just like 50
I got 50 off in my clip I wish a nigga tempt me

Shout out to 40, water, molly water, 3 different bitches
When you may Sprinkle Me Man, I swear to God I was pimpin'
When Jeezy first met me, man I swear to God I was trappin'
If you ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
That shit would not happen
That shit would not happen
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
When Jeezy first met me, man I swear to God I was trapping
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen2Embed
