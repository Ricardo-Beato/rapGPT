Ayy
I could give a fuck if there's mold on my daily bread
I'm a foe to the fainting goat, I'm at home on the razor's edge
Over the garden wall when your Rover was playing dead
Arm-in-arm with a melancholia, roses and baby's breath
Slow to reveal a signal from deep in the tub of tiger balm
Lighter lit, giant slalom circumvent the psychopomp
Womp womp, circle to the watering hole
Something secluded where the spoon stand up in the joe
Pursue a puff of smoke who never hum or trumpet his post
From unassuming to the poltergeist of multiple homes
Ultimate weapon, slow the pulse to a crawl
"Sir, we had thought he was toast"
That's when the elbow drop from off of the ropes
Family approach him like he sat up in his coffin and spoke
We only talk in awkward hello after awkward hello
Most of my visitors request that I be tied to a chair
I wear the skin of my detractors, maybe try not to stare
Yeah

Every time I look up from the paper
I see animals exhibiting irregular behavior
Even though I know that it's a warning
I am back on my old shit again like any other morning
Every time I peek out from the corner
Birds are flying belly-side-up, fish are walking out the water
Even though it seem legit
I'm right here til the season dip
I ain't seen shit
I ain't seen shit
You might also like
My gang sign's never the same twice
Since offering his service had him nursing a snakebite
We dabble in certainty, I'm allergic to grave vines
You certainly unearthing my aversion to make nice
I'm basically bored stiff
Your sortie go from orbiting warships
To cowering in corners, "Mother, make us some warm milk"
From 'bout it to the mayor of Snoresville in a jiffy
The final form's a portrait of a squirrel stuck in a chimney
I buy a second seat for my extraordinary piss and moan
Feet up while the fleet assemble, keep the devil in the hole
With several yelling, "Sparta," you were yelling, "Marsha, Marsha, Marsha"
Only one'll read the chapter after larva, it's a good one
I'm haunted by Atlantic water bade adieu
Balancing a billion rocks to levitate adjacent to
Escapist at the undisclosed, aloof and newly mummified
You're upsetting the customers, you should see the other guy
Wait

Every time I look up from the paper
I see animals exhibiting irregular behavior
Even though I know that it's a warning
I am back on my old shit again like any other morning
Every time I peek out from the corner
Birds are flying belly-side-up, fish are walking out the water
Even though it seem legit
I'm right here til the season dip
I ain't seen shit
I ain't seen shit
How many vermin get to scurry up the piggy back
And burrow in before it lose the personhood to sticky trap?
Clown car of clingers, I shiver off with the water dogs
Invoking tippy toes along the wall and diving somersaults
That sneak him out the supper club, and muddy up the coveralls
I leave y'all to the scuttlebutt
We get our water from the source directly
Zoltar, predisposed to go dark
Ghost ride, all roll-bar, no lodestar, ayy
Comeuppance like a fire licking at your shoes
When all you want is happy feet in hammocks under azure blue
Have you any marrow past the ballyhoo or no, sir?
No, it's mostly snotty noses pressed to empty zoo enclosures going
"This is stupid, I'm tired, I want a pretzel"
The guppies are getting grumpy, there's nothing like nothing special
I know you were expecting just a Jekyll
The others are in there also, his company doesn't end well
