7 ContributorsLittle Homie (Interlude) Lyrics
When you talk about... New York...
The first thing that comes to your mind is B.I.G., like...
That's the king! I don't think there's no other king out there
Nobody could take that, that, that crown from him right there!
The legacy of B.I.G. is something real deep, man
Go back to a bunch of roots, man, Notorious about family and keepin' it tight
That, that's one of the best that ever did it!
Represented what he represented, did what he did
Youkno'Imean?
He put Brooklyn on his back
He represented the hood, he represented New york City
Respect to my dude, man!
I love you man!
Just like you hear, man
B.I.G. Forever... youkno'Imean?
M.A.F.I.A. Gang!
Rest In Peace B.I.G.!You might also likeEmbed
