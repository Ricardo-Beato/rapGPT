8 ContributorsI Ain’t Drunk Yet Lyrics
Got for-for-for-foreign bitches, they ain’t drunk yet
They all the bom-bom-bom-bomb like Lotus
Got lipstick kisses all on my garment
And you know I want it
Thugger Thugger really want it
Got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
I got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
They saying they ain’t drunk yet, they ain’t saying they drunk yet
We got 1000 bitches telling me they not drunk yet

Stumbling inside the club
Leaning, on me no cup
Leaning, only no book
Hold up, throw up, chug, pour up
 to this, get, get
My wrist, super glisten
S on my chest, I'ma save you tonight
Let this wrist do the rest
Ok, you a good investment
No way, cause I fucked you on the first date
Nat nat nat, nat nat nat (natural)
I’ll kill your ass, get inside your motherfucking back
I'ma wake up, kill you again baby, Iraq
Then make you stand at the mailbox for that fine pack
You might also like
Got for-for-for-foreign bitches, they ain’t drunk yet
They all the bom-bom-bom-bomb like Lotus
Got lipstick kisses all on my garment
And you know I want it
Thugger Thugger really want it
Got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
I got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
They saying they ain’t drunk yet, they ain’t saying they drunk yet
We got 1000 bitches telling me they not drunk yet

They say they not drunk enough to leave with me
So I told her to be with me
Patiently, don’t speed your way
Out of the way, get it
I hope the girl get it
Cause I ain’t really with it
I ain’t buying  tickets
She said no won’t play no police games
I ain’t tryna be bandit
I just fuck her real good, like DMX on Belly
Ay Keisha, senorita
Let’s go to California beaches
Pay fuck food with your Visas
Then get back to  fuck round and round on you
I might jump out of this rubber, acting  on you
Got for-for-for-foreign bitches, they ain’t drunk yet
They all the bom-bom-bom-bomb like Lotus
Got lipstick kisses all on my garment
And you know I want it
Thugger Thugger really want it
Got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
I got them bad bitches telling me they not drunk yet
They saying they ain’t drunk yet, they ain’t saying they drunk yet
We got 1000 bitches telling me they not drunk yet3Embed
