21 ContributorsWeak Spot Lyrics
If only we can lay our hands on that vixen Yu Shin Hua
Then all our problems will be over...
Yu Shin Hua!

You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

The quintessence, father of the hip hop renaissance
My slang been around before baton and Benetton
I've been on, fingerprint, two finger tips
So when I squeeze the rubber grip, release the clip, then leave the clip
C-Cypher Pigs can't identify it
The true and living God, son, we exemplify it
The most complicated 'formance of life, we simplify it
Bzzz, don't knock it til you try it
Flying dagger, make 'em stagger, then I take a swagger
Ice cold Jägermeister, take a drag of
Humboldt County kush, fly like the Nike swoosh
Bruce Almighty got more problems than Spidey, look
Old Brooklyn, Putnam Avenue crook, I've been tooken
All around the world, rooked it then, drive back in Brooklyn
Good looking, son, yo, don, bring the hook in
You can never find Zig weak spot, stop looking
You might also like
You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

From the continents to Croatia, I'll flame a lamester
With the new slang, much more to show ya
These rocks change, Glock fully, hot pellets
Have me running through the hall, it's on, like you being chased by the relic
Can't nothing harm me, yo, I move through any project
With logic, few semi's, hide in the cockpit
Scream out, Shallah and I'ma tap in, harder than Tinactin
Don't try to play the fella, I'll blacked in
Moving all miraculous, the slap smiths of the rap game
Say my name backwards, you'll get back changed
Black man, black hooded, moving through the city
Like you Batman, still you so pussy, like Catwoman
Don't bother the Legion, more squeezing, more reason
To light a new block up, cause me to cement shit
Powerful block shoppers and all niggas getting that guac
Dare you to try to find my weak spot

You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
I stay on the sixty-four squares, while controlling the center
Trading space for material, the time zone I enter
It's calculated by movement, from pushed pieces
Advances in development, once the pawn reaches
The 8th ranked, now heavily armed with a tank
My opponent's base is threatened, soldiers cut with shanks
Moved all my small pieces, emcees are driven back
Unable to avoid capture from the attack
Such movement, is naturally quite unsound
Men is badly placed upon dangerous grounds
Loosening their position, before they were strongly posted
Before the double rooks had approached it
They must've been quick to ignore the principles
Rock a V and an effective God is invincible
A strategic plan, just the way I envisioned it
Many fallen soldiers in complete imprisonment
You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

I tell you, right, right, right, in ya muthafuckin' face
Muthafucka, you know, well, you know muthafuckin' well
When…we don't play that shit, or, I don't play that shit
That's just Wu-Tang. You know, I'm the nigga
That...that, give it to ya raw
When I said "First things first, man, you fuckin' with the worst
I be stickin' pins ya head, like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu"2Embed
