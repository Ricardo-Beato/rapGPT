26 ContributorsLemon Head Lyrics
(K. Swisha)

Whole time I knew niggas been fake
Two Chanel bags for my sidepiece
I feel like I'm Gandhi, but that besides me
Snakes on his head, I ain't talkin' Don C
Gave my bitch a hundred racks, told her not to mind me
Me and Draft in that Lam', Concrete's first signee
I'll plead the Fifth if them coppers try me
I'm slime, I'm swift, I'm too damn sneaky
I'm a young hot boy, gold teeth like B.G.
Fuck what them niggas sayin', I know they need me
Backyard too much land, might build a teepee
Tripod hold a stick, pierce you like a CD
My bitch can't get my phone, she know not to ask me
Only Brandon Mitchell, know where the cash be
That's my blooda for life, feel like mama had him
Someone play with her wrong, trust me, I'ma bag him
Mouth platinum, wrist random

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lemon-head shawty give me mouth and it's so exquisite
Fuck her one time, she want her whip pimped, I'm not Xzibit
Talkin' 'bout she want a Birkin, now she talkin' gibberish
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Apple-head bitch give me dome, it's ten out of ten
Think that I won't fuck on her friends, bitch, go think again
Concrete boy, been outside, bet she let me in
You might also like
Shouldn't have to say this shit, but who we better than?
Told my bitch to go eat Mediterranean
Finna walk over this beat like a pedestrian (Pedestrian)
I just bought a brand-new whip, it is obsidian
This bitch wanna fuck, I just want mouth, so she upset again
Will I drive the Benz or the Lam'? Well, that depends
Double down on my numbers, I need all my ends
Pussy play with me wrong, go up in his chin
Call my young nigga Beyblade, he can't wait to spin (Spin)
I was seventeen years old tryna crack a BIN (Yes)
His lil' bitch a lil older, she like juice and gin (Oh, yes)
I like juice and Sprite (Mhm), so I call her twin

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lemon-head shawty give me mouth and it's so exquisite
Fuck her one time, she want her whip pimped, I'm not Xzibit
Talkin' 'bout she want a Birkin, now she talkin' gibberish
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Apple-head bitch give me dome, it's ten out of ten
Think that I won't fuck on her friends, bitch, go think again
Concrete boy, been outside, bet she let me in

Oh my, oh wow
Bitch think that I won't fuck on all her friends
Told that stupid ho think again1Embed
