"WHOO KID"

I'm Dick Shipman with a hood news brief
Lil' Kim is free
After serv..

After all, comput..

Right now behind me, is the elephant's ball sack
They're gargantu..

Running this country..
..

Live at the spot now is our prison correspondent Heywould Yablowme
Heywould, take it away

Thanks Dick
We're standing here in front of the federal detention centre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Where Brooklyn's own, Lil' Kim is scheduled to be released from incarceration
As you can hear behind me, her loyal fans are anxiously awaiting her release
And, needless to say, they are hyped
Hold, on Dick
She's coming, right now
