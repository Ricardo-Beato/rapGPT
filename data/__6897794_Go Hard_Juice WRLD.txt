I was sittin' in the crib with a hand full of racks and a heart full of pain
Yeah, funny thing is, I really did think all hoes were the same
Then I saw your face and I heard your name, name
Had to make you my bae, put that on the gang, gang
Thе groupie hoes don't phase mе, tryna give out that lame brain
It don't amaze me, your heart, I contain-tain
Take her to safety (Yeah)
You're my getaway
So you can't get away (Ayy)
