17 ContributorsBusiness Mind Lyrics
While rubbing elbows in the hills of high society
I look back on my life and realized the hood lied to me
Built the bullshit sense of pride inside of me
On a rise to fly car hating on varieties

Look, I don’t need no bitch niggas surrounding me
Get caught, you better stick to the codes that you provided, b
If you don't plead the 5th you get your whole shit split
So called kingpins get real money to snitch

I know it sound hard to believe this bullshit
But sometimes you need money to see who you cool with
See niggas hustle hard and cop them a few whips
They end up popping niggas they used to be cool with

I’m a street entrepreneur, condo, connoisseur
Furs, suede, my car’s the core
Nigga I been a boss I employed my boys
And show em a bunch of shit they never seen before

I got a business mind
That block is mine, that brick and them Glocks is mine
I got a business mind
That drop is mine, these knots and this watch is mine
I got a business mind
You can’t stop my shine
A nigga got a World Guiness book grind
I got a business mind
And I pop my 9, fuck around find out in time
You might also like
I got a short fuse so if by some chance I get annoyed
The button gets pressed and your life gets destroyed
Got niggas that'll do the shit just cause they bored
Man I ain’t even gotta tell niggas what for

You think you cool but I swat your type of fly
Yeah you crossed your T's but you forgot your I's
That’s why I out-charisma ya, I could out-business ya
Intimidate ya with success, I catch the interest of

Corporate America gangstas we got em tearing up
We only want the money, no reason to be scared of us
We feel the life that we live is unfair to us
America’s an oven, you got to break bread for us

Go hard or die soft is what was said to us
So if it’s gunplay you gon get shot instead of us
Crackers be thinking they one step ahead of us
I say shit like that to let em know that I’m aware of it

We keep accountants to count, I got lawyers to share, kid
Babes to clean up my mess, go make the bed bitch
They said death or jail is what’s ahead of us
So when they ask me what I thought, all I could say is I'm a
Street entrepreneur, condo, connoisseur
Fur or suede, my car’s the core
Nigga I’ve been a boss I employed my boys
Matter fact, I don't even wanna chat no more
