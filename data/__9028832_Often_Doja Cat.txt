Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You must do this often
You must do this often
You must do this often
You must do this oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby, it's so tellin'
What you can do
It's a simple understandin'
Between me and you
Oh, because

'Cause when you run your tongue up my thigh
I can't help but wonder, hmm, why
You got so much more up yo' sleeve
You wanna make sure I don't leave
I won't and what is this now?
You must make your daddy so proud
Way you bump and grindin' on me
You got more than somethin' I need
You might also like
You must do this often (Practice on me or perform)
You must do this often (Because I really want more)
You must do this often (Makin' my way to your door)
You must do this oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I just wanna watch us again
And over again
Superstar, professional
You already read the room
I wanna do intervals
Lеt that soak in

'Cause when you run your tongue up my thigh
I can't hеlp but wonder, hmm, why
You got so much more up yo' sleeve
You wanna make sure I don't leave
I won't and what is this now?
You must make your daddy so proud
Way you bump and grindin' on me
You got more than somethin' I need

Oh
Oh, oh
Oh, mm
Oh, oh, oh, baby, mm1Embed
