Mi no compadre (Mi no compadre, mi no compadre)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh

My seats are some reptiles (My seats are some reptiles)
You niggas some reptiles (You niggas some reptiles)
I come with a lot of power (I come with a lot of power)
I come with that Aquafina (I come with that Aquafina)
It hang off my neck and my earrings, fingers
I came with that check and I came exquisite
I went and spent a check on my transportation
We came from the section that aid in greatness
See what I did when I came through faded (See what I did)
All of these niggas, they gang related
Drug related got me walkin', pacin'
Peekin' out the window like I'm Khujo
Seen some real niggas get indicted
Seen a pussy nigga get some recognition
Twenty racks inside a nigga britches
Twenty bricks'll have a nigga twitchin'
They say you wanna conquer all them Audemars'
Diamond VVS is Niagara Falls
Dranks is drankin', fall asleep in the boat
Keep the stanky stank, nigga right in my coat
Got a bracelet wrapped around my wrist
Like to see my shit light up and glisten
Like to see some fish come back a brick
Put some bread on your head, get ya hit
You might also like
Fuck around, think it's a game (Fuck around, think it's a game)
Fuck around, get on that drank (Fuck around, get on that drank)
Fuck around with all the fuck around (Fuck around with all the—)
You fuck around, get murked today (You fuck around, get murked today)
Fuck around, get work today (Fuck around, get work today)
Fuck around with all the fuck around (Fuck around with all the—)
Fuck around, you gon' get paid (Fuck around, you gon' get paid)
Fuck around, we goin' crazy (Fuck around, we goin' crazy)

Mi no compadre (Mi no compadre)
Mi no compadre (Mi no compadre)
Mi no compadre (Mi no compadre)
Mi no compadre (Mi no compadre)
Mi no compadre (Mi no compadre)
Mi no compadre (Mi no compadre)
Mi no compadre (Mi no compadre)
Mi no, mi no compadre

I'm not excited
We can't be reunited
Fuck it, I'm not being modest
Had a young nigga right up on Missoni
My jewelry hang on my wrist like I'm retarded
I came with the gang and they lightweight retarded
Niggas be like that bitch must been imported
Niggas shoot birds at the judge in the court
Forty chains swangin', Mardi Gras
For forty bands a nigga daddy die
Automatic, nigga air you out
I was abandoned there but never more
Greedy nigga with a attitude
I been rackin' in mechanicals
I've been on another altitude
All the shit gon' end in casualties
I've been gettin' lot of fettuccine ('Cine)
I just went and bought a nigga trap (Trap)
They just wanna see a nigga miserable (Miserable)
Pull the Desi on 'em, leave him critical (Woo)
Take the codeine and love it baby (Baby)
Everyday a celebration (Yeah)
The struggle got me dedicated (Yeah)
This money got me levitatin' (Money)
Fuck around, think it's a game (Fuck around, think it's a game)
Fuck around, get on that drank (Fuck around, get on that drank)
Fuck around with all the fuck around (Fuck around with all the—)
You fuck around, get murked today (You fuck around, get murked today)
Fuck around, get work today (Fuck around, get work today)
Fuck around with all the fuck around (Fuck around with all the—)
Fuck around, you gon' get paid (Fuck around, you gon' get paid)
Fuck around, we goin' crazy (Fuck around, we goin' crazy)
