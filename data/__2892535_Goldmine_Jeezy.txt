17 ContributorsGoldmine Lyrics
Check, check I got 'em
Pull the reverb up, turn me up just a little bit, yeah

Partied last night that shit was too crazy
We don't fuck with them, them niggas fugazy
Hurt them haters last night, they need pain pills
We was in that bitch all like Lil Wayne grill, uh
He said he loves his hood cause it's a gold mine
He said he loves his block cause it's a gold mine
He throwing up his hood cause it's a gold mine
He said he'll never leave and it's a gold mine, uh

Make that chopper Milly Rock back on this gangster shit
Whoever don't like it, they can suck a gangster dick
If she a real bitch then she gon' keep it lowkey
I don't even got to knock, I got a door key, uh
Any given night we in a Aroma ho
Bout to drink myself into a coma ho
Don't worry about me cause I got a driver
And if he drive us in the river then I got divers
Bitches so fly they need a runway
My nigga tatted up, he with the gunplay
Y’all do it for the ‘Gram, we did it with them grams
Told y'all niggas watch the throne, so I'm going HAM
Bout to put the game in a chokehold
Jizzle bought the 'Rari and the dope ho
The bitches with me looking better than some pretty diamonds
Got her dancing at my crib like it's the King of Diamonds, yeah
You might also like
Partied last night that shit was too crazy
We don't fuck with them, them niggas fugazy
Hurt them haters last night, they need pain pills
We was in that bitch all like Lil Wayne grill, uh
He said he loves his hood cause it's a gold mine
He said he loves his block cause it's a gold mine
He throwing up his hood cause it's a gold mine
He said he'll never leave and it's a gold mine, uh

Spot got cameras on the wall just like they Mona Lisa's
10, 11, chains like you been doing features
Tryna tell me 1 on 1 that's what you're bout
Tryna tell me nigga that I ain't your (?)
Mr. Park the 'Rari and the dope hoes
Bout to put the game in a chokehold
They ain't come up on him in his G5
Straight from Finger Lickin' straight to G Fly
You say you bust a move? Bust a move then
Saw the mansion once and then I moved in
Start investigating then I moved out
Had to put the merchandise on a new route
Keyshia Cole mama nigga man down
If I die tonight my funeral at the compound
Another sold out event thats word to AG
And if you thought that I was over then you crazy
Partied last night that shit was too crazy
We don't fuck with them, them niggas fugazy
Hurt them haters last night, they need pain pills
We was in that bitch all like Lil Wayne grill, uh
He said he loves his hood cause it's a gold mine
He said he loves his block cause it's a gold mine
He throwing up his hood cause it's a gold mine
He said he'll never leave and it's a gold mine, uh4Embed
