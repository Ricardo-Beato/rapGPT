I say my prayers on private planes
I thank God for the drip before he dried the drain
I think twice about the pilot with my hybrid brain
It's like I super-see survival, I'm alive and well
Give to the streets so I can hear them for spider fell
When they were tearin' down my projects like the idol wealth
And I was out here feelin' lower than the height of Hell
I grab the book, and book the trip, I had to look at God
I mean the verse is pretty decent, but the hook is hard

Skim through, skim my need
(Just try to find my way back, just try to get my way)
Skim through, skim my need
(Just try to get my way back closer to the truth)

Read all the instructions for the brand new construction
The map to the function is just a path to destruction
Exercise your right to be a dyin' breed, and re-reader
All the free thinkers must be readers or retweeters
Our last name heroes and brief leaders were more than just repeaters
All these so-called see so-ers will need reaper
Everyday we tryin' not to be what we've been through
Look at every page, promise never to skim through
You might also like
Skim through (Skim my need), skim my need
(Just try to find my way back, just try to get my way)
Skim through (Skim my need), skim my need (Skim through)
(Just try to get my way back closer to the truth)
(Skim my need)

(Skim through, skim my need)
Amen, amen
Let it shine
Amen, amen
Amen, amenEmbed
