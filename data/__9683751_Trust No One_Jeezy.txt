7 ContributorsTrust No One Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah
Friday night I’m on poplar street posted on the
Block
Hustlin’ on an empty stomach,  in my
Pocket, got a knot
Quarter in the bushes, eight ball in my
Socks
First I heard a boom, then I heard a pop
That's how niggas get killed, nigga, I ain't
Trustin' no one
36 for 24, them 9's is for the 41
And if a nigga want a split, I slice it like
The Shogun
Nigga bought a O, I front an O and now
He owe one
Marcus Clemons told me, "Don't take no
Shit from no one"
Now I'm on my way to middle school
And I forgot my ruler
He was arguin' with a junkie, two shots
In the medulla
Now I'm gettin' off the school bus, my
Homie just got murdered
And I just wanna go to Dairy Queen and
Get a burger
I know what you thinkin', my heart
Colder than a blizzard
And now I'm makin' rocks disappear just
Like a wizard
That's when I dropped that box green
Chevy, call it lizard
Now I'm in the mac with my homegirl
Let's call her Peaches
Them bricks was for the 28, back then I
Called em' features
Now she vouchin' for her baby daddy
Let's just call him J3
I was chillin' on auntie front porch, me
And J Leach
She said, "Shit rough right now, he need
A four way"
My conscious tellin' me I shouldn't trust
That niggas no way
Gangster Kell hit my line, he said he
Need a H-town
Last thing I heard, he went to get
Some weed in H-Town
Didn't go how he planned it, yeah, them
Ese's must've played him
Contemplatin' robbin' me, he thinkin my
Bread gon' save him
Met him on the eastside, he flexed me
With some singles
Big bills on the outside, you know just
Like some Pringles
Cut him off in traffic then he jumped off
On the highway
Sent a couple shots before he tried to
Send some my way
Rather be on white sand beaches
Bumpin' Sade
Or at the St. Regis Bal Harbour in the
Lobby

Trustin' no one
36 for 24, them 9's is for the 41
And if a nigga want a split, I slice it like

He owe one
That's how niggas get killed, nigga, I ain't
Trustin' no one
