Ooh, that's my trick (Trick, trick)
I’m her pimp (Pimp, pimp)
She my flip (Flip, flip)
Ooh, don't forget (Get, get)
That's my trick (Trick, trick)
She my bottom bitch
Ooh, that’s my trick (That's my trick)
I'm her pimp (I'm her pimp)
She my flip (She my flip)
Ooh, don't forget (Don't forget)
That's my trick (That's my trick)
She my bottom bitch

That’s my ho
That’s my doe
That's my glow up
She go hard
She just like a pro
She just wanna blow up
If you talkin’ shit
Wipe your spit off my nuts
Nigga, grow up
On a boat like I'm Noah
Xan like I'm Noah
Damn, I don't know her no more
And she bought a crib
Then she bought a whip
In her Prada fit
Got some Gucci kicks
That’s my bottom bitch
'Cause she 'bout it, bitch
And I'm proud of it
