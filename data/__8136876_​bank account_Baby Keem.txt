Huh, violate that bitch, I did, yeah (Yeah)
Huh, violate that bitch, I did, yeah
Huh, violate that bitch, I did, yeah

I can't talk about all the shit that I done did (I can't talk about)
I can't talk about all the bitches I done hit (I can't talk about)
I can't talk about all the niggas that got fed (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
My pockets be blue, but my eyes, they still see red (Rrr)
Doot-doot, doot-doot, fuck the loaf, I make the bread (Bread)
Doot-doot, doot-doot, I see numbers in my head (I'm alive)
I like dead people instead
Doot-doot, doot-doot, ain't 'bout money, texts on read (Yeah)

Doot-doot, doot-doot, did it (Yeah)
Everything you did, I done been did it (I did it)
Every bitch you fucked, I done been hit it (Hit it)
Hit it (Hit it)
Hit it (Hit it)
Doot-doot, doot-doot (Wow), every time I go to check my bank account (My bank)
Doot-doot, doot-doot, you wouldn't even believe my bank amount
Doot-doot, doot-doot, I can't count up the whole goddamn amount
Doot-doot, doot-doot, I made it
And sometimes I forget I'm famous, just like I am Amos (Yeah)
And I can turn your bitch around and fuck her in her anus
You might also like
And I just let her spirit up (Yeah), for some entertainment
Won my first GRAMMY, put my opps in the pavement
I told my ghetto bitch to shut the fuck up (Ayy)
I like tough love (Ayy, ayy)
I know they don't trust us
I just put it in her mouth, she need a touch up (Need a touch up)
And my lifestyle Tempur-Pedic, need to rough up (Need a roughing)
I walk in the fuckin' meeting, all you starstruck (Lil' bitch)
Baby, you've been blessed to see it, give it good luck (Lil' bitch)
My cousins say that I'm a menace to society (Society)
When I fuck a famous bitch, I do it quietly (Shh, shh, shh, shh)
All my niggas quick to judge, I know they tired of me
Toxic bitch won't let me leave, something up her sleeve (Sleeve)
And she know what I bleed, she know my ID
I sent her to Maldives, just so I could breathe
Doot-doot, doot-doot, ugh, came out kicking in October
Last time I checked, your energy was bipolar
Last time I checked, your baby mama had an odor
Last time I checked, she was fuckin' the promoter
Ugh, you was sittin' on a porch
Last time I checked, I'm the one that took the torch
Last time I checked, I cut you off with no remorse
Last time I checked, y'all was quick to go report
If I cancel, then that mean I had some shit to do
If I cancel, I was in the projects, ten to two
If I cancel, who the fuck you think you talkin' to?
If I cancel, call my eldest bitch and tell her, "Deuce"
If I, "doot-doot, doot-doot," then that mean I'm probably at the bank
If I, "doot-doot, doot-doot," hug my bitch, I gotta keep her safe
If I, "doot-doot, doot-doot," taper, taper, takin' off her face
If I, "doot-doot, doot-doot," said she want a smart nigga with taste
I can't talk about all the shit that I done did (I can't talk about)
I can't talk about all the bitches I done hit (I can't talk about)
I can't talk about all the niggas that got fed (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
My pockets be blue, but my eyes, they still see red (Rrr)
Doot-doot, doot-doot, fuck the loaf, I make the bread (Yeah)
Doot-doot, doot-doot, I see numbers in my head (I'm alive)
I like dead people instead
Doot-doot, doot-doot, ain't 'bout money, texts on read (Yeah)4Embed
