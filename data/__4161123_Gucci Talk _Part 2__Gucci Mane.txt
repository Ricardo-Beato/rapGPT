2 ContributorsGucci Talk (Part 2) Lyrics
What it do, it's Gucci
We outta here like last year
It's Brick Squad, them dirty birds
We stay in your hood with somethin' to sell
The hustlers, let's go
Holiday, we gone!
Appreciate the movement
Holiday Season
Know I ride for this shit
Gon' keep goin'
2011 is over, I promise you
1017, Commission, Brick Squad Monopoly, Insane Entertainment
I don't give a fuck if you a trash man, a lawyer, a street pharmacist, get your money, nigga
Fuck them haters
We gone!You might also likeEmbed
