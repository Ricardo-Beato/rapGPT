8 ContributorsItâ€™s Goin Up Lyrics
Are you ready?
Gucci Andretti, Spaghetti Junction
Drop top Ferrari, call it the Headless Horseman
Water whipping in the kitchen my wifey bitching
But I ain't got no time for scressin, I'm tryna stretch it
I hold up my whip my left wrist, call me left wrist
Right wrist, make the work twist like it's chopsticks
Roof gone, Gucci present, my top is absent
My old school make em hate me with a passion
Loud in, bales of loud in, got that strong huh?
Countin up a hundred thousand in my long johns
I'm up on these suckas so I guess that's why they block
See these niggas need to shop with me, come up on a knot
Dope boy took 400,000 to the lot
Where them keys to that Rolls Royce? Drop it like its hot
Nigga tried to rob Gucci Mane, guess that boy forgot
That my carbon, carbon 15, keep 200 shots

Its Goin Up Its Goin Up Its Goin Up Yea I'm Hot
My Feature Price Its Goin Up
Its Goin Up Its Goin Up Its Goin Up Its The Drought
You Know The Price Its Going Up
Said Up Zone 6 My Check Up
Said Up Zone 6 My Check Up
Said Up Zone 6 My Check Up
Pull Up To The Club And Theyd Be Wut the Fuck

With News Flash Nigga This Is Straight Off The Wire
My Blood Just GoT blood So His Ass Got To Retire
It Ain't All Good Cause I Just Left The Streets Jack
They Say Its A Drought And The Hoods Off The Meatrack
The Trap Was Going Ham Now Its Full Blown Pig
And Yours In The Streets Itll Split Your Full Grown Wig
And Niggas On That Bullshit Sellin Wax And Drywall
Careful Who You're Scoring From Niggas Bound To Try Yall
Me I'm The Trill-O G So I Ain't Trippin On 'Em
We Automatic Mayne And we Ain't Scared Of Grippin On 'Em
We Got Our Own Bricks You Can't Hit Your Own Licks?

Bring Them Helicopter Prices In The Hood This Shit Outrageous
Gucci Mane Ain't Got Like The Money Get Contagious
Stupid Don Porshe Cocaine Miley Cyrus
If Money A Disease I Got A Million Dollar Virus
Lookin Out The Window And My House Looking Like An Island
Fresher Nigga In And Out With An Stylist
Man Cost A Hundred But The Chopper Cost A Thousand
125 Grand pools Running In Your House
The Work Banked Up But the Yeast Went Down
500 Dog Flagged Get Your Bitch Gunned Down
Throw It Up Throw It Up Aces And Spades Pull It Up
Bottle After Bottle We Going Harder Till We Throwin Up
