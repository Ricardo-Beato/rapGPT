Al Watts: Okay, and now we've met our contestants, let's get to the game! I'm going to ask an amount of four questions, and you'll try to answer them correctly. Now, you out there in the audience can answer along with them! How many feathers are on a Perdue chicken? How many fibers are intertwined in a Shredded Wheat biscuit?

Now that we know the questions, we'll let the contestants think them over, and we'll return right after these messagesYou might also like2Embed
