Yo! What's popping? Hello, world—as I usually say, hahaha. My name is ... It's not important. What's more important is what I told y'all, and what I told y'all was—on Tha Carter 1, and everything else—I said, "I'm the best rapper alive," quote-unquote. And now, y'all believe me, haha. And since '05, The Dedication has been in your life. Tha Carter has been in your life. Gangsta Grillz has been in your life. So: The game has existed before us. But it was never the same after us, hahaha. Don't you agree? Well, without further ado, I'ma shut the fuck up. And we gon' get into this trilogy. Dedication 3, baby, yeah! Welcome!You might also like1Embed
