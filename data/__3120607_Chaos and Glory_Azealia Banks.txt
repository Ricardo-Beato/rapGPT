13 ContributorsChaos and Glory Lyrics
Set in the mood, here for the rendezvous
They can't walk in my shoes
Stun and peruse, I got fans in Peru
I put splash in your juice
Spicy psyche, spicy enticing
There I go again, there's none like me
High speed, fast 
Killin' shit
Call me a criminal, ditch the gambit
Imma start hittin' the planet
Like drugs when they hit the campus
To my advantage, got a whole crystal manage
Just might cop a plot in Kansas
Where's the standards?
You want it, I got the answers
And I might not use my manners
Fancy danza
I came to wave a banner
Watch em duck cause I clutch the hammer
 the glamour
Put it in the clip and jam it
You gon' click, you gon' grip your camera
It's all about me, your honour
This ain't no primadonna
Second to none
I am as far as they come
Stay on my job till I get it done
Shuffle the deck of them cards
Live like the world is ours
Automobile with the seat back
Babies coppin' breeze, y'all peep that
Don't need the receipts, you can keep that
I put that beef on a meat pack
I done did shit you wanna do
The dollars coming too
Now I gotta come for you
Let me show you what Imma do
Switch locations, now you can't see me
Ball so hard, still make it look easy
You can't see it, this ensemble
All my moves make moves, it's uncommon
Like an unstoppable force
Switchin' roles in the court
I got time to endure
Fighting my baddest till I win the war
Coming for more
Chaos and glory for more
Chaos and glory for more
Chaos and glory for more
You might also like
 on the battlefield
Killer smile, Killer heels
Snakes and ladders and a game of life
Bathroom light
Standing low
Styling out
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
I run the battle now
Chaos in the glory
Chaos in the glory
Chaos in the glory
Chaos in the glory

Face it, no one can replace this
Makin jaws drop, bitches gon need a face lift
You said a lot but you really ain't say shit
I'm top notch, couldn't reach me with a spaceship
Fashionista, master teacher
Got them overseas wishing that they had a Visa
Blast the heater, pass the reefa
Can't forget me even if you had amnesia
It's the don diva with the strut, deluxe
 on my palm, in my clutch
Wreck the place and throw a slug at ya gut
Party hard
Celebrate it like the Mardi Gras
You hardly hard
I body your body guard
Catalyst the lavishes
Lookin more like a masochist
I'm hazardous
You lookin' for an ass to kiss
And I'm looking for that cash to grip
Pleased to meet ya
I've been juggling the struggles
And the battle's won
Fighting to the top of my 
Yeah, I'm juggling the muscle and I'm still not done
Du dun dun dun
Du dun dun dun
Du dun dun dun
Du dun dun dun
Pleased to meet ya
I've been juggling the struggles
And the battle's won
Fighting to the top of my 
Yeah, I'm juggling the muscle and I'm still not done
Du dun dun dun
Du dun dun dun
Du dun dun dun
Du dun dun dun1Embed
