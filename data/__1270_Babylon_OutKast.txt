77 ContributorsBabylon Lyrics
I came into this world high as a bird
From secondhand cocaine powder—I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted, but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges without no snap-back
And, bitches, they say they need that to shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route, turn each other out, burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me can't even get no backrub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part?
But let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down when you speak from your heart—now that's hard
While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats they got some shit that'll blow out our backs from where they stay at
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin' (Hopin'), wishin' (Wishin'), prayin'
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith)
In you, in you

Yo, yo, yo
I'm fascinated by the way your nipples peak at me through your blouse
Freaky me, freaky you, can't help but be aroused
'Scuse me, Lord, lustful thinkin', but that's the way we was brought up
Sneakin' to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods and laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be explorin' each others privates
Hunchin' with all our clothes on until we felt excited then (Ah)
Oh, now it's on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere if you know what I'm talkin' about
Now if too harsh then walk on out and I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny because it's devilish, now, see, we dead wrong
You might also like
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun (Oh)
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin' (Prayin')
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith in you)
In you (Oh, ooh)

People don't know the stress I'm dealin' with, day to day (Day)
Speakin' about the feelings I'm possessin' for Rene
Mopin' around and wonderin' where she stay, saw her last that she lay
"Give it another day," I say, but the Lord, he taketh away
Now give it back, Lord, 'cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor stores, crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Livin' up on this earth before a nigga like Daddy was born
But they be makin' it seem that my music and crime are team
But I'm speakin' the truth not dreams (Dream)
So what in the fuck they mean, my lyrics ain't clean?

Ooh (Yeah), I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone (So I keep hopin')
So I'm hopin', (And) wishin', (And) prayin' (Prayin')
To keep my faith in you (My faith in you)
In you
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun (Just begun, oh-woah)
Ooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone (Oh, yeah)
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin' (Ooh)
To keep my faith in you (My faith in you)
In you
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, though we're here, someday, we will be gone (I keep hopin')
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'
To keep my faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you (Keep my faith)
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith...13Embed
