18 ContributorsShooting Guns Lyrics
Got my guns and magazines
And a red one from a beam
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

Shoot your gun I'll make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

I go to war to 'til heart stop, niggas ain't listening
Get the thumping and the dumping at your newborn's christening
Tell your homie, tell his homies, he 'gon need more homies
Ain't this a bitch, I got the extended clip right on me
And my diamonds on my neck, I dare a nigga to scheme on it
The Ruger on deck, it's hard to miss with the beam on it
I'll give your ass a permanent nap, sing you a lullabye
I got money to run, so fuck a alibi

Shoot your gun I'll make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

Yeah, I believe you when you say you tough, nigga
All that means is you fucked, nigga
I get the drop I'm on it
Morning, noon or night, I spot ya, I got ya
Wake up cuffed to your bed, cops asking, "who shot ya?"
As the world turns, we live and we learn
The hollow tips burn and I ain't concerned if I ain't hit
And I ain't hit, so a nigga don't really give a shit
You know who you fucking with
Come through, dump more than a clip
Niggas be on some stupid shit
'Till they get hit, ain't that a bitch?
You might also like
K-I double, shotgun barrel double
My homies front a couple and I move 'em on a double
Racks in the duffel, Mac with the muzzle
Makin' circles in you, all black like a tunnel
I only know how to hustle, can't stay outta trouble
I got a big gun, muthafuck a scuffle
Kidd Kidd, will you ever change?
Fuck no, Pimp zone, Rida gang, you already fuckin' know

Got my guns and magazines
And a red one from a beam
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more

Man these niggas so fake, I call 'em knock-offs
Like Pringles I pop the top off
You ain't hot, dawg, you the fucking Micky Mouse song
I'm on fire like Louisiana hot sauce
Brand new J's cost a buck fifty nigga
You scuff these Iâ€™ll scar your face, buck fifty, nigga
Been fucking with them pigs, you a guinea, nigga
And you always begging, you's a ''give me'' nigga
I wear my gun like its trendy, nigga
You pussy and ain't shit, kitty litter
Uh, see where all that bitching get ya
Right in front of this pistol, huh
Got my guns and magazines
And a red one from a beam
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

Shoot your gun now make you a believer
Now you better pray for something more5Embed
