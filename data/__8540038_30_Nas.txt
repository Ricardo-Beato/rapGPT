(Hit-Boy)

A divine creature, ran through dimes, divas
I turned blocks to beaches
By the time you see us, we just turned tides even
Cuban chain, got the largest pieces
But, I— (Thirty)
Wild for keepin' it so timeless
Almost half a century with a crispy lineup
My peeps Salaam said I remind him of Martin Lawrence
Breakin' hearts on some real thin line shit
I'm done with star chicks, I survived divorces
I ain't have to climb back, I just climbed in Porsches (Thirty, uh, uh)
Uh, I ain't have to climb back, I just climbed in Porsches
I was the ill seed, the illest one
The villainized, but I feel free and the field be
Crazy way before the drill beef
Doesn't matter this is sheer relief, I feel the breeze this is
Superhero material, rap star status
Premier album still might happen
I wonder why Pete Rock would act like that
That type of behavior make me give rap right back (Thirty)
And now I can't tell if all the good that I did's bein' hid with they agenda again, nigga
I know that y'all prayin' I go back to nothin'
We in the future, let's get past the frontin'
Let's get money
You might also like
This is practice, this is magic
History, havoc, instant classic (Thirty)
This is madness in all fairness

We been movin' how you fuck niggas wanna
My thirty for thirty highlights doin' numbers
Goin' on thirty summers (Thirty)
Goin' on thirty summers
Goin' on thirty summers (Thirty)
I'm goin' on thirty summers
Goin' on thirty summers (Thirty)
Goin' on thirty summers
We been movin' how you fuck niggas wanna
My thirty for thirty highlights doin' numbers (Uh, thirty)

King, ooh, uh
Uh, king
Uh, king
Uh, king
Uh
Uh, king
Uh
