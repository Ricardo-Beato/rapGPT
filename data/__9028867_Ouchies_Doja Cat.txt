(We got London on the track)
Yeah

Let me get it started
Round one, fight
Round two, ice
Round three, bye
Let me get it started
Yeah, round one, fight (Fight)
Round two, ice
Round three, bye

Okay, I don't mean to instigate
Y’all really phone it in with the music lately
I don't need another hit 'cause it’s useless, really
I ain't lookin' good? You hallucinatin'
Every time I hear 'em talk, I assume they crazy
You could open up for me, who are you? First lady?
Shut it down mid-show, tell 'em, "Fuck you, pay me"
That's a new Mercedes, I am graduatin' (Yeah)

Let me get it started
Round one, fight (Fight)
Round two, ice
Round three, bye (Bitch)
Let me get it started
Yeah, round one, fight
Round two, ice (Yeah)
Round three, bye (Yeah, I said)

You full of Remy, now your face look tired (Yeah)
Used to be the baby ma, you marten now
You gon’ need another doc, can't talk me down
You better pick her up 'cause hoes brawlin' now, so come buck up

Let me get it started (Yeah)
Round one, fight (Let’s go)
Round two, ice (Hey)
Round three, bye (Thought you did something)
Let me get it started (Bitch)
Yeah, round one, fight
Round two, ice
Round three, bye (Let me try it again)

Crusty, musty, dusty bitches
Don't you ever, ever in your life
