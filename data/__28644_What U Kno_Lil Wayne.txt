Alexis Motors dot com!
Go see 'em when you ready to ride like a professional!
Know that! (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Yeah
What y'all know about that hard work?
What you know a—, what you know a—
What you know about the grind?
What you know a—, I know all a— (Gangsta Grillz, you bastards! Gangsta—)
What y'all know about where it gets you? (Yeah)
Y'all better learn something! (I asked her—)
I'm 'bout to close the books! ("Ayy, shawty—")
It's nothing like it! ("Ayy, shawty—")
AMG! (Yeah—yeah!)

I'm a New Orleans gangsta, after the storm
Boy, it took 'bout three million to rebuild my home, but—
I'm back on defense, back in the zone
I eat rappers and go in my yard and bury they bones, huh!
My pockets on Raven-Symone
That's fat—what you know 'bout that? Huh?
See, I'ma keep it goin', keep it movin'—we can do it, I ain't trippin'
So far ahead of them niggas, we got a time difference
Don't confuse me with them: I'm different
Tryna holler at Tip for a movie audition, shit!
I push that Maserati to the limit (*Vroom*)
Zig-zaggin' through that traffic like Emmitt
I tell them niggas, "Hurry and buy!"
And if you dry-snitch, you get buried alive
Yeah, and I don't chase 'em like you do
I keep a bad bitch skatin' like New-New (Gangsta—)

Big shout to SHADE 45!
Shout my nigga, Stix Malone!
Can't forget super-barber extraordinaire, my nigga, Quadir!1Embed
