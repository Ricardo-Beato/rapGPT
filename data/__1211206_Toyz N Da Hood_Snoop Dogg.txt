What's happenin', y'all? Big Snoop Dogg
Shootin' a shout out to all the lil' rascals out there man
The lil' homies, you know'm'sayin'?
Niggas keep tellin' 'em they ain't gon' grow up to be shit
Don't trip, I used to be a lil' rascal too
Look at this lil' rascal now
Yeah, the lil' rascal done became the Big Snoop Dogg
Follow your dreams, lil' homies

Ah, check one bobba, yeah
We goin' back, to the hip-hop shop, non-stop, baby
A-ha ha ha ha, yeah
Where all the DJs use the turntables, like Glocks
A-ha ha ha ha, ah
We just havin' fun, and nobody gets shot
Now, uh, where's my leading lady?

Now we movin' on, to hip-hop and funk
Where Snoop and Bootsy usin' music and lyric
To spike yo' punch, baby

Wa-hooooo out there
Ah yeah, bobba
Ah heavens to all out blitz (All out blitz)
I don't know your name but uhhh
I think I want a kiss, yeah
I know you're fine, like the wine I drink
And you may not get a second chance
(And you may not get a second chance)
To make a first impression
(To make a first impression)
So take the opportunity
Yeah, I pop these parties like I pop emcees
Never need a ride 'cause I carry my own keys
And if you wanna hang with us
Tell 'em it's all good, baby (It's all good)
All we do around here is uhh
Play with our toys, up in the hood
Swing down, and get that frown off your face
Now all we do around here is uhh
Party in the place
Swing down
Let me hear y'all say - PARTY IN THE PLACE
PARTY IN THE PLACE
That's all we do around here, baby
(Pull out those toys in the hood)
PARTY IN THE PLACE
(You know it's all good)
Yeah mama, get that off your face
PARTY IN THE PLACE
PARTY IN THE PLACE
I'm just sippin' on Gin & Juice
Tryin' to catch up with Mother Goose
Yeah, she got that golden egg
And now she trippin' all in my head
Ahh, Snoopadelic, bobbasYou might also likeEmbed
