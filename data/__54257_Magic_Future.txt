50 ContributorsMagic Lyrics
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic

On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport
Way I smoked the blunts man I burned 'em up like Newport
Fifty thousand dollars on superstar attire
K.E. and Young Future bringing them fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick if you wanna put me on a flyer
Excuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me to Grady's
A young G in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'mma do a 180
For the haters I'mma go ahead and do it 360
Drinking on a Sprite got lean all in it
I'm a Astronaut nigga better trust my pimping
You might also like
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic

Billionaire boy that's true inspiration
Learned the Astronaut Kid, no such thing as limitation
Flying down 20 in the motherfucking spaceship
Just left Magic in the motherucking basement
Two bitches trailing in a Bimmer out of Germany
Gotta thing for me, they wanna sing for me
They like my energy, I'm an embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I don't trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from your past life
You will re-appear and go outta sight
I'm Pluto talkin', Jimmy walking when you walking
I used to be fly but now I'm hawking
I was an Earthling now im SciFi
Wallah, I stay high
My bitches on they high horse
I double back like two cups
And crawl out in that new Porsche14Embed
