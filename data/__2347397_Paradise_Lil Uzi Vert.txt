Yeah, paradise, yeah (Yeah)
It's somewhere that I never been before (Before)
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up (Wake up)
Yeah, like you better with no makeup (Makeup, no, yeah)
Yeah, paradise, yeah (Yeah)
It's somewhere that I never been before (Before)
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up (Wake up)
Yeah, like you better with no makeup (Makeup, no, yeah, yeah)

Baby, you like me, like the way you stay clean
Alexander the Wang, Alexander McQueen
You doing your little thing, you rocking Balmain
I'm rocking Mr. Completely, the 424 jeans
I started touring (I started touring)
My life is the opposite of "My life is oh-so boring"
Yeah, you know so turnt up (Woo)

Paradise, yeah (Yeah)
It's somewhere that I never been before (Oh)
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up (Wake up)
Yeah, like you better with no makeup (Makeup, no, yeah)

My phone, ignore it (My phone, ignore it)
When you be callin' (When you be callin')
I started ballin' (I started ballin')
You stopped your stallin' (You stopped your stallin')
That Range, I park it, I drive a Rover
I skrrt, I skrrt, yeah, I swerve and drive it just like I stole it
And she right on my side 'cause she's the boldest
Our style's the coldest, style's the coldest
We liplock until our lips are swollen
Live in the moment, good times is golden (Yeah, yeah)
I'm not gonna lie, you got me open, yeah (Yeah, woo, yeah)
But that's only in the moment, yeah (That's only in the moment)
You might also like
Yeah, paradise, yeah (Yeah)
It's somewhere that I never been before (Before)
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up (Wake up)
Yeah, like you better with no makeup (Makeup, no, yeah)

Yeah, paradise, yeah
It's somewhere that I never been before
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up
Yeah, like you better with no makeup32Embed
