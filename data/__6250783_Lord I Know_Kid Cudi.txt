95 ContributorsLord I Know Lyrics
Hey

The world is steady spinnin' and I'm in it full speed now (Yeah)
Couldn't miss the perfect moment, been livin' wild
Every day's a blessing, get the message, God, hear me out (Out)
While I'm chillin', fronto peelin', oh, Lord, tell me how
I been on my own, there's somethin' missin', missin' (Yeah)
On my job, workin' strong, hyper-focused, baby, ain't no phasing
Tell me what you do when your world is crazy (Crazy)
Something goin' on and I wish the world could save me, wasn't ready
Now I understand, my nigga, shit is gravy (Gravy)
Keep away from hoes, never let them get too close, not C (Nah)
No time for drama, ain't the same way it was (Uh-uh)
Struttin' like it's nothin', hit the button, no more feelin' buzzed (Uh)

Ooh, yeah, I know
Baby, I'm a warrior, baby, I'm a warrior (Yeah!)
Ooh, set the control (Come on)
Baby, I'm a warrior, baby, I'm a warrior

Start the show, blessings in my life
Lord, I know (Lord, I know), You can make it right
Start the show (Yeah, nigga), blessings in my life
Lord, I know (Lord, I know, vroom, vroom)
You might also like
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
How I am, I'm rockin' steady betty (Uh-huh)
Tell 'em how you seen a fuckin' wizard in the flesh
Now I'm bending every rule until it breaks, no time for chillin', chillin'
Onward on my mission, on my journey, on my quest, yes
Time to roll (Yeah), got my niggas and my boos
Been so sick of runnin', now I'm focused on the next
When it's time to move, serve 'em with that new, new
Tired of the evil tryna take me out my best, wow (Yeah!)
Shoot 'em up and kill 'em, that's they motto, look around, 'round
Tryna gun a nigga, send him up in heaven's gown, gown (Woof!)
Aim it (Woof, woof!), what it do, fool?
I won't be a victim of the devil, got the wrong dude (No)

Ooh, yeah, I know (Uh-huh)
Baby, I'm a warrior, baby, I'm a warrior (Yeah!)
Ooh, set the control (Uh-huh)
Baby, I'm a warrior, baby, I'm a warrior (Warrior)

Start the show, blessings in my life
Lord, I know (Lord, I know), You can make it right
Start the show, blessings in my life
Lord, I know (Lord, I know)
