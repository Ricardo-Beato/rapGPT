Yeah man, I'mma get me a boat
I'ma ride that bad boy down Nostrand Avenue, man
Yeah, let it roll, coming in waves (wave, wave)
Let it roll, coming in waves (wave, wave)
Let it roll, coming in waves (wave, wave)
Let it roll, coming in waves (wave, wave)

Yo, I love the way it feels, man, it feel good
Yeah, this track got a feel, man, it's real good
Got the ill melody but it's still hood
You know the deal
Yo, I never let up, keep it flashier than old-school get-ups
Got it crackin' like old-school leather
Reminiscent of a more wholesome era
I would ask a little girl if we could go together
Little Stevie finish, read the harmonica
Archie and Jughead, Betty and Veronica
I learned life ain't a comic though
No, put away the toys a long time ago
New name for the studio is Kweliwood
Jolly good flow, getting gnarly as the naughty would
Back and forth on the stage with Yasiin
Call our group what Garvey probably would
You might also like
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would (stay here I would)
But babe, you know I gotta go get that paper (stay here I would)
Let it roll, coming in waves
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would (stay here I would)
But babe, you know I got to go get that paper (stay here I would)
Let it roll, coming in waves

All my language is romantic
So let in, I don't even know Spanish
All I know is I'm scorched to the Puritans
Most tyranis rapper on the whole planet
I'm the one who was never supposed to be here
Now I'm the one the haters see, let's be clear
Yeah, bet now you remember me
Give you a reminder cause you act like your memory
Lost like Dory while you off finding Nemo
Talking you a boss, you as soft as Brian Eno
Tellin' all these stories, why you lying to the people?
Why you fronting like you want it but you rhyming kinda emo?
Tryna find a needle in a haystack easier
Than tryna find a leader in the mainstream media
Never knowing where we headed
Til we're following each other off the cliff like Lemmings
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would (stay here I would)
But babe, you know I gotta go get that paper (stay here I would)
Let it roll, coming in waves
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would (stay here I would)
But babe, you know I got to go get that paper (stay here I would)
Let it roll, coming in waves

Let it roll, get bold
Big Daddy Kane style never gonna get old
Spit flows that invented cause of skid row
Tiptoe when you enterin' the zip code
Pistols, brandish it, we never hand 'em in
Accessory to crime got 'em handling the shenanigans
And the hand God brings like the Mandarin
Ugly sense, picking Polo rugbies off the manequin
Woo, now I'm feeling like the new wave
Like I'm two days deep into my blue phase
My baby hate that I'm living out of suitcase
Like I forgot to tie the knot like the shoelace
Let me be your liberator
Get yourself together, we gon' see each other later
You could be my love or you could be another hater
Why you frontin' tryna run from all this deviant behavior like
Yeah, Whisky Boys
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would (stay here I would)
But babe, you know I gotta go get that paper (stay here I would)
Let it roll, coming in waves
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would
But babe, you know I gotta go get that paper
I made some time, for you1Embed
