Hmm-mm-no-no
Hmm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Yeah, mm, oh
Oh, woah, woah
Hmm

Pardon me babe, there are instructions I think that you should read
I'm a madman, I cause problems that I truly never mean
I'm damaged, I trust no one, sometimes I can be real mean
To a magnitude extreme, I'm sorry, oh, but

Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, I'm so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, here's your warning

Hmm-mm-eh-oeh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Hmm-mm-eh-oeh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Mm-mm-eh-mm-mm-eh-eh
Hmm, mm-mm-mm
Hmm-eh-mm-eh
Hmm-mm-mm

Pardon me babe, there are instructions I think that you should read
My heart it has no shell, I can sense everything
I love from deep inside, but there are pains I hope to fix
I have no bag of tricks, it's just you should

Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, I'm so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, here's your warning

Hmm-mm-eh-oeh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Hmm-mm-eh-oeh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Handle, eh-oeh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Handle, eh-oeh
Hmm-mm-mm

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, oh why me, me?
Why, oh why me?
Beavis: "I don't know, Butthead. I'm feeling kind of... I don't know."
Butthead: "Wuss."
David Van Driessen: "Come on, Butthead, m'kay? Sometimes when you have a very powerful artist like Cudi, it's possible that his songs invoke certain emotions and feelings and those feelings are valid, m'kay? You know, another thing that brings up some of these feeling is hallucinogens, which I know both of you have been doing, m'kay? So why don't you just sort of relax and maybe take this as an opportunity to meditate, m'kay? Go inside yourselves, look inward"
Butthead: "Yeah Beavis, look inward. Look up your butt."
Beavis: "Shut up Butthead, your vibe's all wrong. You're not on the same frequency, butthole. You just don't get it Butthead, you just don't get it."13Embed
