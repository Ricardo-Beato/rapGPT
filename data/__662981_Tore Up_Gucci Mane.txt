8 ContributorsTore Up Lyrics
I just wanna tear something up, baby girl let me tear something up
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up
I just wanna tear something up, baby let me tell you what
I just wanna tear something up, who wanna get tore up?
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get fucked
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get fucked
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up

I'm in the mood to fuck, not in the mood to talk
I'm not the dude today, pay all your bills you straight
Fuck what your girlfriend say, ball like the NBA
Check out my resume, let's buy a Benz today
Money to lend today, call all your friends today
She sleep in a bed with me but at first was scared of me
I tear that pussy up then give her some bread
Never bite the hand that's keepin' us fed
Bring home the bacon and I ain't killed a pig
Don't go in that room, it's too much mid
My girlfriend show you how to bust that bitch
Cut a ho off, I don't trust that bitch
Big Gucci baby on that juvie shit
Got dope in my house and I hide that shit
Don't need no friends, I can buy you some
While you getting your hair done I get your own salon
Why you getting yo nails done, I can buy you one
If you never took a pill then try one
You might also like
I just wanna tear something up, baby girl let me tear something up
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up
I just wanna tear something up, baby let me tell you what
I just wanna tear something up, who wanna get tore up?
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get fucked
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get fucked
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up

Buy a pistol baby and I'll carry it
Let's fly to Vegas, get married quick
I'm a burglar, I'm a murderer
Three ear drops baby I'm wearing it
I'm kind of careless with that money, might drop a mill
Spend 50k on bags and heels
Smoke that Cali kush in the Hollywood hills
Ball so hard, you don't need no nigga
I need a real bad bitch don't need no nigga
Might trick off on a hoe but don't feed no niggas
Big Guwop, he better choose that nigga
Better cut that man off, better lose that nigga
Since the last man was born
All this lean we pourin
It's a miracle that we ain't sleepin'
Been on the road 3 weeks touring
Imma buy my main bitch a foreign
Yea and I'm a paint it orange
I'm fresh in this Ralph Lauren
Been ballin' since the day I was born
That lil nigga don't get along with me
Cause the niggas I got too strong with me
I'm on that lean and kushy
I feel asleep in that pussy
I just wanna tear something up, baby girl let me tear something up
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up
I just wanna tear something up, baby let me tell you what
I just wanna tear something up, who wanna get tore up?
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get fucked
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get fucked
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore upEmbed
