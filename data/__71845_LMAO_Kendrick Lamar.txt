22 ContributorsLMAO Lyrics
Wow
I think I must have forgot or something
Like I ain't hot or something
Like I don't make your girl take off her top or something

I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

Jump in the coup and I'm gone
I smell like money, I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak
That can jump on the bone
Like an X-Ray technician
My rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs
All cause I'm 21
Like playing blackjack
Picture this kodak
Moment forever
K.Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite
I'm that cool
You might also like
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

Bottle of goose and I'm gone
Watching her get loose
Like a third graders tooth
The shit that we on
Is the ultimate high
Double XL flow
That's the ultimate vibe
Park that Lambi' outside
Just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lami' in drive
Watch 'em peel like potatoes
Holla' LMAO
When they drunk and two-step
Like I never could pass
A sobriety test
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

I'm in the club I can manage
Providing lenses
Make my view panoramic
I'm out of this world
I'm off of this planet
They don't say K.Dot is here
They say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted
Like a kitchen floor
But my floor is marble
I ride in the carpool because I got two whores
In the back of that chrome
See they're all I need
Like Aaliyah alone
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?3Embed
