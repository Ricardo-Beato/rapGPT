91 ContributorsInside Lyrics
Yeah man, you know what Iâ€™m saying?
Already
You crazy for this one!

Fresh out the belly of the island into the heart of the city
T and them just hit the road, I had Sage and Nak and 'em with me
I thought the fauna was pretty, so I approached her (I did)
My first apartment was really covered with roaches
'Cause niggas was really smoking
Gotta say that, as of late, I been busy with business, mostly
Got a tape? Catch a wave, now you in the industry ocean
Missing out on your boat
I been figuring out my own fish, home gets distant
We working, I'm on the road again
Cold and the spirits is bursting up out the Trojan, man
Fridge full of spirits in the crib
Mirror, mirror, let me hear why the niggas that's the peers see and hear us
Then mimic the fucking motions, man
Keep the circle close, let them niggas front in the cul-de-sacs
Friendly with the chosen, the rest is getting the poker hand
Face-drinking smoker, it help me duck when emotion jab
Fame is the culprit who give me drugs without owing cash

Sipping 'til I melt, Devil trying me, I'm dodging
Falling victim to myself, middle finger to the help
When it's problems, I don't holler, rather fix 'em on myself
When it's looking like it's quiet for you, this the shit to yell
This the shit, right (Yup), keep your chin high up
'Cause when she ain't fucking with you then her friend might
Let you get up inside (Yup), let this shit ride (Yup)
You don't get it rocking like we do on this side, nigga

Ayy
Ayy
I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper (Yup)
And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily, daily32Embed
