6 ContributorsClocked Lyrics
Once upon a time, there was a young boy
He grew up on the banks of the Mississippi
He wants to fly away to find his personal paradise
But first I give thanks and then finish my whiskey
I can't explain why I feel so alone
When I'm surrounded by these people who won't leave me alone
We used to treat the pain like an obstacle
Before we knew it offered opportunity to glue me to you
It's a beautiful life, we tryin' to notice it
But it's a difficult life, you gotta hold it in your fist
Like a knife, don't ever bleed for vampires
Skeptical of suckers tryna feed my trash fire
If you got the time, you gotta make that impact
Bend up the bars and break out of the syntax
I keep running until I collapse
Until my time's up and I don't come back

Make time to have a good time
If you can't find time, you might have to buy time
Take a timeout before you're all out of time
It's about time, don't be wasting my time

Once upon a time, there was a young boy
He grew up on the bottom of the Twin Cities
We bothered everybody at the party
She could've been my Bobby, I probably was her Whitney
I'll write a song for you, then write another one
I struggle just to keep it down to a couple of
Pages in the notebook, save you on a hard drive
What's it gonna take to get your name in the archives?
And I pretend to do the sensible thing
But I've been swimming upstream ever since I could dream
And it don't even seem like the line's getting shorter
I need a drug that makes time move slower
I been complaining just a little too often
I should be thankful for these limited options
I got a full belly and something to cough on
Somebody tell me what the fuck is my problem?
You might also like
Make time to have a good time
If you can't find time you might have to buy time
Take a timeout before you're all out of time
It's about time, don't be wasting my time

You know what time it is
You know what time it is
Time's killing us, time's killing us
We killing time and time's killing us
Time's killing us, k-killing us1Embed
