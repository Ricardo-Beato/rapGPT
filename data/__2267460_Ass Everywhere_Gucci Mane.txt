11 ContributorsAss Everywhere Lyrics
I need a ghetto girl, with a big ol' ghetto booty
Every time I come around she try to give it to me
Every time she turn around it's like a fucking movie
Every time she take it down, I wanna fuck her
She throwin' that ass every where, for this money
She throwin' that for this drink, she throwin' that all this cream
She throwin' that ass everywhere, get it on the floor
She throwin' that, work it like a pro, she throwin' that ain't nothing wrong

I'm smokin' on that super gas, you might not even wanna smoke with me
Sellin' dope, my niggas rob you, don't even wanna buy dope from me
Not Lil' Flip but I'm sucker free, not Lil' Tip but they crown me king
Infrared beam , on my MAC-10, scrap on me now think I'm just rapping
30 Glock shawty, I make a nigga run, like a nigga just signed for a USA team
Kick him in the ass, now he got hemorrhoid, that's what you got for trynna fuck with my boys
Thou shall not kill and I know it's God's will, but that's something I gotta take up with the Lord
Song is a sword and I know it's a sword, but this 40 right here'll shoot up your Accord
Make the crowd applaud, when I pull up in the void, pull up in the Charger, nigga, no charge
100,000 dollars got 'em taken it apart, niggas said they never seen a Dodge so hard
8 bottle, molly, I'm hard from the start, 24/7 Imma keep me a wad
Credit card fraud ass broad but the bitch go hard and act like one of the boys

I need a ghetto girl, with a big ol' ghetto booty
Every time I come around she try to give it to me
Every time she turn around it's like a fucking movie
Every time she take it down, I wanna fuck her
She throwin' that ass every where, for this money
She throwin' that for this drink, she throwin' that all this cream
She throwin' that ass everywhere, get it on the floor
She throwin' that, work it like a pro, she throwin' that ain't nothing wrong
You might also like
Oh yeah, yeah I think she like me, ass high up like a mountain
I ain't scared no, I'm go hiking, girl I fuck with you
That pussy biting, bite it back, I bet you like it
Call me nasty, but you like it
You got the work, baby, I got the oohs
Hop out the shower, then hop on the penis
Tell 'em niggas to chill when I pull up on you
Sing r&b, but I'm ready to shoot

I need a ghetto girl, with a big ol' ghetto booty
Every time I come around she try to give it to me
Every time she turn around it's like a fucking movie
Every time she take it down, I wanna fuck her
She throwin' that ass every where, for this money
She throwin' that for this drink, she throwin' that all this cream
She throwin' that ass everywhere, get it on the floor
She throwin' that, work it like a pro, she throwin' that ain't nothing wrong2Embed
