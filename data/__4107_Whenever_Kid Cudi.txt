Focus baby don't look at me
See right through me, understand my heartbeat
Murmurs to mock your rhythm
Yeah, my nuts, the other girls want 'em
But they can't have, at least for the moment, I'm with you
There could be people around, I'm just focused on you
You can sip Chardonnay and I'ma have myself a brew
I'm a country ass nigga baby, you know how I roll
Your face, never seen something more perfect
You dance in my mind like Justice
I know you listening back like, "Damn, bro!"
Laid back so gentle like the violins
Lay on the beat and we don't have to be as discreet
Can I have a taste? "Absolutely!"
You're my sweet tangerine, let's make a smoothie
But baby, all jokes aside
My heart beats faster when you open your thighs
I'm just ready to slide, ride and glide
Whenever, baby, whenever, baby
Whenever, baby, however

Whenever, however, you want me, girl
You got me (Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me, boo
It's me and you, babe, me and you
Whenever, however, you want me, girl
You got me (Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me, boo
It's me and you, babe, me and you
Whenever, however, you want me, girl
You got me (Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me, boo
It's me and you, babe, me and you
Whenever, however, you want me, girl
You got me (Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me, boo
It's me and you, babe, me and youYou might also like5Embed
