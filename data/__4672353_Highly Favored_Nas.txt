27 ContributorsHighly Favored Lyrics
Patient
My faith is highly favored by the father, love to all
Rest in peace to Zanu, the barber brought cases
Celebrate and take us back to thought
The real New York, death to rapists and rats
The touch school to Brooklyn stories
The kings, the lifers, the lords of Queens
Or the stories on Puerto Rican righteous, I heard things
Know some people who know people
Getting money, the broke people claim you owe some people
It's easy to explain anything to a real liver of life
Who live where you live and see shit the same
Gotta watch who you joke with or get checked
We easily mistake jokes for disrespect
Where I'm from, it's never over if somebody dies
Somebody gon' ride, years later, somebody son, double 4-5
You laid up in ICU, hoping you survive
Too many stories like this one

What's shaking?
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to 'yall (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?
You might also like
Uh, yeah
Some are caricatures, amateur boys
I'm like a classic pianist with a handful of sores
Bandages on my finger, still managing chords
Like a live band, performing in a sand storm
Blind, but I still hit the right keys
Swift as a life breeze, dripping
In fear of God, scented in Diptyque fragrance
Some nights Creed flavors, I am motivation
I don't talk on the next man, I am never hating
This daily bread, holy bread
Alphabetical numerals, codes of red
What's more dense, gold or lead?
What's more expensive?
The OG said, "No matter what it is, rent it
And never buy it, it's all temporary possessions
We don't own nothing on this Earth but our soul and that's the lesson"
Project apartment parties, rest in peace to Marley
Try not to get booked by Officer Laverty

What's shaking?
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to y'all (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My faith is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?1Embed
