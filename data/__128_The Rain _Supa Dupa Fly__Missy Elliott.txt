Run the track
Me, I'm supa fly
Supa-dupa fly, supa-dupa fly (I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly (Against my window)
Supa-dupa fly, supa-dupa fly (I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly (Against my window)
Supa-dupa fly, supa-dupa fly (I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly (Against my window)

When the rain hits my window
I take and *inhale, cough* me some indo
Me and Timbaland, ooh, we sang a jangle
We so tight, that you get our styles tangled
Sway or do-si-do like you loco
"Can we get kinky tonight?" like Coko, so-so
You don't wanna play with my Yo-Yo
I smoke my hydro on the D-low (D-D-D-D-D-low)

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I— I can't stand the rain
Against my window
You might also like
Beep, beep, who got the keys to the Jeep?
Vroom
I'm driving to the beach
Top down, loud sounds, see my peeps
Give them pounds, now look who it be
It be me-me-me and Timothy
Look like it's 'bout to rain, what a shame
I got the Armor All to shine up the stain
Oh, Missy, try to maintain
Ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky
I can't stand the rain

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I— I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I can't stand the rain

I feel the wind
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten (Nine, ten)
Begin, I sit on hills like Lauryn
Until the rain starts coming down, pouring
Chill, I got my umbrella
My finger waves these days, they fall like Humpty
Chumpy, I break up with him before he dump me
To have me, yes, you lucky (I can't stand the rain)
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I— I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I— I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain8Embed
