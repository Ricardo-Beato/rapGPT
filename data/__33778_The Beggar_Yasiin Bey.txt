Woman you know I love you
Woman you know just how I feel
You try to tell me that you don't know
When I know you know the deal
Woman you know I love you
Woman you know I care...
Hey
You try to say
I'm running game
You try to say baby you don't play fair
Oh darling
If there is any doubt in your mind
I want you to be sure...
Heeeey
If you don't ever see me again
I want you to be sure
That I love you
Oh girl
Oh baby I love you
Darling I love you...
Hey
Oh darling I love you...
Hey

You got to understand how I feel
You need to understand where I'm coming from
Ain't no need to be afraid
Ain't no need to get up and run
Oh darling
Oh girl you know I love you
Oh darling

Oh baby
If you never see me again
I need you to be sure
From this moment right now
Till for ever more

Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love
You, love you, love you, love you...
