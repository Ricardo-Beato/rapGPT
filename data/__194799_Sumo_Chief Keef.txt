Sosa, sumo sumo
I got 4, I got sumo, Chopsquad
Are you a sumo? I got 22. Bang bang
Sosa sumo, yeah, yeah, yeah, bang bang

Sumo, ayy, sumo, ayy, sumo, ayy, sumo, ayy
Sumo, ayy, sumo, ayy, sumo, ayy, sumo, gang
Call me Sosa Sumo, gang, pull up with that you-know
That Breitling in that four door, gang, I don't like no two door, ayy
Sumo, sumo sumo (Sosa Sumo), sumo sumo, ayy
Sumo, sumo sumo (Yeah), sumo sumo (Bang)
Pull up wit that you know (Skrt), yo thottie in that glue though
She gon' let me fuck though (Gang), 'cause I own my jewels though

Are you sumo flexin'? Are you sumo flexin'?
When you pull up do you hop out flexin' like you sumo wrestlin'?
Ayy, are you connected? Have your jewels been tested?
Do you smoke tooka pack, man? Or you smoke fooka pack, man
Ayy, I hopped up out that vroom, like I just hopped out of Cooley
Got a tech with them damn coolin' kit, I spit it, now it's shootin' shit (Bang)
My house got a pool and shit, I be on my sumo shit
I cannon ball up in the water, I swear I just be doin' shit (I gang gang)
Watch bling like Gucci shit, chain bling like Tunechi shit
I swear I be sumo flexin', I be on my Rakishi shit
I be on my Beamer shit, 'member Mitsubishi shit
Gettin' all this money, I swear that they not send me shit but (Gang)
