Bark if you want nigga
I gots to let you know, I got them things
That'll get you gone nigga
When it's on nigga, we call it backfire
We air niggas out, it's like a flat tire
We some grown men, on some grown shit
On some "you best leave me the fuck alone" shit
We get it on quick, you know what type of shit this is
But we ain't getting drunk cause we don't need no witnesses
FUCK YOU to the judge, FUCK YOU to the police
Fuck the snitch in his fuckin ass, with no grease
We don't want no peace, war 'til we die
And we gon' get it in 'til we fall or we fly

Get your money up! (What!) Get your paper
Right! (Yeah!)
Get your money up! (What!) Get your paper
Right! (Yeah!)
Get your money up! (What!) Get your paper
Right! (Yeah!)
And watch a nigga do his thing for real
AIGHT?

Back on the grind, back on the clock
Comin back for mine, back on the block
The kid is, back with the Glock to stick niggas up
Hear that meat wagon, come pick niggas up
What nigga, WHAT? You keep a dick in yo' mouth
I'm from New York, but I'm STILL the shit in the South
Motherfuckers don't wan' know about the Dog
And I ain't got no friend for, all of y'all
Look, shit now here gon' change nigga, for real!
Red dot on yo' brain nigga, for real!
I ain't got time for the bullshit
Y'all niggas is mutts, I'm a full Pit on my way to the pulpit

Get your money up! (What!) Get your paper
Right! (Yeah!)
Get your money up! (What!) Get your paper
Right! (Yeah!)
Get your money up! (What!) Get your paper
Right! (Yeah!)
And watch a nigga do his thing for real
