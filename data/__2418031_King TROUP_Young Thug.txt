I just asked God why he called for Troup
When it's time to ride, if you love 'em, nigga, prove it
(Wheezy Beats)
You know all your lil' niggas gon' shoot shit up for you
I thought I seen a ghost because your son look like you, fool
King Troup

Action (Thugga!)
I hop out, I'm dabbin' (Hop out, I'm dabbin')
My old lady classy (My old lady clean)
We on to this fashion (Yes, we drippin')
My coupe sittin' on Davins (Skr-skr, skrr)
Hop out with a bad bitch (Hop out with a bad bitch)
My faculty braggin' (What?)
My briefs, they high fashion (Swear)
She naked, I walk through the door (I swear)
I promise, I promise she know (I promise)
I pour up a four and got more (Lean-lean)
I'm cold as the North fuckin' Pole (Brr)
I came a long way from the stove (Long way)
I hop in the foreign, go slow (I hop in the- skrrrrr)
Iced out, ain't no time in it, oh
Oh-oh-oh

Thugga!
I just beat the case (Just beat the case)
I hopped out the Benz (Hopped out the- skrr)
I just fucked some twins (I just fucked 'em bitches)
Had the jewelry in (I did)
I hopped out again (I hopped out and what?)
Pulled up in the Range (Pull up and skrr)
Got drank in my cup (Got drank in my- lean-lean)
Like I'm Kirko Bangz (Get)
From ashy to classy (Ashy)
Keep up with my ice and my fashion (Yeah)
I take care of my kid with a passion (Yah)
I pray to God that they stay happy (God)
Lil Roscoe, he sleep where it's nasty (I swear)
They could've freed him 'cause he grew up with no daddy (Forreal)
But instead, they took advantage and did him badly (Fuck)
Ain't give no fucks 'cause we were saddened
Got a camera from the club and that's all they had (Free the goat)
They also knew that lil' nigga didn't have a wagon (Free the goat)
Damn

Action (Yeah, yeah)
I hop out, I'm dabbin' (Hop out, I'm dabbin')
My old lady classy (My old lady clean)
We onto this fashion (We onto these drips)
My coupe sittin' on Davins (My coupe sittin' on- skrr)
Hop out with a bad bitch (Hop out with a bitch)
My faculty braggin' (Brag)
My briefs, they high fashion
She naked, I walk through the door (Ayy)
I promise, I promise she know (Yeah)
I pour up a four and got more (Yeah)
I'm cold as the North fuckin' Pole (Yah)
I came a long way from the stove (Yah)
I hop in the foreign, go slow (I hop in the- skrrrrr)
Iced out, ain't no time in it, oh
Oh-oh-oh
Stop it (Stop it), stop the killin' (Stop the killin')
We (We), we get millions (We get millions)
We together (We together), get the cheddar (Get them racks)
Fuck them niggas (Fuck 'em, fuck 'em)
Keep a Beretta (Keep a Beretta)
Let 'em have it (Let 'em have it)
Ask God for forgiveness for them babies (Sorry God)
You know Slimes with it, baby, baby (Baby, baby)
Stack them racks up to the ceiling, hey, hey (Hey, hey)
Fuck you a nigga's old lady
Keep 'em mad and that's how you know you doin' good (Keep 'em mad)
Keep embarrassin' them with racks that look like books (You keep some racks)
I'm so finished (Finished with what?)
With these bitches (With these hoes)
I need me a real one (Need me a real)
I need commitment (Where ya at?)

Hop out with a bad bitch (Hop out with a bad bitch)

She naked, I walk through the door (She know it)
I promise, I promise she know (I promise, I promise)
