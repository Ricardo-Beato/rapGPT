I be nollie tre flippin' on your block, straight cruising
Tre- tre flippin' on your block, straight cruising
Nollie tre flippin on your block, straight cruising
Tre- tre- flippin' on your block, straight cruising

Nollie tre flippin on your block straight cruising
Ankle wrapped up a while back, a nigga bruised it
Who's this fresh ass nigga with the steelo?
A vicious ego, he hardly ever land in primo
He always got a brand new deck wherever he go
Flexin' on niggas at the park like Debo
He keep the hot spots on the d-low
If he snap a board, DGK'll hook him up with the reload
Never get it mixed up, I'm the one with big nuts
Hitting everything regular, because my switch sucks
Play SK8, you'll get fucked, see I likes to kick butt
Hole in my shoe 'cause that's the spot where all my grip rubs
I'm in the valley with a bunch of street vandals
We maneuver boards with a clean handle like Kareem Campbell
Soon, I'll be rolling through your neighborhood probably
So, don't be scared to holler if your ass fucking spot me

I be nollie tre flippin' on your block, straight cruising
Tre- tre flippin' on your block, straight cruising
Nollie tre flippin on your block, straight cruising
Tre- tre- flippin' on your block, straight cruising

Who can bust like this? Wicked frontside flips
Only one try bitches want to touch my dick
The homie Manny know a school with a spot so proper
So we go hop the gate and hope the cops don't spot us
We mad and fucking senseless, waxing up the benches
Get the cameras out because we stacking up the tricks
Bitch, kickflip backtail was on my hit-list
Until this nigga P-Rod came and did the shit switch
Saw a handrail and figured I could bust on it
Tried to boardslide and hit my fucking nuts on it
Stupid homies hyped me up look at my ass now
'Bout to pass out, man I'm only skating flat ground
Some days I feel like I suck and never try stuff
Until I watch a skate video and get hyped up
You phony niggas tryna rap, better pipe down
This shit isn't just a trend homie it's a lifestyle

I be nollie tre flippin' on your block, straight cruising
Tre- tre flippin' on your block, straight cruising
Nollie tre flippin on your block, straight cruising
Tre- tre- flippin' on your block, straight cruising

Now wait just a minute trick, yo, this kid is sick
How the fuck this nigga doing tres with the ninja kick?
I still got 'em fresher than a loaf of bread
If you witness one you'll probably throw your board away and just go home instead
Blazing up the hubba on this skating little suckers
They ain't brave enough so they say I'm a crazy motherfucker
Yes, best believe I'm that raw, you don't have to ask dog
I been doing this since you were semen in your dad's balls
So much pop you would think I'm bout to blast off
So fucking high when I land I crack the asphalt
G'd up shoes the color of cherry kool-aid
Hat back, with no belt in my pants, just a shoe lace
Skating legends mean mugging yo, when will these niggas learn?
It's been 10 minutes and I still can't seem to get a turn
If I never go pro fuck it yo, I ain't tripping
Long as I look fly as fuck when I be nollie tre flipping
I be nollie tre flippin' on your block, straight cruising
Tre- tre flippin' on your block, straight cruising
Nollie tre flippin on your block, straight cruising
Tre- tre- flippin' on your block, straight cruising18Embed
