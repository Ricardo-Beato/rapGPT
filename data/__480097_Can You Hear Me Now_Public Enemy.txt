7 ContributorsCan You Hear Me Now Lyrics
Somebody in the house say, "Yeah!"
If y'all really like to rock the funky beats, somebody say, "Hell yeah!"
I like that from the people up top, check this out

Damn if I be some slave again
Got no fake ass friends and no timbs or rims
Sure 'nuff, got no designer names
And I never played no video games
(Don't) I ain't got no diamond rings
No bling, and no minks and no two earrings
And no pimp glasses mugs or cups and things
Or whatever the hell they all be carryin'
Don't treat my highs too high or my lows too low
You won't see my soul sold on no video
Don't need no cheques to get no chicks
Or be some hypocrite to get you on my dick
(Back) So let the young sing and rap to the young
As long as y'all don't think freedom is free to be dumb, now

Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
(Say "ho!")
(Yo Chuck, kick it to 'em, man!)
You might also like
Its suicidal to think I'm your American idol
Hypnotic trapped in some three thousand mile box
Chicks bobby socks, today be Botox
Now that hip-hop's the new so called rock
Parents dressin' the outside
Of their kids and what they wear instead of stressin' the inside
Way back, my peoples gave me pride
Now in 2004, I ain't gotta hide
If you can't afford it just leave it to the side
Cause you looking real stupid with that tear in your eye
Gotta a '94 and I hear you talkin'
But its damn sure better than walkin'
It might be old, you know it sure ain't gold
And it's better than stylin' in the cold
It ain't no rolls, and won't get stole
But you won't see me walking on no side of the road

Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
(Say "ho!")
(Yo Chuck, kick it to 'em, man!)
At the age I am now, if I can't teach
I shouldn't even open up my mouth to begin to speak
I need some radio to help me reach
But I heard (radio!) they get their money on by makin' you weak
Drowning in the sea of some big dose of now
No past no future Let the young grow wild
Ain't gave em nothin' some done robbed the child
From substance ont currr , fill em up with style
Like hip-hop started on TRL
Like wow, took the game and made it a damn shame
Hell with history, you don't even Know my name
I ain't the same damn thing That y'all used to playin'
Im that non stop rocket heading to your brain
Now that's what I'm sayin'

Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
(Say "ho!")
(Yo Chuck, kick it to 'em, man!)
I may not got no flow but I ain't pimped by no negro
Backed by some cracka with his ass by the door
Therefore I can never be poor
Cause my mind, body, and soul cannot be sold
Priceless, so i avoid the triflin'
Words in my cipher, stuff y'all can't get enough off
Got's no time for somebody's jail
My time is just like the US Mail
My time is richer Than them new Astro Pitchers
I be damned if my face be under some picture
Where you heard the N-word So save your liquid
P.E., we just here to flip it
Find somebody new to get with
The next time you hear
A cat who can't stand or even look in the mirror

Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me now
(Say "ho!")
(Yo Chuck, kick it to 'em, man!)Embed
