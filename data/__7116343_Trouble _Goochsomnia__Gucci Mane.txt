Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma be there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex 
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma be there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex 

 statis
When your ex see me, she see baddness
 back now
Now she in the club, saying how she want him back now
 security 
 girl  we know
 the club 

Trouble, trouble, troublе, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma bе there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex 
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma be there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex 
You might also like
I'm a problem child,  trouble
 K in the Gucci bag duffle
 stayed in the 
 the feds 
 on the kitchen table, mama didn't know what to do
 playing hoola hoop
I was eating frooty loops
 bad boy, shine like Diddy do
 trying, ain't never seen 
I'm just from the city, where everybody killing
You put us on TV, like we down here chilling
You tryna get a milli, no I can't take 
 girl

Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma be there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex 
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma be there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex 

Gucci!
 too hot to handle
Swag so sick, make 
 have you flying to Atlanta
Gucci Mane 
I like getting rich  girls 
I had a girl  but she kept 
Gucci!
Hold up, hold up
 ho  and you need to stop calling
Hold up, hold up
He told me how you treated him bad, no need to hate on the low, we balling
All my girls that got your own man
Put 'em up  nobody else's man
Put 'em up
 trouble

Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma be there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex 
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma be there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex 
Oo wee, girl you in trouble
 I'm just 
 in trouble
All the rappers in trouble, tell your wife I think I love her
Gucci!

Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma be there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex 
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Imma be there when your ex 
Imma be there when your ex Embed
