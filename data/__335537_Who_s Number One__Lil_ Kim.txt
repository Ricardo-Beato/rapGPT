12 ContributorsWhoâ€™s Number One? Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen
(Come on throw your hands in the air like this one time)
One-two, this thing on right here
(We ain't gonna stop)
Can y'all hear me out there?
(And we want everyone in this motherfucker to get up out their seat)
Ladies and gentlemen, without further adieu
(It's our time)
I'd like to introduce to you, my bitch

Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap
I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats
Trying to take my crown, I ain't letting that go down
I cop the four pound and go the whole twelve rounds, yeah
You broke hoes need to throw in the towel
Life's a wheel of fortune and y'all can't buy a vowel
Who me? That's none of your concern
Like ashes in the urn, more money to burn
Damn my ass is firm, stay away from germs
Pussy flawless, get wetter than worms
If you only knew like Aaliyah
How your man be hawking me and stalking me
When he fucking you he see me
Every crack vial or record he sell I get a piecey
Easy, believe me, my words is credible
Ask Nat Cole huh, I'm unforgettable
Don't let the QB get a hold of your guy
Sex him well, get him high, he might fuck around and die
You might also like
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)

Your so-called vendetta was light like bird feathers
Even with an umbrella, you can't stop my hurricane
I moved on to bigger and better things
Y'all still making minimum wage
First on stage, like the Ever I glazed
Leave you amazed, and keep the fifth by the rib cage
All you jealous ass hoes', rebellious ass hoes'
Still trying to recoup off the first album ass hoes'
You a gangster? Prove it. Wanna shoot me? Do it
That's word to Jerry McGuire, I'll set that ass on fire
Tie you up with barbed wire, carve my name in your face
Pour gasoline on you, drop you at the gas station
Y'all chicks ain't blind, I shine like polyurethane
Cocoa butter cream, vaseline and drugs baby like codeine
Low self-esteem? Uh-uh, the flow is excellent
Yours is satisfactory, return them to the factory
I mean practically, the shit is wack to me
Mama bear, finally out of hibernating
Here to tell you chicks to stop tail-gating
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)

It's the B-I-G-M-A-M-A
Often tipsy, cabin in Poughkeepsie
I've been in this shit since Biz hit the
One-two, nothing left to do
Move it in there, cathedral ceilings
Don't come to my house, it might hurt your feelings
P.Diddy introduced me to the business side
Spotted me a few mill and a couple of oil spills
That's how we do it, you chicks is no frills
Doin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels
Stealin' tricycles, ridin' bicycles
Our diamonds be so white they look like icicles
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts
On the countdown (giggles) - don't make me laugh
Got my own company, I'm chief of the staff
They say we twins, then I'm the better half
I'm nasty! Worse than Howard Stern
This court is adjourned, and now it's your turn, bitch!
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)
I guess you know by now who's number one
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from
(Number one)
So if you got beef, you better think again
(Number one)
Cause you can't win
(You can't win)

Can you feel me?
I just wanna know if y'all can feel me
I just wanna know if y'all can feel me out there
It's not a game, we're back
And this time we're not going anywhere
Number one, that's my bitch
Recognize! Ya feel me?Embed
