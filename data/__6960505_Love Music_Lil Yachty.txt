25 ContributorsLove Music Lyrics
All I, all I ever heard was good things
Good things about you and your ways
All I ever do is think of you
Think of you and me holding hands

At the school dance
No, no, no, we're just friends
Hope that we can be more
I dreamed of you last night
You had on a big old gown and a wedding ring, you were my wife
Baby, you were my wife
Baby, you run my life
Girl, I don't know where we will stand if we do not dance, you are my type
Baby, you are my type

All I, all I ever heard was good things
Good things about you and your ways
All I ever do is think of you (Yeah)
Think of you and me holding hands

Will I ever forget you? Something I cannot do, I am all burned out
I only want you in my face, everyone else in my space can get the fuck on out
You stole my heart, one day, broke on the floor
Gaze in your eyes, I don't need nothin' more
The quicker picker upper, you are mi amor, for sure
I'll put a bounty on you for your love
Driving through counties to meet you for love
Don't ever doubt me, I'll always show up
You might also like
All I, all I ever heard was good things (Oh, yeah)
Good things about you and your ways (Ooh)
All I ever do is think of you (Yeah, yeah)
Think of you and me holding hands
