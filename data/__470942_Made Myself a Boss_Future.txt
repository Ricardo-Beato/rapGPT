15 ContributorsMade Myself a Boss Lyrics
Streetz Calling!
Future, future
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, ay!

I walk on Jimmy, got the smoke on loud
I got perfect attendance, bring that work to yo town
Cause I made myself a boss I made myself I made myself a boss
I made myself a boss, I made myself a boss
I paid my grandma rent, and got my lil sister a house
I keep a pocket full of money any time I'm stepping out
Cause I my made myself a boss, I made myself a boss
I made myself a boss, Yeah I made myself a boss

I'm walking on a stack of tens, so every step is immaculate
All this fucking cash I count, you gon' think I inherit it
I’m a free band nigga on a heroship
All we do is inherit bricks
Come and get some water whips
I’m on cancun on a water trip
I’ll take that cash and flip that cash
Go to 5th and I’ll spaz
Versace, (?) Bally bags
Got a phone book inside my pants
Got racks in left and right pocket, you know we call them football pads
When I re-up, got to use a ladder when I count them bands
Ay! I talking to Diego, I need 20 I'm in Clay Co
They gon go in like an hour
Money, cars, bad bitches, good powder
With a good connect, you can jug 100 thousand

I walk on Jimmy, got the smoke on loud
I got perfect attendance, bring that work to yo town
Cause I made myself a boss I made myself I made myself a boss
I made myself a boss, I made myself a boss
I paid my grandma rent, and got my lil sister a house
I keep a pocket full of money anytime I'm stepping out
Cause I my made myself a boss, I made myself a boss
I made myself a boss, Yeah I made myself a boss

I dress up in Jimmy, and got it cheap like Wendy
Ain’t got a driver that ending, Ima push to the limit
I take highway chances, with these rap advances
I got mouths to feed and I ain’t leaving them stranded
I go head on with the that paper like a bull
I get hungry every time when I get full (I get money)
Bitch I’m Tony in my city I got pull
55 Chevy and it got them doors
I don't wanna drive it, got he stack put up
I'm an antique owner, and I'm as hot as a sauna
Coming straight from the corner selling kush marijuana
Put my hood on TV, look at those shoes on me

I walk on Jimmy, got the smoke on loud
I got perfect attendance, bring that work to yo town
Cause I made myself a boss I made myself I made myself a boss
I made myself a boss, I made myself a boss
I paid my grandma rent, and got my lil sister a house
I keep a pocket full of money any time I'm stepping out
Cause I my made myself a boss, I made myself a boss
I made myself a boss, Yeah I made myself a boss2Embed
