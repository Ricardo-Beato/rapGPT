20 ContributorsBig Worm Lyrics
(T-T-T-T-T-Think we found a loop hole)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

Gave you more than a million, told you, "It's yours, baby", yeah
Gave you more than a mission, love is war, baby, yeah
Gave you one big missile, two big bombs, baby, yeah
Gave you one big kiss and these two arms, baby

Gotta meet a nigga halfway, I'm just a call away
You can use me for your band-aid, I'll put your scars away
And you know I come with some pressure, you gotta be certain
Too picky, I cannot just fall for any person
Too picky, gotta be for me and promise not to turn, yeah
She keep her spliff on Deebo and I keep my blunt on Big Worm, yeah
Uh, jealousy towards me happens so often
Far from egotistic, I done told you that I need you, yeah
Too many fake ones out there, ain't hard for me to see through them
When they know you way way up there, they just wanna see you land
I don't wanna stand if you ain't standing by my side, no oh
I cross the T's baby, you dot the I's, oh oh

Gave you more than a million, told you, "It's yours, baby"
Gave you more than a mission, love is war, baby
Gave you one big missile, two big bombs, baby
Gave you one big kiss and these two arms, baby, yeah

Gotta meet a nigga halfway, I'm just a call away
Gotta meet a nigga halfway or meet me all the way
Use me for your band-aid, I'll put your scars away
Too picky, I cannot just fall for any person
Too picky, gotta be for me and promise not to turn, yeah
Gotta build a bridge from you to me and promise not to burn it
Although jealousy towards me happens so often
You know they gon' be focusing on everything that we do, yeah
Far from egotistic, I done told you that I need you, yeah
Too many fake ones out there, ain't hard for me to read through that
I don't wanna stand if you ain't standing by my side, no oh
And if you like magic, baby, that's a body high, oh oh
Jealousy towards me happens so often
These hoes just tired, they're exhausted
Been sending shots and whatnot, tick tick tock, it's crunch time
Can't give a thot a minute of my bustdown 'cause for you I

Gave you more than a million, told you, "It's yours, baby", yeah
Gave you more than a mission, love is war, baby, yeah
Gave you one big missile, two big bombs, baby
Gave you one big kiss and these two arms, baby

Gotta meet a nigga halfway, I'm just a call away
You can use me for your band-aid, I'll put your scars away
And you know I come with some pressure, gotta be certain
Too picky, I cannot just fall for any person
Too picky, gotta be for me and promise not to turn, yeah
She keep her spliff on Deebo and I keep my blunt on Big Worm, yeah
You know they gon' be focusing on everything that we do, yeah
Far from egotistic, I done told you that I need you, yeah2Embed
