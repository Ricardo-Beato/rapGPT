12 ContributorsOnly A Case Lyrics
Look, I went got my own shit, how you 'gon knock that?
Pulled up in drop coupes, shit with the top back
Handle my business plus when they pop always pop back
I'm back in Denver, figure niggas ain't got that
Look where my stocks at, you study my process
Niggas is crawfish, Me? I'm a Loch Ness
Whenever I drop that, they feelin' like Pac back
Hussle in Crenshaw is like O'shea in a Sox Hat
Classic L.A., nigga, stay out my way, nigga
We ain't the same nigga, simple and plain
From reputation in these streets to where you sit on your plane
What you did for your fame?
How much you paid for your chains?
Tryna kick it with the Crips so he can say that he bang
You know he ain't from the gang, that nigga playin' with flames
Got a hunnid young niggas still dealin' with pain
Put a hole in your brain just for claimin' the fame
Look, We know your type, afraid of a fade
Iâ€™m ashamed when I say it, but, shit, a spade is a spade
And me? My transition got me showered in praise
From the streets to the stage, to changin' the game
International Nip Hussle, the current exchange
Once you travel the world, you ain't returnin' the same
Got a Persian in my place, put a bird in my safe
Conscious of rainy days, so it's only a case
Yuh, I know my homies relate
Get rich or do life, shit, it's only a case
My style spody like the 40's would say
All money, yeah, nigga, that's the holiest faith (Haha)
You might also like
It's only a case, knock a fuckin' hole in ya face
Headed to the top in a lane with no space (Motherfucker)
Don't make me load up this K
Nigga, it's only a case
Put a hole in ya face
Nigga, it's only a K
Knock off ya face
(So stay the fuck up out my lane)

I used to stand on the corner with my rocks and guns
Sell yay by the gram, see the cops, we run
Get cracked at the county, squabble niggas for fun
Before you even make your mattress, nigga, where you from?
Made bail, hit the block in my 501s
I was just young and livin' reckless with more drama to come
Got the hood tatted on me 'cause the damage was done
Real certified nigga get respect where I'm from
I ain't really gotta tell you, you can tell where I'm from
Ruthless, scandalous, crafty niggas hate where I'm from
Only the strongest survive in the hood I'm from
Get yo chain and you life snatched away where I'm from
Point blank, straight facts so they know me as semi
Besides the bullshit I'm on the grind chasing a milli
Politicking with some youngins that be loading up semis
Smoke blunts, no fenis, we terrorizin' your city
Drink 'tron out the bottle, goin' hard on my kidneys
I'm gettin' money out of town, some niggas climb through chimneys
Do yo thang, pimpin', robbin', squabbin' & jackin'
Whatever it takes for the money, shit, go 'head, get it crackin'
Nip's on a marathon and got 'em runnin' they laps
Some niggas took it out of line and got to runnin' they yaps
Now I'm screaming O-M-G, I hope they fuckin' with that
Money all on top of money, got 'em stackin' to that
Bullets all on top of bullets, they don't jam, they clap
They say bullets ain't got no name, I wrote his name on the back
Shit, I'm G.I. Joe and ain't no holdin' me back
I'm still screamin' O-M-G, I hope they fuckin' with that
Hope they fuckin' with that, I hope they fuckin' with that
I'm still screamin' O-M-G, I hope they fuckin' with that
Know they fuckin' with that, I know they fuckin' with that
I'm still screamin' out O-M-G, I know the yfuckin' with that
Yeah, nigga
It's only a case, knock a fuckin' hole in ya face
Headed to the top in a lane with no space (Motherfucker)
Don't make me load up this K
Nigga, it's only a case
Put a hole in ya face
Nigga, it's only a K
Knock off ya face
(So stay the fuck up out my lane)

It's only a case
Knock a hole in ya (Motherfucker)
It's only a, haah
Yeah, it's only a case (Hahaha)
Knock a hole in ya (Nigga, hah)
Hah, so stay the fuck up out my lane5Embed
