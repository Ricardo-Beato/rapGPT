3 ContributorsBirthday Money Lyrics
Yo, yo
Okay, okay, okay

Man, I got songs to write, homework due
10 P.M. and I'm overdue
Sunday night, hit the sack
Wake up next day go to school
Life sucks, but not really though
Currently, man, I'm  flow
Heard of me, man, I'm ill and dope
Murder beats then I kill the flow
And I'm doin' me, son, you ain't comin' close
Take you outta your comfort zone
Bust a flow and I run the show
'Bout to cut you short like summer clothes
I go in on my B-Day
Go out for that cheesecake
Stay up late with a plate of cake
And a young boy still tryna make that bank
They say it's toward my college fund
I just hope that college fun
All they throw is hunnids 'cause they glad that I'm their daughter's son
Ridin' round now I'm well behaved
Working hard 'til my wealth is safe
Mess with me and you melt away, man, name a rapper do well as me
I'm straight to the point Tim Hardaway
Got 'em jelly, like marmalade
I'ma go hard 'til the bar is raised
She got me sprung like March to May
It's Harlow, man, I'm too raw
Spit foul, no loose ball
Got 'em sayin', "Dang", 'cause I'm ballin' like 
Ceiling on that roof attached, I'm movin' back, you dudes is wackYou might also likeEmbed
