58 ContributorsEdge of the Earth / Post Mortem Boredom Lyrics

This is a special presentation
Hello everybody
Hello everybody
Hello everybody
Hello everybody
Hello everybody
Come on down
Hmm-mm
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Eh-eh-eh-eh

Hanging on the edge of the earth
Oh, what a beautiful scene
Oh, what a beautiful ending to see
Laying on a cliff, staring at the stars
Oh, what a beautiful scene
Oh, what a beautiful ending

Bits and pieces are wrong with me
If so won't you sing along with me?
Here's one more for the people lost in insanity (Oh, oh, oh)
Cover your wounds, don't show your scars
Smile for friends and carry on
Here's one more for the people lost in insanity (Oh, oh, oh)
You might also like
Hanging on the edge of the earth
Oh, what a beautiful scene
Oh, what a beautiful ending to see
Laying on a cliff, staring at the stars
Oh, what a beautiful scene
Oh, what a beautiful ending
Oh, what a beautiful ending
Oh, what a beautiful ending (Hmm-mm-mm)

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh


"There is an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins. (Wait, this mic) They appear to be in a kind of trance, others describe them as being..." (Ha, ha, ha, ha)

Just a bit
Muah
Yeah, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Oh, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
The angels have no whiskey, na-a-a-a-a-a
Can't say I'm not disappointed, na-a-a-a-a-a
Yeah, I'm in the thick of it, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I was sick of being sickened, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
The sun is always beating, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Oh, I'm sick)
(Hmm-mm-mm, oh, oh, oh)
Post-mortem boredom settling in my skin
(Hmm-mm-mm-mm)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
