7 ContributorsSo Cold (Interlude) Lyrics
When I reach down my Tru's, I pulled out a big bankroll
As I scrolled down my contacts, I got over a hundred-some hoes
Here he go right here, hold on
What you doing?
Uh, kinda busy
What you mean "Kinda busy"?
Iâ€™m-I'm kinda busy, stop it (Shh, be quiet)
Who the hell you're talking to?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Who is that? Future over there or something?You might also likeEmbed
