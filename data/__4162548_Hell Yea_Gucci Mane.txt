3 ContributorsHell Yea Lyrics
A thousand  of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich
Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit
Hell yeah, this that president Bush shit
A thousand  of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich
Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit
Hell yeah, this that president Bush shit
Hell yeah

This that  kush shit
My girlfriend think she president Bush, bitch
Hell yeah, and I'm gone off that lean shit
My brother Duke keep on sendin' me that green shit
Fuck jail, Gucci time, man I'm hood rich
I'm in that Zone 6, I throw it like the first pitch
My yellow 'Rari in the front and I parked it
A black chick in some heels match the carpet
I'm pullin' up to the club like I own it
Ain't with that bullshit, Gucci don't condone it
My tolerance get low with the flexin'
I woke up, bought my main chick a Lexus

A thousand  of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich
Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit
Hell yeah, this that president Bush shit
A thousand  of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich
Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit
Hell yeah, this that president Bush shit
Hell yeah

I be the brick squad youngin', leave you stankin' like a funyon
On these other rap nigga's toes like a bunion
I'm BS, and you BS, but I'm Brick Squad, you the Bull Shit
Pistol like my chaperone, we goin' on a school trip
Places that you never seen, blowin' on that stupid green
Rollin' on a stupid beam, hit the scene in limousines
Codeine and Promethazine, diamonds in my pinky ring
Nigga what the fuck you mean?
Brick Squad, dream team
I got money to blow, naw, I ain't Drizzy
Money make the world go 'round, that's why I'm dizzy
Standin' behind Gucci, Flock, they like "Who is he?"
Slim Dunkin in this muhfucka, cut the chizzy

A thousand  of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich
Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit
Hell yeah, this that president Bush shit
A thousand  of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich
Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit
Hell yeah, this that president Bush shit
Hell yeah
It's Big Gucci, excuse me while I ball
Until my release my nigga, no lights out
Lights out, creep on in silence
Why do I promote violence while nonviolent?
Why my tattoos smilin'?
To remind me of the time they robbed me with no problems
Now my problem solvin' is revolvin'
Around all these 
And my company stretch from here to Compton to Bouldercrest
 say Bompton
That's somethin' to those who have nothin'
No bluffin', Brick Squad, no cuffin'

A thousand  of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich
Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit
Hell yeah, this that president Bush shit
A thousand  of that mid shit
Hell yeah, this that shit that get your kids rich
Hell yeah, a hundred bags of that kush shit
Hell yeah, this that president Bush shit
Hell yeahEmbed
