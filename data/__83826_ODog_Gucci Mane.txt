11 ContributorsODog Lyrics
I'm a thuuuuuuuug
Even though I wanna change my life and get it right
To the judge, I'm always gon' be a thuuug
Like O-Dog, "Menace II Society"
They wanna see me underground
But I just bought a plane, hey, hey
Sky is the limit now; my jet just took off the ground now
And ain't nobody gon' stop my destiny, destiny, no no no
Ladies night - pop a bottle now
Cause the wear just came off now
From doin'; time in the penitentiary, yeah
And if you come from the ghetto and you feel like a champion
Let me see you put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)

The sun beamin' on my chick in my {?}
Feelin' hipper than a hippie in a tye-dye shirt
Gucci Mane motherfucker and the earth my turf
Ice cold, buzz hotter than July 1st
Oooh, this the type of tune make a dime choose
He make it rain, then I can make it monsoon
I buy a bitch out her contract, dumb stacks
Suckers sleepin' on me Zantax, I'm deadly
I'm talkin' Anthrax, the other side of the tracks
You know the Amtrak; multi-millionaire still rockin' amulets
I was turnt up to the mess but now I'm past that
But now I'm past that
I move stealth, I'm gettin' jealous of myself
Me and Wyclef and the swagger's SoSoDef
Smoke pounds of that 'dro 'dro from out West
And I ain't made at no one cause I'm oh so blessed
It's Gucci
You might also like
I'm a thuuuuuuuug
Even though I wanna change my life and get it right
To the judge, I'm always gon' be a thuuug
Like O-Dog, "Menace II Society"
They wanna see me underground
But I just bought a plane, hey, hey
Sky is the limit now; my jet just took off the ground now
And ain't nobody gon' stop my destiny, destiny, no no no
Ladies night - pop a bottle now
Cause the wear just came off now
From doin'; time in the penitentiary, yeah
And if you come from the ghetto and you feel like a champion
Let me see you put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)

Tired of all these late nights, smoked out shit
Ain't no mo' leavin' the club three or fo' bad chicks
I ain't goin' to the lot, coppin' no mo' whips
I ain't drinkin', all the pills, I'm all done, I quit
Psych! I'm poppin' wheelies with a dime on the bike
My baby right, she whispered in my ear tonight is the night
I'm higher than a kite, bright ice, in need of a light
Pilot lighter light it homey as I lean to my stripe
Ye ain't freshest out here, ye ain't ballin like me
Baby talk can't comprehend, talkin' foreign to more
Purple label, Polo, Revlon on me
I'm the big homey, you a big phony (well damn!)
Makin' movies in the V.I.P. I need a Tony
Gucci Mane Tarantino with the tendonitis
Pour 80 bottles in her face, now she dancin' on me
She know she dancin' with a star them diamonds dancin' on me
It's Gucci
I'm a thug
Even though I wanna change my life and get it right
To the judge, I'm always gon' be a thug
Like O-Dog, "Menace II Society"
They wanna see me underground
But I just bought a plane, hey, hey
Sky is the limit now; my jet just took off the ground now
And ain't nobody gon' stop my destiny, destiny, no no no
Ladies night - pop a bottle now
Cause the wear just came off now
From doin; time in the penitentiary, yeah
And if you come from the ghetto and you feel like a champion
Let me see you put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)

It's Gucci1Embed
