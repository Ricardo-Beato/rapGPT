4 ContributorsSister Good Gameâ€™s Testimony Lyrics
You know I went to sleep no stressing
And I woke up to a blessing
I got the whole city back guessing
"How in the hell she catch that blessing?"
Give em the game for free, I really should have charged a fee
All this killing in the streets
Black on black crime
Young men taking life, and you're putting em in your own hands
But let me give you a little game, and a little knowledge (chuckles)
You better pay close attention to this, right
The killing must stop
Y'all black mens, it's bigger than that
As soon as you get banged up, right?
You'll be down that joint, with two suit and a lock up
No green dots, no Visits
Your main bitch, you know where she be at, right?
Fucking your bottom nigga, your best nigga
So you better think
You think about what lives you're going to destroy
How many families you're gon' hurt
But guess what, you lose everything
Right before you go to sleep at night, you pray
You pray to God for a change
You gotta change
Free every nigga in the chain gang
Free my son
Free my familyYou might also likeEmbed
