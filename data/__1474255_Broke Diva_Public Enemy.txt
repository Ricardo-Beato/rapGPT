2 ContributorsBroke Diva Lyrics
Public Enemy
Yeah, boy!

See I work, she don't work
But she's the first to curse when shit don't work
I take my ass around the Earth
So she can spend my money first, okay?
I forgot how we became two people, a couple
Damn sure not financially equal
She lost me when it started to cost me
Lost me when she tried to outfloss me

Tried to boss me, tried to outfloss me
I just don't need her, broke diva
It ain't cheaper to keep her
Should I love her or leave her?
I just don't need another broke diva

Y'all should hear her, always in the mirror
You should see her, some of y'all wish to be her
GETTING UP IN THE AFTERNOON
WHILE THE WHOLE WORLD
2-3OCLOCK
I BEEN UP AND DOWN THE BLOCK
Gotta tell this woman to bounce
Buying these designer tags she can't pronounce
With my bank account down and out
She ain't even got the nerve to count
You might also like
Tried to boss me, tried to outfloss me
I just don't need her, broke diva
It ain't cheaper to keep her
Should I love her or leave her?
I just don't need another broke diva

Hard odd, got jacked up credit cards
Exotic cars
With notes paid off from the checks she wrote
I hope she knows I ain't no casino
I got a job, you gotta go
Don't get it twisted
If you're trying to be famous for being famous, I missed it
You still want me to kick out
Baby, I just did you out
Flavor Flav!

Tried to boss me, tried to outfloss me
I just don't need her, broke diva
It ain't cheaper to keep her
Should I love her or leave her?
I just don't need another broke divaEmbed
