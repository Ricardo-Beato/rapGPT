47 ContributorsForever World Lyrics
And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love...

Love me forever, girl
My mind racin', I'm with you, girl
Huh, yeah
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah
Forever mine, forever mine, forever mine
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah

Baby hol' up
Pull up, Lamborghini, lift the door up
Baby know I'm slime, real slime like a boa
Baby, you a dime, I put diamonds from your neck to your toe-a
Baby, you worry too much
I get my vibe through your touch
Fuckin' thots, that's not enough
Sleepin' in the whip, no house
No guap, baby girl, huh, that's that real love
Baby, you was riding when things was tough
Baby, you a whole diamond in the rough
You know you're forever mine
I'll never leave you behind
Forever mine
Lil Boat!

Love me forever, girl
My mind racin', I'm with you, girl
Huh, yeah
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah
Forever mine, forever mine, forever mine
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah

Never will I leave from your side
I choose you, I know you gon' ride
I fuck on hoes on the side
But that's just for the neck, girl, no lie
Never had real love, I'm bad at trusting
I just fuck, then I move on, no cuffing
You held it down back when I was out hustling
Tryna turn nothing to something
I know you're special
And I hope you make it big one day
Let these niggas try you, I'm the first with the gunplay
'Member when your moms brought my dog on a Sunday
I've been trippin' lately, need to get out the sunken place
And you super fly, you could walk on a runway
You still mine although I know you hate me
I should have gave you the world, but I fucked up
Late nights on 14th Street givin' butt rubs
I tell myself in my mind that I need that
I see you and I'm scared what you see back
You come around when you want, I don't need that
I've had so much heartbreak that I bleed black
And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love...

Love me forever, girl
My mind racin', I'm with you, girl
Huh, yeah
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah
Forever mine, forever mine, forever mine
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh
Love me forever, girl
You know you my forever world
Huh, yeah

And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love...12Embed
