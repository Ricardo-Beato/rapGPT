Mr. Untouchable
Ain't nobody fuckin' with these
You know I'm unfadeable
That's the reason why I'm out on these streets
'Cause I'm a bonafide gangsta (Gangsta)
Hustla (Hustla)
I never been a mark ass buster
Haters, how you love that?
(Put that West back on the map)

Crush 'em out that bulletproof, 740 Levi
Tipped a hundred dollars when the valet grabbed my keys
I'm runnin' through this money like these hundreds is adidas
They hatin' and we see why
We riders and we fly
You niggas is neither, you know the procedure
Hustle 'til we run out and then count cash and re-up
High 'til we die so it's motherfuckin' detox
The only thing we run is Louis belts through our Levi's
Catch me at the function, hoppin' out dumb thick
All these hoes wanna fuck but all I got is one dick
Expense, one more chance, all I need is one Nip
And all my competition on some I can't even front shit
You the one and I see what this become
They wavin' their white flag and I'm still bussin' my gun
No surrender, no retreat, my nigga, I got to eat
And keep thousand dollar sneakers on my feet
Hussle

Mr. Untouchable
Ain't nobody fuckin' with these
You know I'm unfadeable
That's the reason why I'm out on these streets
'Cause I'm a bonafide gangsta (Gangsta)
Hustla (Hustla)
I never been a mark ass buster
Haters, how you love that?
(Put that West back on the map)

Uh, listen, look
Cops can't touch a nigga
Never been a sucka nigga
Fuck a bitch, fuck a nigga
All money, money getter
All I really care about is the women in my kitchen
Foldin' clothes, washin' dishes, got me through them cold Decembers
Told 'em it'd be better days, so that explains the shit I'm into
I kept my word but details is confidential
Not too many niggas have survived the type of shit I've been through
And even less is this nice on an instrumental
Minus the pencil, just the info
They tell me that it's all a mind game, so I play this shit mental
They see the platinum plates and they assume that it's a rental
'Cause his album's yet to drop so how he pull up in a Benzo?
Drop the top, bet the bitch got crop
Let it blow in the wind on a roll, don't stop
Yah, yah, the next stop will be the block
Grab a fat stack of weed, then we hopped on a yacht
Yah
Well, alright, yah
Meet Mr. Untouchable
Blowin' that bubba kush out the sunroof
Let it burn like 151 proof, errh
They say some fools can and some fools can't
So you wish you can niggas can take this to the bank
Nipsey Hussle and Kokane
Putting paint where it ain't

Mr. Untouchable
Ain't nobody fuckin' with these
You know I'm unfadeable
That's the reason I'm out on these streets
'Cause I'm a bonafide gangsta (Gangsta)
Hustla (Hustla)
I never been a mark ass buster
Haters, how you love that?
