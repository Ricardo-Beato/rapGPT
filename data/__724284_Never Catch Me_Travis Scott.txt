She take a shot of Hennessy
I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up
I do this shit for him and me
I'm the next lone star to blow-up
Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats 'cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon' be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé
I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The RAV4 turned into a Rover
'Til it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty-five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on?
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer
I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eat-all-day; itis
Will I ever fall off? I doubt it
You might also like
No, no, no, no
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies?
They want my soul from me
Know that I'm gone, but one thing
They will never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off
