10 ContributorsSoul on Ice Lyrics
Internationally known
You 'bout to smell my cologne
Westcoast motherfucka
Lets toast motherfucka
Old money (x16)

Old money, new money, no money, nose runny
Don't try to turn the Godfather into Sonny
Don't try to turn your forefathers into money
The rap god got the whole world praying for me
Pray for me, third eye see you laying for me
Crazy Toones DJing for me
I'm the real Iron Man, you just Robert Downey
A crackhead in blackface fresh out the county
Nigga

Back the fuck up off me
I burn just like hot coffee
I'm kind of sweet like Toffee
Look what this game done taught me
Look mama, look mama (I'm soul on ice)
Look mama, look mama (I'm soul on ice)
Look mama, look mama (I'm soul on ice)
Look mama, look mama (I'm soul on ice)
Hey
You 'bout to smell my cologne
You 'bout to smell my cologne
You 'bout to smell my cologne
Look, nigga
You 'bout to smell my cologne
Hey
Old money (x16)
You might also like
Candy paint flow ever since "My Adidas"
Ice Cube fans get sugar diabeetus (diabetes)
Sugar Ray Leonard style, nigga, I'm the sweetest
Roll in on some ass just like Jesus
Cool as the fridge and you shaking like jello
Mad 'cause my life is like a marshmallow
Look, motherfucka, if you smell my cologne
Ask yourself why are you all in my zone

Back the fuck up off me
I burn just like hot coffee
I'm kind of sweet like toffee
Look what this game done for me
Look mama, look mama (I'm soul on ice)
Look mama, look mama (I'm soul on ice)
Look mama, look mama (I'm soul on ice)
Look mama, look mama (I'm soul on ice)
Hey
You 'bout to smell my cologne
You 'bout to smell my cologne
You 'bout to smell my cologne
You 'bout to smell my cologne
Oooh ooh oh ooh x4
Yo, what's up my niggas out there
Just letting you know right now, man
You got to, you better, you got to pay your dues
To the Don Mega
Dead on the block and hit y'all ass
With that old Ice Cube super bomb hit
The one that sent your cousin Tony Tone to the penitentiary back in '89
The one that sent Lil Ray Ray out from L.A. to St. Louis
And got off the bus and served them niggas them quarter thangs
Make sure you tune into that nigga Ice Cube
The first one who put you niggas on perms and pimping
And pistols and preachers
Perms and pimping, and pistols and preachers
Perms and pimping, and pistols and preachers
Perms and pimping, and pistols and preachers
Old money (x16)

Damn, it feels good to be independent1Embed
