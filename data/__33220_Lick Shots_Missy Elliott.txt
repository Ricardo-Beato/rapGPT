9 ContributorsLick Shots Lyrics
Uh, ayo, Timbaland
See, what they don't understand
Is we about to flip our whole style on 'em
For two-double-zero-one (Hey)
And for those of you who hated (Hey)
You only made us more creative
(Misdemeanor, uh)

You don't wanna speak my name
Mess around, get that ass blown away
Brrah, fool, go on away
I ain't never like your tail anyway
Missy got somethin' to say
I ride down the block in an Escalade
Bling bling all in your face
I think you might need to put on your shades
Rah, I know you feel me doe
You hatin' on me, but you hear me doe
Twenty inch rims sittin' crazy low
Ah, I'm a crazy ho
I'ma keep the party live
Me and Timbaland gonna flip it tonight
Keep your hands in the sky
Wave 'em 'round like you're crazy high
You might also like
Huh, time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?
Blaow, time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'? Blaow

You don't know who I be
Your mammy tell you not to fuck wit' me
If I give you head, you'll never leave
Rah, stop sweatin' me
Flip it on the blackhand side
Looka here boy, don't you even try it
Make me dislocate your spine
My rings fix your shine like turpentine
What you comin' 'round here now fo'?
Baby, hell no, you just want my dough
Get ya black ass on the flo'
Fool touch me, that's a no-no
Rah, Mr. DJ, won't you play that song?
Tell the freaks shake they nasty thongs
Hey boys, won't you sing along?
'Cause we gon' rock the party 'til the early morn
Huh, time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?
Blaow, time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'? Blaow

Y'all don't hear me (Hot)
You got your guns but you don't scare me (Ooh)
Originality is leary (Uh)
My own style and I ain't sharin'
Back up, back up, easy now
Hey y'all (Hot)
Let's turn it up and tear the club down (Uh)
Grab your drinks and give me two rounds
I'll break you off, I'm goin' down down
Watch yourself, I'm about to turn it up

Huh, time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?
Blaow, time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'? Blaow
Listen
Listen

Huh, time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?
Blaow, time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'? BlaowEmbed
