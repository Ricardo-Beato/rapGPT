66 ContributorsThe World Is Filled... Lyrics
The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see?
I'm just tryin' to be all I can be
Ohhahhoahh, yeah

Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore, she be game for sure
Pimp so hard a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk 'cause I live it
Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me, that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it
See, you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga, we be flyin' through your hood
Hood rats scopin' with their eyes on my goods
See, we date 'em like we hate 'em, see 'em like we don't need 'em
Treat 'em like we meet 'em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you never knew what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
And if she's flexible, fuck the nigga next to you

The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see?
I'm just tryin' to be all I can be
Ohhahhoahh, yeah

Uhh, uhh, uhh
"When the Remy's in the system, ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck him? Will I diss him?", that's what these hoes yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all still chase 'em, I'll replace 'em, huh
Drunk off Dom, silk and gators
Spittin' words, make a bird tell they flock see you later
Whether, drunk or high, skunk or Thai
Nigga play against a playa, shit, slugs gon' fly
Ain't gon' lie, pimped out her SSI
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o - she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew in each state
Now I got 2 in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now I pop bottles with models, larger steaks on large estates, shit

The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see?
I'm just tryin' to be all I can be
Ohhahhoahh, yeah
I had a whole lot of bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game, always say the right lines
Had a few prostitutes, and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let em do it to you!
She ain't no sucker, I know that bitch, man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman lovin' a rich man
Now here you come, drop top ridin'
You ain't no pimp, fake nigga, stop lyin'
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that lived it
Street life, pimp shit, make the ho respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick, that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figure
She left you 'cause you couldn't be like them real niggas
She was a hustler by nature and you was just faker
Than the average simps, found a badder pimp

Crazy ass man
I never would have bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that hoe, man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe!
Man I'm 30 years old, nigga
And that bitch was hoein' when I was in 9th grade and shit
Think about that: she been around then right?
Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes, man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin' with you cause you had a good ass job, nigga
Nerd...treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga, she ain't nothin' but a hoe!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife, fool
Every time you turn your back, that bitch is fuckin' with them gangstas
Eastside, Westside - these are my partners
Do that shit, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout nigga
I tell you about some real pimps and hoes
Tell you about these pimps and these hoes man
Yeah I know a few, shit
