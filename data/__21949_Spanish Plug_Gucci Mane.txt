Geah, geah, geah, yeah
Gucci, Gucci, huh, huh, huh, ha?
Gucciracci baby, Gucci Gucci
Coca√≠na shawty

When I see my plug this how I talk to 'em
And when I serve my folks this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dogs dis how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane, Laflare, I'm fin' to talk to 'em

To my guala, my partner, molta manana
Gracias, de nada, brought me years of dollars
Que pasa amigo? Cocaine more bonito
Cohina mucho es grande on the repo
Ese el pablo, my barrio your barrio
Comprende my friende you speak real good ingles
Six hundred Wednesday, five thousand Tuesday
El nombre es Gucci, no punta, no pussy
Coronas and kushi, kilos and elbows
Chito seritos, they come from Mexico, there he go
Twenty tacos and it got me fifty burritos
S550 Mercedes on Flat Shoals
Que pasa, manana, my guala guala my partner partner
Love to treat a nigga to a steak and a lobster
Now a nigga owe them a million dollars
Got me making ten G's an hour, money's power, time is money
You don't know the nigga then serve the dummy
Serve the junkies then ride Ashantis
You might also like
When I see my plug this how I talk to 'em
And when I serve my folks this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dogs dis how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane, Laflare, I'm fin' to talk to 'em

What the bumba claat? My trap spot, dreadlocks and rastas
Rude boys and rude girls, Jamaican mobsters
I shot the sheriff, smokin' Bob Marley
All of this ecstasy is killin' me softly
Turgo and curry, mid grade so pretty
Sex spot my ex-spot, can't dodge that red dot
Smokin' the lah-lah, can't get no higher
Where is me iya? She sends me fiyah
Where is me lighter? Look at me ice-a
Step up your neck piece, I like your wife-a
I pack a rifle, I loves me life-a
Put up your hands 'fore I put up my rifle

When I see my plug this how I talk to 'em
And when I serve my folks this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dogs dis how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane, La flare, I'm fin' to talk to 'em
What's up nigga, what it do? I'm good my nigga, how are you?
Half a chicken, whole chicken, quarter chicken, what it move?
Bentley coupe on Bentley shoes, hell naw them ain't 22's
Still keep coke in inner tubes, plottin' on my next business move
Twenty-six inch tennis shoes, old school painted Maserati blue
Brought my gun, but forgot my roof, pullin' up wit'cha baby boo
Ooh ooh, it's you know who, it's NASCAR baby what you gon' do
Looking for somethin' thick I can screw, paint change and my diamonds too Trap nigga watch remindin' you
My grill and rang be blindin' you
If you a stubborn artist I'm signin' you
I'm still the same nigga that be shinin' too
Trap nigga watch remindin' you
My grill and rang be blindin' you
If you a stubborn artist I'm signin' you
I'm still the black nigga that be shinin' too, bitch~!

When I see my plug this how I talk to 'em
And when I serve my folks this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dogs dis how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane, La flare, I'm fin' to talk to 'em2Embed
