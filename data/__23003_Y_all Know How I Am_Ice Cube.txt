Don't trip, y'all know how I am (I'm a fool)
I'm a fool, y'all know how I am...
Drop it, drop it
Uhh, yeah

Don't trip, y'all know how I am (Don't trip)
I'm a fool, y'all know how I am

Mister Ice Cube, nigga, treat me like the man
If not I come through, slap rock, bam bam
Uncle Sam cain't fuck wit'cha nephew
F-U, y'all better let a vet through

Don't trip, y'all know how I am (Don't trip)
I'm a fool, y'all know how I am

(Oh my goodness!)
OMG make 'em say, "Oh my goodness!"
In L.A. with two fives like L. Goodrich
Black Lambo' keep me on my bullshit
Disrespect the team, I wish you would, bitch
You might also like
Don't trip, y'all know how I am (Don't trip)
I'm a fool, y'all know how I am

They call me Doughboy bitch, you know how I do
I spit it straight from the top like a frisbee on a roof
You can call a nigga dope baller krispy in a Coupe
Every +Friday After Next+ I'm pullin in something new...

Ha ha, yeah, uhhh..
The dirty rubber, play the gutter, fallin' from my lady lover
Three-eighty clutcher, Dub shady than a motherfucker
Turnin a Bacardi up, shoot the whole party up
Catch you at the stop light, what Da Lench Mob like?

Don't trip, y'all know how I am (Don't trip)
I'm a fool, y'all know how I am

Maylay, ugly, get stupid, McNoopid
Came in with Dub C on this Ice Cube shit
L.A. hat, khak's and Air Max
Blast the C-A tat, yeah, we stay strapped
Don't trip, y'all know how I am (Don't trip)
I'm a fool, y'all know how I am

I'm a fool, I'm a trip, I'm a Blood, I'm a Crip
I'mma slide, I'mma dip, I'mma take you on a trip
Where the girls wanna strip if you stick to the script
Act up if you think I'm on some Hollywood shit {*echoes*}

I'm a fool, I'm a fool, y'all know how I am
Don't trip, don't trip, y'all know how I am
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, y'all know how I am
Don't trip, don't trip, y'all know how I am
I'm a fool, y'all know how I amEmbed
