Ridin' in the backseat with the seat way back
Way, lemon (Way, way)
Way, way, way, way, way
Wop, wop (Yeah)
It's Gucci
Wizop

Ridin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back (Way back)
This white on white Maybach (Waybach), I call it payback (Huh)
Yeah, you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back (Ziggy)
I'd rather rap a Zay' track than a Dre track (Skrrt)
Catch me flushin' down the street with the top way back (Bop, bop, bop)
I had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at
Man, y'all know I fuck with Mike WiLL, we go way back (Mike WiLL)
Now let's bring the trap back, nigga, Gucci Mane back, nigga (Guwop)

I'm the bestest, I'm the freshest ever stepped on the scene (Wop)
I mean what I say, I say what I mean (Huh?)
Keep a rocket in my pocket like my name was Hakeem (Oh)
Somebody had the picture, she thought it was a dream (Uh)
A college chick dream big man on campus (Wizop)
All these folks impersonate me like Elvis
Too much sauce and I'm not selfish (No)
I rule with an iron fist wrapped in Velvet
The seat way back and the top laid back (Huh)
Her waist real small but that ass real fat (Mwah)
She get turnt up and you can't turn back (No, no)
She make my dick stand up, I push them legs way back, way (Woah)

Ridin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back (It's Gucci)
This white on white Maybach, I call it payback (Huh)
Yeah, you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back (Ziggy)
I'd rather rap a Zay' track than a Dre track (Yeah)
Catch me flushin' down the street with the top way back (Flushin')
I had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at (Hey)
Man, y'all know I fuck with Mike WiLL, we go way back (Mike WiLL)
Now let's bring the trap back, nigga, Gucci Mane back, nigga (Gucci, huh)

I'm the slickest, I'm the richest ever rapped on the track
In the S600 with the seat way back (Way)
1017 mob boss, I don't play that (No)
I'll get your whole head knocked off if you say that (Shh)
I had a long-nosed .38 way, way back (Shh)
I sent a nigga to the pearly gates way, way back (Shh)
They thought that Gucci Mane was soft, now they don't think that
Please get that devilish juice away from me, I don't drink that
My own clothin' line Delantic, man, yeah, I run that
You heard Atlantic dropped Gucci? Why would they do that?
I lost 200k in Vegas, yeah, man, I blew racks
Man, get these broke-ass niggas away from me, they ain't worth two stacks (Ah, it's Gucci)

Ridin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back (It's Gucci)
This white on white Maybach, I call it payback (Huh)
Yeah, you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back (Ziggy)
I'd rather rap a Zay' track than a Dre track (Yeah)
Catch me flushin' down the street with the top way back (Flushin')
I had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at (Hey)
Man, y'all know I fuck with Mike WiLL, we go way back (Mike WiLL)
Now let's bring the trap back, nigga, Gucci Mane back, nigga (Gucci, huh)14Embed
