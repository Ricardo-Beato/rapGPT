25 ContributorsThrow It Up Lyrics
Yeah yeah, uh yeah
Yeah yeah
Carolina, nigga
Fayettenam, nigga
Yeah

This is for them street niggas to them deep niggas
Them politics, them geek niggas
To them freak bitches that swallow dick, it's real
Or them sheep niggas in Prada shit and still
Even them bleak niggas without a cent could feel
I never sleep nigga, I gotta get them mills
I never cheat nigga, my heart is with the Ville
When niggas greet niggas with hollow tips, but chill
You'll never reach nigga, I got an itch to kill
Word, a nigga bringing heat to the third
My shit in every street, like the curb
So bitches wanna meet 'cause I'm deep with my words
So them niggas wanna peep like a perv
But peep game
Before they start saying "he changed"
A real nigga can never forget where he came
So if I'm up in Carolina kicking deep game
Or if I'm riding through Queens like the E-train
I throw it up!
Yeah

As you niggas smoking more kush
South niggas run you niggas, ask George Bush
Ask Bill Clinton, a nigga Will Smithin'
My jeans a lil less baggy, money still fittin.'
The streets a lil less rowdy, but they still kickin'
Them Randy Johnson O.G. niggas still pitchin'
And yeah, I know she got a man, but I'm still hittin'
So when he be up in that shit, he be like 'This feels different, "
No shit, throw dick like the veteran I am
I got that vitamin D, it's like medicine to them
I got her climaxing like it's never finna end
That's why she fucking me a lot better than her man
She try a new trick, she so wet a nigga swam
Like a salmon in this bitch, my dick drowning in that shit
They love a fly nigga on that frisbee shit
Plus a nigga get Gs like them Disney flicks
I throw it up!
Yea
If you a down south nigga, throw it up, (and)
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (ay)
If you a Fayettenam nigga, throw it up, (yeah)
If you a ATL nigga, throw it up
New York to L.A. niggas, throw it up
Yeah, Chi-town throw it up (yeah)

Real niggas want the money, so that's where my aim is
Ho niggas love the attention, wanna be famous
Real niggas fuck the attention, they know it's dangerous
Rather make a mil' and nobody know what my name is, (uh)
But that's the price when you nice with it
And them ladies gonna like 'cause you light-skinned
I take advantage of the situation
I'm hitting dimes from Atlanta up to Pennsylvania
They catch feelings and I switch next
"I made it clear baby, just sex
I'm too young to settle down, shorty get dressed! "
Even them white girls tryna be my princess
But I only fuck with sisters like incest
I've been stressed, I'm so in-depth
I get this weight up off my chest like a bench-press
I sense death in the air, but it's nothing for me
Some niggas better be aware or meet the cousin of sleep, get it?
You slow niggas still ain't felt that shit
How she gonna upgrade me dog? I built that chick
Rapping's a cash cow, finna milk that bitch
You better hit up homicide, I just killed that shit, boy!
Throw it up nigga!
Throw throw it, throw it up!
Yeah!2Embed
