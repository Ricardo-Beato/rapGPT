2 ContributorsNow a Daze LyricsMan I'm in the daze, walkin round round in a maze
Its money to be made, yes I’m on the paper chase
You know I love you babe (you know I love you babe)
But you know I gotta go, keep your number on? speed dial
Man I'm in the daze (I'm in the daze)
Man I’m in the daze (I'm in the daze)
You know I love you babe
But man I'm in the daze (in the daze)
Baby let me be yo president, yo Obama you can my bird lady
My Obama momma, low druma, B vacation in the sumer
Girl let me get ya problems,girl you know I here to solvе em
You can tell me no problеm, ooh I know you like me
Ooh I know you love me, you want some more around me
So come on getting lovely, I'm getting into money
Donald trump money, a pow way is stunting and problems keep on coming
And girl you know I'm out there on the road, Missi city shawty shove
Black and prop 'n' nose man I thought I let you know
Man I really gotta go, it from the bottom of my soul
Man I love ya on the lobe, girl in case you didn't know
Man I’m in the daze, walking round round in a maze
Its money to be made, yes I’m on the paper chase
You know I love you babe (you know I love you babe)
But you know I gotta go, keep your number on? speed dial
Man I'm in the daze (I’m in the daze)
Man I'm in the daze (I'm in the daze)
You know I love you babe
But man I'm in the daze (in the daze)

Money to be made, yes I'm on the paper chase
You know I love you babe

Man I'm in the dazement, walking past money in a mazement
Eyes low from the kush, similar to Asian
J-Bar is? up next, SOD Money Gang
Wearing day in my shoes man you boys can't hang
Girls say I look good but I'm better in person
My waves are success yes I call it swag surfin'
My bussiness so cropin' but my style so urban
Never rock skinny jeans but yo girl still jerkin
Man I'm in the daze, walking round round in a maze
Its money to be made, yes I'm on the paper chase

Man I'm in the daze (daze, daze)
Man I'm in the daze (daze, daze)
You know I love ya babe
But man I'm in the dazeEmbed
