That Boy Cassius
Hello world, hi
I would like to welcome you to the Migos show, you know
It's a day of life, my life, of course

All my niggas made for it (Made)
All my niggas made for it (Made men)
Don't ask about them whips and them houses and jewelry
'Cause all that shit is paid for (Cash)
All my niggas made for it (One more time)
All my niggas made for it (Made)
Don't ask about them whips and them houses and jewelry
'Cause all that shit be paid for (Cash)

All my niggas made for it (All 'em)
All my niggas made for it (Everyone)
Not Toby, but we slave for it (Not Toby)
No Kunta Kinte, but we slave for it (No Kunta Kinte)
I waited some days for it (Days)
Secure the bag, my niggas, they spray for it (Brrrp)
Supply a sea of Ac', think I got a taste for it (Argh)
She bad, but I already smashed, so she get ignored (Smashed)
These bitches open heart, they quick to open doors (Open)
On my G5 I can soar, I like to explore (Explore)
Havin' trouble pick a outfit that I haven't worn (Haven't)
Havin' everything in-store and got plenty more (Plenty)
All my niggas made for it (Made), process board (Process)
All my niggas came forward (Came), takin' charge (Takin')
All my niggas paid for (Paid), no debit card (No)
Think I might go cop the Wraith since I stay with stars
(Skrrt skrrt, skrrt skrrt, skrrt skrrt)

All my niggas made for it (Made)
All my niggas made for it (Made men)
Don't ask about them whips and them houses and jewelry

Yeah, yeah
Today was a good day (Ayy)
Dropped my top ridin' down the highway (Skrrt, skrrt)
I don't see no 12, ain't gotta drive straight (Naw)
So I'm hoggin' up the lane 'cause my bills paid (Yeah)
And my momma's (Momma) and my sister's (Sister's)
Niggas made for it (Yeah), can't knock my hustle (Naw)
I done slaved for it (Slaved), look at my muscles (Muscles)
MVP the whole game, Quavo Russell (Russell)
No, do not touch 'em (Don't touch 'em), I'ma have to bust you (Bow, bow)
I cannot trust you (Yeah), I cannot love you (Nope)
If you ain't my brother that came from the struggle (Ayy)
Must not be made for it, I'ma have to cut you, yeah (Ain't made)

All my niggas made for it (made)
All my niggas made for it (made men)
Don't ask about them whips and them houses and jewelry
'Cause all that shit is paid for (cash)
All my niggas made for it (one more time)
All my niggas made for it (made)
Don't ask about them whips and them houses and jewelry
'Cause all that shit be paid for (cash)
Woo, woo
Thank God for blessings, gotta pray more (God)
Hop in the Wraith of course, I grind like skateboard (Wraith)
Lambo truck, I tour drippin' in Tom Ford (Tourin')
"How did you come in the game?", I came with the gang, of course (How?)
We get ya fired to flames, turn ya to smores (Fire, yeah)
All aboard (Woo), load up the bricks on the Ford (Bricks)
I bought a tiger to roar (Tiger), we 'bout to body a store (Body)
Soak my wrist for sure (Soak), love all my fans to the core (Hey)
I put my kids in Dior (Kids), I put my momma on resorts (Momma)
We catch the bricks and deport 'em, missin' the plug, he got deported (Woo)
I'm on the block for a day (Block), I pray I don't go back to stay (Pray)
I told her my kids come stay (Come on), she got my kids on her face (Hey)

All my niggas made for it (Made)
All my niggas made for it (Made men)
Don't ask about them whips and them houses and jewelry
'Cause all that shit is paid for (Cash)
All my niggas made for it (One more time)
All my niggas made for it (Made)
Don't ask about them whips and them houses and jewelry
'Cause all that shit be paid for

Cars, jewelry, house, everything paid for
I got niggas still tryna beat a case, boy
Don't you come around that Nawf 'cause it ain't safe, boy
Got my niggas from the Nawf, but you don't play, boy11Embed
