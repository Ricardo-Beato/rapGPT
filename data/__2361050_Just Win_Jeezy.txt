10 ContributorsJust Win Lyrics
My mother used to say birds of a feather flock together if you run around with losers
You will end up a loser. It's necessary you get the losers out of your life if you want to live your dream

Win my nigga just win
It’s a dirty world but that bitch still spin
And we don’t trust the preachers or the crooked politicians
The mothafuckers always talking, they don’t ever want to listen
I’m reeking of success you can smell it thru my pores
And when I build my dream house I’m hiding money in the floors
You wanna prove em' all wrong in the end
Just win my nigga just win

Niggas grinding everyday, niggas dying everyday
Either you hustle or your starve nigga ain't no other way
Being rich, that shit's a talent being broke that’s a profession
See I woke up un-incarcerated, that shit there is a blessing
None of your mothafuckin business nigga don’t ask me why I’m stressing
Don’t know what I had to do to get it nigga don’t ask me why I’m flexing
I was born with a gift nigga I'm a bread winner
Whole team gotta eat we just we just dodging fed dinners
I just wanna win but they set me up to lose
The streets kick ya ass nigga yeah im talking judo
At the end of the day how many pussy niggas  you know
That’s what a pussy nigga do though
Im praying for a better day, I'm being optimistic
He said he want the same thing I said be more specific
Nigga it's hard out here my people sick and tired of struggling
All this clown ass shit my people sick and tired of juggling
You might also like
Win my nigga just win
It’s a dirty world but that bitch still spin
And we don’t trust the preachers or the crooked politicians
The mothafuckers always talking, they don’t ever want to listen
I’m reeking of success you can smell it thru my pores
And when I build my dream house I’m hiding money in the floors
You wanna prove me wrong in the end
Just win my nigga just win

Can’t wake up cause I ain't been to sleep
And the shit that I got on I been in it for a week
I see white air ones but my fingernails dirty
When you don’t see me on the block my clientele get worried
In the back of my mind, in front of my brain
I’m a pretty good shot but this ain't my aim
Want to live the American dream like Uncle Haus and his wife
Work hard, feed my kids, see what that be like
For now I’m seeing junkies and pipes
Making sure a solider put a uniform on and go and earn him some stripes
See my counselor told me education or you starve
Last time I seen her she ain't even have a job
Gangbang, sell dope or rob
Welcome to the African American mob
When you probably gone die even less than your worth
Leave your momma with the bill a funeral home and a church
Win my nigga just win
It’s a dirty world but that bitch still spin
And we don’t trust the preachers or the crooked politicians
The mothafuckers always talking, they don’t ever want to listen
I’m reeking of success you can smell it thru my pores
And when I build my dream house I’m hiding money in the floors
You wanna prove me wrong in the end
Just win my nigga just win

It's necessary to know that everybody won't see it that everybody won’t join you
That everybody won't have the vision
It's necessary to know that a lot of people want to complain. But they don’t want to do anything about there situation
That you’re an uncommon breed you know
You have to know within yourself that I can do this even if no one else sees it for me I can see it for myself that’s necessary1Embed
