17 ContributorsReally Ready Lyrics
It's about feeling
The combination of young people, drugs, a fairly sexually charged social environment, and syncopated music
Is just all designed to draw you into you and your friends and your scene, and your hood, and your place in the cosmos
And not sell you out as a consumer
To a Hollywood or Manhattan-manufactured forms of entertainment (It's Guwop)
Huh

I'm a real nigga, talkin' 'bout what I really have (Legend)
'Cause I fucked a nigga bitch, that's why he really mad (Damn)
Hit a nigga in his head, I be really glad (Bah)
Since the day I lost Dunk, I been really sad
A nigga make a hit and dip, will he really last?
A nigga say he hold you down, but will he really blast?
They say I'm worth fifteen M's, but that ain't really shit (No)
And I ain't content with what I got, got to be really rich
Sold dope on the really, was broke on the really
If you really wanna get it, then you know I'm with it
Really wanna go to war with me, not really
If you wanna get it, then you gonna get it
You worth a mil', not really really
I ain't all in your business
If it's not your girl, not really really
Then why it's hurting your feelings? (It's Gucci)

My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already (Woah)
These rap niggas all really scary (What up, Gucci?), talk loud, but ain't ready (I swear)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes (Uh-huh)
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (It's Dolph, really)

On the real, these rappers pussies, nah, really, straight up (For real)
But meanwhile, I'm in my traphouse with 'bout six different flavors
But fuck that, let's get to it (Yeah)
Took out my scale, broke down the bale, and my clientele ran straight through it
Drinkin' mud, riding through the city, yup
Sellin' P's out the coupe really, yup
Paid 15K for my SS and invested another fifty, yup
These rap niggas, they don't wanna see me, nah
Got your bitch with me taking off her drawers
Smokin' weed and laughin', burnin' rubber while I'm runnin' from the law
Really, fuck you, nigga, come get me (Fuck you)
I'm a Castalia nigga and all we do is get money, you feel me? (Castalia, really?)
Know it's two Glocks with me, yup
Got that boy Guwop with me, yup (Ayy)
Downtown rooftop chilling, yup
Quarter mil' on the floor, really
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already (Woah)
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready (It's Dolph)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready (Really)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes (Passes)
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)

Bee, I'm bickin' back and I'm boolin' (Boolin')
Drop the top and it's foolish (It's foolish)
Finessin' game with your main bitch (Turn up)
Now my pockets is stupid (Stupid)
Fuck with Gucci, get your issue (Issue)
You pussies soft like tissue
Hundred K'll get you knocked out (Knocked out)
Put me in the ring, get boxed out
So I jump on the stage, get the team real hype (I'm hype)
Gucci throw a cup and the whole squad fight (Turn up)
Bottles on me, so we pourin' all night (Squad)
Nigga get to trippin', switch up, fight night (Squad)
I'm jumping out that coupe (That coupe), I lost my damn roof (That roof)
Thank God these boys so fly, we don't need no parachute (We gone)
So I'm chasing after figures (We runnin'), squeezin' on these triggers (Triggers)
Bank account six figures (Yeah), kick my feet up, Louie slippers (Guap)
Vacation in the Hamptons (Hamptons), rockstar, Marilyn Manson (yeah)
All for that check, I'll hold a nigga ransom (Squad)
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already (Really)
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready (Really)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes (Passes)
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already (Already)
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready (Really)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes (Passes)
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)1Embed
