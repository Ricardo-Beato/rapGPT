21 ContributorsDon’t Even Bother Lyrics
Yeah, Veeze in this bitch
Goin' and goin'
Goin' and goin'

I pray all of my niggas get to millions of dollars (Yeah)
Chrome Hearts jeans, Moncler coat cost an Impala (Slatt)
How dare this rap nigga talk tough? He know I'm his father
These niggas rap verses GTA, I don't even bother (Yeah)
These bitches askin' for a buck, damn, I don't even bother (Yeah)
He wanna fight for a pint, nigga, don't even bother (Fuck)
I scammed how much your verse cost, don't even bother
Heard the opps need a hearse, shit, they shouldn't evеn bother (Yeah)

Throw that pussy in a lake, lеt him swim with the fishes (Yeah)
When he dead, I'll be first to put my dick on his Mrs. (Yeah)
Bob and weave like Mike Tyson when she tryna give kisses (Weave)
My bitch pussy so damn bald, thought it was make-a-wish (Wish)
Pullin' up to link my Philly bitch at seven, six (Who?)
Fuck, I mean seven o' six
Ball like a 76'er
Free all my niggas down that road staring at them bricks (Bricks)
Shoutout to every real nigga who ain't never switch (Yeah, slatt)
You might also like
I pray all of my niggas get to millions of dollars (Yeah, slatt)
Chrome Hearts jeans, Moncler coat cost an impala (Slatt, slatt, slatt)

Heard the opps need a hearse, shit, they shouldn't even bother (Yeah)

Throw that work in the water, it get hard when you twist it (Sheesh)
Lil' bro asked for my gun, told him bring it back empty
I ain't never had a pit, I be doggin' these bitches (Yeah)
Where I'm from, niggas killing over Cartier lenses (Hmm-mm)
My doctor still prescribing when I don't got the symptoms
It's enough to feed a village in the stash of the rental (Brr, ooh)
I got enough to buy a house, you see I poke out my dental (Brr, ooh)
The Lord done blessed me with a lot, but every night I be sinnin' (Thank God)

I pray all of my niggas get to millions of dollars (Yeah)
Chrome Hearts jeans, Moncler coat cost an Impala (Slatt)
How dare this rap nigga talk tough? He know I'm his father

Heard the opps need a hearse, shit, they shouldn't even bother (Yeah)
I'm doing eighty in the twenty-five, I'm just having fun
I seen the police, hit a U-turn, you know I'ma run
I'ma fuck her once and I promise she gon' buy me guns
Nigga, I looked up to Blade Icewood, not Tommy Buns
Twelve hundred dollars for Amiris with the colors in them
I told her, if her friends just like her, then we fucking with them
You the type of nigga pay for friends, I don't fuck with niggas
I'm the type to take a trip to Paris for the shopping district

I pray all of my niggas get to millions of dollars (Yeah)
Chrome Hearts jeans, Moncler coat cost an Impala (Slatt)
How dare this rap nigga talk tough? He know I'm his father
These niggas rap verses GTA, I don't even bother (Yeah)
These bitches askin' for a buck, damn, I don't even bother (Yeah)
He wanna fight for a pint, nigga, don't even bother (Fuck)
I scammed how much your verse cost, don't even bother
Heard the opps need a hearse, shit, they shouldn't even bother (Yeah)Embed
