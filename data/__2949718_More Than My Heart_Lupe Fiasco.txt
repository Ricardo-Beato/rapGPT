16 ContributorsMore Than My Heart Lyrics
Uh, thank you!
Heheheh, uhh, check, check

When you got popped up and you got locked up
And the block shot up and your girl knocked up
And your kids be like, "Who gonna watch us?"
Your mama, they nana
When you ball too hard or your money got spent
So you got kicked out, you ain't have no rent
But you still had a place where you could go
Tell me where you went, your mama
Soon as they let me outta jail
Went straight to my mama's house
Need someone I can talk to
And a little more time to work all these dramas out
That lawyer money, that bail money
Those letters in the mail never fail you, homie
Who visit when niggas don't visit?
Man, she the realest, boy, let me tell you somethin'
You better love your mama

I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth (more, more)
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches (more, more)
And I love my car
More than I love my heart (ooh)
Oh-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You might also like
Yeah, now some mamas might be your confidant
Some mamas just good for shoes
Some mamas might be your drinkin' buddy
Some mamas might not be cool
Some mamas might wait 'til you get home
Some mamas might come up to your school
And fuck you up in front of your friends
Cause you don't make the rules
Really thought that you was doin' it today
Now you sittin' there lookin' all stupid in your face
When you get home, just tell her you sorry
And put on this song, start movin' to the bass
"Boy, cut that shit off!"
Goddamn, mama, they made this song for you
Said through the powder and the problems
Gotta honor my mama, so that's what I'm tryna do
Ayy, better love my mama

I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth (more, more)
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches (more, more)
And I love my car
More than I love my heart (ooh)
Oh-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, now some might think their mama ain't perfect, she is
All in her face, better get in your place
You one of her goddamn kids
Now some might think their mama ain't worth it, she is
Gotta help her out no matter what it's 'bout
No matter whatever she did
Now some might think they mama ain't here, she lives
She lives, she lives
She lives, she lives
She lives, she lives

I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth (more, more)
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches (more, more)
And I love my car
More than I love my heart (ooh)
Oh-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa1Embed
