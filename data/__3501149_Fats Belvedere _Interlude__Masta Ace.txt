The name's Fats Belvedere
And if you live in my hood, and you got big credit
Now I'm the man you come to see
Mastercard, Visa, whatever it is, I either have it, or I'll get it
Now I've known Ace for most of my life
And I was always telling this guy it was crazy
To be going out there, breaking his ass
Making phonecalls, sending emails
Running in and out of town for a few grand here
For a few grand there
But he had a passion for it
Ya'know he didn't care
And honestly, I had to respect him for thatYou might also likeEmbed
