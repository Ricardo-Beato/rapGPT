She said she feelin' nice
She said she feelin' nice
She said she feelin' nice
She said she feelin' nice
She said she feelin' nice (Yeah)
She said she feelin' nice (Said she feelin' nice)
She said she feelin' nice (Said she feelin' nice)
She said she feelin' nice (Said she feelin' nice)

Long walks on the beach (On the beach)
On the resort, three bedroom suites (Resorts)
Rib-eye steak from Phillipe's (Phillipe's)
In Bahama (Bahama), with an eater (With an eater)
She 'bout to put my face on her tee (On her tee)
I said "Baby, put your face in my briefs" (In my briefs)
Tell the waitress bring four margaritas (Four margaritas)
Before I hop on this jet (On a jet)
Jah know I got the keys to success (To success)
No more walkin' with a vest (No more)
All my jewelry is VS (VS)
Pick up my jerk wings in a Phantom (In a Phantom)
Pop a Perky (Pop a Perky), start dancin' (Start dancin')
No lights, no camera, just vibes (Just vibes)

She said she feelin' nice (Hey)
She said she feelin' nice (Baby)
She said she feelin' nice
She said she feelin' nice (Yeah)
She said she feelin' nice (Said she feelin' nice)
She said she feelin' nice (Said she feelin' nice)
She said she feelin' nice
She said she feelin' nice

Hold up, wait a minute
I got all these bands in the Goyard
How you wanna spend it?
Can I put you on the yacht in the ocean?
Get you everything that you see
You ain't gotta worry 'bout nothin'
Shawty, everythin' on me
I'm tryna get to know you
Push back then drop it slower
Never want the night to be over
'Cause every time you bend over
Girl, you got a motherfucker like "Oh"
Look at your body (Oh yeah)
Got my attention
Quarantine ain't a thing when the bill right
Fuck social distance
She said she feelin' nice (Ayy)
She said she feelin' nice (Said she feelin' nice)
She said she feelin' nice (Oh)
She said she feelin' nice (Oh, oh, oh yeah)
She said she feelin' nice
She said she feelin' nice (Oh-oh)
She said she feelin' nice (Ooh, ooh)
She said she feelin' nice (Let's go, let's go, let's go)3Embed
