16 ContributorsThe One I Love Lyrics
Baby, fuck them chicks and them other girls
You're the one I love, you're the one I love, you're the one I—
Baby, fuck them chicks and them other girls
You're the one I love, you're the one I love
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I (love)
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, yeah

Rap life
License and invitation to act like
I'm living the fast life
Long way away from relating to the Pharcyde
I was the dude they used to pass by
Looking for her in the day with a flashlight, that type
That's until I got my cash right, heh
You should have seen your boy last night, that's right
Acting like I was a god in the past life, this is your last try
If I don't act right, this what you said the last time
We know each other so well that we past lying
And we past crying, and we past fighting
It's like dealing with women my favorite past time
I love finding trails to path find, ain't nothing like it
When you stop calling, that was a bad sign
Remember you would blow up the batline now flatline
I was scared to fall asleep so I nap light
One eye open and my phone in my path of sight
Hoping I don't wake up to a catfight
Exposed like them hotel sheets in the black light
You let me cook like the pot was cast iron
And stayed through the good and the bad times
So that's why, I'm back in line tryna get off your bad side
It might take some time and that's fine but trust this
You might also like
Baby, fuck them chicks and them other girls
You're the one I love (you're the one I love)
You're the one I love (you're the one I love)
You're the one I— (aye!)
Baby, fuck them chicks and them other girls
You're the one I love (you're the one I love)
You're the one I love (you're the one I—aye!)
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I (love)
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, yeah

Here's the deal, I know you still have fears to consider
Your tears filled a river but you still ain't a quitter
Turned to pills and the liquor when your feelings was bitter
Signed, sealed and delivered but you still with a nigga
Now my ex chick is ill but you the best in the field
Place your bets, here's a mil', I invest in the real
Went from Netflix and chill to breakfast in Brazil
Went from Mexican villas straight to Texas for grills
We the best when we building
Got the egg in the nest and it's chilling, it's left for the children
The hate is so real son
But they full of jealousy and it's killing them, they stressed in their feelings
When I tell her don't let them affect how she feels
She throw the blame right back at me, how we expect to heal?
Investigating like she be waiting for a detective shield
Better still feeling insecure about her sex appeal
She know she cute when she catching a little attitude
She know I love her when she wear her hair natural
She let me back in her life and I show my gratitude
I try to curb my habit of acting like other rappers do
Them other chicks ships in the night, they just passing through
They ain't invested what you invested, you got the capital
To put up and you actually put up with the collateral
Damage that I cause but you back and it's magical, yeah
Baby, fuck them chicks and them other girls
You're the one I love (you're the one I love)
You're the one I love (you're the one I love)
You're the one I—
Baby, fuck them chicks and them other girls
You're the one I love (you're the one I love)
You're the one I love (you're the one I—aye!)
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I—you're the one I—
You're the one I (love)
The one and only
You're the one I (love)
Aye! You're the one I love, you're the—aye!
You're the one I (love)
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, yeah

Baby, I want you to know
Can't nobody take your place, no
We always gon' hear this and that about, each other
But who knows and who cares?
Long as you there and I'm there, who cares, babe?

Baby, fuck them chicks and them other girls
You're the one I love, you're the one I love, you're the one I—
Baby, fuck them chicks and them other girls
You're the one I love, you're the one I love
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I (love)
You're the one I (love)1Embed
