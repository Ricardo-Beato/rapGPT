3 ContributorsTitanic Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Yeah
(J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League)
Let's go

This shit ain't for the weak (Nah)
Grab the scuba gear 'cause this shit get deep (Haha)
Yeah, can't swim, nigga, you bound to drizzown
You lucky you even at the table, nigga, sit down (Damn)
Niggas ain't got shit to show for it
You ain't got it, nigga? Go ask your ho for it
Can't look me in the eyes, niggas finicky
Just be honest with yourself, you still envy me (Yeah)
Cry me a river, Justin Timber' me
It's givin' frenemy, I don't like your energy
The boy ain't mine, why we talkin' 'bout supportin'?
Way too real to be talkin' 'bout extortin' (Haha)
TD Jakes told me, "Just pray"
And Tony Robbins told me, "Don't play"
It's your vision, make it happen, nigga
It's my boat now, I'm the captain, nigga (Let's go)
You might also like
How you let 'em ride your wave but a nigga right beside you still hatin'? I will never understand it
Ungrateful-ass niggas, these ungrateful-ass hoes, they gon' fuck around and sink the Titanic
They don't care about your dreams, they don't care about your goals, man, these niggas give a fuck about devotion
See, the hatin' won't quit 'til you shipwrecked, bottom of the ocean (Go)

It's hard to be real with a fake nigga
Gotta keep the antivenom for the snake niggas (Damn)
You thought he was your man, but he wants your place
Like Nicholas Cage, he wanna wear your face (Woo)
Keep your eyes open for the backstabbers, nigga
Don't tell 'em 'bout your pack, they pack grabbers, nigga (Ayy)
Don't tell 'em 'bout your dreams 'cause they dream stealers
Fuck your dirty ass doin' 'round us clean niggas? (Haha)
Only thing worse is a fiend, nigga
To get what they want, they straight scheme, nigga
Only things worse than fent' is the fame, nigga
Rob grown-ass man for a chain, nigga
They can never throw me off, I'm too bossy, nigga
And you know it stay up, I'm like coffee, nigga (Yeah)
Niggas started playin' games, that's when they lost me, nigga
Kept it straight up and down, they still crossed me, nigga (Ayy)

How you let 'em ride your wave but a nigga right beside you still hatin'? I will never understand it
Ungrateful-ass niggas, these ungrateful-ass hoes, they gon' fuck around and sink the Titanic
They don't care about your dreams, they don't care about your goals, man, these niggas give a fuck about devotion
See, the hatin' won't quit 'til you shipwrecked, bottom of the ocean
How you let 'em ride your wave but a nigga right beside you still hatin'? I will never understand it
Ungrateful-ass niggas, these ungrateful-ass hoes, they gon' fuck around and sink the Titanic
They don't care about your dreams, they don't care about your goals, man, these niggas give a fuck about devotion
See, the hatin' won't quit 'til you shipwrecked, bottom of the oceanEmbed
