2 ContributorsFeelin’ It (Video Version) Lyrics
What.. '96 and forever
Rok-A-Blok, Roc-A-Fella

I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

I keep it realer than most I know you're feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill in dip
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a trick, and then you die
But for now, love, we live life, the chiller wrist
Since diapers, had nothing to livе for like them lifers but
Making surе everybody get a slice of the pie we dice up
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit the world with some game that'll light ya life up
If every player in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint
If y'all brothers ain't talking 'bout large money, come on money
You might also like
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

Even if it ain't sunny, hey, I ain't complaining
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40, hydroplaning, what, shorty?
(Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining
Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living, the ill street blues got you hunger painin'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, they still singing, fools
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal with
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as it gets
'95 South I burnt downs in 96
When I was doin my thing, I hit those cats on the hill with bricks
Ain't nothin changed, cats still ridin them chrome things
Oh yeah, maybe we got a couple more stones in the rings
And we don't have to talk in code when the phone rings, we own things
Rockafella

I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
What, y'all ain't heard that fella Jay hot? Can't knock the hustle
Fill the glass way to the top till I wet my knuckles
Y'all stay consumed with rumors here
I keep your girl on the bloomers while you scream on the answering machine
"Pick up, I know you're there!"
I can't believe y'all so emotional
And mad at me because I'm doin what I'm supposed to do
Stacking G's, I'm beyond your rumors, I'm a player
Macking V's in the tropic where the only topic is daiquiris
With the hot chick rocking a 2-piece with double C's
Estimate the glasses alone, cost her 2 G's
The dread dude stopped by, introduced me to new trees
I told him it's stress back in New York, I need it to release
We start to zoning, me and this chick on the island, unplug the phone and
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke then I leave that stuff alone, man
It got me going, again

I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët...Embed
