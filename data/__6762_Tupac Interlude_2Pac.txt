3 ContributorsTupac Interlude Lyrics* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists

Right now, it is it is almost.. it is almost... uhh...
IMPOSSIBLE for you not to see how strong rap has gotten
You know what I'm sayin'! t's it's like umm..
Our our brothers and sisters, our youths, and some of our adults
Their ear is PINNED to rap music right now
And if you really wanna get our message out
And really wanna start teaching, we need to start doing that
We we really need to start using, our methods
You know what I'm sayin'!
The Last Poets did it with poetry
And uhh, and and.. even in our history
From a ancient Afl- African civilization
Poets went from village to village
And that's how, stories and messages and lessons were taught
You know what I'm sayin'! And... so, like you say, history repeats itself!
And so.. it... it was, it was... at it was, you know, obvious!
It was, pick it up, you know?
Bein' the race that we are, bein' the strong race that we are!
We picked it up, we picked up those positive, those positive vibes
and we started rappin' and... so I think it is, it's a very good medium too!1Embed
