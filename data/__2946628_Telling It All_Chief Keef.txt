12 ContributorsTelling It All Lyrics
Runnin' to the cheese, lil' nigga, I ain't fuckin' round
Them hit-men with me lil' nigga, they will hunt you down
Sosa was never 'bout that life, how the fuck you sound
Put the red dot on your nose, you's a fuckin' clown

I'm in the foreign ass truck at the stoplight
We leave your ass left if you're not right
I'm in traffic, pull up and steal your spotlight
Red insides, white out, that's a stop sign
And the truck look like a dump 'cause it's sittin' tall
Break his ankles, take the shot, ball nigga, ball
Gucci jackets, both pockets filled with it all
And these diamonds and my jewelry tellin' it all

I hit Gucci just to stunt
I just poured me up a cup
I've been in it since a pup
I'm gonna get it, wish me luck
We in that tinted car, you fucked
Nah in Tunechis voice, you trucked
Rollin' dope up like a cluck
So much dope, it got me stuck
I swear I be high as fuck
In the mall just buyin' stuff
Ring me up, I'm cashin' out
Ain't with all that trying'stuff
And I got that iron tucked
I just started chargin' up
Ain't with all the fussin' stuff
In that vrrrrm cuttin' up
You might also like
I'm in the foreign ass truck at the stoplight
We leave your ass left if you're not right
I'm in traffic, pull up and steal your spotlight
Red insides, white out, that's a stop sign
And the truck look like a dump 'cause it's sittin' tall
Break his ankles, take the shot, ball nigga, ball
Gucci jackets, both pockets filled with it all
And these diamonds and my jewelry tellin' it all

I'm in the diamond, district kickin' big shit
Bank roll, on me, poppin' big shit
Me and the crew, in your city we got big sticks
Big TV near the toilet, I take big shits
I had your bitch, in my office, now she dismissed
No attention, especially when she throwin' big fits
Forty pointers, and a watch, that's that big shit
A couple shows, my pockets fatter than a big bitch
Whole pint, now I gotta take a big piss
Triple A, I always got a-fuckin'-ssistance
Peter Parker, I always knew I had a sixth sense
And the opps, is always on my fuckin' hit-list

I'm in the foreign ass truck at the stoplight
We leave your ass left if you're not right
I'm in traffic, pull up and steal your spotlight
Red insides, white out, that's a stop sign
And the truck look like a dump 'cause it's sittin' tall
Break his ankles, take the shot, ball nigga, ball
Gucci jackets, both pockets filled with it all
And these diamonds and my jewelry tellin' it all1Embed
