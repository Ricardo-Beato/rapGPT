6 ContributorsPillz (Ice Attack) Lyrics
Yeah, Gucci Mane, is in the building
So Icey Entertainment
Zaytoven on the track
When we come to the club, we got the choppas on deck, and the yoppas on deck

Is you rollin', is you rollin'
Is you rollin', is you rollin'
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
East Atlanta slums, yeah, that's where I come from
Pop that bubble cush, and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy, until your bitch came in
Bout the same time that thang kicked in
Her face ain't too pretty, but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up, thinkin this buffy the body
Ain't your name Latrina, cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm on three double stacks, and I'm lookin for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid mane, I love the way you flowin
Riding in my drop, but I don't know where I'm going
On 285, I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride, smelling like a pound of purple
Gucci show time, in like 5 more minutes
I'm gonna cool on juice, cause I'm really really trippin
Went to the strip club, then requested I'm the man
The next thing you know, I was throwin rubber bands
You might also like
Is you rollin', is you rollin'
Is you rollin', is you rollin'
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
She always tellin me, she ain't ever sucked a dick
Never took a pill, or never ate a bitch
You a liar, but I ain't gon get upset right now
But I wish I had a liar detector test right now
You say your man a bitch, he might be
But I bet your husband ain't icey like me
Keep standing on BC, in my ash and black tee
With them dope man Nikes, and them  ass jeans
Got paper, but I still keep that thrax on me
I'm the shit in East Atlanta, baby, ask about me
Pop 1, pop 2, 2 halves, that's 3
Ain't no Waffle House, baby, eat like KD
Gucci good like your hood, man, he's so street
Wearin doces in the club, cause you know the boy geeked
Drop the top on the thang, let you see my seats
We been rollin, rollin, rollin, and we ain't slept in weeks
Is you rollin', is you rollin'
Is you rollin', is you rollin'
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Gucci Mane LaFlare, nigga, get yo mind right
Order Krisp by the 12, like I'm kissin Bud Light
Sell cush by the bell, so you know my shit tight
7:30 in the morning, on an all night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shaudy
So tell me where to go, like my name E-40
A rich rockstar, nigga, I'm gon' party
Got a party pack of pills, that's at least bout 40
A  in your hand like like a pack of jellybeans
Take 4 these pills, call me in the morning
50,000 pills
Man, I'm so real
$3 for a pill, that's a damn good deal
Is you rollin', is you rollin'
Is you rollin', is you rollin'
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Girl, he geeked up, girl, he geeked up
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might beEmbed
