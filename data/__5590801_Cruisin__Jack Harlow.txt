4 ContributorsCruisin’ Lyrics
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum

Rollin' 'round town in the passenger seat (What)
My boy got the whip, as we pass through the streets (Okay)
Slumped to the seat while I bump to the beat
While my dad's on the phone tryna ask where I be (Yeah, but)
But, I ain't feel the phone vibrate in my cargoes
You know what it is, man, you know it's young Harlow (Harlow!)
See a fine chick, and I'm peepin' that shit
'Cause you know the boy gotta check her out like a barcode (She bad like)
Woah, in the zone, man, I gotta get home
Curfew twelve-thirty and it's twelve-fifteen (Fifteen)
Drive by slow, and I'm high off life
So my eyes hang low like my self-esteem (Kush)
Nah, just playin' I'm the man right now
Man, I swear to God, life ain't never felt this sweet (Never felt this sweet)
Haven't felt this free since elementary
And tonight is a night that I'm relishing
I am just trying to get through the obstacles
Hoping tonight doesn't end in the hospital
Working things out like that shit was abdominals
Then I just cruise, Mission Impossible
Like a white vacation
Man, I swear sometimes life's amazing
Sit back in the nighttime, at the right time
And you know the young boy mind is racing (Okay)
White suburbs to the all-black ghettos
Top to the bottom, first to the last levels
To the last lights in the dead night, like, woah now
Slow down, put his foot on the gas pedal (Skrrt!)
Got that hype and I got that metal
Got that bass and I got that treble
Time stays tickin' on this life I'm livin'
So goin' back home ain't on my schedule
You might also like
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun (Yeah)
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum (Ha, haha)

Oh shit, I just turned eighteen
No curfew now, gotta work that thing
And my new girlfriend got her tongue just pierced
But she goin' down on me tryna hurt that thing
I'm unprobable, smokin' through all of my obstacles
Like I'm a agent on Mission Impossible
They tryna throw alcohol on my cup
Well, bitch I got a bottle full
Young kid flye'd out, well I really didn't fly here
But I'm lookin' real fly now
Put me up in my house, got a swisher for the beat ride
Now we really finna vibe out
Enemies on time-out, lookin' for jokes to get the rhymes out
I ain't stickin 'round to find out
Plus I got the boy J-Harlow spittin' straight bars
In the dark until he ready to shine out
This my jam, we ain't never make no plans
Weekends throwin' up bands, gimme that advance
And give and Harlow a chance, bitch
You ain't never rolled no grams bitch
You ain't never seen these girls
But I'm 'bout to get between 'em like a sandwhich
And I'm tryna see this world
Got the globe in my mo'fuckin' hands bitch
Now I ain't tryna be the king of the world
But I also wasn't tryna put my thing in your girl
Heard of accidents?
Mo'fucka yeah that's what happens when you talk shit like a laxative
So gone give it a swirl when you around
The white boys holdin' it down for two towns
From Louisville to Manassas
We get it packin', we rappin and spreadin' love

When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum, yeahEmbed
