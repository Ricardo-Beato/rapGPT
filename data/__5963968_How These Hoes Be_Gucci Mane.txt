3 ContributorsHow These Hoes Be Lyrics
Yeah, huh, huh
DJ mothafuckin' Rell

You know all these hoes, actin' like you owe 'em somethin'
Just 'cause ya fucked her, but now ya want a partner
Partner, pop a dose and calamari pasta
Prada, Louis, you should see my closet
Crocodile, alligator, chinchilla, and ostrich
I don't need no bank cards, I only make deposits
Forty thousand dollars, all in hundreds, fuck a wallet
I didn't go to college, but my money, got a lot of it

Wish that, wish that Gucci let me make a profit
Go out when I knew it, but that is not an option
Wish that, wish that Gucci let me make a profit
Go out when I knew it, but that is not an option

Dually trucks, mounted up, you know how these hoes be
You know how these hoes be, you know how these hoes be
Hummer trucks, mounted up, you know how these hoes be
You know how these hoes be, you know how these hoes be
Old schools, mounted up, you know how these hoes be
You know how these hoes be, you know how these hoes be
Fit, off, set, sold, you know how these hoes be
You know how these hoes be, you know how these hoes be
You might also like
Homie wanna be me, you know how these niggas is
And she wanna fuck me, you know how these bitches is
This the forty inch waist, thats how big my britches is
Twenty-two, seven fifty, thats how much these chickens is
Growed up in apartments, I didn't have a picket fence
I didn't have a back yard, now I got a Jaguar
I am a celebrity, but I don't want no caviar
Can I get some hot ones, hundred piece for all of us
Shawty really bulletproof, she down to fuck all of us
All of us not ballers, baby, tell me, you just somethin' to fuck
Toss you up, toss you up, bossed up, Phifer truck
Drop top Viper, and its striped, bought me two of 'em

Dually trucks, mounted up, you know how these hoes be
You know how these hoes be, you know how these hoes be
Hummer trucks, mounted up, you know how these hoes be
You know how these hoes be, you know how these hoes be
Old schools, mounted up, you know how these hoes be
You know how these hoes be, you know how these hoes be
Fit, off, set, sold, you know how these hoes be
You know how these hoes be, you know how these hoes be
Its Gucci, baby!Embed
