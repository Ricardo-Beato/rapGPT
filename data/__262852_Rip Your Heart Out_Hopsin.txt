Well, now that you've all prepared yourselves for the madness, I present to you: Hopsin and Tech N9ne!

See, I be bangin' on niggas with rappin' voodoo
No slack for you fools
If you ain't gettin' the message I'll slap it through you
My ass is coo-coo, tracks is brutal, that's the usual
Shit that we do in Panorama City
No time for no bitches actin' too sadity
My niggas is rugged, rude, and kinda gritty, for really
Explosive, you know this, come get your daily dosage
I spit that funky shit, can you send a medic for my halitosis?
The flow is as solid as diamonds
Niggas should know they cannot corrode this
So motherfucker bow down
As if you're tryin' to suck on your own dick (Ferocious)
He think he tight, then watch my ass stretch him
You'll feel the wrath if ever you fags test him
You just a sperm cell that climbed
Up out of your dad's rectum
Muh'fucker, I got balls like I'm Ash Ketchum
I really can't imagine not spazzin' on a track this savage
I snap, then I'm a little fanatic
So orgasm 'cause they witnessin' madness, nigga
This that twenty one three classic, nigga
Talkin' that shit get yo' ass whooped, nigga
Damn it, that nigga Hopsin he be killin' shit
If I see him I'ma blast that nigga

We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it
We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it

You damn right
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
You damn right
Nigga, I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out

Never will the bomb ignite unless you step to me
Gonna be the one inside of my trajectory
Nigga better run and hide, I kill excessively
That's my recipe, 'til the death of me
You don't wanna be the reason I'ma lose it
Anybody wanna battle, better cool it
I'ma chop on top and I come cruisin', two-bit
Sloppy chopped and I can prove it, stupid!
I'ma buck ‘em all down
Tecca N9na sick, I'm such a raw clown
Eager to F it up, even if ever ya
Evil, I eat ‘em up, fuckin' y'all sounds
Smother ya, when I pop at people they discover the
Killer stoppin' evil, what the fuck is ya
Trippin off of? You can get lickin' my governor
Nigga, they callin' me Bane, like Saddam Hussein
Ain't that a bitch? 'Cause me and Hop only thing
Is takin' over like Pinky and the Brain
I'ma give you the gun and
You're never livin' when the trigger is summoned
I see you sucka shakin', shiver, you runnin'
"The niggas are comin'! The niggas are comin'!"
Better tell them all that they don't want the N9na hail to fall
Your lowlife, soon they're gonna be no life, doomed
Gonna go night, dunes, gonna pick yo' right tomb
I know it's irkin' you niggas
You watchin' me rip it then blow like boom!
We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it
We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it

You damn right
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
You damn right
Nigga, I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out

Let me get the baton back, I'ma bomb rap
Lookin' oh so malicious with contacts
Nigga starin', like, "Damn, where yo' mind at?!"
This ain't no pro level shit, it's beyond that
Loaded up and I'm ready for combat
Standin' out like I'm Khalifa's blonde patch
When I come at you with vicious artillery
You wouldn't want it, like Tomica's contract
I K.O. niggas, I'm sorry
Then I throw 'em in a white trash RV
Then they wake up with a blade stuck in their rib
Yelling: "Oh my goodness, yo, where are we?!
Hopsin, this shit is too gnarly!
Why would you wanna go harm me?
I thought we was homies
Now you wanna go and turn me into shrimp on the barbie!"
(Fatality) Bitches, I am rap, every verse is fire
I lay my shit down like fertilizer
A murderous words supplier, merkin' you is my first desire
If you got a problem with me
You can suck on my dick 'til it squirts saliva
The whole planet been waitin' to get a serial killer symphony
Comin' from the Volume and Strange
Get in the way of a killer, try to deliver
You gonna end up in a trap, and I'm sewin' your brains
MC's wanna take the bar down
I fucked the game and even picked your card out
Bitch, I'm far out
Hopsin and Tecca N9na takin' over, we gon' rip your heart out
We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it
We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it

You damn right
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
You damn right
Nigga, I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out71Embed
