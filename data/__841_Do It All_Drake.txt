42 ContributorsDo It All Lyrics
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

Tonight I’m into breaking up
Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone
I-I-I-I’m with my people
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
It's just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby, forget about it
I'm headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
My judgment's never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman, weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Baby, after you
I’ve had a glass or two so
You might also like
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G. and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask what's up and they just always say the cost of living
I learn from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen
'Cause everything's easier to get into than get out of
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, I still run the committee
N.Y. forever nigga, Diddy
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
