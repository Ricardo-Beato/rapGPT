Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your xan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love

You might also like
I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you've seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes
It ain't nothin' you could say but "That's love"
That's love
That's love
That's love
Say that's love, ooh, ooh
That's love
That's love
That's love, that's love, that's love
I love you (You love who?)
I love you (Tell 'em who you love)
I love you (You love who?)
I love you (Yeah)
I love you (Sing it right now)
I love you (Love)
I love you (Who do you love?)
I love you (Love)
I love you
That's love
That's love, that's love
Say that's love, ooh, ooh, that's love (Love)
That's love, that's love, that's love, that's love, igh54Embed
