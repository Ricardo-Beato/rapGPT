Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I spend that guap, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I fucked your thot, yeah, yeah
She say I'm cute but I get that a lot, yeah, yeah
Baby, I'm Almighty, start flexing like yeah, yeah

Skrrt, If you flexin' then just join me (Then just join me, fuck)
But please do not disappoint me (Don't disappoint me, fuck)
Tryna flex up on me, you'll get disappointed (You'll be disappointed, fuck)
Pull up to the spot, ten pounds of that funky (Ten pounds of that funky though)
I don't smoke that reggie though (Reggie though)
'93 octane, Texaco (Texaco)
Got some shooters out in Mexico (Mexico)
Pull up, get that check then go (Check then go)
300 dollar bag, what is it inside? (What is it?)
20 G's on my True Religion pants (On my fuckin' True)
Don't sell that bullshit, I ain't gon' buy it (Stop)
For that cash, yeah, yeah, I park my car outside (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Catch you slippin', catch your thot outside (Duhduhduh)
Tell your thot to hop up in my ride (Hop up in my ride, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Now we cruising gettin' high (Cruisin', gettin' high)
She told me you was just lyin' (She like, "That nigga was just lying")
