Either way, either way
Either way, either way
Either way, either way
Either way, either way

Either way, bitch, I'm that nigga (I'm that nigga, either way, either way)
Either way, I'm countin' figures (I'm countin' figures, either way, either way)
Either way, I'm with my fuckin' niggas (I'm with my fuckin' niggas, either way, either way)
And either way, we'll fuckin' get ya (Either way, we'll fuckin' get ya, either way, either way)
Either way, I'm gon' get cake (The way I love you Kay Kay, either way)
Either way, I'm gon' get laid (Either way, I'm gon' get laid, ayy, either way)
Either way, I'm a fuck yo' bae (Either way, I'm a fuck yo' bae, ayy, either way)
Either way, she'll know my face (Either way, she'll know my face name)
And I gotta get this money either way

Gotta get this money either way
Got them bitches comin' either way, ayy
And this money comin' either way, ayy
And I money hungry either way
Dreads low, you can't see my face, ayy
Eyes low, I can't see the place, ayy
I'm smokin' dope, I can't feel my face
That was gon' happen either way
I'm gon' let that semi spray
A fuck nigga in my way and that's either way
I'm ridin' Bentley's MIA
My chopper Kimmy K, I nicknamed her Kimmy Karday
Just bought some semis today
My ning ding went MIA

Either way, bitch, I'm that nigga (I'm that nigga, either way, either way)
Either way, I'm countin' figures (I'm countin' figures, either way, either way)
Either way, I'm with my fuckin' niggas (I'm with my fuckin' niggas, either way, either way)
And either way, we'll fuckin' get ya (Either way, we'll fuckin' get ya, either way, either way)
Either way, I'm gon' get cake (The way I love you Kay Kay, either way)
Either way, I'm gon' get laid (Either way, I'm gon' get laid, ayy, either way)
Either way, I'm a fuck yo' bae (Either way, I'm a fuck yo' bae, ayy, either way)
Either way, she'll know my face (Either way, she'll know my face name)
And I gotta get this money either way

I remember sellin' coke now I get booked for shows
â€˜Member some lil thots but my phone full of those
And a lot of guns, bitch, my home full of those
Either way, you can get eight shots out this Ruger nose, ayy
She wanna come to my house, I'm like, "Girl, no clothes", ayy
She wanna smell my guap, I'm like, "Girl yo' nose", ayy
Bitch, what you talkin' bout, I'm into it with O-we
You don't give me top I'm into it with you
You feel me?
Smokin' on this loud, you smell me
You ain't smokin' loud, that's filthy
Told my lean-man to double seal me
I take clean money and I'm filthy
Either way, bitch, I'm that nigga (I'm that nigga, either way, either way)
Either way, I'm countin' figures (I'm countin' figures, either way, either way)
Either way, I'm with my fuckin' niggas (I'm with my fuckin' niggas, either way, either way)
And either way, we'll fuckin' get ya (Either way, we'll fuckin' get ya, either way, either way)
Either way, I'm gon' get cake (The way I love you Kay Kay, either way)
Either way, I'm gon' get laid (Either way, I'm gon' get laid, ayy, either way)
Either way, I'm a fuck yo' bae (Either way, I'm a fuck yo' bae, ayy, either way)
Either way, she'll know my face (Either way, she'll know my face name)
And I gotta get this money either way
