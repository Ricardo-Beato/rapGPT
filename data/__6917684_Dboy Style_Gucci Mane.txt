12 ContributorsDboy Style Lyrics
Sizzle, roll one real fat (It's Gucci)
What? (Haha)
Southside on the track, yeah
808, 1017, huh? (Brr)

I'm a trapper, I am not a rapper (No)
I mount the Dawn up, it's lookin' like a Raptor (Damn)
You a hater, you are not a factor
Big diamond choker on my neck, I got asthma
Heavy watch on my wrist, it cost a meal ticket
Just stack your money up, get rich enough, then we'll kick it
It's 'bout survival, I'm bustin' at my rivals (Pow, pow)
I put a glacier on her hand, it went viral (Burr)
Egyptian fabric on my skin, it came from Cairo
Say ain't no cap in your rap, but you a gyro
They kicked me out of college, I wasn't embarrassed (No)
I graduated from pointers, moved on to carats (Damn)
I promoted myself, gave me a salary (Millions)
It's still hard to believe I'm a celebrity
Dark shades, I still see all the jealousy (I see 'em)
I'm in a Pegasus, I'm racing for my legacy

I'ma rock my jewelry d-boy style
Bust down my watch, bust down my smile (Bling)
These fuck niggas tried to steal my style (Steal my style)
But cookin' up grams can't go out of style
They said, "Gucci went broke," I said, "Hush your mouth"
I'm off paper, got paper, they done fucked up now (Fucked up now)
Kick back on the couch in this big-ass house
With this Olympic-size pool, I went the He-Man route
You might also like
Diamonds so cold, it's like the heat ran out (Huh?)
I need a Wonder Woman spouse and a He-Man house (Yeah)
I dropped the top in the V, then the freak came out (Freaks)
Then when she suckin' on the dick, I thought her teeth came out
Nigga, I ain't go to practice, nigga, I don't wanna scrimmage (Nah)
Twenty-two bricks, runnin' with 'em like Emmitt
Mama couldn't talk to me, I ain't wanna listen (Nah)
Teacher couldn't teach me 'cause I ain't pay attention (Fuck it)
Mr. Drippy Drippy have you swimmin' with the fishes
They want the old Gucci Mane that do a verse for a chicken (Skrrt)
Old Gucci Mane sellin' chicken for a living (Wop)
Water whippin' in the kitchen, even then I had the vision (It's Gucci)

I'ma rock my jewelry d-boy style
Bust down my watch, bust down my smile (Bling)
These fuck niggas tried to steal my style (Steal my style)
But cookin' up grams can't go out of style
They said, "Gucci went broke," I said, "Hush your mouth"
I'm off paper, got paper, they done fucked up now (Fucked up now)
Kick back on the couch in this big-ass house
With this Olympic-size pool, I went the He-Man route (Wop)

Huh?
