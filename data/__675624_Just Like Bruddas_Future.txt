(Zaytoven)
I gotta kick this flavor, you heard?
Ah, that boy Steezy
That's his bitch
It's only Mexico 'round a nigga, feel me, you heard?

You're chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian
All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland
Molly on file and I'm sipping out the styrofoam
Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium
Bend it over, pose for a Freebandz president
I'm counting up 'cho while I'm counting up these presidents
Slide down on a new diva, that's what we about
Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so poured up
Two-seater plush, few racks in the bumper
A few goons in the cut, I treat 'em just like brothers
Treat 'em just like brothers, treat 'em just like brothers
Few goons in the cut, treat 'em just like brothers

Chewing on the bars, and we call 'em barbarian
I'm on my way to Mars, got the stars in the ceiling
Down south, Georgia, boy, we the new Chopper City
We the new Chopper City, we the new Chopper City, yeah
Free B.G.
Word to my youngin, we gon' dump on you
That dirty money, I can smell the gunpowder
That's dirty money, I can smell the gunpowder
He got his hoodie with his hand in his right pocket
And you gotta watch out or it's lights out
Lights out, hotwire me an Eddie Bauer
And I went and got it poppin', and I let them bullets shower

You're chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian
All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland
Molly on file and I'm sipping out the styrofoam
Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium
Bend it over, pose for a Freebandz president
I'm counting up 'cho while I'm counting up these presidents
Slide down on a new diva, that's what we about
Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so poured up
Two-seater plush, few racks in the bumper
A few goons in the cut, I treat 'em just like brothers
Treat 'em just like brothers, treat 'em just like brothers
Few goons in the cut, treat 'em just like brothers

Off two milligrams, I forgot about my ex-ho ('Bout my ex-ho)
Stayin' with the gas, fill my blunts up with petrol (Blunts up with petrol)
Pop a couple double G's and down 'em with some XO (Down 'em with some XO)
Trippin' off them bars, you forgot when you was dead broke (yeah)
Styrofoams and mula, yeah, styrofoams and mula (Freebandz)
Half a million dollars on a ring, I'm taking Percocets
Down five Xanax and I pray I wake up and forget
I been with the gang 'cause they love me how I am
Shit ain't been the same, they talkin' 'bout me on the 'Gram
They say I turned my back on my baby mama, I'm on them tabs
And my hood looking up to me, I love them niggas to death
Even in the afterlife, when ain't a breath of me left
You're chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian
All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland
Molly on file and I'm sipping out the styrofoam
Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium
Bend it over, pose for a Freebandz president
I'm counting up 'cho while I'm counting up these presidents
Slide down on a new diva, that's what we about
Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so poured up
Two-seater plush, few racks in the bumper
A few goons in the cut, I treat 'em just like brothers
Treat 'em just like brothers, treat 'em just like brothers
Few goons in the cut, treat 'em just like brothers

He got his hoodie with his hand in his right pocket
And you gotta watch out or it's lights out
Lights out, hotwire me an Eddie Bauer
And I went and got it poppin', and I let them bullets shower33Embed
