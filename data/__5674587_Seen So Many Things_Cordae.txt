3 ContributorsSeen So Many Things Lyrics
Yeah
This one for all the real
Uh

I seen the winter and fall and all the winners who fall
I hope beef turn love and all the niggas resolve
And all the people getting killed, damn it's pissing me off
And all the rappers sneak dissin' won't mention at all
It's so priceless, this feeling so priceless
I swear that I might just put rap in a crisis
And then all the madness, these niggas is average
I know that I'm  it's all in a bad sense
But on to another note, like buying my mother's 
And all of the people doubting, I swear y'all can fuckin' choke
But I don't promote violence, got niggas who tote irons
They flexing and most lying
The idols got ghost writers, this shit is crazy
It seem like the world is falling apart
Don't gotta worry 'bout my shit, man, it's all from the heart
I mean you niggas know I'm real, I been raw from the start
I seen through the light, that's why I'm standin' tall in the dark

'Cause I seen so many things
And they shed so many tears
And life isn't all it seems
I seen through all my years
'Cause I've been up and I fell down
Was in heaven, I'm in hell now
'Cause I've seen so many things
And I've seen so many things
You might also like
I put my heart into rap, there's nothing harder than that
Not to mention other niggas that are partially facts
There's nothing for me to hide and I'm thankful that we alive
And the music is  I was working that three to five
It was worth it, I swear it was worth it
And practice those verses, and making it perfect
I gotta just get it
This rap shit is like my lottery ticket
So hoes chase but I swear I'm too fly for these pigeons
I'm like that kid in the basement chasing all of the faces
'Cause they was  hatred, I'ma ball when I make it
I got some problems I'm facing like college  payments
Dad said this rap shit might take a lot of my waiting
So you got two options, be a doctor or patient
Or you got no options and your option is famous
So I guess a nigga gotta make the best of my living
Don't wanna be that old nigga who regretting decisions

'Cause I seen so many things
And they shed so many tears
And life isn't all it seems
I seen through all my years
'Cause I've been up and I fell down
Was in heaven, I'm in hell now
'Cause I've seen so many things
And I've seen so many things, yeah
