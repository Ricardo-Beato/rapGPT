11 ContributorsReady 2 Ryde Lyrics
Keep it shaking, Cali keep it quaking
Cause the Ryders got me bringin home the bacon
Show me love, and it wasn't no mistakin
That I would dedicate this melody - fuck the hatin

I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

Aiyyo, so what the deal Dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg
Niggas seem stressed to the brain, how you feel dogg?
Nigga I'mma ride, set it up, let it spill Dogg
Anything you want, I can flip, got the skill Dogg

Baby girl you so so-phisticated
Finance related, you graduated
To the next level in the game, wearin my name
Bad little brickhouse, go and do that thang

Yo - niggas surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty - your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, askin why he kissed me
Stop whinin, just to cry and get the mackin daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is actin crabby
That's why he bagged me
Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy
No stressin over chicks - problem? Bet I solve it fastly

We gangbang on these niggas like we 'posed to do
And I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you
We posted Boo - you, my, one and only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin
Thuggin, dig it, dug-in
I'm lovin every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talkin bout, no doubt
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy

Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was frontin I hop on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'mma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my litter strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song
