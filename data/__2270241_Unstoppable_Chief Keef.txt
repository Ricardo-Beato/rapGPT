30 ContributorsUnstoppable Lyrics
My leather so soft, shells so hard
You wanna be a boss nigga go hard
Call me lil glo I come through and dim your yard
I got coco baby like damn so hard
Go in my closet pick some straps out the arsenal
I got on Trues but these bullets fly like envelops
Blood Gang ride through hop out like whats poppin' tho?
I'm a blade call me Sosa Snipes Unstoppable

Tadoe in the cut, Slick on the roof tho
Lay these bullets on yo ass straight sumo
I'm smokin on this Tooka I'm on Pluto
I be doing me I ain't worried bout where you go
You gotta run a couple loops for the loot
Get in yo car make it do what it do
I ran through 2 milli but it's cool
I be stirring up that money making music
Off that Don't like and Love Sosa too
Play Faneto in the club they go coo-coo
I'm like Bang, smokin cali but with Snoop
I'm from Chiraq but Cali what it do?

My leather so soft, shells so hard
You wanna be a boss nigga go hard
Call me lil glo I come through and dim your yard
I got coco baby like damn so hard
Go in my closet pick some straps out the arsenal
I got on Trues but these bullets fly like envelops
Blood Gang ride through hop out like whats poppin' tho?

You know I'm from Chiraq got the K

All these fuck niggas mocking me

Police walking up on me I be blowing smoke
In they face
Wanna lock me up cause I got dope, shit is gay
I be with that disrespectful shit any day
Try me Imma let the Tec blow anyway

My leather so soft, shells so hard
You wanna be a boss nigga go hard
Call me lil glo I come through and dim your yard
I got coco baby like damn so hard
Go in my closet pick some straps out the arsenal
I got on Trues but these bullets fly like envelops
Blood Gang ride through hop out like whats poppin' tho?
I'm a blade call me Sosa Snipes Unstoppable6Embed
