2 ContributorsCity Under Siege Lyrics
Can't understand my city's under siege
F-A-C-E-M-O-B screamin' 'cause I mean it
'Til these motherfuckers bury me
37-40 pull that pistol packin'
Gun slangin', bangin' Southside
Heat bringer, heat slanger

Head banger, jaw re-arranger, the bitch strangler
A total stranger in your face with this thing aimed at ya
You're facin' danger, 16 with one up in the chamber
I'm 'bout to stain ya, with this motherfuckin' handgun

And fuck them laws
They got my brother already, they can suck my balls
Average nigga have no luck at all
But because I be in my 'Lac chillin'
They stereotype me thinkin' I'm into crack sellin'

Man, I'm Windy City 2-20, anybody chin checker
3rd floor Lake Grove, 35th in leather gloves
With the snub nose, complex born and raised
And under siege every day
You might also like
The definition, of a guerilla
He is a killa, robbin' for scrilla
Not your average every-day nigga
The laws at me, better off dead 'cause I ain't happy
(Kill or be killed) I'd rather go to war before they catch me

Arrest me, I told you before I wears vest's
A born legend by the way of .357
I'm an automatic with static, it's tragic Mr A-L K-A-P-O-N-E
The last man standing

Rollin', ridin', slowly slidin'
Creepin' up in the corners where you hoes be hidin'
Takin' you over in ways you never even thought of
The city's under siege, nigga, don't get caught up

I'm a 4th Ave Lake Street ridin' ass nigga
Still a ? superior executioner
The bomb M-I-D-W-E-S-T marauder
Killer with the Triple Goose gun compartment
(A city under siege)
Ghetto birds hover over South Side Chicago
Ellis Park killin' fields, gang war rival
Bigger than the Sears Tower, I was a pain in the smoke
They found his body floatin' the lake shore

Eight holes filled up his body full of hot ones
Shot one, two, three, four, down like dominoes
Cop killin', Colombian necktie vic
Split, throat slit, it's over with

I said a hip-hop
Pour a cup of coffee and then I'll sip and stop
Because we're gettin' watched by some new group
New booty MC's walkin' around like you and me
But all they do is listen to shit only a fool'd believe

2-75, big fat and nasty, fuck bein' classy
I'm straight ghetto, chuckin' beer bottles out the window
Nigga, I been broke so I say fuck poppin' some Dom P
I'm drinkin' MD 20/20, my city's under siegeEmbed
