14 ContributorsVacation Lyrics
I got to
Like that, don't you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hahahaha
Yeah, nigga, say I see you, nigga
Turn me up a little bit

Said I'm stressed out, so tired
My days so long
Said I'm stressed out, so tired
Got to move on

I need a vacation
I'm goin' to Decatur where it's greater
See if I can stack me up some paper
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to The Bluff where it's rough
See if I can pick me up enough
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to College Park where it's dark
See if I can get me off some hard
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to the Four where it good
And everybody know I make it snow
I need a vacation
You might also like
You see me standin' here, like a chandelier
Gangsta of the yeah sippin' Belvedere
I'm smokin' Inglewood, I'm feelin' hella good
A nigga wish he could, I wish a nigga would
I'm smokin' on the good, I'm grippin' on the grain
Louie the thirteen mixed with Hurricane
And like a crippled mane you can catch me with that cane
Gon' be a bloody murder if I catch you with my chain
See, these hatin' ass niggas gettin' on my nerves
I'm so disappointed, y'all, I'm at a loss for words
I put it on the hood, I'm gettin' money 'til I'm dead
The only thing I'm fearin' is the motherfuckin' feds

I need a vacation
I'm goin' to Kirkwood where it's greater
See if I can stack me up some paper
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to Thomasville where it's rough
See if I can get me up enough
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to Allen Temple where it's dark
See if I can get me off some hard
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to Bankhead where it good
And everybody know I make it snow
I need a vacation
Yeah, I'm outta here, send you a postcard
And if you're out of that, send you some more hard
I need a peace of mind, some relaxation
I'm mindin' my business , so why you niggas hatin'?
I keep it too real, so why you niggas fakin'?
You try it if you want, 'cause my niggas waitin'
Won't let you stress me out, won't let you worry me
Just 'cause I'm doin' good, won't let you murder me
It's drivin' me insane, it's makin' me crazy
You know you owe a nigga, so fuck you, pay me
I put it on the hood, get money 'til I'm dead
The only thing I'm fearin' is the motherfuckin' feds

I need a vacation
I'm goin' to Pittsburgh where it's greater
See if I can stack me up some paper
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to Summerhill where it's rough
See if I can get me up enough
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to Edgewood where it's dark
See if I can get me off some hard
I need a vacation
Jonesboro South where it good
And everybody know I make it snow
I need a vacation
Said I'm stressed out, so tired
My days so long
Said I'm stressed out, so tired
Got to move on

I need a vacation
I'm goin' to Decatur where it's greater
See if I can stack me up some paper
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to The Bluff where it's rough
See if I can pick me up enough
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to College Park where it's dark
See if I can get me off some hard
I need a vacation
I'm goin' to the four where it good
And everybody know I make it snow
I need a vacation1Embed
