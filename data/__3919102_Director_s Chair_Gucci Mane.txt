John, what it do, mane?
What up, nigga?
I know these niggas ain't loyal
I know these niggas fake as hell, mane
But that's just water under the bridge, man
We gon' move on, man
Get Gwop, man, you know what I'm saying? (Hahaha)
It's East Atlanta's finest in this motherfucker, man
I'm affiliated with the affiliest, you know who I'm talking 'bout
DJ Drama and Gucci Mane, man
They never thought this shit would happen, man
They just gon' make 'em hate, man
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
You feel me? Nah, I mean, we gon' flex, mane
I mean, new cars, new jewellery, man, new (Haha)
New shoes and new hoes and new clothes, man
It's Gucci, baby, DJ Drama, man
Tell 'em hate on that, man (Hahaha)
They don't want to tell that, man
Cheers to the lord, babyYou might also likeEmbed
