Bobby Brown, Bobby Brown
Pick a town, lock it down
Chrome Hearts, Chrome Hearts
Bitches love my style
Look at how my wrist glow, huh
Two-fifty just for the watch, uh
Post on the block, I was servin' vanilla
I caught a wave on some Maison Margiela
Audemars, water, Beretta, vendetta
Stella McCartney, it came with the bezel
Takin' off just like a rocket, got racks in my pocket
I'm havin' my way with these hoes
Shawty in love with my diamonds, she love how they twinkle
She love how they glisten and glow
Pour up a four like I'm young Tony Snow
One in the head, ninety-nine more to go
Winnin' and winnin', pull up like a GOAT
Trippin', don't spill, that chinchilla on the floor
Came from the gutter, that's word from the bro
I'm Evel Knievel, these niggas some divas
I'm really havin' more hits than The Beatles
I was out trappin' with keys like Alicia
I be finessin' my plug, got it cheaper
Bought some new killers, I bought some new choppers, hey
I'm on the block with the Devil, I hang with the robbers
Any hood we go, they treat me like God, huh
Switch up the flow for the visual
Just so you know that I'm spiritual
All of my money identical
Blue faces, blue faces, keep it one hundred
They want that Woo shit
Niggas gon' shoot shit
You ain't no Woo, nigga
You ain't gon' do shit
