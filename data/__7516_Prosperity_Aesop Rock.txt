23 ContributorsProsperity Lyrics
Sulking in bulk and a half, sulk in a laugh, crash test
Figure the mixture's digging up his last breath
Grief leaf thief briefly turned chieftain
The tap water is on the waters off the waters leaking
So this is blue?
My frame reportedly sparred in garden variety burners and lost to normalcy
My terms the memoir, obligation the bookmark
Crystallize impurities to zero on the...
Autocrat derby catapult sponges, my hunches hurling murder abundance
Lunches where the city sump is pungent, (Curdling!)
Tomorrow sits on what the sin/consquence merger brings
To bubble up along the edges of precious child fantasy broken, broken
Hi, my name is Hazardous Tobacconist (Hi), hung on the brink
I purge a dirge and spit my lung in the sink
As for the product, well it's wrenched in a barren backward wasteland
Of shimmering moral tension adventuring to blossom pleasant
I've done it all, from pixie dust to cramming pins in voodoo dolls
And ninety-nine dreams linked on the shooting gallery wall
But it's like, not a wave crash similar to last or next
Heckle me not already doctored by regrets
Rain (rain)
Belligerent fragments bond massive
Usher in the pixels 'til the image burn classic
Bliss in a barrel and motivation in a basket
Imma cast it out to sea and wait for my karma to grasp it
I left my crutch over the rainbow with my riches
And I know the rat race of the bad taste once its grimace cringes
See, an iron butterfly will float if given good condition
But I'm still fishing the same worm from the same faulty position
You might also like(Prosperity)
Sorta makes you think
I'm a Tomahawk I walk alone and miss the bliss
Inside the accidental meeting of the pencil and the seedling
And the central started beating
Breathing at a rapid caliber
I doubt if her allotted grace will last forever more
-
Dusting off a dream to be an autopilot
Still a silent understudy. Funny how the opposite will throttle
And the different stroke and model to the prison
Is an accurate portrayal of inadequate betrayal of a wish
-
Gonna-wanna-coulda-shoulda-woulda didn't
Isn't it amusing choosing
Yet a plan is hibernating
Waiting till the mating dance of motivation took a fine position
Dishing only after every little kiddy has performed
-
I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a general he said
I just wanna, I just wanna be a-
I just wanna sleep, yo
Oh, Eidolon, Capitol Crush
Gallop my chariot burning and awful enigma
Sprung by the sling of David to pierce gutter bug batch prior to hatch
Dismiss it as a soul cadets' excuse to decorate maps with thumb tacks
This gold star product pushing hate boogie themes Enter the smoke screen
Blazing saddle remnants alive analyze pensive
Connect all picket fences like chain gangs linked digging trenches
To candy land image factory. Sold
-
Oh, I wanna be an astronaut, I got the merits and heart
And I bought a starship with hard earned money from one hour selling dreams to dummies
When they raised the lights:
Ja-ja-Jesus Christ! I've never seen so many goblins in my life! (Oh, my lord)
-
Migrate through the fog and then some
Dragging bitch circuits on a short leash like organ grinder primates dancing for bread crumbs
Well, did you touch that slugger?
Banging on the table with an old tin cup, thin luck
-
I can raise the dead while the shocked settlers fled the blaze
Sprung out their bed of nails to spread the sails, racing for milk and bread
But I got (big) big plans. I ride a big boat with a big ol' motor
And I ain't really that big on helping you turn your leaf over
-
(Let's sing)
Bring out your dead, I got a pile sky high
(Let's sing)
Run if you're miserable, saw the planet fly by
My name is "Try to deny the magnificent doom craft my ragged soul built
And I'mma show you why this fucking globe tilts"
(Repeat 3x)
Take me where the air is clear
I don't really know where but I know its not here and
Every little step she takes makes me spin
Cause I know I'll never have to ever sleep alone againEmbed
