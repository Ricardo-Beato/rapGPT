Dipset
Dipset
Dipset, dipset
Dipset, dipset
Told that bitch get her lips wet
Ayy, bitch

Get your lips wet, bitch, Dipset
We gon' aim this fucking clip at you (Bang)
We gon' blow this fucking clip (Bang, bang)
At your shoulders and your hip (Doo, doo)
Dipset, Dipset
Bitch, Dipset
Goin' crazy, Dipset
Killa season, Dipset

Put them Killa Cam's on them, I'm flexing real hard
Put them bandanas on them, guess I think I'm Juelz
Where my jewels? bitch they shining, look at all these diamonds
Bitch, I got it all from grinding
Shaun White, snowboard
Oh boy
I'ma old boy
Matter of fact, bitch I'ma Glo boy
You ain't making no noise
Pull on your block, gratata, this a set up store boy
You might also like
Get your lips wet, bitch, Dipset
We gon' aim this fucking clip at you (Bang)
We gon' blow this fucking clip (Bang, bang)
At your shoulders and your hip (Doo, doo)
Dipset, Dipset
Bitch, Dipset
Goin' crazy, Dipset
Killa season, Dipset

I'm at it again, got a necklace again
Got weapons again, and we blast them again
He did it again, oh shit he ducked them again
He shitted again, pulled up in Beamers and Bentleys
Oh yes, wait a minute Mr. Postman
I got some guns, go and send them to Glo and nem
Cause I can't trust foe nem
They think I'm flexing, I'ma have to show them
I need a McLaren sitting on 4's
I need Velanos and Lambos
Niggas sneak dissing on the Glo
I tell my nina "get them girl" like Cam do2Embed
