9 ContributorsA Long Hello Lyrics
Let's make a bonfire
I got a blanket in my trunk
One blanket, and we could wrap it around both of us
The lake is beautiful this time of night
I wanna listen to your breath
While I look at the moon
Plus, plus I got you this overpriced iced latte
Look at the stars, check this out

There's far too many breakup songs
And there's not enough songs about the moment we met
A lot of words get spread, the pain, shame, and regret
And I'm not holdin' my breath for any change to the sketch
But I hope to death somebody can sing about
The countless times that we found a way to even out
Even though we were born to work with these hands
It's in the plan for us to learn the insecurity dance
It goes: make a party as the method to prevent it
I'm so sorry you reacted so defensive
If I could lend an unsolicited suggestion
Don't even know if I'd recommend that you paid attention
You might also likeThey told me "Hell never felt so good"
But I could tell that they only tryna sell some books
"Look, y'all know that I would help if I could"
But I was too busy tryna nail myself to some wood
There's more songs praising the people we went to prison with
Than there are praising the people we make children with
And I ain't saying either one is more legitimate
But it'd be ridiculous to think that it's coincidence
Shit, I'll never be the best at this
I write songs that I'm living in, welcome to my sweatshirt
I think it's magnificent that you're presently present
Thanks for listening, appreciate your effort
Cinderella, fit your hand in the glove
We on a spaceship, crash land from above
We on a lazy river, fly fishing for love
We on a double barrel shotgun, hunting for dove
Life is just a song, I hope that it's long
It starts with "hello" and it goes till I die
If I did know it all I'd at least attempt to clarify
Why we try to over-emphasize the goodbyes

We try to over-emphasize the goodbyes
We always over-emphasize the goodbyes
So just pretend this is a long hello
So just pretend this is a long hello
You can pretend this is a long helloEmbed
