86 Contributors3 Tearz Lyrics
Oh, we went to school alright
Haha, we went to school, we was doin' JPEGs
Check

Used to cut the rock with no glove on (Step)
Shove on, for the block, develop a love jones (Yeah)
The reason why your ho got them rug burns (Ah)
It's no limit, call me Mr. Serv-On (Yeah)
Work all day 'til the work gone (Step)
Talkin' back in the day when I had a chirp phone (Boop)
My nigga made a wrong turn, got flipped in the zone
Had to say I was a smoker just so I could go home (Home)
Every day, another episode (Step)
I'm just tryna hear the beat like the stethoscope (Yeah)
Like my bass lines thick, like a Texas ho
It was written, but the signature not legible (Nah)
Drink so much, I could drown a fish
On some other shit (Step)
A demon on the hunt for the succubus (Step)
Why you on some pedo shit? Hit it then fuck her bitch
I don't think you know who you're fuckin' with (Yeah)

Two tears in a bucket, fuck it (Step)
I don't care about nothin', nothin' (No)
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin' (Step)

Danny, it's dangerous, Run The Jewels is chaos in arrangements
Shit'll give your fuckface a facelift
Poppa did the Triple Lindsy flip when the 'caine hit
Mama never met a bottle that she couldn't drain quick (Ayy)
Stuck in a rude mood, the fuck shit approaches
Like we believe in nothin' Lebowski (Yes, Lebowski), there's no motive
I babble on, tryna get bags like, "Fuck all of 'em"
Death is on my couch and I'm telling' him jokes, stallin' him
Plus, I offer one of my smokes, he smoked all of 'em (Fuck, man)
True doom, eat up your crew, like MM... FOOD
Say the name, it's like you prayin' for pain, but you rude
Got a brain? You gon' move it or lose it, you screwed
I'm profane, it's deranged, it is sick, real shit
If I'm correct, the really cool kids prolly callin' it lit (Hey kids)
Call it shit that I am culling from my brain with a switch
Hold my beer, I'm 'bout to go and get rich, motherfuckers

Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'
Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin', hol' up

I don't give a fuck 'bout Trump, who got dump?
Who protesting collections at their garbage dump?
And I don't really give a fuck about givin' a fuck
And who feels that black celebrities ain't givin' enough
Give 'em the dick; fat, slick son of a bitch
Better than you are, what you are's the son of a whore
My dad told me that your mom was somethin' mean on her knees
But thank God we ain't related, 'cause she swallowed the seeds
Happy belated, I'm elated to know we ain't related
So tell your special kids stop saying Auntie Shana my lady
I sip on fine wines, fine dine with dimes and nines
I got an Einstein mind and I still tote iron
I'm a P-I-M-P in my own rhyme
Space-age gorilla pimpin' out the cage with mine
Would you steal for me, nigga?
If it's goddamn mine
Would you kill for me, nigga?
Bitch, you out your goddamn mind
And that's goddamn right, I'm goddamn Mike
Win in the end like Tina did goddamn Ike
Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'
Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin', hol' up

Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'
Bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'
Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'8Embed
