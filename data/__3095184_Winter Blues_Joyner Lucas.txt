51 ContributorsWinter Blues Lyrics
Damn I feel so loose, I'm about to pop shit
What's a man to do when he's out of options
I ain't wanna do it but it
(Shh, hold on, be quiet, they're coming..)

Oh no no no no no no (Blap, blap, blap)
Oh no no no no no no (Shoop, shoop, shoop)
Oh no no no no no no (Skrt, skrt, skrt)
No no no no no no
I said gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, you heard what I said
Nigga run that, run that, run that, run that, you heard what I said
I said yeah, oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no no

I remember everything was different
When I tried to get a job and make some money, I was livin' on the street
I walked a lot of miles and nobody wasn't hiring
And I had to stand in line if I was to get something to eat
'Cause I ain't had no homies and my girl depended on me
Every night that we were lonely and I couldn't get no sleep
'Cause I was plotting on anybody I seen that was getting money
You got it? I need it sorry, you don't need it more than me
And bitch, I'm tired of this struggle, ducking and dodging them puddles
Wondering if God ever hear the prayers I said
'Cause every time I got a new hustle, that shit done got me in trouble
You don't know how many fucking tears I've shed
But fuck it, I'm letting loose, and they told me don't bend the rules
This is my winter blues, you know what I'm finna do
Anything necessary to make it up in the news
And I'm taking every mothafucking thing that I pick and choose
And I'm done with all the begging, I'm past that, all I did was get laughed at
You can go back track but you'll never get cash back
And they told me I'm half black, but I'm white as a lab rat
With a mic and a gas mask, I'm a light for your trash ass
And I might get the last laugh, better fight if you back stab
With a knife in your backpack, all my life I've been jabbed at
But I fight like I'm Mad Max with a knife with the yeah, yeah
You know, you know what the fuck I'm talking about
Listen, I don't give a fuck about your feelings
You don't have any idea just what I had to do to get what I want
All I wanted was to make a decent living
I can't even count it on my fingers how much shit that I lost
Woo, nigga, this is my job
Yeah, these are my thoughts
Woo, I ain't never had shit
But for now you better give me what's yours
You might also like
Damn I feel so loose, I'm about to pop shit
What's a man to do when he's out of options
I ain't wanna do it but this
(Shhh, hold on, be quiet, they're coming)

Oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no
No no no no no no
I said gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, you heard what I said
Nigga run that, run that, run that, run that, you heard what I said
I said yeah, oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no no

You really got some nerve talkin' bout me like you're better
Cause you got your shit together and I'm really goin' through it
I don't think you have a clue what it feels like
Doin' dirt knowin' in your heart you ain't wanna do it
I don't got one G bone in my body
I ain't never gang banged, I don't know nothing about it
I don't claim to be a thug nigga or Illuminati
But there really ain't no tellin' what I do when I get rowdy
And I'm starvin' and my back against the wall and you ballin'
Everytime I see you, all you do is flash hundreds
Everything on fleek, I ain't never had nothin'
I just wanna be you, wanna feel like stuntin'
And lettin' loose and they told me don't bend the rules
This is my winter blues, you don't know what I finna do
Anything necessary to make it up in the news
And I'm taking every mothafuckin' thing that I pick and choose
I'm done with that hating shit, the fuck do you think this is?
Damn it, you made me sick, ain't no time for no babysit
This is the way we live and yes I'm okay with this
You think you all that and a bag of potato chips?
Could jump off a crazy bridge, and enough of you idiot kids
Go suckin' a lady dick, I would never just make amends
With none of you shakin' hands in public like yeah yeah
Like get the fuck out of my face, dude
Listen, I don't give a fuck about your feelings
You don't have any idea just what a nigga had to do to get loose
All I wanted was to make a decent living
I can't even count on all my fingers how much shit I went through
Woo, what I went through
Yeah, what I went through
Uh, and when shit get real
Ain't really nothing that you can do, woo
Yo, what's up, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you
Peace
Yo, who the fuck do you think you are
Tryna give advice to a child? My child
Nigga, you the biggest piece of shit I've ever met in my life, my nigga
You the last person that should be trying to give advice
To anybody about anything, let alone my fucking kid
Acting like some fucking role model or some shit
Nigga, no nobody wanna be like you, stop it15Embed
