3 ContributorsSmooches Lyrics
Smooching, baby
She like smooching, baby
 like Gucci, baby
I like smooching, baby
She like smooching, baby
 like Gucci, baby

They say opisits attract, girl 
Only 4 seconds, 
 girl, and I'm about to nosedive
Gucci Mane the virus, better not put me in your harddrive
Imma kill the cat, but a kitty cat has 9 lives
So that's just the starter, Imma kill that cat 8 more times
First I let her drive me, then I let her ride me
I'm standing in the VIP, she standing right beside me
I blow a kiss at her, then she blow the kiss back
And this is not a theary, this a well known fact
Cruises, smooches, perses 
She smelling all fruity for who?
Me, Gucci

Smooching, baby
She like smooching, baby
 like Gucci, baby
I like smooching, baby
She like smooching, baby
 like Gucci, baby

Your ex boyfriend is useless, he foolish, he clueless
You're on my to do list, he don't know what to do 
He keeping his bow and aro, tell him shoot me 
 would think your boosting 
I'll pick you up at 8,  choosing
I lost my top, I don't know where my roof is, I'm stupid
 like a drug, so don't abuse it, my cutey
Or you might  a junky for Gucci

Smooching, baby
She like smooching, baby
 like Gucci, baby
I like smooching, baby
She like smooching, baby
 like Gucci, baby

I said I come up in the club, I'm looking at your ass like what
 already  you and your girls  some groupie love
 up in the oven, gotta have a drink before I pick
 tonight
 wanna freak tonight
I'm in the cut, feeling like  see the light
Nothing but them 10's,  jeans and tights
 like I'm riding and riding  in the hood
So many other niggas  the hood
Every dime piece in this piece look so good
Nigga act right 
Smooching, baby
She like smooching, baby
 like Gucci, baby
I like smooching, baby
She like smooching, baby
 like Gucci, babyEmbed
