12 ContributorsHurt Yo Eyes Lyrics
Now baby I can’t tell him
We gon catch him in these streets
Bust his cerebellum
Looking for him like the police
With my umbrella, when I hop up out the phantom
I bang watermelon, that’s the color bandana
Molly got me rollin', I can see all of these plotting niggas
I’m like the president, niggas they want to bury me
Bitches they want to rape the kid
I’m fly like pelican, all of these bitches wait for bids
I’m sick and tired of the critinitics
All the critics want to bite into my dip sum
I ain’t playing, I’m for real for some
King cobra nigga killing off
Too many, too pretty, these the city bitches
All these pussy niggas riding dick without permission
All these critics tryna kill me but its benefit me
SMM nigga that’s my shit, get it?
That’s my shit, get it
Get it

All these chains that I have on
So many foreign bitches in my phone
I'ma pull outside with purple
All this goddamn money on me
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
You might also like
On the phone with bloody, listening to the chain gang
When I was young I used to wonder how it feels to gang bang
Now that I bang it feel like my phone don’t ever stop ringing
Play with big B’s and that funeral ain’t gon never stop singing, nigga
Nigga riding round with Glock 40s
No lady, but we riding round, looking for shorty
Pistol old, but you know them bitches only 30
I been busting since I was 12, my scrap ain’t no virgin
Young niggas, climbing up the fucking ladder
We gon reach you, push a nigga like you came out of battle
Hundred shots hit him, fold him up like a centipede
DK a J, he like to smoke a nigga, no weed
Baow, baow, baow, baow
Man down, get him
Baow, baow, baow, baow
These these fucking missiles
Nigga playing with the squad, we coming too hard
We coming to hard, better play the squad

All these chains that I have on
So many foreign bitches in my phone
I'ma pull outside with purple
All this goddamn money on me
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes2Embed
