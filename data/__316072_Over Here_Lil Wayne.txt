13 ContributorsOver Here Lyrics
We pimpin' over here
Yall simpin' over there
Yall bitches over here
Yall trippin over there

Better keep that over there (4x)
You
Better keep that over there (2x)
You
Better keep that, better keep that (2x)
Hey, hey, because

We pimpin' over here
Yall simpin' over there
Yall bitches over here
Yall trippin over there

Better keep that over there
Better keep that over there
Better keep that, better keep that

Well, I'm young Weezy F. Baby
Fuck a ho, cut a ho
Only if she can cut the coke
Let's fucking go, it's Hollygrove
Bussin' straight through the fucking do'
You fucking know them calicoes
They go blucka blucka
You better have a vest baby
Only if I don't shoot to low
Make your chest do the Tootsee Roll
Turn your face to a pussy hole
Turn my bullets to dicks
And I'm making love to your shit, like a bitch
And I bet that you gone love my sex baby
Now say my name like Beyonce
They ain't fuckin' with me, I say
Holla at ya boy, bitch holla at yo' nigga
Now show love, don't be shady
And please say the...

We pimpin' over here
Yall simpin' over there
Yall bitches over here
Yall trippin over there

Better keep that over there (4x)
You
Better keep that over there
You
Better keep that, better keep that
Better keep that over there

Young Money motha fucka
Black 'Lac, hopping out me and Spitta
He puffing on that dro, I'm sipping that hard liquor
Stop thinking you hard nigga
Cause I'll show you different
Keep, running your mouth
Boo will have your ass missing
I got your bitch kissing right under my waistline
Got a lot of dreams, but pimping I never chase mine
This G strolling, heck to the cops, loaded
Pushing that new Rover, still copping the cola
Whipping that with soda
You looking at a Young Money soldier
Chi high roller
Big dough folder, big lead holder
Shampoo bullets that hit heads and shoulders
We pimpin' over here
Yall simpin' over there
Yall bitches over here
Yall trippin over there

Better keep that over there (4x)
You
Better keep that over there
You
Better keep that, better keep that
Better keep that over there1Embed
