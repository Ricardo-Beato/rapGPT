One day, I was tryin' to be myself
The same day this thug say, "You gotta come hard!"
Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin' hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin'
I guess it's hard for you hard niggas to start thinkin'
Pussy MC's stinkin' so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction and relate it to me?
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggas, be too hard to say "ho" at the shows
I rose like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin' me hard is criminal
Niggas you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin'
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up

It's just one too many niggas got cars and no land
One too many niggas with cash and no plan
One too many niggas that's tryin to MC
That's one too many niggas comin up to me
That's one too many niggas
Just one too many niggas
That's one too many niggas
That's one too many niggas
Just one too many niggas
"One, two"
Forever, I ain't gon' be rappin
Shit that happened to me, I gotta let niggas know
This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo
Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it
Next album you gon' blow, up my ass, you done blew it before
Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life?
Get you some pussy? you should be gettin' rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin' niggas but readin' be makin' me sleepy (Hey!)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin
Niggas stuck on one and then I ran by
Claimin' they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and you's a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin' about this and about that
Sounding bitch-like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right
I'm number one
One too many niggas tryin' to tell me bout they theory
One too many niggas that ain't tryin' to hear me
One too many niggas doin' shows that don't happen
One too many niggas life depend on rappin'
That's one too many niggas
Just one too many niggas
Just one too many niggas
That's one too many niggas
Just one too many niggas
"One, two"
One two many niggas can't find they niche
One two many niggas wanna be my bitch
Nigga, one too many niggas3Embed
