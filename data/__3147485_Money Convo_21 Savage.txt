49 ContributorsMoney Convo Lyrics
Peon-ass niggas (Whoa)
Levis and Adidas ass niggas (Ha, ha, ha)
Hi-Point having ass niggas (What)
I got a Glock and it don't jam my blast niggas (Facts)
You a lovey dovey buy a ring nigga (What)
I'm the type to pass her to the team, nigga
You went and bought that bitch CÃ©line, nigga? (21)
Now she fuckin' me, I know you wanna kill her (Ha, ha)
And I sold dope on my 10 toes
We ain't fallin' out over freak hoes (On god)
21 Savage still in savage mode (On god)
I thought I told you I'm a savage on these hoes (On god)
Maybach with the curtains up (21)
I'm with Nudy, he gon' burn you up (Slime)
Fake gangbangin', nigga turned into a snitch (Huh)
Went against that 21, I left him in a ditch

Pull up
We like gas, we like gas, gas, gas (Gas)
Hol' up
We like cash, we like cash, cash, cash (Cash)
Hol' up
Wanna fuck me, I'm like yas, yas, yas (Yas)
Hol' up
VVS' drippin', dance, dance, dance (21)

Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo

Bitch I came straight from the bottom, nigga and I'm still humble (21)
Auto start my whip before I dip, I let that bitch rumble (21)
AK-47s, M16s, they gon' sting, bumble (Sting)
Got your main bitch with me bent over eatin' meat, gumbo

Money talk, yeah, nigga, cash talk, yeah, nigga (21)
Ridin' 'round with that yappa tryna duck the feds, nigga (21)
Oh you drinkin' green? Nope, only drink that red, nigga (Red)
Only fuck the bad hoes, buy my cars with cash, ho
Niggas know I blast off, pull up with the mask off
Air it out like aerosol, I robbed Peter and Paul
Bought a 488, finna act an asshole
I've been gettin' so much money, they think I sold my damn soul
You a fake gangsta, you ain't ever shot nobody
I don't wanna hear them stories 'bout them fake bodies (21)
Young Savage send a hit like John Gotti (Gotti)
Nigga get whacked, thinkin' they hard 'cause they on molly (Bitch)
I'm the Saint Laurent Don, love to cash out (Cash out)
You a dick jumpin' faggot, you a mascot (Bitch)
You beat your bitch 'cause she walk 'round with her ass out (Yeah)
They wanna rob me 'cause I walk 'round with that bag out (Facts)
Drinkin' syrup, lil' bitch, I'm finna pass out
Never slippin', Glock 40 with a red dot (Facts)
Seven figure nigga, money all I talk about (Cash)
You ain't talkin' 'bout no money, what ya talkin' 'bout?
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo

Bitch I came straight from the bottom, nigga and I'm still humble
Auto start my whip before I dip, I let that bitch rumble
AK-47s, M16s, they gon' sting, bumble
Got your main bitch with me bent over eatin' meat, gumbo
