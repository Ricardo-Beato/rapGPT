6 ContributorsYou Lyrics
Okay, are y'all ready?
Turn it up, Snoop
Yeah, let's go to church like yah!
Come on, everybody clap your hands
1,2

Listen up, let me testify how God's been good to me
He came through for me time after time
Even when I didn't believe
When my life took a real bad turn
He turned it for my good (He never left me)
He never left me, nor forgot me
Just like He said He would (Here we go, You are)

You are the antidote
You're the healing for my soul
You are the remedy
You have been so good to me
You are my heart's desire
You're the reason for this burning fire
You are the friend in me
Everything God that I ever need is in You (You)

Here we go, Verse 2

Everybody's got a story to tell how good You are
Oh God, how You're the great Redeemer
And You brought us out of the dark
No words can even describe just how good You've been
So glad that I know You and that You're deep within

You are the antidote
You're the healing for my soul
You are the remedy
You have been so good to me
You are my heart's desire
You're the reason for this burning fire
You are the friend in me
Everything God that I'll ever need is in You (You)
