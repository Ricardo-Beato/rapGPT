18 ContributorsTwo Thangs Lyrics
Gucci Mane in the building (Gucci, Gucci)
Laflare, Big cat (Laflare)
Said we got it like that (like that)
Everythang don't mean two thangs, watch this

Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use don't mean two thangs

Uhhh...
It ain't the money it's the principle (uhh)
What kind of student make mo' money than the principal?
And I never made the Honor Roll (uhh)
But I'm in the lunchline with a honor roll
You pumpin iron in the weight room (uhh)
I'm on the grind, got an iron in the weight room
And I never played softball (uhh)
But I always kept the hard and the softballs
You doin math on the calculator (uhh)
I'm weighin slabs doin math on a calculator
And I ain't tryin to write no essays (uhh)
I'm tryin to get a hundred pounds for my eses
You tryin learn how to speak spanish (uhh)
But my connect tryin teach me to speak Spanish
And you a monitor in the hallway (uhh)
I'm all day on the grind with a four-way

Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs

Every word I use don't mean two thangs

Uhh...
You the one who won the spelling bee (uhh)
I'm the first third grader wit a felony
And I never was a teacher's pet (uhh)
I'm the one who went and stole the teacher's cigarettes
And I never went on field trips (uhh)
I'm at Walter's tryin to buy me some stash slips
And I always been cutthroat (uhh)
Fifteen takin big niggas Starter coats
Laflare Entertainment by myself (uhh)
But I used to have a high right, low left
Gettin money by the truckloads (uhh)
Rollin up big fat el productos
Before I drank V.S.O.P. Remy
I used to drank that MD 20-20
Woodgrain and reverse 8's (uhh)
Box Chevy trunk soudin like a earthquake
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use might mean two thangs
Young Gucci Mane got a style so strange
Every word I use don't mean two thangs

In the club put it down with the block man
You probably gotta work a 9 to 5 (uhh)
I'm on the grind with the nines for the fifty-five
Get you a half of a 12 (uhh)
Low key bucket tryin to duck 12's
So what's up wit them t-shirts (uhh)
