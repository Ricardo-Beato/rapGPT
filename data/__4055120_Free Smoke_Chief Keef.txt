Free smoke, baby, free smoke, baby
Free smoke, baby, free smoke (Yeah)
Free smoke, baby, free smoke, baby
Free smoke, baby, free smoke (We givin' out)
Free smoke, baby (We got), free smoke (We got)
Free smoke, baby, we got free smoke (Yeah)
Free smoke, yeah (We got), free smoke, ayy
We got free smoke, ayy, we got free smoke

Say what? (Yeah)
I can be a doctor, still can’t feel y'all
Boot up in your ass, that's a field goal
Get your ass smoked, boy you real close (Yeah)
Never sell china to a Chinaman
Girl if I ain’t shit, why you like me then?
Doin' all that woofin', nigga fight me then (Let's get it)
Say you out here, why you hiding then? (Pussy)

Free smoke, baby, free smoke, baby
Free smoke, baby, free smoke (Yeah)
Free smoke, baby, free smoke, baby
Free smoke, baby, free smoke (We givin' out)
Free smoke, baby (We got), free smoke (We got)
Free smoke, baby, we got free smoke (Yeah)
Free smoke, yeah (We got), free smoke, ayy
We got free smoke, ayy, we got free smoke

Hand on the Bible
Swear I hit a nigga with that rifle
I could make the shot with my eyes closed
Gotta let rivals be rivals
Niggas be actin' real psycho
He tryna lose weight, get him lipo
He said I'm a bitch, yeah I know
Up this big bitch, click clack, hi bro
She wan' give me top, should I let her?
Nigga that’s a fuckin’ double yes sir
Skrt skrt, pulled up, bless her
She say all these diamonds look like treasure

Free smoke, baby, free smoke, baby
Free smoke, baby, free smoke (Yeah)
Free smoke, baby, free smoke, baby
Free smoke, baby, free smoke (We givin' out)
Free smoke, baby (We got), free smoke (We got)
Free smoke, baby, we got free smoke (Yeah)
Free smoke, yeah (We got), free smoke, ayy
We got free smoke, ayy, we got free smoke

The spot lookin’ tropical
It's noon, I got a doctor, fuck the obstacle
Bitches take my phone, ain't tryna be fallin' through
You gon’ be able to tell if I don't fuck with you
People ain't listen, then my folks asked me what I would do
I thought I was coppin' one, but I was coppin' two
Oh you 'bout your green? Turn you to Barney suit
Oh you rockin' ice? Yeah we rockin' it too
Free smoke, baby, free smoke, baby
Free smoke, baby, free smoke (Yeah)
Free smoke, baby, free smoke, baby
Free smoke, baby, free smoke (We got)
Free smoke, baby (We got), free smoke (We got)
Free smoke, baby, we got free smoke (Yeah)
Free smoke, yeah (We got), free smoke, ayy
We got free smoke, ayy, we got free smoke (Yeah)1Embed
