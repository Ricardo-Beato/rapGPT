7 ContributorsAmen Lyrics
In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good seems to let evil occur
While still possessed in our human form we live life searching for greatness
Since the day we were born
And as we bow our heads at night
Rich, wealthy, or poor with dislikes
We pray asking for forgiveness for our sinful ways
With Mind, Body, Spirit, and Faith we Pray AMEN
Yea(Amen) You like that right(Amen) I wrote it myself by the way(Amen)
Yo Young(Amen) Jeezy Jizzle Snowman
We gotta give the streets what they want man
FUCK THE GOT DAMN SHIT
You gotta get it in
Lets get it

Bow our heads let us pray
Thanks to the day
Bills paid crib laid thanks to the Yay
In that 'Rari at that red light that's in the 'A
Glock 40 with that red light that's anyway
See you mothafuckas actin' like yall done caught amnesia
I know what to do get them chains up out the freezer
Bitch it's Mr. Trap or Die ok you niggas asked for it
Yall know these niggas couldn't walk a mile in my air jordans
I'm like adidas on a zebra mothafucka way too many stripes
Countin' 20's in my white beater way 2 many nights
I'm talkin' all the yay you ever seen beyond ya wildest dreams
Niggas get that first million dollars, buy the wildest things
Frog green bubble eyed coupe seats giraffe skin
That one reckless ass phone call will get ya ass ten
You might also like
Please Lord yea it's gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin' niggas starvin' because they can't find no yay
See the first done rolled around and they bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin' some be dyin' bow our heads and let us pray
Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen
Yea yea

I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen em come 2-toned like a Saleen
Saleen Saleen yeaaaaa that's a Mustang
Break em down in the 9 that's what I call hust-ling
They say they want that dumb shit but this is ignorant
Spent a condo on the timepiece now that's ignorant
They like Young you a fool yea I could've bought some real estates
Instead I bought a half a block and tried to sow up half the state
I'm on 75 75 when they was goin' for the 25
I guess it's pickin' up a trey just a ordinary day with extraordinary pay
Extraordinary risks can't even explain got a extraordinary wrist
I talk it cuz I lived in many shit ain't really nothin to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony don't you fuck with me
