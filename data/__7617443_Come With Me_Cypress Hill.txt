3 ContributorsCome With Me Lyrics
Come with me
Hail Mary, let me grow that green
What do we have here now?
Let's get fuckin' high tonight
La-da-da-da, da-da, da-da
Come with me
Hail Mary, let me grow that green
What do we have here now?
Let's get fuckin' high tonight
La-da-da-da, da-da, da-da

Blessed by the desire to create the fire
I must get you higher
You're required to enjoy it, it inspires
Ninety days in the haze crops that will amaze
Trimmers gettin' paid, so many joints arе gettin' blazed
Got your CBDs growing in the back, no THC
Ph.D., cultivation spree, you must pay a fee
Insanе OG, to the brain low-key
Maybe it's just me but I think you need some weed

Grow from a seed to a whole industry
So many clones to feed for the high we achieve
Blessings received from Mother Mary
Raising crops 'round the clock, now the stock is legendary
Smokin' (La-da-da-da, da-da, da-da)

Come with me
Hail Mary, let me grow that green
What do we have here now?
Let's get fuckin' high tonight
La-da-da-da, da-da, da-da
Come with me
Hail Mary, let me grow that green
What do we have here now?
Let's get fuckin' high tonight
La-da-da-da, da-da, da-da

One of the reasons I've made it through many seasons
Is this weed that I breathe in that keeps my brain dreamin'
Mind reaching for higher levels, I never settle
I was a young pup from out of the ghetto that set the tempo
God bless the leaf, rest in peace
To anyone that stands between the legalization that we want to see
Good green and papers, that's the recipe
Phuncky Feel Tips and a lighter, let it set you free

If anybody tries to question our integrity, I'm flexin'
Let me give you the protection, heat is comin' in your direction
Hit you in your solar plexus, it's the power of suggestion
Look at me now, never stressin'
Liftin' 'em up, give a lesson
Smokin' 'em out in the sessions
Better believe they feel the essence
(La-da-da-da, da-da, da-da)
Come with me
Hail Mary, let me grow that green
What do we have here now?
Let's get fuckin' high tonight
La-da-da-da, da-da, da-da
Come with me
Hail Mary, let me grow that green
What do we have here now?
Let's get fuckin' high tonight
La-da-da-da, da-da, da-daEmbed
