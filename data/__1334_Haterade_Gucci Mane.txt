We've evolved from small to tall
And shall not stall, been flyin’ too long
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, girl

I be sippin' on haterade
That deep down get you paid
And it tastes like lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep down get you paid
That flavor is lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
You know what I'm talkin’ ‘bout?

I'm not listenin’, I'm not interested (Interested)
My attention only focused on what I get (What I get)
Diamond’s glistenin’, they call me Mr. Check
White ice lemonade, black ice, she thick
Got jewels, wealth, ambition, life's a bitch
So I treat it real good like hoes don’t switch (Hoes don’t switch)
My whole life, I ain't never seen a car like that
And she probably won't see the next shit I get
And a seventeen fresh and I say I guess
Successful, healthy, I live no stress
So today is the day that the big boy shine
Drop tops everywhere, I wouldn't know how to rock (Wow)
Got the titties out today showin’ off tan lines
Bands bendin’ in my pocket, no, it's not drumline
Me and Skateboard P in the club on time
No, not on time, but it just in time (It's Gucci)

We've evolved from small to tall
And shall not stall, been flyin’ too long
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, girl

I be sippin' on haterade
That deep down get you paid
And it tastes like lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep down get you paid
That flavor is lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
(Uh, yo, ayo) You know what I'm talkin’ ‘bout?

This one goes out to all of my critics
Don't you feel stupid? Look how I did it
Look how it came to pass when I said it
We can do debit, I don't need no credit
Yes, I'm epic, look how I rep it
It's been eight years, but I broke the record
Yup, the record, yup, the record, yup, the record (Just for the record)
Uh, I'm all that I can be
And I'll admit, I'm appalled when you envy
’Cause you can do it, too, and you can do it, too
I just happen to be the girl that they threw it to
So I'ma bounce back, and I'ma ball out
And every time that you see me I'ma go all out
And I'ma win till the endin’
Don't be mad when you see me transcendin’, Gucc’
We've evolved from small to tall
And shall not stall, been flyin’ too long
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, girl

I be sippin' on haterade
That deep down get you paid
And it tastes like lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep down get you paid
(It’s Gucci) That flavor is lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
You know what I'm talkin’ ‘bout?

I ball hard, I should be in Sports Illustrated (Yeah)
Cool as a motherfucker in a Porshe lemonade coupe
Pull up in a ‘Rari in your hood, get intimidated
Mutilated, Maserati, Lamborghini decapitated (Damn)
Fed investigations on what I accumulated, insinuated
That I'm not the man that I say I am, like I give a damn (It’s Gucci)
But I just ride around town pickin' up stacks (Pickin’ up stacks)
Somethin’ like Louis, somethin’ like Gucci
And I love money, yeah, I love solutions
And my teenage karat ring, baby girl choosin’ (Brr, brr)
And I ain't hard to please, baby, come choose me (Come choose me, come choose me)
Lounge around, round the town with the top chopped off
You can call it lost and found ’cause my top stay down (Top stay down)
And I ain’t seen a motherfucker since I bought this car (Since I bought this car)
I ain’t seen a motherfucker since I bought the car (It’s Gucci)
We've evolved from small to tall
And shall not stall, been flyin’ too long
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, girl

I be sippin' on haterade
That deep down get you paid
And it tastes like lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep down get you paid
That flavor is lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
You know what I'm talkin’ ‘bout?

Go and lift your glass, go and lift your glass
Let's think about the future and forget the past
Everybody just lift ya glass, go and lift ya glass
If a nigga keep hatin', tell 'em kiss ya ass
Just lift ya glass, go and lift your glass
Let's think about the future and forget the past
Everybody just lift ya glass, go and lift ya glass
If a nigga think they go hard, don't make me laugh, it's Gucc’2Embed
