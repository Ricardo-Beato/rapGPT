6 ContributorsI Wonâ€™t Fall Lyrics
Yo, you got these niggas runnin' around like they head cut off
Like they gully, then switch when I'm spittin' those dummies
I creep in the cold 'till my nose get runny
Then I'm layin' for a nigga like I'm waitin' on money
I ask these hoes what the fuck they want from me
From the gate I keep it real that's why they gon' love me
I got a shorty if she get down for me, when I'm out of town
You know she holdin' down the crown for me
Dog, god forbid if i die, don't worry kid
Take you with me shit pussy don't want me
My life's story was the Henny, had to stop that
And now I'm focusin' clear when I cop that
Fuck gettin' clapped, it be more like applause
Since they tellin' like broads, might as well get 'em all
The H-, the A- the V- the O- the C
I'm the man, the myth pushin' shit to the White League

You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)
You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)
You might also like
Don't make me be after you niggas like the Ku-Klux-Man
Throwin' my hoodie, you know I'm burnin' that grass
Plottin' on how I'm goin' murder that ass
We poppin' up, guns choppin' up yo whole staff
What's toppin' the cassette, ain't nothin' gettin' passed
'Cause we gettin' fat, on top of that we gettin' cash
I hear you niggas wanna get me, may God be with you
Plus you better keep that mothafuckin' thing ridin' wit you
And if i feel you a threat to my well-being
Niggas is bleedin' you niggas better back up off the P kid
I blam you, and pass you to Jesus Christ
You be a Ghost Dog like Forest Whitaker wife
Be a dumb mothafucka thinkin' P not squeezin'
Like Palm Springs the only thing beefin'
Is that gumball 'cause I ain't got talk for ya'll
I got big four-pound towners
Give you New Balance

You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)
You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)
The two-face niggas,  backstab niggas
I felt that shit coming, like that in the bud, gunnin'
No tolerance for them niggas, fuck the dumb shit
I hope you niggas die broke, while we in the plushes
Hotel Suites, expensive car seats
Windows half-down bumpin' out mobb beatz
With a bad bitch beside me, raisin' up the volume
Know they hate to see that and that's why we come thru'

You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)
You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)

Aight, that's the bottom line right there
That pretty much sums it up, you can two face me
Backstab me, try to set me up and all that
But you know what? I won't fall1Embed
