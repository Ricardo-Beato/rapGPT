2 ContributorsTurn Around Baby Lyrics
S.y.s
Savoire fair
You gotta love it!
Gucci Mane laflare (gucci gucci)
Bankrupt records
This right here
Versatile
Savoire fair
Turn around baby
Lets do it
Pimpin ain't easy

I blow my nose wit money
I keep snot on my knots
Drinkin louie 14; 150 a shot
Turn around for me baby; let me see what you got
And you can take them panties off but you can keep on yo top
Ugly boy from da block; 20 bottles to pop
Rolls gold everythang bitch hotter den hot
Drop top benzo in the parking lot
When i leave out da club da whole party stop
50 carats in da charm 15 on da watch
Prince cut pinky ring n***a give me my props
Bow down to the king Gucci Mane laflare
Extra ordinary player you aynt gotta stare
If you feel it in yo bones get out cha chair
If you know dat you'rе fine shake ya derriеre
Gucci Mane in da house wit da savoire fair
Gucci Mane in da house wit da savoire fair
Turn around baby girl; damn you cute
I aynt tryna come at you like a prostitute;
But you look like da type dat can dance for loot
And im just tryna really chill &have some dranks wit you
Nice to meet ya baby!
