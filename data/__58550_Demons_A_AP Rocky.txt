6 ContributorsKnuckle Sandwich Lyrics
I crash landed like a cosmonaut on a planet that God forgot
All these pop rappers makin' records have gotta stop
Rockin' like I'm Akhenaton, knockin' down the Gods you jock
Shuttin' down the block like I'm SWAT when a cop is shot
Drop a giant quicker than Goliath with slingshots
My rings and my watch... got a stash box in Gringotts
Ancient raps written on scrolls with the ink blots
Titty pics in the inbox, pretty bitch with the pink socks
Pretty sick with the hip-hop, insidious with the shit-talk
Edward Teach on the beach on the beat soon as the ship docks
Flintlock pistols that pop when your clique plots
I'll leave a blood puddle so large that I could skip rocks
Your chick jock my thick cock, evil as Alfred Hitchcock
Fuck her on your bed then I have her order me Pink Dot
I pimp a lot of ladies and I pimp a lot of sluts but
Lately it's the latter it don't really matter much
Got these rappers mad as fuck that they math isn't addin' up
'Cause Ap is up to somethin', summonin' demons to snatch 'em up
I'm savage as fuck, every single sabbath I erupt
In a fit of rage, I spit a page of raps I construct
To alter the Earth, place you on the alter like a ritual
Spit despicable scripts that'll leave your condition critical
Any individual's dissin' is inadmissible
You little bitch, you bitter? My middle finger dismisses you
Missile guided by digital pixels in my eyelid
Half physical, half metal, assembled as a hybrid
Like Robocop; I make the most gassed rapper's motors stop
You never tote a Glock, you totally Photoshop
Photographic memory, never forget an enemy
Immortal so I kill they family members every century
Centipede speed, all you smell is the scent of weed
Never leave witnesses freed, I just let 'em bleed
Believe me I'm beastly, you'll beg for a peace treaty
I'm 5-stars in GTA when police see me
And I'm the reason why your bitch got a bad back
And why the studio's got a policy with Aflaaac
My habitat is toxic, got me rocking a gas mask
Ap's back, cummin' in your baby mama's asscrack
A class act that clash with the wack
Cash in stacks, bodybag bars, casket raps
Cats collapse when they feel their spinal columns just snap
Snatch your soul through the hole in the back of your snapback
Blackin' out, fuckin' spazzin', imagine me when I'm angry
Ravagin' ladies who say he's like a dragon with rabies
I'll carjack a Mercedes and drive it back to the 80's
When Ap was a baby to find out why I'm actin' so crazy
Actually the most accurate way you'd have to portray me
Is out sellin' Fugees The Score and score a flick for ScorseseYou might also like1Embed
