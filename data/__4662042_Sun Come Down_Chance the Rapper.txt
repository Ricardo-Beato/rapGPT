45 ContributorsSun Come Down Lyrics
I let the sun come down
Without telling you exactly what I mean
And you might never know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down without letting you know exactly what I mean
Exactly what you mean to me
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

Please don't let my death be about my death
Please don't make no movies about my death
Please make my death about my life
If you make a movie 'bout my life, make it right
Please don't make no holograms, don't wanna do it twice
You wanna use my likeness, please approve it through my wife
And if you get the license then you better use it right
Don't misconstrue my offerings to offer new advice
If I said it, I meant it
If I'm dead, it's cemented
And cinder block cemeteries already ascended
I'll leave you my last name I left on the last plane
Too much baggage but you can carry on Bennett
I just wanna make sure that my words touch you
Pinky swear and kiss it
Promise no one'll hush you
Jump and hit the blocks, I promise you'll see the mushroom
Clouds and the dust soon
Leavin' more thoughts than there are bristles on a brush broom
You might also like
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down
And you might never know
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down without letting you know exactly what I mean
Exactly what you mean to me

7 PM thoughts in my home
Who to put in my will, who to put in my won't
Some people my blood, some people my flesh
That's the difference 'tween catch and fetch
I don't want nobody to be at my wedding
That won't be there for my marriage
They can see that shit on Facebook
They can like it, they can share it
Like, "Look at that lil' dress and how she wear it
I thought that pregnant belly prolly tear it"
"You know they only did this shit for money"
"I know one day that they just gon' co-parent"
"I gotta zoom in, count up all the carats"
"I know that nigga probably went to Jared"
"I know that nigga probably so embarrassed"
But they don't know nothin', baby
That's why I tell you when I say it, I say
Don't look down, don't look down
When they, when they try and make up all that bullshit
I just tell you
Don't look down, don't look down
And when we goin' towards the sky, when we get into that atmosphere
Don't look down, don't look down
And when they go into the comments, we like a comet
Don't look down, don't look down
Don't look down7Embed
