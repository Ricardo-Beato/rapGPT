Food & Liquor

Yeah, my man said he wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something he could recognize, something he could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real (FNF)
Something that could make her move, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel

Lust, sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything, he crushed
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them, but we hush if it's us

That's why, my momma said she wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something she could be proud of, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not having nothin' real
Real, real, real, real
That they don't know how to act, they don't know how to feel
Feel, feel, feel
You might also like
Life, ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest, now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good, so God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free, ain't a G, show you right

The game is not to give 'em nothing real
Real, real, real, real
Nothing that they could use, nothing that they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real
Real, real, real, real
So that's all they'll know, that's all that they'll feel
Feel, feel, feel

Struggle, another sign that God love you
'Cause on the low, being poor make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep 'em out of trouble
'Cause being poor also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own I can hit 'em with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can, on the Man up above you
That's why, I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something they could recognize, something they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something that'll make 'em stop, something they can feel
Feel, feel, feel

Yo! FNF are real; really real, yea
You know what it is, woo
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real
Let's go
So real, so real, so real25Embed
