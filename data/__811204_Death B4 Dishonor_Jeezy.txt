4 ContributorsDeath B4 Dishonor Lyrics
One time for Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Real niggas, hallelujah
This for my real niggas, I swear to God
You know it's death before dishonor, it's in my fucking heart
One time for Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Real niggas, hallelujah
This for my real niggas, I swear to God
You know it's death before dishonor, it's in my fucking heart

A hundred black lux jeeps like the taliban
And everybody jewelry flashin' like an ambulance
Self made
Thats an understatement
That nigga self paid
Thats your understatement
One time for Big Meech, Dre Beezy IP Dro Beezy
Cop the drop top roadster it was baby blue
Thats on Tito Dash yeah this works for Baby Blue
How you blowin money fast you don't know the crew
Oh you part of the fam shit i never knew
Y'all suppose to make it hard this is easy ho
Pull up in that triple white I think I'm Jeezy ho

One time for Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Real niggas, hallelujah
This for my real niggas, I swear to God
You know it's death before dishonor, it's in my fucking heart
One time for Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Real niggas, hallelujah
This for my real niggas, I swear to God
You know it's death before dishonor, it's in my fucking heart

God damn ho you got them massive titties
Might as well roll with me to magic city
Call it magic city cause my whole city magic
Talkin' that magic powder, yeah, my whole city have it
Where you can find a brick before you find a soda nigga
Buy spit before you buy a coca cola nigga
Kept the lights on them bitches nigga Alex know

Y'all suppose to make it hard This is easy ho
Pull up in that 62' me and Meechie ho

You know it's death before dishonor, it's in my fucking heart
One time for Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Real niggas, hallelujah
This for my real niggas, I swear to God
You know it's death before dishonor, it's in my fucking heartEmbed
