Bodies gettin' dropped, we so used to winnin' (Bang bang)
Ridin' wit my niggas, we be cruising tinted (Bang bang)

Kush too strong with a thick bitch
She like Chief Keef, and play his shit
When we ridin' smokin'
Chopping shit like I'm Logan and the pound potent
My young G's stay iron holdin'
Pink champagne and some golden
New Ray Bans, let me unfold 'em
Just cashed out so I'm holdin'
Gotta lot of Nenes, I be moudlin'
Bitches pop pills like ibuprofen
Niggas say they ballin' but I be coachin'
Don't get bitched now nobody know 'em
I be with young wild niggas, ID home
I love pussy but I prefer dome
Money come fast like my 4S phone
I pack loud smoking strechers long
Hit it call me shorty bird strechers on
I'm winnin', bitch, I'm a champion
Pack louder than a ambulance
Money dance, bitch, hella bands
Just might cuff some FNs
Soon as they drop in advance
These niggas losing
No D, second chance, huh
I can't lose, bitch, I'm so used to winnin' (Bang bang)
Fuck with my family and you are finished (Bang bang)
And bitch, we at the top, we so used to winnin'
Bodies gettin' dropped, we so used to winnin' (Bang bang)
Ridin' wit' my niggas, we be cruising tinted (Bang bang)
Catch up, bitch, we so used to winnin' (Bang bang)
Every thing double digits, we so used to winnin' (Bang bang)
Pull on yo block let off some shots, we so used to winnin' (Bang, bang, bang, bang)5Embed
