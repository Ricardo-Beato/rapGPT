DP On The Beat
(Vlone)
Boy, you too slow (Vlone)
Yeah, yeah, ayy (Vlone Thug)
Boy, you too slow, yeah, what? Ayy (Vlone)
Boy, you too slow (Vlone, Vlone thug)
Ready, set, go, hey, hey, hey, ayy, yeah (Vlone, Vlone, Vlone thug)
Yeah, yeah (Vlone)
Ready, set, go (Vlone, Vlone thug)

Ready, set, go, um, yeah (Ready, set, go)
Gotta give credit to God but I did this on my own, um, yeah
Playboi Carti, what's your religion? He said it's Vlone (Vlone, Vlone)
I swear I'm vlone
When I get older I swear I die alone (Die alone, die alone)
And on the real, don't nobody really wanna die alone (No)
And they really hate on me to get me out my zone
But they cannot get me out my zone (No), hey
Work her brain like it's mind control (Yeah)
We gon' make it rain, tell 'em bring some more (Bring some more)
Lambo in the rain, yeah, I lost control (Yeah, yeah)
Hit the front light and I smashed the door (Yeah, yeah)
And I looked down, still got my dough (What? What?)
Whew, neck on freeze, AP wrist on froze
Yeah, swag OD and your lil' bitch know it
Oh Vet' my Ts, Raf Ricky from Dover (Yeah, what?)
Got a centerpiece hanging on the chopper with the shoulder
Diamonds on my teeth
You might also like
Ready, set, go, um, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Gotta give credit to God but I did it on my own, um, yeah
Got a bad chick on my side and you know she gonna roll (Hey)
Know I gotta stay on my toes
Ready, set, go, only thing that I know
Ready, set, go, hey, hey
Ready, set, go, wait
Ready, set, go, ayy, ayy
Ready, set, go, wait
Ready, set, go, yeah, hey
Ready, set, go, wait
Ready, set, go, hey, yeah
Ready, set, go, hey (What?)
Ready, set, go, ayy

That's your new girl? Yeah, had her last week
Felt like yesterday, what a fast week
Don't want to treat Brittany like Ashley (No)
Yeah, treated her cool if you ask me (What?)
Yeah, but thatâ€™s only if you ask me
Found out she was cheating, what a bad dream
Bad dream, fighting through a bad dream
(That girl ain't want me, now she wanna let me, ayy)
Wanna caress me, now she wanna sex me
Tell that girl that I'm sorry, I'm already married
Yeah, straight to the money (Yeah)
Make her tear up like onions, yeah
She take D just like Sunny, yeah
Swing from trees like a monkey, yeah
Want that tail like a pony
Want that tail like a horse
Pull up foreign whip, I own it
Tell that girl, "One call, I'm on it"
Gotta watch the snake like a boa
Getting money, you know it
Make it rain and you know it
So much I need a mop
Ready, set, go, um, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Gotta give credit to God but I did it on my own, um, yeah
Got a bad chick on my side and you know she gonna roll (Hey)
Know I gotta stay on my toes
Ready, set, go, only thing that I know
Ready, set, go, hey, hey
Ready, set, go, wait
Ready, set, go, ayy, ayy
Ready, set, go, wait
Ready, set, go, yeah, hey
Ready, set, go, wait
Ready, set, go, hey, yeah
Ready, set, go, hey (What?)
Ready, set, go, ayy
