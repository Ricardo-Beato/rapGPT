Yeah
Ah
Real hot girl shit
Mwah

Okay, the hate turned me to a monster, so I guess I'm evil now (I’m evil now)
Woke up and I blacked out everything so I can see it now (See it now)
I'm on that demon time, it's only right I cop the Hellcat (Skrrt)
They always hit me where it hurt, but this time, I felt that (Ow)
Why I gotta prove myself to bitches that I’m better than? (Huh?)
As if I wasn't at radio stations goin' Super Saiyan (Super Saiyan)
As if this fuckin' body isn't everything they buyin' ('Thing they buyin')
And as if a nigga didn’t shoot me and they pickin’ sides (Baow)

I'll be back, I’m 'bout to go crazy
I ain't pullin' up ’less them hoes finna pay me ('Less them hoes finna pay me)
Bitch, I'm the shit, and I ain't gotta prove it (I ain't gotta prove it)
Finna go dumb since these hoes think I'm stupid
I'm 'bout to go crazy, crazy
I'm 'bout to go crazy, crazy
Bitch, I'm 'bout to go

I hit once, I hit twice, now it's a habit, I go Cassius (Woah, woah)
Your ex nigga made you crazy, this dick make you psychopathic (Straight up)
If the sextape leak and everyone see, know it's gon' be a classic (Classic)
But don't forget how quick I'll crop you out and change the caption (Quick)
Strictly raised by pimpin', not by simpin', show no sympathy
If they hate you for being you, they not secure in they identity (Damn)
Me, myself, and I, she treat me like the Holy Trinity (Woah)
Fuck a Birkin, give you a business, boss you up, now you can buy ten of these (What we doin'?)
Shit, whatever I say
Run your city, now it's mine for however long I stay
Bitch play me, well, that's my bad for ever lettin' her play
My mama prayin' for me, she better pray for whoever in my way (Boy)
Now how many besties done upped and left me? (Huh?)
Who claimed they my dawg and just my pet peeves (Huh?)
Who tried to double back and triple-text me
Fuck I look like stressin' over these hoes that stress me? Lil' bitch
You might also like
I'll be back, I'm 'bout to go crazy
I ain't pullin' up 'less them hoes finna pay me ('Less them hoes finna pay me)
Bitch, I'm the shit, and I ain't gotta prove it
Finna go dumb since these hoes think I'm stupid
I'm 'bout to go crazy, crazy
I'm 'bout to go crazy, crazy
Bitch, I'm 'bout to go crazy

A bitch can't me check me, can't disrespect me (Shh)
A shot can't hit me if it's sent indirectly
Hoes can't see me with this rap and the fashion
Bitch, you know I'm fire, you can't drag a dragon (Ah)
I used to be patient
Now I'm on some ski mask shit, bitch, I'm anxious (Yeah)
Hoes talkin' cash shit, but can't make a payment (What?)
Carnivore, I'ma eat up any bitch who play me
Forty-inch long black weave like Morticia (Yeah)
Applyin' so much pressure to these hoes, they gettin' blisters (Gettin' blisters)
I'ma buy it twice so my shoes got sisters (Got sisters)
I only want a nigga on my birthdays and Christmas
Mean girl, I ain't lettin' bitches sit with us

I'll be back, I'm 'bout to go crazy
I ain't pullin' up 'less them hoes finna pay me ('Less them hoes finna pay me)
Bitch, I'm the shit, and I ain't gotta prove it (I ain't gotta prove shit)
Finna go dumb since these hoes think I'm stupid
I'm 'bout to go crazy, crazy
I'm 'bout to go crazy, crazy
Bitch, I'm 'bout to go crazy (2 Chainz, Toni)
'Bout to go ignorant, rich with the benefits
Crook in my dick, shit lookin' like ten to six
Used to hit the dealership, now they makin' dropoffs
Stars in my roof, I don't have to take the top off (Gone)
County going crazy (Crazy), have your ass knocked off
Charm on my neck lookin' like a fuckin' softball (Woo)
Your ho just left (Left), yeah, she a southpaw
Ass so fat, man, them folk gon' try to outlaw (Outlaw)
Megan, what's poppin'? You already know the topic
Let me see you scrub the ground, let me see you touch the carpet (Carpet)
Still throwin' bands during a pandemic ('Demic)
Smokin' on raw paper with my strand in it

I'll be back, I'm 'bout to go crazy
I ain't pullin' up 'less them hoes finna pay me ('Less them hoes finna pay me)
Bitch, I'm the shit, and I ain't gotta prove it (I ain't gotta prove shit)
Finna go dumb since these hoes think I'm stupid
I'm 'bout to go crazy, crazy
I'm 'bout to go crazy, crazy
Bitch, I'm 'bout to go crazyEmbed
