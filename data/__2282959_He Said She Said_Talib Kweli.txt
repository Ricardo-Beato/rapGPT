7 ContributorsHe Said She Said Lyrics
All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care

A cautionary tale
I heard about this new artist
Somebody said he was the hardest
Seem like I gotta do the knowledge
Cause I don't go by them comments
Loving the promise of some new hot shit
And apparently this kid got it
He adored by all of them bloggers
They describe him down to his boxers
I heard last night he had problems
With some other random ass nigga
Tonight the blog is on fire
Them niggas beefing on twitter
His timeline full of depression
But his death the life of the party
They celebrating his self destruction
It make for excellent copy

All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care
You might also like
The life a series of moments
And VIP he be posting
Dudes be drinking that potion
Girls all in they emotion
Thoroughbreds in the stable, what
Pills on his table, what
I heard he staying independent
He don't fuck with major labels
The rumors keep on swirling
Every interview is a circus
Yeah he grinding, he working
But his lack of God is disturbing
Can't wait to write about how the drugs to blame
He was numbing the pain, he was loving the fame
Plus think he going out with what's her name
With an ass so fat she won't fuck with lames

All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care

Heard your baby mama got crazy drama
Get way too violent and drunk
Couldn't make an honest woman out of her
Now he face your honor every month
Now she slandering niggas on instagram
So her followers up and her kids be down
She be giving out advice how to get a man
On the sex tape part of a business plan
Now she coming out next to plug
A new song she gets on the breakfast club
Where party promoters give extra love
All the hypebeasts saying sit next to us
I heard a bunch of these rumors
I heard it made this nigga lose it
Only thing I have yet to hear
Is any of dude music
All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care3Embed
