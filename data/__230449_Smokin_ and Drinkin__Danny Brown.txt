Check
A-Trak, what up?

Drop a deuce in that soda, tell your ho to come over
Coming straight out that Motor, sipping oil never sober
Bring backwoods of that OG, we smoking 'em back-to-back
Molly looking like sugar, so you know that I'm dipping it
See my jeans 'bout a stack, and my shoes cost 'bout half of that
Let's not talk 'bout the shirt, she can't even pronounce that
Ghetto Nigga in high end, my Theory is Low End
My Tribe on a Quest, put that money in motion
So bitch, we smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
My ho got tats on her face, sell me them cookies from Oakland
But not the kind that you eat, stuff it in Swisher Sweets
And we smoke blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

I don't know what y'all be thinking
Spaced-out, rolling up that stinky
Big-big blunts the size of pinkies
Pour one out, we still be leaning
I don't know what y'all be thinking
Smoking, drinking, drinking, smoking
In that order, we slow motion
'til it's over, never stop
You might also like
Smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke

Gotta get away, to escape, I smoke this kush to the face
Gotta get away, get away, I think I need to pray
Please, oh Lord, oh Lord, I need your help again
Took too many pills and I think I hear my heart beating
Taking over those chances, honey backwoods stuffed with that grammy
My ho blowing that powder, mixing liquor with them Xannies
Stress party, get away, hope these problems just go away
Right there in my face, I ignore it every day
I be
Smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke

I don't know what y'all be thinking
Spaced-out, rolling up that stinky
Big-big blunts the size of pinkies
Pour one out, we still be leaning
I don't know what y'all be thinking
Smoking, drinking, drinking, smoking
In that order, we slow motion
'til it's over, never stop
Smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke26Embed
