24 ContributorsHit ‘Em wit’ da Hee Lyrics
Missy, uh-huh (B.I.G.)
Yeah, I like that

Uh, it's the Q to the B to the
Double E, spittin' lovely
And it don't stop, rocks shine through my tank top
Where your bank stop, I deposit all the one drops (Ha)
Think not, excuse me, but uh, I like to flow
'Cause this joint knocks harder then Indica
And I be off the wall like the Lox
Nightbox filled with Benjamins
Me and my girl Missy gettin' pissy up in Bennigans
Makin' all of you rappers begin again, like Finnegan
Christians repent then sin again
Girls wanna be my friend again
Lay up in my crib of wit', get up in my linens and
While Misdemeanor hit notes like Sarafina
I subpoena you to my funk grooves see
I hit you wit' the huh
She hit ya with the hee

It wasn't your car that had me all in love with you (You)
'Cause I've got my own ride and a trunk full of tunes, yeah (Tunes)
I drive through your hood
And I hit 'em with the—
You might also like
I hit 'em with the hee (Hit 'em with the hee)
I hit 'em with the—
I stop 'em with the ha (I stop 'em with the ha)
Let's drink to you and me, let's drink to you and me
Meet me at the bar, ha
Hee, ha

It wasn't your money that had me all sprung out (Sprung out, sprung out, sprung out)
'Cause I got my own account and my bills in large amount
Ayy, hey-hey
I drive through your hood

I hit 'em with the hee
I hit 'em with the—
I stop 'em with the ha (I hit 'em wit' the hee, I hit 'em wit' the ha)
Let's drink to you and me, let's drink to you and me
Meet me at the bar (You can meet me at the bar)

Long Iced Tea slurp me swiftly, meet me at the bar
What's up star? We know who you are
Shit, no shit, I thought you hadn't noticed
The way I roll this Dutch, the way I roll this Dutch
Niggas love my style too much, duck (Haha)
Here comes the shot, bang-bang, brrt, drop
Me and Timbaland like ha
We takin over blocks
Like a one-billion-bitch march
I hit 'em with the hee
I hit 'em with the ha
I hit 'em with the hee
