I'm in here smokin' on some real bud
This shit so strong it'll make you pass out, loud
I remember bein' broke still
But don't forget I got that bread now
I'll bust your mothafuckin' head now
My auntie say she think I'm fed-bound
You step on my ground then that's dead ground
Like MJG I make you lay it down

Lay it down, nigga, lay it down, nigga
Hands up, get your ass on the ground, nigga
Face down, nigga, lay it down, nigga
Hands up, get your bitch ass on the ground, nigga
Lay it down, nigga, lay it down, nigga
It's a stickup, don't make a sound, nigga
Lay it down, nigga, lay it down, nigga
When I come through with that chopper, lay it down, nigga

I told you that I lay it down when I ride with 
Rushed to 33rd and with a fuckin' ski mask
Blow a nigga's ass into fuckin next week
For playin' with Gucci Mane, you'll be fuckin' dead meat
No paddle, nigga, but you're up shit's creek
Gave you some work and you've been runnin' off for weeks
I'm the judge and jury, nigga, we go home court in the street
And if I slap you with this pistol, try to knock out all his teeth
Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm extraordinary, player
I'm ridin' in the car, come from another hemisphere
Yeah I can get you here, babe and I can get you there
But if you come with me, you do not have no interwear
Where, where, baby, where you wanna go?
I'm flowin' and I'm blowin' on some shit so fuckin' potent
This beat's so fuckin' dope it nearly broke my Panasonic
This Scooter and Gucc, Snoop and Dre and this is The Chronic

Lay it down, nigga, lay it down, nigga
Hands up, get your ass on the ground, nigga
Face down, nigga, lay it down, nigga
Hands up, get your bitch ass on the ground, nigga
Lay it down, nigga, lay it down, nigga
It's a stickup, don't make a sound, nigga
Lay it down, nigga, lay it down, nigga
When I come through with that chopper, lay it down, niggaEmbed
