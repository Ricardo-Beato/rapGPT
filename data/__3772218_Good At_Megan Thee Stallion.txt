MCV, bitch, hahaha
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, and fuck you!

Ayy, ayy, posing, drinking all the bottles of Patron and
Drive these niggas crazy 'cause they know they can't control me
A hottie, a model body, suit by Armani, I'm shining
If you lookin', ain't that hard to find me
Yeah, Stalli is a player
I make these niggas toes curl like my baby hair
I get up on the drink and get to feeling on myself
Bad bitches singin' all my songs like a prayer
I'ma super bad bitch (Bad bitch)
And I only hang around wit' other bad chicks (Bad chicks)
Everywhere I go, I gotta take a damn pic
Turn around, look back, I get ratchet (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Taking selfies, really tryna fix my lipstick
I love myself but niggas say I'm hard to deal with (Deal with)
I'm still hotter than them hoes that you chill with (Chill with)
And I could pull any nigga on some chill shit and that's some real shit
I ain't choose being player, being player chose me
And no, I ain't committed but I'm never lonely
I gotta keep these motherfucking haters off me
Don't be actin' fly when you know you goofy
You might also like
Tell me where it's good at
Tell me where the fly niggas in the hood at
Ayy, fuck the club, where the kickback?
Ayy, is that the 'yac? Lemme get that
Ayy, somebody tell me where the boss be
Can you keep these broke motherfuckers off me?
And I only keep the baddest bitches 'round me
Chopper, yellow, redbone, and a bunny, where it's sunny

Gucci on my coochie, glitter on my body, everybody wanna do me
A hood Mona Lisa, figure like somebody drew it
If I introduce you to this pussy, nigga, you gon' chew it, rub your waves while I do it
I know bitches I've influenced, I look different, they congruent
Post a pic up on the 'gram, then my DMs get to boomin'
"Hey bighead," and "What you doin'?" "Can I fly you out to Europe?"
"Do your pussy taste like gum? 'Cause I'm really tryna chew it”
Hit 'em back like, “Who you bank with? Do you got a lady?
And if you do, can you still deposit my money safely?”
He watchin' all my videos just to watch me shake it
Damn, I thought the nigga had a seizure, way he shakin'
Let me wrap my legs around you, keep you warmer than a blanket
Drive around the world, city to city, let you spank it
Posing for your pictures 'cause I know you wanna take it
Tell the world you mine, put it in them bitches faces
Tell the world you mine, put it in them bitches faces
Tell the world you mine, put it in them bitches faces

Tell me where it's good at
Tell me where the fly niggas in the hood at
Ayy, fuck the club, where the kickback?
Ayy, is that the 'yac? Lemme get that
Ayy, somebody tell me where the boss be
Can you keep these broke motherfuckers off me?
And I only keep the baddest bitches 'round me
Chopper, yellow, redbone, and a bunny, where it's sunny

Voguing, party with my bitches 'til the morning
Working every angle 'cause they love to catch me posing
A slick ponytail with a tight outfit
But why cover up with a body this sick?
And why you like to Facetime when I'm this lit? (Huh?)
I think it turn you on when I'm talkin' my shit
I ain't talkin' rapping when I say I like to hear you spit
You ain't talkin' sauce when you say you like to see it drip
I will never bust it open for no broke dick
I don't hang with bitches I ain't gettin' money with (Money with)
Middle finger out the window when they lane switch (Lane switch)
I know I'm handlin' my business when they talk shit
And my ex nigga always tryna take it there (Take it there)
He used to play me, now he told me I ain't playin' fair (Playin' fair)
Oh, so you want me now that you know I don't want you here?
You just be callin' me to say shit I don't wanna hear (Uh-huh)
You just be callin' me to say shit I don't wanna hear (Uh-huh)
You just be callin' me to say shit I don't wanna hear

Tell me where it's good at
Tell me where the fly niggas in the hood at
Ayy, fuck the club, where the kickback?
Ayy, is that the 'yac? Lemme get that
Ayy, somebody tell me where the boss be
Can you keep these broke motherfuckers off me?
And I only keep the baddest bitches 'round me
Chopper, yellow, redbone, and a bunny, where it's sunny (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

Ayy, ayy, I ain't choose being player, being player chose me
Ayy, don't be actin' fly when you know you goofy (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)1Embed
