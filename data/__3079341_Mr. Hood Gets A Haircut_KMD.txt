What's up
(I want my haircut)
Yah might as well got nothing better to do
Yah they told you my clippers are broke right
Well sit right there
Move those records
Yah right there
Sit
(This chair is dirty)
Alright you gonna start complaining
Anyway what kind do you want
Fade, flat
And put, put that out G
(Does the smoke bother you?)
Of course it bothers me and that's disrespect man
You see the no smoking sign
And plus my incense, it don't blend
It don't blend man
Where you from anyway
(I'm from New York)
Oh word hmm

Land of the golden records
Home of the hits
(Do you have popular records?)

But we got like many different styles and all that
Jazz, funk, blues, Jeep music
