8 ContributorsStill Pushin Lyrics
As you see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours (Logic)
Yeah, check it, ayo

Pick up the brush like Picasso, '93 Nas flow
200 on the 101, watch as the nos go (Now)
Straight from the underground, that lost flow
Now we get Louis V, back in the day as a kid it was Costco
I stay breaded like Roscoe’s
Rap messiah, me and my apostles
I'm 33 but by rap years I'm fuckin’ fossils
Still kickin', still pushin', still grindin', still goin'
Already knowing that I don't know shit
Walk in the room, knew my intentions ‘fore I spoke it
I took the record and broke it
Feeling limitless, I'm feeling so focused
This is all me, nobody co-wrote this
And I hope this reach you when you need it
Not at your wit's end, feeling depletеd
Keep being you, fake motherfuckеrs we seeing through
This some rap shit, come now feel the flow in this beat
I’ve had my ups and downs, but life ain’t ever felt this steep
Shallow moments in my career, but it's never been this deep
Praise God that I’m alive, moment I wait 'til I see
Ayo, this is emceeing, finally ON-YO like Koreans
Foreseeing I would blow like C4, who want more?
Me and my clique tighter than belt buckles
This for anybody that life beat down and felt knuckles
For the Discord, pulling strings like Hendrix's ripcords
(You are watching a master at work)
Wooh, this shit crazy (Is this what you want?)
You might also like
Ayo, my kicks 3G's like an astronaut’s, pass the shots
You stay acting funny
Need a reality check? That's that Kardashian money
My flow ultra, no 85
'86 you like Reagan, no longer alive
Engaging in bullshit, I want no parts
Rapping in my genes, ain't no starch
I can rhyme without rhyming, still make the people third month
Fifth month I continue to ensue, cut you like Ginsu
You don't know the shit that I been through
It's hard to stay present when your past was tense
The flow is immense
Weed hit my chest like 450 on the bench
On my MPC2000XL in the front yard
I stay with vintage brakes like junk yards, always come hard
Pick up the mic now En Garde
Try hard, back with another attempt
Don't hold me exempt
Stay with bars like I was held in contempt
Ain't fucking with you like a women ain't giving consent
What's the gift of life without presents?
Smoking an ounce plus the resin
I got the throne, you got the chair
Stay dropping the ball like Time Square
When I'm fried I lose track of time like Phil in Futurama
No time for the drama, only the comma, my money never pause
Rebel with a cause, sound the applause
In the cut like gause
Black and white like Hitchcock, me and the blunt lip-lock
I'ma kick push, you can suck a dick and then kick rocks
First free mixtape in ten years
It's Logic, pack master
Young Sinatra, RattPack
I love y'all, man, this whole shit straight from the heart
Inglorious Basterd, Volume 1Embed
