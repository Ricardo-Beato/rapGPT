Yo, uh
Got my nigga Easy in this motherfucker
Deadstock sixes and shit
Got my nigga Metro in this motherfucker, yeah, ooh

Uh, by the bar (Bar), buy the bar
Bitches on my table everywhere (Where)
On the floor, condoms on my dresser (Straight up)
On my business, never plannin'
Never sober (La Flame), thinkin' blew me up (Up)
Body shots took on your bitches titties
Slow it down, pick it up, fuck a third
Speed the fourth gear grindin' up
On everything, it's my year (Straight up)
I got it now, everything I ever asked for
We gettin' it, far from mama's Jeep
She never tinted it
She frozed up, I unfrozed her
Now come a little closer (Straight up)
Get your ass up off that wall
And go roll up that doja (That dough)
Tell your boyfriend bust that key
Go 'head and fill ya nose up (La Flame)
'Til it's over
We ain't lookin' for the hoes, where the trophies?
Grab a glass, go ahead, get throwed up (Straight up) (Yeh, yeh)
She feelin' it (Yeah, yeh, yeh)
Don't spill the shit (Yeh, yeh)
Ah, she crazy, she goin', she goin'
Gone!
You might also like
Ayy, all this money on the table, ooh
We don't want relations
We don't want no conversations
Fuck around and change the weather (Straight up)
Damn, I'm with my main bitch
Ayy, and I don't love her no mo' (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Drinkin', fuck the limitations
I done made it out the basement
Fuck around and change the weather (Straight up)
Ayy

I'm off a bean, I'm off a bean
See this lean, it's in my dreams (That dope)
Off this dope, don't wanna smoke (Oh no)
Off this roll, I might just roll (Straight up, straight up)
Let's get throwed
Out in Houston they know my name (Oh)
In MO city they know the gang (Oh)
Young La Flame, ain't nothin' changed
But the chains and diamond rings

Diamond rings, I lost my brains
Me and Ye Ye out in broad day
I'm on the 3rd coast
Eatin' Burlow with Merlot (Straight up)
I got my shirt off
Kickin' dirt off out in Bergdorf (La Flame)
She like, "What you doin'?" (Doin')
It took a path just to get me here
Don't give a damn if that's ruined (Ruined)
Later on got a ring, ring, ring
She at my doorbell, "ding-ding-ding-ding"
Let the bitch in, the bitch seen
Bang out, bang out
On the couch, on the floor, in her mouth
Camera's out (Camera's out)
Once my dick's in, no pulling out (No pulling out)
That's my baby (Straight up)
Bitch been doing coke since the '80s (That dope)
I'm a '90s baby (La Flame)
Young La Flame, you know he crazy

Ayy (Straight up, straight up)
All this money on the table, ooh
We don't want relations
We don't want no conversations
Fuck around and change the weather
Damn, I'm with my main bitch
Ayy, and I don't love her no mo'
Drinkin', fuck the limitations
I done made it out the basement
Fuck around and change the weather
