3 ContributorsInvicible Lyrics
Scarface the criminal
Hardcore invincible
Scarface, invincible
The hardcore criminal

Never letting nothing stand in the way of me riding
Animal instinct intentions whenever we grinding
We criminally minded, I'll squeeze ya blindly
Body parts deteriorated when they find ya
Here's your death certificate, might as well sign it
The ending, I'm the reaper, why you hiding?
I'm violent, I strike with the force of a bomb
And right when you least expect it I come
Uh, I know you see the fire in my eyes
The hunger, the hate, I'm trapped inside, now die
Everybody in here gotta die
Ain't nobody in here escapin' my nine
Ain't no sense in hiding', you wasting my time
Bitch, I gotta handle, I came to get mine
Believe if you don't leave no witnesses, no crime
Welcome to the part of the sun that don't shine

Scarface, invincible
Hardcore criminal
Scarface, invincible
The hardcore criminal
You might also likeWelcome to the day of futures AK
The place where you get caught for shit, you get sprayed
Where hoes got dicks and niggas is bitch made
Taking penitentiary chance to get paid
Children getting suspended for toting switch blades
Others brutally murdered before the 6th grade
6 million ways to murder choose 
I prefer the method of using a 12 gauge
And blades crack open your rib cage, shawty
High off of wanting' this weed and black mildly
The hardcore following is raising dead bodies
Murder Inc. in the muthafucka like Irv Gotti
And living hot as we ride
Look into my bloodshot eyes to visualize the blood red skies
It's the border where the live dead die
A brief moment in time and the sun don't shine, bottom line

Scarface, invincible
Hardcore criminal
Scarface, criminal
Hardcore criminal
Scarface invincible
Hardcore criminal
In the event that you coming with static, I play the map
Comin', comin' at you with M11's and automatic
I'm worse than the mentally ill, a bad habit
Over killing my victims, just to get to see they casket
Rage like a machine, you suckas get blasted
The hardcore serial killing, I done mastered
The church of the criminally sick, I'm the pastor
My dad used to beat up my mom, I'm a bastard
Now ask her, how does it feel to be a smasher
Me plus me with a strap, that's disaster
For anybody protecting the shit that I'm after
Empty wishes don't be takin' you out, I'mma have to
Scarface invincible
Hardcore, criminalEmbed
