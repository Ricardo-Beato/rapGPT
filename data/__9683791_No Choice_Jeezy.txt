8 ContributorsNo Choice Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

'Bout to cop another duplex, fuck this Rolls Royce (Aye)
Screamin', "Let's get it", 'til I ain't got no voice (Haha)
Shrink wrap the money, so it don't get moist (Yeah)
I gotta go and get it, I ain't got no choice (Yeah)
You better stack your money, nigga, fuck that Rolls Royce
Screamin', "Let's get it", 'til I ain't got no voice (Aye)
Shrink wrap the money, so it don't get moist (Damn)
I gotta go and get it, I ain't got no choice

Thug Motivation in a tux with the symphony
The streets taught me everything, everything but empathy
I been through hell, I'm livin' well, and I don't want no sympathy
Gave me lemons, I made lemonade, and I ain't talkin' Simply Mind playin' tricks on me, took a month from alcohol
Giorgio Armani, that's what I wore to Tamron Hall
"Just know we hurtin' out here', that's exactly what I told her
But still we solid out here, that's exactly what I showed her
Never in a million years thought I'd be on CNN
Tellin' them about them white squares that I was gettin' in
Nigga that I knew turned feds best teller
Meanwhile your boy, New York Times best seller
Greatest story never told, yeah, I had to write a book about it
Told 'em that they snatched my man up, and I was shook about it
And yesterday, I was partyin' with the Vice President
Had a certified real nigga at her residence
These flunkies tellin' everything, but really, they don't know shit
Gossipin' and assumin' 'bout a nigga, boy, that's ho shit
Can't hear you, nigga, money in the way, yeah, that's broke shit
Potter's House with TD Jakes, nigga, yeah, that's Pope shit
God gave me a gift of lean, you niggas can't take it
Beyonc√© with this soul shit, you niggas can't break it
Good Morning America, I'm kickin' shit with Robin
All black everything, you know your boy was mobbin'
Fresh up out the cartel, chillin' with the mayor
Told Reverend Warnock to keep me in his prayers
I ain't dead or in jail 'cause that bullshit wasn't meant for me
Savin' that for my sit down with Oprah Winfrey
Told 'em I done gave this shit about that real estate
You best be buyin' dirt, if you out there flippin' weight
It ain't nothin' but love, yeah, let them niggas hate
I'm in the mansion with the gate and I'ma keep bein' great

Screamin', "Let's get it", 'til I ain't got no voice (Aye)
Shrink wrap the money, so it don't get moist (Damn)
I gotta go and get it, I ain't got no choice

You better own your own pain, nigga
These niggas will always wanna find somebody to blame 'cause they don't wanna own their own pain
I'm ownin' mine, nigga, yeah
Yeah, vulnerability is power, nigga, it's strength
Makes you strong, my nigga
I'ma keep healin' on these niggas, yeah
I ain't got no choice, yeah
Do this one of two ways, nigga, yeah
You got two choices
One's to go get it, yeah
Other one's to sit back
And you already know how that go
You know how that go, nigga, yeah
Ain't shit comin' to a dreamer but a dream, yeah
Nigga, we ain't got no choice, yeah
These niggas see a nigga livin' better, doin' better, bein' better
Y'all niggas wanna come out the woodworks and shit
Yeah, nigga, you know what it is, nigga
Niggas see a nigga healin', nigga bein' great
Niggas wanna hate, nigga, I told you niggas y'all ain't see the vision though
One thing about it
For the motherfuckin' record, nigga, yeah
I'm so far past you niggas with this fuck shit, I'm gone, no question
But I want you to remember one thing, nigga, yeah
I might forgive, but I don't motherfuckin' forgetEmbed
