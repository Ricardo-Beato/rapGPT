19 ContributorsBeans & Magazines Lyrics
Go, go, go, go, go, bang (Sos' baby)

Throw you some shells
I got that arm, ayy
Unleash the beast
And that be my charm, ayy
Hop in my American whip
Hop out the foreign
'Fore you call the police
I'm already gone, ayy ayy

Pop out the Miss, ayy, hop out a bitch
Was broke, but damn man I'm rich, ayy, tryna catch me a fish, ayy
Lookin' like I hit a lick, so much horse and kick
This bitch like a Ferrari, ayy, boy, we ain't fakin' no funk
I was like 8 with a gun, pour ace up but I'm the one
When I take KayKay to the lunch, I tell her to get what she want, ayy
We stakin' out on a beef, we comin' out like a leak, we comin' outta the tree
I'm comin' outta the V, turn up the passenger seat, ayy
Hand me a light, let's get ready to ride, all this ice I'ma catch frost bite
If you sneak diss, you can catch me outside, if you sneak diss, then you know it's on sight, ayy
Girl, we ain't a couple you can't hold my hand and these dirty ass niggas can't hold my bands, ayy
Too many blunts, my eyes bloodshot red, steady hearin' voices in my head
You might also like
Throw you some shells
I got that arm, ayy
Unleash the beast
And that be my charm, ayy
Hop in my American whip
Hop out the foreign
'Fore you call the police
I'm already gone, ayy ayy

Young nigga, from the bottom
Ohh, got me, like I got me
Wrist rocky, pockets stocky
And we got beans and magazines

Send me in the wilderness
And I'm coming out with Scars
Water well it might be a shark
Baby what caught your eye it might be my ring
And you know this the 50 feet, step in this ring
I'm flexing like I'm stone cold Steve Austin
She wanna ride me like yeehaw
I'm bout my bread, pita
Wanna relax with the seat back
Tint so dark you can't see past
Just had a talk with my ego
Got more more shelves than The Home Depot
Throw you some shells
I got that arm, ayy
Unleash the beast
And that be my charm, ayy
Hop in my American whip
Hop out the foreign
'Fore you call the police
I'm already gone, ayy ayy

Young nigga, from the bottom
Ohh, got me, like I got me
Wrist rocky, pockets stocky
And we got beans and magazinesEmbed
