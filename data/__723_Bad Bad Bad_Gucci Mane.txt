What's happenin'? It's Gucci
Hey Keyshia, you feelin' this girl, man but...
She ain't right, you know what I'm saying? (Fatboi, Fatboi!)
Take one, take one, Gucci! (Ohh, whoa!)
I can do bad by myself, you know what I mean? (Whoa, whoa!)
For real (Okay, okay) (Aye!)
Action, action (Doin' it) (Oh)
Gucci!

Rap game paid me, trap game made me (Gucci)
We used to be good friends now she can't stand me (What?)
Her man ain't G, her man ain't me (What? What?)
Her man can't be what her man can't be (No, no, no!)
My jewelry game fridgy- white watch blizzard (Burr! Burr!)
Crocodile lizard, pinky ring ignorant; (Burr! Burr!)
I'm careful who I step to when I step too (Huh!)
And if I choose first she choose me then she special (Huh!)
Long walks all night dawg I can help her (Help her!)
Bless her, show her how to be successful (Well Damn!)
Kiss her, Gucci hustler, a finesser (Huh!)
Sudden valley cook up second of the extra (Skurr!)
Stack up loud pack make her catch a contact (Huh!)
Dumb sets long stacks, I can make her come back (Gucci!)

I'm a bad boy but still there's so much good in me (Yeah!)
You can take me out the hood the hood is still in me (Yeah!)
I need a girl to feel herself but can still feel me (Oh)
Just let me be your only choice no need for plan B! (Mm!)
My love life is malnutritions you my Vitamin C
Stay down like Hillary and I can be your Billy
I'll buy you Jada pinky pinkies I'm the biggest willy (Burr!)
Just when I give it throw it back just like we playing frisbee (Burr! Gucci!)
I can do it by myself but I'd be very lonely (Huh!)
Be the diva who's my lover and my closest homie (Yeah!)
So if you sick and tired of being sick and tired call me (Gucci!)
Pick up the yellow pages and look up Gucci! (Gucci!/Burr!) (I can do!)

I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself (Oh! Oh no, baby!)
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself (Can you hear me?)
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself
Ain't no need in arguing about it
If you wanna leave then just be 'bout it
There's no sense in blaming me and me blaming you
There's no reason to be untrue
Everything I got to work hard for
Everyday I work hard to make more
I can do bad all by myself
I ain't trying play love games cause I can do bad baby

I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself (All alone)
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself (Don't need no one! Can you hear me?)
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself (Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I can do!)
I can do bad, bad, bad, bad, bad all by myself (Can you hear me?)

But I ain't going, bad! Oh!
Aye-yeah! Can you hear me?Embed
