50 ContributorsBlue Benz Lyrics
As we go through life, one of the big questions about
Things we purchase is— is, what the value of it is
Is it really worth it?

I used to be at The Tunnel twenty deep in a huddle
Razors on us that'll make skin bubble, Moet, we guzzle
Chris Lighty let me in a few times with nines
That's on God, wish you woulda walked by
And bumped me hard or just looked at me wrong
My chain on, try to book me, you gone
Goons, Italian leathers, couple bottles of Dom
Took risks, this ain't what you want, there's rules to this
Don't get it misconstrued, my suit gamе is crisp
Silk, linen, chiffon, Dior to Diadora
But I rock custom more, that hustler aura, tap in
Razor cutter, nineties, eighties lover, raised in gutters
Raised above it, they made it up out the hood subject, I made you love it
Crazy, I knew this chick, she had a blue Benz
A Jersey penthouse, she used to pimp girls that would turn rich men out
Her coke habits was so savage
She hear voices and see ghosts on the average
Of her stepdad, he raised her from a carriage
She was twelve when he passed, she's been in hell since that
Her grandma raised her, I met her in Kingston, Jamaica
Where veteran kingpins bought acres, rest in peace Louie Rankin

Murder uno bomboclaat fi fun

Peace signs in the air for son
Put his name on the street sign there where he from
Whenever we hear his bangers, flare up a blunt
And praise God, and pray we all prepared when He come for us
Just opened my new office, West Coast branch
Place my teacup on the saucer, it's Esco, man
Bossed up, nothing feels better than doing deals with my brothers
It's surreal, how I feel, y'all should love us
Life is a test so congratulations to your success
For having patience, you deserve the best
You know how they do niggas, the IRS
People I ain't even met take it out my check
They the biggest gangster, I respect the jooks
We buyin' big boy mansions, they respect the crooks
This for my project niggas and blue Benzes
Mercedes emblems with they bitch with 'em8Embed
