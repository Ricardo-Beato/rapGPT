What if I blow up tomorrow, what am I to become?
I won't be another rapper who was found with a gun
That's not the life that I'm living, I'm fulfilled with a purpose
I'ma be the greatest ever, man, I feel I deserve it
Them kids get younger and dumber
Them boys will steal from the churches
They always say that they hurting
Gotta heal from my verses
I'm a leader of men and I'm the voice of the youth
But old niggas gon' listen, say this boy is the truth
I got the veteran bars like I'm the boy with the troops
And yeah I'm from the Southside but this ain't Lloyd in the booth
I got a verse and a chorus
And my songs gonna flourish
Only worry bout growth, man, that's word to the florist
Niggas always switching sides, call the guys out for remorse
But I'm always running shit, they tryna block where I'm going
But they can't stop it, I'm Jordan
My new watch is imported
Now my timing is perfect, I will not be distorted

Because we live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus, I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings
We live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus cuz I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings
You might also like
I need to blow up the mall, we gon' shine like the sun
Always got my brother's back if niggas tryna front
Got my mind on the blunt, bunch of silly distractions
I gotta pocket full of dreams, I wish they really would happen
But in the city, they clapping
Bunch of overreactions
It's like I'm finished with a poem cuz they niggas be snapping
Let's do it big with the rapping
Talking real and they hear you
But we going different ways, I see your breaks in my rearview
Fuck it, let's get it and go
I remember rapping off of middle end roll
Switching the flows, feel like we never did it before
When niggas got cold, squads broke, they picked and they rolled
We gave all we got, I'll give till I'm ghost
Once I'm Casper, rapper
These niggas pussy like Jaz the rapper
I'm trying to afford me a forty Meek and back to back it
But nevertheless, they showing off but never respect
Just try to put me on but never the rest
Living the best

Because we live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus, I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings
We live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus cuz I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings (sing)
Listen
All my life, I just be searching, asking what is my purpose
These niggas watching me and I feel like I'm trapped in a circus
Just cuz I can rap about bad bitches, chilling, sipping some lean
And I can rap about me selling drugs and all of the things
Tell my soul man, I can't let them niggas hear what I say
I'm trying to change the world and maybe I can do that today
I never change what I believe, man, I stay true to myself
You can't pay me to speak, deaf just to offer me wealth
And I'm tired of people thinking that I got nothing to prove
They think I'm on the road to nothing cuz I dropped out of school
These niggas don't know the work I put in to be here
And I never take any orders cuz the boat's what I steer
And never ask what if, or how would things be different if I
I just faced my fears, got off my ass and said fuck it, and just tried
And one thing, when I'm at the top, I can look back and be proud
I see applause and nominations when I look at the crowd
Yeah

Because we live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus, I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings
We live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus cuz I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings1Embed
