6 ContributorsThirsty (Gucci Sosa) Lyrics
You ain't Playa Fly, and you ain't Gucci Mane
And we got Juiceman, is you thirsty?
Drankin on purple drank, smoking on purple dank
And it ain't never dry, so is you thirsty?
Nothing personal mane, nothing personal mane
You looking thirsty mane, so is you thirsty?
Nothing personal mane, othing personal mane
Yo it ain't never dry, so is you thirsty?

Thirsty, thirsty, buddy looking thirsty
Young Juiceman, pockets stuffed like a turkey
Young Juiceman, with more keys than 
 and I never let you play me
Posted in the kitchen, straight drop the babies
 you know I'm working daily
Still whip the work, so icy baby
Zay on the ttrack,  and Fly crazy
Juiceman stupid, pinky ring 
VVS chain got your girlfriend drewling
 white with the blue 
 new Louie
Prada , racks on the Gucci
Everyday I'm  my life is like the movie
Smoking on kush, lean got me woozy
Young Juiceman,  like the pool stick
You might also like
You ain't Playa Fly, and you ain't Gucci Mane
And we got Juiceman, is you thirsty?
Drankin on purple drank, smoking on purple dank
And it ain't never dry, so is you thirsty?
Nothing personal mane, nothing personal mane
You looking thirsty mane, so is you thirsty?
Nothing personal mane, othing personal mane
Yo it ain't never dry, so is you thirsty?

How many people on this Earth have seen
Anybody on this Earth that wanna be like me?
 Memphis  legend, I'm the minute made 
And I really do exist, universal heartthrob
I ain't never in a 
 I'm Fly
Yo my name say it for me, it's Playa fucking Fly
Have you ever stood beside a real dark  figure?
Getting higher than a  500 nigga
Said he come from the city, where they're known to spit deadly
Get pimpin, get pimpin

 ho in the Coupe, so my zipper unzipping
Not to mention, all the money  been getting

So Icy Entertainment, please pour ya boy a drink mane
Nothing personal mane, you looking thirsty mane
You ain't Playa Fly, and you ain't Gucci Mane
And we got Juiceman, is you thirsty?
Drankin on purple drank, smoking on purple dank
And it ain't never dry, so is you thirsty?
Nothing personal mane, nothing personal mane
You looking thirsty mane, so is you thirsty?
Nothing personal mane, othing personal mane
Yo it ain't never dry, so is you thirsty?

You ain't Playa Fly, and you ain't Gucci Mane
And we got Juiceman, is you thirsty?
Drankin on purple drank, smoking on purple dank
And it ain't never dry, so is you thirsty?
Nothing personal mane, nothing personal mane
You looking thirsty mane, so is you thirsty?
Nothing personal mane, othing personal mane
Yo it ain't never dry, so is you thirsty?Embed
