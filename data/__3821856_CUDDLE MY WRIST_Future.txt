Zaytoven
Cuddle my wrist, cu-cu-cuddle my wrist
Cuddle my bitch, cu-cu-cuddle my bit'
Cuddle my wrist, cuddle my wrist
Cuddle my, cu-
Cuddle my, cuddle

Cuddle my wrist, cuddle my bitch, cuddle my wrist
Cuddle my bitch, cuddle my wrist, cuddle my wrist

I got that monkey on my back
I walk around with 500 racks
I keep the city on my shoulders
Carry it 'round like a bag of stacks
I put a kit on a Bentayga
Dr. Miami, the ass fat
Nigga wanna play with the Murda Squad
Fuck around, I had to call up Scratch

Goyard as soon as the bag got packed
Zone 6, sure, I ain't showing no slack
Never been a quitter, I'ma turn it to the max
Lean in my liver, I've been taking good batch
Real dope dealers don't hang around rats
Four by four, sitting taller than a 'Lac
Margiela on my toes, sittin' way in the back
Canary yellow gold, Rollie and a Mac
Glock four-oh, plastic gat
VV coated, sitting on my chest
Pussy ass niggas don't call no threat
I'm a big dog, you ain't nothin' but a pet
Weak ass nigga boutta run outta check
Tryna keep up, better step up your neck
Had to eat it up when I caught the baguettes
Snackin' on me, it ain't nothin' to address
You might also like
Cuddle my wrist, cuddle my bitch, cuddle my wrist
Cuddle my bitch, cuddle my wrist, cuddle my wrist

Fifty-five mil' on my carats
I never had to go in the vault
Fishscale when you speak my status
Future already done picked up the phone
We on a regular line, nigga
I can't talk to you nothin' 'bout the raw
I heard you seen a nigga get flatline
You better not tell them none what you saw
Soon as I drop, I got flexed up
Fuck all that drama, got heat tucked
Ice out the hittas, my cuts up
Yellow gold Presi, it bust up
Young nigga already pushed the Ferrari
I came in with the head off
Jumbo Patek gon' crush your career
All these wheels, got dust on the wheel
So many foreigns, a car dealership
Poured up my cup when I hopped on the Lear
Drippin' severe, the God is here
Dic's in here, I got chartered here
I got that monkey on my back
I walk around with 500 racks
I keep the city on my shoulders
Carry it 'round like a bag of stacks
I put a kid on a Bentayga
Dr. Miami, the ass fat
Nigga wanna play with the murda squad
Fuck around, I had to call up Scratch

Cuddle my wrist, cuddle my bitch, cuddle my wrist
Cuddle my bitch, cuddle my wrist, cuddle my wrist5Embed
