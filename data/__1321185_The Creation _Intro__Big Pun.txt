9 ContributorsThe Creation (Intro) Lyrics(Laughing)
As the full eclipse approaches
I must build the illest creation
Known, to mankind
(Master, what are you going to do?)
Big Daddy Kane
Kool G Rap
Rakim the Master
Eddie Murphy
(Why, why you need Eddie Murphy?)
Cause he's a funny muthafucka
Michael Jackson
(Michael Jackson?)
Because he has money
Fuckin' dickhead
(I'm sorry master, haha, I'm very sorry)
The heart of a Indian
The strength of a black man
And the pride of a Spaniard
I present to you...
The Punisher!
