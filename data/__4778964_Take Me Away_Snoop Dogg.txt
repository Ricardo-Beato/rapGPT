Yeah
Yeah,  Russ, Wiz, Snoop Dogg
Mmmm,  yeah
I don't even smoke like that but (Oh yeah)
I have been the past couple days, fuck it

I  said this kush is gonna take me away (Yeah), 'way, away
I  said this kush is gonna take me away (Say what?), 'way, away
(What, what? What, what? What, what?)
I  said this kush is gonna take me away, 'way, away
I said this kush is gonna take me away, 'way, away

I don't need nothin' but a pound wit' a light
Take me away, nigga sittin' on flight
Sky  high, smokin' on a PJ, G shit, bangin' on replay
OG snoop, no webay
I don't see nothin' but the G way, my eyes on green like I'm DeRay
Money and kush, weed in my hands, burger in the bush, gettin' my bands
Shit gettin major, got my own brand, whole lotta flavors, hunnid thousand in the stands
Everybody feelin' good, ain't nobody out there hatin' today
Nah, smoke it, make it understood
Hit the kush and let it take you away, 'way
You might also like
I said this kush is gonna take me away, 'way, away
I said this kush is gonna take me away, 'way, away
I said this kush is gonna take me away, 'way, away
I said this kush is gonna take me away, 'way, away

It's 1 AM and I'm just ridin' 'round town
Had a girl in São Paulo, I'll fly her right now
Don't send me emoji with the bright eyebrow
Tell me something good right now
I'm feelin' like, ooh, ooh

Okay
This KK got me feelin' cray-cray
I just got a pound and I smoked it all the same day
This cookie got me feelin' like a rookie
I just took three puffs, got super high, that's how it should be
This purple got me in a circle
Better slow it down before you hit it, it'll hurt you
This lemon got me feelin' finished
I won't ever stop, been blowin' smoke since the beginnin'
Ya' feel me?

I said this kush is gonna take me away (Yup), 'way (Let's go), away (Let's go)
I said this kush is gonna take me away (Yup), 'way (I mean), away (Yeah, yup)
I said this kush is gonna take me away, 'way, away
I said this kush is gonna take me away, 'way, away
It's 1 AM and I'm just ridin' 'round town
Had a girl in São Paulo, I'll fly her right now
Don't send me emoji with the bright eyebrow
Tell me something good right now
I'm feelin' like, ooh (Yeah, yeah, whoa)
Ooh (Yeah, yeah, whoa)3Embed
