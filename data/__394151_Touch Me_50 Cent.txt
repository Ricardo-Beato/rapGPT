This time.. I'ma make it clear..
That I'm number one, uhh

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, she so vicious, sweet kisses, taste delicious
Maybe this is who I should make the missus
Let's conversate a little like a fiddle, play with the middle
They way she shake when it wiggle, I mean she hot like a kettle
Well, me I'm strapped with the metal when I go hard for the bread
So I line you up and I dent you
You run you're fucked when I catch you
You only eat cause I let you, I hate the fact that I met you
When you could say that you know me and act like I'm your homie

Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me (come on come on...)
Hold on tight and don't let go, baby I'm about to explode
(Come on come on...)
'Cause all my love you can control... (yeah...)

Haha... yeah... yeah... yeah...
She scratch my back when I'm stroking
She scream she like it, she open
I'm sitting back while she sucking, she super freaky, I love it (woo!)
The sex is better than basic, that kitty kat, yeah, I chase it
She do it just how I like it, position after position
Fast stroke, short stroke, deep stroke, listen
She down for pushing her limits, that's why I'm pushing up in it
Start kissing her lips then I'm kissing her neck
When my tongue cross her tatas, then bet it get wet to her, easy

Touch me, tease me (touch me baby...)
Feel me and caress me (tease me baby...)
Hold on tight and don't let go (50...), baby I'm about to explode
(Wooo...!)
'Cause all my love you can control...
(This is how it's supposed to feel
I said this is how it's supposed to feel...)

I'll spend the night with you (haha...)
If you promise you will do
All the things to make me scream, and you know just what I mean
(Girl you know what he mean...)
'Cause tonight you taste like ice cream
(Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah...
Work it out now... wooohooooooo... !)
I wanna make you fall in love
Make you touch the stars above (haha...)
Please me low and be my friend
I'll come back and hit it again (and hit it again...)
And again, and again, and again (again and again...)
Don't go away (yeah... come on girl...)

Touch me, tease me (make it feel good...)
Feel me and caress me (I mean real good...)
Hold on tight and don't let go, baby I'm about to explode (haha...)
'Cause all my love you can control...
(Yeah... I can feel it... owwwwww...!)

Let me get that Lex, nigga
Sex wetter than aquariums
Flashing, to get their ass and (uhh...)
Who fucks slow in Lear jets and coupes
My ones stacking
You ain't know that I be macking, uhh (nah...)
The extra set of keys, the thirty G's
Them trips to Belize, had you living on your knees, uhh (yeah...)
Not to mention the laced out crib in Dallas
(Yeah... yeah... yeah... ah!)
The forty room palace, sipping Cristal-ise
Uhh, what, uhh

Touch me, tease me (yeah...)
Feel me and caress me
(Now bend, and stretch come on...)
Hold on tight and don't let go (now bend, and stretch come on...)
Baby I'm about to explode
(Work it out... I said work it out...)
'Cause all my love you can control...
(Come on break it down... that's how they break it down... haha...)
Touch me, tease me (this is what I call fun...)
Feel me and caress me (I'm having so much fun...)
Hold on tight and don't let go, baby I'm about to explode
(I'm back to work...)
'Cause all my love you can control... (yeah...)Embed
