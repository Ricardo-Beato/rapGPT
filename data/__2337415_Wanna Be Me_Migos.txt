12 ContributorsWanna Be Me Lyrics
There's a lot of niggas that wanna be us right now
We just set a trend 'round the whole nation
I know you wanna be me
Tryna bite my dab
But I'm on a whole another level
Let's go!

I had a dream
Bitches keep running to me
Money keep coming to me
OG gas bag, I can't breathe
I'm the godfather, capeesh
It's not solid gold on your piece
I'm at the top you beneath
Why you copy and cloning us three
You niggas you wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
But you cannot be
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You might also like
You wanna be me
You don't wanna be me
I done did a lot of dirt up in these streets
From breaking in houses to selling them 
Remember going to the airport and stealing g
All these street niggas they fucking with me
All these broke niggas they like to 
I shot the fuck nigga before he could reach
And I'm sneakin' and geekin', feelin' like scream
Who are you?
You wanna be me
But you cannot be
More M's than Mickey D
No diamonds, it's gems all up in your piece
OG gas, need to spray some Febreze
I'm the same nigga from back in the day
Give me a Sprite and I'ma drop an eighth
I go bananas, I turn to an ape
Talking behind me, that's a pussy trait
I'm fly as a bitch but I don't got a cape
I am the predator, you are the prey
I'm robbing his son not talking 'bout Nate
Pull up to my mansion, get froze at the gate
He couldn't make it because it was too late
Shoutout to Pedro, he put food on my plate
You wannabe niggas not hunnid, you fake
I had a dream
Bitches keep running to me
Money keep coming to me
OG gas bag, I can't breathe
I'm the godfather, capeesh
It's not solid gold on your piece
I'm at the top you beneath
Why you copy and cloning us three
You niggas you wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
But you cannot be
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me

You wanna be me nigga, just think about it
If I feel uncomfortable nigga, pull out the pocket rocket
If it's an issue my nigga, ain't no need to talk about it
Niggas quick to talk like they 'bout it, we gon' see 'bout 'em
Niggas be bitin' the three amigos stealin' lingo my nigga that shit is illegal
I used to trap out the Regal with Skippa Flippa, cameras follow a nigga like cheetahs
They wanna be the Migos cause they know the critics say the Migos better than The Beatles
United Kingdom like I'm William Regal
All black Lamborghini man it look like Caesar
I don't want no feature lil nigga, you don't speak that ether, favorite rapper nigga there is neither
Don't really fuck with the industry independent, you get more Benjamin's when you single
I call my plug and ask him what's the tab
He told me you straight hit me when you touch down
I've been a trendsetter, 21 years
2015 niggas stealing the dab
Niggas try copy my flow and I laugh
They don't know how long I work for my crown
I come for you artists and fuck up your 
You'll see, keep talking, get hit with the dab
I had a dream
Bitches keep running to me
Money keep coming to me
OG gas bag, I can't breathe
I'm the godfather, capeesh
It's not solid gold on your piece
I'm at the top you beneath
Why you copy and cloning us three
You niggas you wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
But you cannot be
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be me
You wanna be meEmbed
