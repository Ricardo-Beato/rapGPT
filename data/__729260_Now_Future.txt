(808 Mafia)
Yeah
Future Hendrix, Super Future
All this jewelry on me
Rings on me, I'm fuckin' swaggin', you hear me? I'm stylin', I'm fly
To the max

I got my jewelry on me right now
Fifty round carbine on me right now
Got a hundred round drum on the seat right now (On the seat right now)
I got your bitch and she with me now
I had her sippin' on codeine now
I let her pull up in Bentleys now (Pull up in Bentleys now)
My goons get it done with a MAC-11
These niggas gon' ride for this shit we reppin' (For this shit we reppin')
Be cool on that fuck shit (Be cool on that fuck shit)
And I'm on that fuck shit (And I'm on that fuck shit)
We work that dope out the mud pit (Dope out the mud pit)
We on that dope and that mud shit (Dope and that mud shit)
We tried to show niggas some love shit

Niggas tried to flex they muscles on us
We cut 'em off and bought some better choppers
We fuck your bitches, let my brother hit 'em (Let my brother hit 'em)
Fuck you niggas, let my robbers get 'em (Let my robbers get 'em)
They just wanna see me out my mental
Went and fucked some commas up at my dental
Fuckin Lambo' up, doin' numbers
Pop a molly up, I remember
Better put your misses up, I'ma get her (Put your misses up, I'ma get her)
Fuck her in the mouth and didn't kiss her
Gut the crib out with all pistols
I got my grill in, twenty thousand
Bought a few chains, that's a new 'Rari
I got this cute dame, give a fuck about her
She want all this fame and a million dollars
I done took this pain and I'm noddin' off
Keep a few rings, give a fuck about 'em
I'm in that new Range, don't give a fuck about it
Grippin' grain on the Mulsanne
Sippin' drank at the Blue Flame
Hit the booth, let the booth flame
We ain't never cool, we just say that shit
For this bitch, you gotta play my shit
Run it back and then say my shit
