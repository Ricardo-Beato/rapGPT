12 ContributorsFor Right Now Lyrics
Sosa baby, GBE baby

I just wanna fuck for right now
I can't show you love, not right now
I’ma flame this bud up right now
Push come to shove, not right now
I ain't tryna talk for right now
I'm just tryna ball for right now
Stay away from the law for right now
You just got to kill them with kindness

For right now I can use me some breakfast
Came a long way from 8 section
Got a lot of bottles in the section
And a lot of diamonds in the necklace
Throwing cash up like "bitch catch this"
Bitches so sweet, I can use a dentist
Kick the cash door down off the hinges
For right now I can use me a pendant
For right now girl I’m M.I.Aair in MIA
I am not a superhero, I can not save
That shit that he flamed up, it smell like sage
She let me smash hit her with that one two three, Johnny Cage
Bang bang
You might also like
I just wanna fuck for right now
I can't show you love, not right now
I'ma flame this bud up right now
Push come to shove, not right now
I ain't tryna talk for right now
I'm just tryna ball for right now
Stay away from the law for right now
You just got to kill them with kindnessEmbed
