63 ContributorsBig Bang Lyrics
Well, so we meet again
(He said he's grown spiritually
Since the last time we'd spoken)

Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects
Where the jackals sit and watch the pedagogues clash flesh
Poison function accompanied by six armor-clad
Black horse and buggy mechanisms
Tugged a portion of my severed vision (my severed vision)
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket
With a shoestring budget
Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now)
But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen
Fee fie et cetera
I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin'
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin' to paddle back home
I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention
By eclipsing doom litigants hatched to bash these picket fences
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering
And when the groom presents the ring
The bride commence the blistering
It's textbook magnificently crude
Prototype king berserker module
Inserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal (treasure)
Treasure, loose cannons span the starboard bow
Of the clipper ship dipped in truth famine pressure (pressure)
Cabin fever meter peggin' ludicrous
Beautiful cartoon troopers
Swallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
I rock ready, aim, fire while y'all rock ready, fire, aim
Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame
Merit badge, marksman, or poacher?
It's all the same (right?)
So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain
You might also like
I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang, Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang
I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang, Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang

I'm just a survivor of the woolly mammoth population
Bottle neck effect, sorta born def
Alien to shallow alchemy
If you gon' metamorph the base-metal to precious
Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the peasants
I'm floating this homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window
Left an S.O.S. infested bottle nestled in his grip so
With a prayer circle release party and hearty wild bellow
I observed him fly ten feet
Then drop the bottles to the devils
Fertile circle turned fertile crescent via bad investment
Despised every second, but I guess I learned my lesson
If I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim
There'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system
Sticky panoramic contaminant planted
In conjunction with phantom assumption
Gutterbug alumnus candidates
Well, I promise you I'll man the lighthouse
Just to help guide in your ship
If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch)
Godspeed, straitjacketed ragged approach
To circle suns via folklore pollutants derived strictly
From a B.C. generation disgust
Community movement alluding to a
"No blood given, no recognition"
Life manner, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer
Trying to build a fence around these magic beans
My dreams have gathered
But to, that certain lack of avail
I sail a choppy lot with buoyancy like a bucket of rocks (a bucket of rocks)
I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang, Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang
I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang, Shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang

Big bang, bi-big bang
It's gettin' bigger by the second
Check it
Ok, I'm here to rock the tugboat and bid the elders farewell
I shook the buddy system wisdom 'til the similars repel
I sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwit syndicate jackals
I'm broken arrow to the fuckin' bone (broken poem)
I don't really believe in God
But God, I'm scared to death of God
I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans
Nor tear the pod
But it's like...
I hike an acre unimpressed and slept on the saber's edge
Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge
I wanna know myself
Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves
And still my shepherd can't administer
The proper push and pulls
I push the ghouls to man overboard
Pull the bulls onto my sword
And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor
Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar
Got a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over
The recipe's designed to plug the appetite for continuity
By stitching togetherness theme congruents (beautifully)
I peel back hearts and lodge greed physics in the chambers
Cauterize the wound and heads like
"Gimme gimme something major"
Road side prophetic, ascend well (well)
Enveloped in a mummy ribbon system
Blistering in a wishing well
