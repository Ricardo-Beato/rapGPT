63 ContributorsHyyerr Lyrics
Easy, ahh
This is Easy Sunday Morning
And we're right here on a beautiful morning
In Cleveland, Ohio, and it's chilly today
The kids are going to school, the grass is frosty
(This should be my) Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out
(Theme song) In the morning
(To life) Hello Cleveland
(Hahah) Yeah

A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
"Wonder what them folks on?" That's what they be askin'
Dumb kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga passin'
We gettin' to the cash and, you can see a nigga shinin'
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple, two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find him
'Less he out on the road ('Less he out on the road)
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just, pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
And free my scalp, I need to free my mind a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Don't really like sippin' cause I get to trippin'
My nigga, just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a little bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by 5-0
"Sir, you look high", I know, but I prefer my eyes low
You might also like
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high

Yeah, they say, "Easy friend"
There he go talkin' 'bout weed again
Probably cause of all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss
What a nigga tryna get you thinking 'bout
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff-puff-pass with your bitch-ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict, tragic, stay rolling up while reclining
I be looking down, see my Jesus piece shining
Good look, Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling, Jack
Let's go
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high25Embed
