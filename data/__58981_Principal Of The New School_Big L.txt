12 ContributorsPrincipal Of The New School Lyrics
I got the gift of gab to lift and grab
The mic and recite hype rhymes that’ll rip and rag and drag
A fag MC who likes to nag a lot and brag a lot
Talkin’ about the lyrics that he have are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle, troop
Rhymes I hook up, MC's I cook up like Campbell’s Soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you’ll get bust and dust and crushed
Bum rushed and all of that
Rhymes never sound whack ‘cause I got ‘em down pat
Your rulin’ time is over, so gimme yo' crown, jack
I get hype fast and MC's might last
A minute with me, because their rhymes are light as a feather
And mines are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick when I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MC's that tried to get wit’ me, hops
That’s why they all got tooken out like a Bensi box
The crown is still mine ‘cause I kick ill rhymes
A lotta rappers talk that murder shit and couldn’t kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I’m smoother than Vaseline
And I’m a stone cold rappin’ fiend
A lot of new jacks are comin’ out, but that’s cool
‘Cause I’m the principal of the new school
You might also like
I recite hype rhymes that shine like rainbows
I pick up the microphone and play MC's like game shows
And suckas are coppin’ pleas while I’m clockin’ G's
Try stoppin’ these lyrics, nigga, please!
'Cause my rhymes are ill like a kid with a bad cold
Your style is mad old, you’re small as a tadpole
This is a giant here, an MC rap pioneer
Before you battle me, chief, go throw on your riot gear
I’m hardcore, comin’ outta wars just barely bruised
Makin’ MC's go on strike like the daily news
But there aren’t gonna be any comebacks
Sayin’ them bum raps, your lyrics are dumb whack
I wreck shows and explode like a landmine
‘Cause L kicks the deadliest shit known to mankind
Front on me, you’ll be history like last week
‘Cause rappers be frontin’ hard and booty like ass cheeks
I’m hotter than Florida, I gets raw with a mic
Slammin’ niggas like the Ultimate Warrior
The subject, the predicate, L kicks better shit
Couldn’t get passed me if your homeboy set a pick
Try to play me out like a cub scout
Better get the fuck out my face or get placed in a casket
It’ll be a tragic incident, what a coincidence
My rhymes are infinite
Like math, and I go to work in a suit, fool
‘Cause I’m the principal of the new school
The lyrics that I’m kickin’ are like lethal weapons
Every time that I pick up a mic, I see you steppin’
‘Cause you want no parts of the L
Hear the sound of my voice, ya start bitin’ your fingernails
‘Cause you’re petro, and my lyrics are death so
Could you win a battle against me? Heck, no!
I just cruise and get smooth on the rap tip
Go ahead, bite my lyrics and get a fat lip
Or a broken jaw, you’ll get more than a beatin’, troop
Fuck around, you’ll be eatin’ soup
‘Cause I’m a brother who likes to party hard
Nice with my hands so I don’t need a bodyguard
MC's be walkin’ the streets just cold frontin’
Step to this and get beat like you stole somethin’
‘Cause I’m not the man to be stepped to
I won’t let you ruin my repu-tation
Across the whole nation
Rappers that be basin’, I’m choppin’ like Jason
I kick so much flavor, you should call me the flavor man
Here, take my autograph ‘cause you’re a major fan
Of the L, ‘cause you like the way I’m kickin’ flavor
Hot as a oven, but cool as a refrigerator
MC's be bitin’ my lyrics like a stone thief
Believe me, chief, you want no beef
So give those lyrics back to the right owner
Or get beat until ya fall in a coma
And physical contact, you don’t want that
So gimme what’s mine and there’ll be no harm, jack
‘Cause where I’m from, we don’t like that thief shit
And I’m the last rapper who you wanna beef wit’
‘Cause chumps I overrule
I’m invincible and the principal of the new school4Embed
