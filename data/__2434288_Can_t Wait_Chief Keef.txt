What did I say, yo?

You made me forget what I said
Aw man, I forget, aww man, I don't remember mine
Fuck back
Ayy

Fuck nigga can't wait
Can't wait to catch his ass and shoot him in his face
I can't wait (Boom), I can't wait (Gratarrah)
I can't wait to get that check today
Spent the other one yesterday (I can't), I can't wait
I get too much damn gwap

Bitch, look at my charm (Charm)
She couldn't wait to see it in person (Bling, bling, blow)

Pop a flat, now I'm rollin' and totin' (Gang gang, gang, gang)
Catch a opp, I'ma blow his fucking face (Let's get it, bih-buh-buh)

Pull off and we racing, ayy (Skrrt, skrrt)
Seen the cops, now they chasing us (Chasing us), ayy

Ask Republican, he know (Gang Front $treet)
Ask Nino, he know, ayy (Front $treet)
Ask Caper, he know, ayy (Front $treet)

Six Double O is what it was, what it is (Sosa)

Six kids, plus all you niggas, ayy (Almighty Sosa)
And these racks up in my jeans (Fuck these hoes, Sosa)
I got on Glo Gang, ayy (Gang gang)
Ayy, remember when I used to wear Aeropostale (Gang gang)
Remember when I couldn't even afford Hollister (Sellin' D on the block)
Now I'ma Rastafari (With that choppa) with the choppa
Get up off my song, Tadoe
'Fore I do you wrong, Tadoe (Grratarra)
Hit you with this 4, Tadoe (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
You made me drop my blunt, Tadoe, ayy
Pick it up, Tadoe, hoe
Get my mothafuckin' blunt up off the floor
'Fore I snooze your fucking neck and blow your throat (Bang)
