Yeezy, Hova, Yeezy
Yeezy Yeezy, Hova, hold up
You either love me or leave me alone
You either love me or leave me alone

Oh, they want me to fall (Fall)
Fall from the top (Top)
They want me to drop (Drop)
They want me to stop (Stop)
They want me to go (Go)
I'm already gone (Already)
The shit that I'm on (Hey)
I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home

Now one more 'gin

Oh (Oh), they want me to fall (Fall)

You might also like
These niggas want me to go, don’t they know that I'm gone
They know I'm space shuttle level, they need oxyg-g-g-gen
Don't they know that they boring? Don’t they know that I yawn?
Only time they exciting is when they mentioning Shawn
Seen Single White Female when she dyed her hair blonde?
Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them
Somebody turn these boys off, don't they know that I'm on
Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs
What the fuck are they Lauryn, they killing me softly
You talk me to death, only thing you do is talk
I open the door for them, what else can I do
These niggas want me to walk for them
Somebody talk to them before I go off on them

Oh, they want me to fall (Fall)
Fall from the top (Top)
They want me to drop (Drop)
They want me to stop (Stop)
They want me to go (Go)
I'm already gone (Already)
The shit that I'm on (Hey)
I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
I taught 'em 'bout fishscale, they want me to fish for them
They want me to catch clean then cook up a dish for them
All of this just for them or they got a diss for him
They want me to disappear like it's gon' shift for them
They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit for them
But what they admitting is they ain't got shit for him
And really the fact is, we not in the same bracket
Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets
Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches
So how am I in the way, what is it I'm missing?
Nigga I been missing, nigga I been gone
The shit that you just witnessing I been on
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it
Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it
Now these niggas is mad, oh, they call me a Camel
But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an animal
Half man half mammal, my sign is a Sag
This is just what I planned to do, oh, don't be mad

Oh, they want me to fall (Fall)
Fall from the top (Top)
They want me to drop (Drop)
They want me to stop (Stop)
They want me to go (Go)
I'm already gone (Already)
The shit that I'm on (Hey)
I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
I'm in The Hall already, on the wall already
I'm a work of art, I'm a Warhol already
On another level, on another plane already
H-O-V, I got my own lane, already (Already)
I done cooked up the rock already
So why the fuck can't y'all get hot already? (Already)
Put your name in the pot already
Niggas compare me to Biggie and Pac already (Already)
Like I'm gone already
And I am nigga I'm already home already (Already)
If y'all can't already see
I ain't worried about y'all 'cause I'm already me (Already)
Yeah, do you already, enough with the complaining
Boo-hoo's already, eat food already
Ain't nothing given you gotta claim your shoes already

Yeah, so in summation, I don't know who you racing
I'm already at the finish line with the flag waving
Come on

Oh, they want me to fall (Fall)
Fall from the top (Top)
They want me to drop (Drop)
They want me to stop (Stop)
They want me to go (Go)
I'm already gone (Already)
The shit that I'm on (Hey)

Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
