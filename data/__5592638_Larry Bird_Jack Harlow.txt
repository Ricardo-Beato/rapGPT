1 ContributorLarry Bird Lyrics
Yeah
Uh
Guess who?
Indeed

Okay, check one-two, the lyrical kung fu
Killin' these tracks every time I come through
Not just some dude I'm a mother lovin' beast
Ballin' on the mic like number thirty-three
Yeah, and I'm sure to be a legend
Keep on spittin' 'till they heard of me in heaven
Go the distance with no assistance
People all know that I'm so consistent
Yeah, and you're all getting slayed
Takin' down anybody sittin' in the way
Got no hops but I'm gettin' rebounds
And all you other rappers 'bout to get beat down

Yeah, Larry Bird
Anyway, I just wanna let everybody know
That in the next few, uh, weeks or months
I don't know when, I definitely got some kind of project coming out
Maybe a mixtape, I don't know
But, all these tracks you've been hearing, remixes, covers, of course a few tracks you haven't
They're all gonna come together
So I hope you download it
And if you know me, hope you get a copy, cause it's sure to be free
But then again, I don't even know what's gonna happen yet
So, stay tuned, cause I'll let you know
Anyway, for now, I'm out
Peace!
Bye-bye, JackYou might also likeEmbed
