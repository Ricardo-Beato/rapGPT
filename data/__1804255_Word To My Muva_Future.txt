Word to my muva, I'll bring that Rarri out
Word to my muva , nigga I'll cash out
Word to my muva, my nigga gonna sing sing
Word to my muva, my team'll let it ring ring
Word to my muva
Word to my muva nigga

Word to my muva nigga
Word to my muva nigga we'll buy this bitch
Word to my muva, I’m ridin' in a spaceship

Keep a bad yellow bitch like a nigga come from Brooklyn
Fuck what you hear pussy nigga get to hookin’
And I started getting money when I learn how to cook it
Where I’m from if you ain't got a set then you tooken
Go and cashout on the lamb fuck it cop the Rari
Finesse you out the cash forget to tell you sorry
Pluto when I’m talking Im at the moon
This the satellite edition don’t make me call my goons
A thousand on your head make a nigga do some damage
Young nigga  team walk around with the cannon
Called up future like god what it do whats happening
For the the freebands nigga i let it go until its jammin’

Word to my muva chubby baby bout to kill this shit
Quarter mill easy, I spent it at the dealership
Banana clip on the chopper dog, thats guerilla shit
Three boost phones at the table
Thats that dealer shit
Started getting money when I learned how to deal this shit where the keys at the the whip? I’m  bout to peel this shit
Chub Papi, I’m bout to cash out
Now I’m in magic city, bitches got they ass out
Esco bring them records back, watch them haters pass out try me for my jewelry , wrong move, blast out 
My atlanta boys know chubby got the check
So pay me like a pussy, and you gon' hit the deck

Word to my muva, I’m ridin' in a spaceship

I got shooters on my side like the real 50 cent
Keep a ratchet in the sun roof dope all in the vent
I’m a freeband nigga, I could pay a bitch rent
I could 20 bands on me walk around the bitch stiff
Boss bitches on a nigga line like a operator
Heard that future running around the city with the calculator
If you ain’t heard been playing with the mash potatoes
Young nigga do yo ass in on a Future favor
Celery & pies got me living in the sky loft
Stash couple hundred come through with your top off
Future Frank White mad love go to New York
But every nigga round here ? and pissed off
Word to my muva, I'll bring that Rarri out
Word to my muva, nigga I'll cash out
Word to my muva, my nigga gonna sing sing
Word to my muva, my team'll let it ring ring
Word to my muva

Word to my muva  nigga we'll buy this bitch
