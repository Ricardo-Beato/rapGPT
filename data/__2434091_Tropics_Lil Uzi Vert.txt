15 ContributorsTropics Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I met a bitch in the tropics
And she be gone off the molly
She suck my dick super sloppy
I had to tell me somebody
I met a bitch in the tropics
And she be gone off the molly
She suck my dick super sloppy
I had to tell me somebody

I met a bitch in the tropics
She super thick in the body
I had to call up my hombre
I had to tell me somebody
I swear that bitch must be crazy
If she might think she my lady
I swear that bitch ain't my baby
I will not buy her Mercedes
They see Uzi got the money
The bitches scream come save me

I met a bitch in the tropics
And she be gone off the molly
She suck my dick super sloppy
I had to tell me somebody
I met a bitch in the tropics
And she be gone off the molly
She suck my dick super sloppy
I had to tell me somebody

Boy my pockets hella swole
Cause I got the bankroll
Balmain pockets hella swole
Cause I got the bankroll
Your bank account on zero
Your bitch look at me like a hero
Tropic foreign bitches
Tropic foreign bitches
And I'm getting money
Tropic foreign digits
I tell the truth
I tell the truth
All I got is tropics

I met a bitch in the tropics
And she be gone off the molly
She suck my dick super sloppy
I had to tell me somebody
I met a bitch in the tropics
And she be gone off the molly
She suck my dick super sloppy
I had to tell me somebody1Embed
