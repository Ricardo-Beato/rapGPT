Yeah, test, test, yeah
I might spend a week, I might–
Yo

I might spend a week at the Magic Castle
Presidential suite made of brass and alabaster
You can cast a spell, just backfires they satire
My guyzer's and I just watching from high rises
Weird luck 'cause when we fail, we only fail up
I tear up every time I see a mail truck
Know that check comin' five-hundred a piece, smoothly
Ayo, that shit behooves me
They need to bring back beheadings
Guillotines for guys, get whacked likе medieval times, thеy not ready
What we touch, leave everything dead-y
For tryna stop us, you can't, like my man said

We havin' motion, we havin' motion, we havin' motion
And y'all ain't havin' no motion, no motion, no motion
Me and Hit, we havin' motion, havin' motion, havin' motion
And y'all ain't havin' no motion, it's all over, like when the show end
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Best friends chill by the pool, they bellydancing
Lampin', throwback sweatsuits from Grambling
Maybach trucks, breaking bad like Bryan Cranston
Black and white Nike Dunks, them clean Pandas
You might also like
Dump the ashes in the ocean, get the sharks high
All black yacht, we made it from the hard times
In any era, Rivieras is my backdrop
Hacienda interchangeable, mad spots
Rollin' dice, shirts like Miami Vice
The women, they wear the scent that seduce with embroidered ice
The flesh a vessel, I'm not obsessed with death
I manifest what's best, I'm ghetto tested, bless
I'm havin' motion like an eighteen-wheeler out on a turnpike
My worst night a motion picture, Fox Searchlight, three-wheel motion
West Coast shit, nigga overdoses, imperial pistols, ferocious
Explosive, East Coast shit
Motion like Flavor Flav in that "I Ain't No Joke" vid
And I ain't gotta say a word 'cause they know
I see Anchorage out in Turks & Caicos
Maybe they too angry, that's why they don't got motion

We havin' motion, we havin' motion, we havin' motion
And y'all ain't havin' no motion, no motion, no motion
Me and Hit, we havin' motion, havin' motion, havin' motion
And y'all ain't havin' no motion, it's all over, like when the show end
Best friends chill by the pool, they bellydancing
Lampin', throwback sweatsuits from Grambling
Maybach trucks, breaking bad like Bryan Cranston
Black and white Nike Dunks, them clean Pandas
Break your spell
Break your spell,  break your spell
Break, break, break your spell
Break your–, break, break your spell
Break, break, break2Embed
