Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Say peace, we don't really want no trouble
Tell me, is you down with the struggle?
All they really wanna do is cuff ya
They don't love ya (No)
Say peace, we don't really want no trouble
Tell me, is you down with the struggle?
All they really wanna do is cuff you
They don't love you (No)

Starin' into the darkness like Marcus
Garvey, I'm an artist, respect to the goddess
Somе say I'm too modest because I'm thе hardest
On this path to progress, there's been carnage
Regardless, this is a harvest for the world to harness
Elder's dreams, creator's promise
Bein' free is like payin' homage
I've been on that peace, black Dalai Lama
My college was between Stony and Cottage
The knowledge, I got it because niggas was 'bout it
Knew I had to pull it, the bullet or the ballot
It's like the parable of the story of the talents
Want my people to get paper, with no margin
Turnin' ghettos to gardens like Ron Finley
Through stages of life, the world's my Wembley
I emcee, from the point of entry
Of peace (Peace) some find it all through their paper routin'
And some find they peace, they peace through praise and shoutin'
And some find they peace through pullin' the shades like Malcolm
I found my peace, my peace makin' these albums, peace
You might also like
Say peace, we don't really want no trouble
Tell me, is you down with the struggle?
All they really wanna do is cuff you
They don't love you (No)
Say peace, we don't really want no trouble
Tell me, is you down with the struggle?
All they really wanna do is cuff you
They don't love you (No)

In dystopia, ground zero from xenophobia
They love to trope me or misquote me, they even wrote me
Out of all accounts other than shoulderin' small amounts
'Til I called them out, I'm what the story is all about
My arrival wasn't willingly, nah, but that's chillingly
The truth, now I fear from shots from cops killin' me
They on the hunt for the plug, and we the auxiliary
The Black power and love, I'm all the above
We'll find peace in the culture I'm responsible to save
And every piece of the puzzle, every article, the page
I'm at peace in the struggle, I'm awake and not afraid
While I'm channelin' my energy from particle to wave
The peace, like Mandela seated on Robben Island
Wise like a prophet arrivin' from the highlands
Look, I'm not here for any kind of problem
Keep me out of your gossip column
Thank you, I'm calm and tranquil at the time and place too
I shine, word to God, I'm divine and graceful
The grind could break you, if you concentrate
You could find your faith where the higher conscious takes you
That's peace
Say peace, we don't really want no trouble
Tell me, is you down with the struggle?
All they really wanna do is cuff you
They don't love you (No)
Say peace, we don't really want no trouble
Tell me, is you down with the struggle?
All they really wanna do is cuff you
They don't love you (No)

Say we done lost
We say we dey pon the right path
Big life only
Liberty, freedom, you hear me?
Tell me what they fightin' for?
(The people under pressure, murderer)
Tell me what they fightin' for?
(The bigsta and the youngsta, murderer)
Tell me what they fightin' for?
(All of ya mother and father, murderer)
Tell me what they fightin' for? (Me!)
Tell me what, what they fightin' for?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!)Embed
