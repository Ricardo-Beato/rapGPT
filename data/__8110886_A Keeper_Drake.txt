Okay, okay
Okay, okay
I found a new muse
That's bad news for you
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep?

Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep?

Yeah, woah, yeah
And I wrote, licks I hit on my ones when I didn't have no friends to ride
Sticks on my dawgs, and I can't even lie to you
Got too much pride for you
Gotta stay safe in these streets
Streets don't play favorites, though
I'm not afraid of it though
God is okay with me, so
Life of that shade that you throw
I've seen you take it low
Limbo right under that ho
Fuck out my face

I found a new muse
That's bad news for you
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep?
I found a new muse
That's bad news for you
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep?

Once is a lot of things
Twice is a decision
Told me a lot of things
Forced into submission, got you Mercedеs-Benz
But that don't make you driven
Thеn what can I do for you? How can I make a difference?
Friendship and loyalty, that's not what it's giving
Given that, why would I keep you around?

Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep?
Okay, okay
Okay, okay4Embed
