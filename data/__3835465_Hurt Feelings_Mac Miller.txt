Well, okay

I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
Everything is strange (Strange), that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

A—a'ight, a'ight
I paid the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine (Yeah,) keep to myself, takin' my time (Uh-huh)
Always into some bullshit, and outta line
Drivin' with my eyes closed, missin' all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty (Pretty)
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Man on a mission, figure it out
Puttin' way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down (Down, down)
I keep my head above the water (Water)
My eyes gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller (Smaller)
I be gettin' richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the P.A. when I pull up (Pull up), soundin' like a concert
Or a (or a), or a monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm fallin' up
Always said I want it all, but it's not enough
Well, o-kay (Yeah)

I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
And everything is strange (Strange), that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)

We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
'Cause it’s only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (Hurt) feelings (Feelings)

Down go the system, long live the king (King)
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring (Spring)
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy (Yeah)
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I'd forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm livin' I'm a little obsessed, yes
High in Jacuzzis, I be hittin' the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex (Bless, bless)
Respect to Adonai
Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride, why you lyin'?
(Why you lyin'?) Tell the truth, just step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains
New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
And everything is strange (Strange), that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)
