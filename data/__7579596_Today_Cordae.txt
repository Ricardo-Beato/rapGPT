Hold on, uh

I don't got the time today
Money on my mind, nigga, I got to grind today
Get that shit andale
Told my brothers, "You ain't gotta worry, I'ma find a way"
Shit gon' line in place
Hopped off the porch too early what my mama say
My card ain't decline today
Sun gon' shine, nigga, sun gon' shine today

I remember them cold nights
Ninth grade, Chief Keef first dropped "Don't Like"
Why the time had to go by?
Eatin' free lunch at the school, used to roll dice
I remember I ain't have shit (I ain't have it)
I was broke as fuck, put that shit in the past tense (Nah, for real)
Check out my Jag' tints (For real)
Had to boss up, nigga can't live averagе
How the fuck niggas still broke? (What the fuck?)
Put it on my mеn, nigga, put it on my lil' bros
Need a Brazil ho
2003, my cousin taught me how to heel toe
Swear I ain't dance since (For real)
Shit going up, nigga, watch how I transcend
Don't need no damn friends (Hi Level)
Rap shit for grabs and I swear it's getting rampant
You might also like
I don't got the time today
Money on my mind, nigga, I got to grind today
Get that shit andale
Told my brothers, "You ain't gotta worry, I'ma find a way"
Shit gon' line in place
Hopped off the porch too early what my mama say
My card ain't decline today
Sun gon' shine, nigga, sun gon' shine today
I don't got the time today
Money on my mind, nigga, I got to grind today
Get that shit andale
Told my brothers, "You ain't gotta worry, I'ma find a way"
Shit gon' line in place
Hopped off the porch too early what my mama say
My card ain't decline today
Sun gon' shine, nigga, sun gon' shine today

Yeah, sun gon' shine today
Ain't no kids cryin' today
He done waste his time, too late
I see he tryna contemplate
Mansion with a top-notch Playboy Bunny lookin' bitch, see-through lingerie
Mm, I could pay a crumb for play
Might bust a few rhymes today
Mm, mm, hey, hey
Spinnin' it like you tryna race, hey
Mm, drippin' feng shui, yeah
Singin' to 'em like Sade, yeah
Mm, money every Monday
Drinkin' holy water, givin' praise to God like Kanye
Had to take the harder way
Now I'm doing shows, rockin' New Zealand, me and Cordae
Back in Australia, mate
I done paved a wave, even left them a trail to trace
Police tryna build a case
I'm just thankin' God I ain't stressin' 'bout bills to pay
I ain't havin' nothin' bad to say
Bank account loaded, got a half a mil' cash in the safe
We was gettin' it way back in the day
Now we in the big body Maybach takin' up space
I don't got the time today
Money on my mind, nigga, I got to grind today
Get that shit andale
Told my brothers, "You ain't gotta worry, I'ma find a way"
Shit gon' line in place
Hopped off the porch too early what my mama say
My card ain't decline today
Sun gon' shine, nigga, sun gon' shine today4Embed
