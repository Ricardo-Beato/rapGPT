12 ContributorsDrown Lyrics
I knew that I couldn't survive without you by my side
But I'm alive
I thought that it was more than a tattoo
Try not to get caught in the classroom
Tomorrow morning while the galaxy is forming
I'ma find a box of stories
Buried in the garden underneath the pouring rain
Never seen the storm before it came
Find the strength to forgive my jinx
Swim the length of the kitchen sink
Freedom of speech don't mean what you think
Hold that thought I'm 'bout to close the ink
Y'all know I never gave a frozen shit
I'm just trying to keep my head above the hopelessness
They wanna blow some kisses at the showmanship
Until they poking at your legacy with broken sticks

Yeah, I think I'm going down
Don't know what to do, I'ma drown
With you
With you, yeah
Yeah, I think I'm going down
Don't know what to do, I'ma drown
With you
With you, yeah

Ugh, here we go
I’m trying to be peaceful
Keep on clashing with your ego
No logic or reason when speaking your piece in disagreements tell me what you’re really thinking when you’re drinking or when it gets heated
Say that you don’t mean it I heard that before I don’t believe you listen to people they’ll tell you everything in how they treat you
View kindness as weakness
Say you don’t need me
Hard to let go but I’m leaving
Face what’s right not what is easy
Give the very least, that’s exactly what you’ll receive
What you see’s a reflection of what you think and perceive
Don’t make a promise you can’t keep or keep what needs to be released, repeat the things that you should change your hands ain’t clean can’t point the blame
No, you can’t stay
You can’t just take, reciprocate make an exchange
I’m lighting sage to cleanse the space
Getting that bad energy up off of me
Replace with inner peace
Fools gold you sold exposed enemies with false identities
You’re no friend to me so don’t pretend to be

Yeah, I think I'm going down
Don't know what to do, I'ma drown
With you
With you, yeah
Yeah, I think I'm going down
Don't know what to do, I'ma drown
With you
With you, yeah
I been let down before, laying against this wall
Ain't no use in crying
When I'm sober I drink, always up when I sink
In a coma, I'm blinking
And in my own mistakes
Lay in my bed and rest, ain't no use in trying
When I'm shocked I won't shoot
Don't know what, they're trying to hurt me
Love me then desert me
Don't give me your mercy
Feel like my flesh burning
So let's start a fire
Goes on every hour
They trying to drown me
Feel like I am falling (falling, falling, falling, falling, falling)Embed
