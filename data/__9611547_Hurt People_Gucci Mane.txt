6 ContributorsHurt People Lyrics
I know there's a lot of folks dealing with a lot
It's been one hell of a last two years
(Once again, I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit)

Hurt people hurt people
Hurt people hurt people (Facts)
Let's examine the fact why people hurt people
Poor, rich or white or Black, all share this Earth, people (Well, damn)
Hurt people hurt people
Hurt people hurt people (Facts)
Let's examine the fact why people hurt people
'Cause they hurt, so they hurt people (Go)

I'm thinking 'bout the words, I had to search, people (The right ones)
Let's talk about how hurt people hurt people (Even your day ones)
Some put 'em in the dirt, I mean they murk people
So sad to see your homeboy on a shirt, people (Damn)
I pray one day we all know gon' know our worth, people (Lord)
Our curse, we Black, so it started from birth, people
I heard this lady killed her husband, he wasn't sleeping with her (Woah)
But her pops had left her mom, she been had daddy issues (Damn)
Saw my partner shoot his brother over a couple dollars (Bruh)
It gets deep 'cause they grew up without no fucking father (Sad)
My daddy loved me, but didn't love me like that fucking bottle
I watched my mama fight her sisters, I was just a toddler (Mom)

They say that hurt people hurt people, well, I'm the fucking model (True)
Them niggas robbed me a couple times, then I turned to the robber (Woo)
I had to look straight in the mirror and say, "I'm the problem" (You)
Life kept giving me tests, I didn't even know how to solve them (Well, damn)
I damn near went completely numb, I wasn't even feeling shit (No)
I had a lot of pent up trauma I wasn't dealing with
Self medicating, a pint a day leads to an early death
Oh, that's the Wop y'all want? Well, hope that y'all don't hold y'all breath
The shit I said and did, I'm grown, I had to blame myself
Now there's no one to blame 'cause I'm the only one that's left (Myself)
A nigga tried to claim my body just to gain a rep
But he's so hurt and desperate, really, that's a cry for help (Help)
