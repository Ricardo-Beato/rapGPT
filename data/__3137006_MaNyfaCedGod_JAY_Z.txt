Yeah, uh
Vacay the pain away, uh
Smoking the pain away, uh
Drinking the–uh

Look at all we been through since last August
Skating through the rumors like, "Aw, shit!"
Still came back, fucked up the red carpet
Shows how big your heart is
On the Run, we took a hundred together
More than the money, it was the fact that we done it together
Uh, healing in real time
Song Cry to Resentment, that was real crying
Bonnie and Clyde things, we hold it down
Had we surrendered then, that'd be the real crime
Got through it, got blessed times two with it
New Bel-Air estates with four pools in it
I told my bro, "You gotta go home," over vino
Goodfella, don't gamble with your life, this ain't Casino
Cost him two mill' plus the child support
We'll get the money back, but not the child support
It's getting too late, we can't afford mistakes
Woulda broke me down had you got away
It woulda broke me up, you took my child away
I'm glad we found a way
Sexin' the pain away
Vacay the pain away
Drinking the pain away
Smoking the pain away

Too perfect not to wonder (yeah)
If we created a flame that would warm us 'til it’s over
We invented lovers from company for the summer
I was many faces, but at least I was willing to change
I was worried that the way I was would end me up alone
Shit feels so beautiful, don't you agree?
I was worried that the way I was would end me up alone


Our external reality is an opportunity to heal our internal upset
Let's build a cathedral these evils couldn't fuck with
I wanna spend my Saturdays and my latter-days
Eating sundaes and enjoying Mondays
Not worrying about what none say

Yoncé, all on this mouth like liquor
Uh, that my nigga, uh, that my nigga
Over everything, each of our mood swings
Whenever attitudes change, like a mood ring
Ain't nothing like somebody that get ya, baby, I get ya
Let's go through this thing, come out stronger, the golden journey
Broken is better than new, that's kintsukuroi
You're fine china, I'm a bull and ball in a china shop
I promise to repair with gold each bowl I drop
Be grateful for whatever comes because each has been sent
From a guy from beyond, that's what Rumi say
"Never go to bed mad," that's what my Ummi say
It always took her less to say more
I always thought she was an angel, now I'm sure, sure7Embed
