How's your son?
(All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
He made the team this year?
Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Ma', we here, we gon' cook this Sunday, okay? So come by
Damn, that's your new girlfriend?

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet, like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yo, you heard the track I did, man? "This Can't Be Life"
Somebody please say grace, so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it, why the guard had to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh, who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
You might also like
And I don't care about (All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all, all, tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Now, all I know, I know all these things

Yeah, this is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like, "See! That's my cousin on TV!"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it, and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together, be Electric Slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw, naw, don't open the photobook up
I got a Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday, nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at they crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousin
Fit three in the bed if it's six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
Rain, rain, rain, go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say (Uh)
Rain, rain, rain, go away (Yeah)
Let the sun come out and all the children say (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi' is my family, dawg
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dawg
I feel like, one day, you'll understand me, dawg
You can still love your man and be manly, dawg
You ain't gotta get heated at every housewarmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
Second she storm out, then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business, uh

(All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
And I don't care about (All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing (All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold (All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
And all I know, I know all these things
All these things
CLK Mercedes Benz
All these things
A whole lotta money
All these things
Mommy and Daddy, can you please stop fighting?
All these things (And I don't care about)
All these things
