Oh, oh, oh
It don't hurt as bad as it used to
Yeah, I like that
Freestyling to it

It don't hurt as bad as it used to
I admit girl, yeah, I just use you
I admit this not what I'm used to
Ike Turner, but I'd never abuse you
Woah, my last girl left me cold
Like frozen in the snow
She already knows
It's hard for me to let go

I been drinkin' and drivin' and survivin'
Take my sorrow and bury me alive in it
Wear your best dress, girl, 'cause you gon' die in it
Bet you regret the day that you lied in it
Crashed the car again, goddamn
Break my heart again, goddamn
I don't have no friends, goddamn
I'm alone until the end, goddamn
Crashed the car again, goddamn
Break my heart again, goddamn
I don't have no friends, goddamn
I'm alone until the end, goddamn
