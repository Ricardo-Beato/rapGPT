Aye aye, aye aye, gang aye, bang aye
Hold on, aye, hold on, bang bang

Came out the house, forgot my belt ayy, pants steady fallin' ayy
They like damn Sosa ayy, how you steady ballin' ayy ?
The money keep coming (comin') , the leaves keep fallin' ayy
And I keep spending and people keep talkin'
We bought FNs, 'cause we don't need folks
Hoes love drivin', we don't be in parties
Been a King Diamond, but I never been a follower
I been seen your shoes, but I ain't even comment
We’ll drop em like an iPhone, I ain’t did it I was airbourne ayy ayy
They can’t catch me bitch I’m Jason Bourne (Yo)
I want a Sandwich bitch go make me one (bitch go make me one)
Pass me the gushers (kush), I'm in the lamb truck, I'm in it gettin sucked up (skrt skrt skrt)
If you a bitch go get some butt shots, my bitch just went and got some, I seen 'em and said what the fuck ? (what the fuck ?)
Hop out the car, like what is up ?
If you did time, you prolly be in that bitch gettin' supper up (supper up)
Gettin that cashew like ah peanut
In S E A T, like a seahorse ayy ayy ayy
Leave your block with 3 corpse
Somehow I ain't been to church, but I been to court
We got rackets, like a tennis court
Bitch we been drillin', bitch it's been a sport ayy
SVJ it’s the Aventador
You might see me ridin' with your bitch in one ayy
You know when she see us she gon get in one
I can ride through a blizzerd 'cause my wrist is one
You might also like
Aye aye wooh wooh wooh aye
Aye aye bang aye aye bang bang aye aye
Dududuh wooh wooh dududuh dududuh

It's on the way, bitch looking at us? let her look (let her look nigga)
She be tellin' that bitch she better look (she better look)
They can't catch me I'm perry the platypus (perry the platypus)
Bitch I'm stuck, I'm off this canibus (off that dope)
Baby I need a double deck a bus ayy
My shorty nem seving like a restaurant ayy (bitch)
You ain't never let a fiend test one (skrt skrt skrt)
They can't catch me like I'm home alone (bang ayy ayy)
He finna be quite up he on the phone (shh)
Baby got cab ain't hard to ride alone (ride alone)
They wanna switch numbers but I told em I ain't got a phone (I ain't got no phone)
They tryna hit my blunt I said I get high alone (I get high alone nigga)
I know you a lil nigga, go buy a zone (go buy a zone nigga)
She know I'm a dog I'm tryna bone (I'm tryna bone ayy)
She asked me her name I got it wrong (and I got it wrong ayy)

Aye aye ayeEmbed
