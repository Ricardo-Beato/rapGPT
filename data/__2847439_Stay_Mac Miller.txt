Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, yeah

Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
Just a little while (Stay), just a little while, just a little while
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
Said, just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

Yeah, hold up, wait a motherfuckin' second (Wait a second)
I know you stressin', you don't gotta keep me guessin' (Keep me guessin')
I'm full of questions, in return I get the silent treatment (Shh)
I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say it's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'? (Oh my God)
I could have a whole collection, just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated, I swear that pussy Grammy nominated
Let's make some music, fuck all of the bullshit
You might also like
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
(Will you stay)
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
(Just a little while, babe?)
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
(Will you stay)
Said, just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
(Just a little while, babe?)

Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'ma go crazy, girl, you save me, meditate me, give me peace of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high, lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between the lines
Binge watched Sopranos, made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come to see her freaky side, leavin' me behind

Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
(Will you stay)
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
(Just a little while, babe)
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
(Will you stay)
Said, just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
(Just a little while, babe?)
Just a little while, just a little while, babe?

The way you walk in to the room, ooh-ooh (Woo)
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more (Hell no)
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go? (Go, go, go)
Yeah, girl, the way you walk in to the room, ooh-ooh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more (Hell no)
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go, girl?

Will you stay
Just a little while, babe? (Just a little while longer)
Just a little while, just a little while (Just a little bit longer, baby)
Just a little while
Will you (The way you walk in to the room, ooh-ooh)
Stay (All I think about is what I wanna do to you)
Just a little while, babe? (I don't wanna be polite no more)
Said, just a little while (Make yourself at home)
Just a little while (Where the fuck you gon' go)
Just a, just a little while (Girl?)
Will you (The way you walk in to the room, ooh-ooh)
Stay (All I think about is what I wanna do to you)
Just a little while, babe? (I don't wanna be polite no more)
Said, just a little while (Make yourself at home)
Just a little while (Where the fuck you gon' go)
Just a, just a little while (Girl?)
Will (Will) you (Will you) stay (Stay)
Just a little while, babe? (Just a little while longer)
Just a little while (Woah-woah, woah-woah-woah, woah)
Just a little while, just a, just a little while
Will you...
Will you...
Will you...
Yeah, daddy
Oh yeah, right there
Oh my God!33Embed
