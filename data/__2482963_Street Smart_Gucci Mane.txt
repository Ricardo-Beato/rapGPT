15 ContributorsStreet Smart Lyrics
Yeah, street smart entertainment
So Icey Entertainment, street smart nigga dawg
Real talk, that's real spit trap money on deck man OJ 

I was in the junior high with a bub of mids dawg
Like a money or an eight then I got some big balls
Got a pound of mid-grade sitting on my front seat
Put a seat belt on it ride HOV
I'm a hot young nigga I'm H O T
Street smart young nigga no phd
 the fifty-sixty-three little shawty that's me
Fifty for one-five three for a qp
Light off the cab mall baby I'm the best out here
In a drop  cause prices get high
In the school of hard knocks niggas selling hard rocks
Kinder gardeners go to school weed in their lunchbox
See I'm not a role model shawty cook that work
Peer pressure young nigga come and hit this purp, yeah
I got a trick up my sleeve got a five gram plate
Quarter brick up my sleeve

I'm a nigga from the hood can't read real good
But I can sell dope good I can sell weed good
Didn't listen to my mama or the goddamn preacher
On the low I got more money than the goddamn teacher
I'm a street smart nigga didn't read no books
Didn't take home economics but I sure can cook
Eighteen for a whole, nine-five for a half
Were good at English but great at math
You might also like
I got work for a worker I got purp for a smoker
I'm not a goddamn role model I'm a motherfucking hustler
My name rang bells in the street cause I'm a G
And if you didn't know nigga you should have asked about me
My clientele on the  all the way to Boulder crest
I'm a real street nigga, I ain't lying I'm a vet
Nigga ever disrespect Ima put it in his neck
Six shots for zone six Ima show them who the best
Nigga should have wore his vest I don't know why he didn't
Perpetrating like it hard, nigga must have thought i was tripping
Nigga I ain't ever slipping I'm ready like Rambo
Ammunition long like the trees that you hang from
Nigga what you came for how can I explain for
Riding in something new yeah i got my brain blown
Yeah I like my beat low, how you like your work fool
Hard or the whipped shit, nigga it ain't even matter though

I'm a nigga from the hood can't read real good
But I can sell dope good I can sell weed good
Didn't listen to my mama or the goddamn preacher
On the low I got more money than the goddamn teacher
I'm a street smart nigga didn't read no books
Didn't take home economics but I sure can cook
Eighteen for a whole, nine-five for a half
Were good at English but great at math
They call me young Juice, I am the damn truth
I'm ice water whipping dawg what about you?
Nine  cars fruit loop chains
Stupid, stupid colors in my pinky ring
I'm not a role model I'm working with them things
Street smart dawg and I can get it on planes
Dropped out of school when I bought my first thing
Eleven fucking grade and it was ninety-nine mane
Now several years later I'm that nigga in the tall 
Ima crush their feelings when I pull out the 
Now their feelings are all hurt, cause I'm rocking Prada shoes
On the block with Gucci Mane y'all niggas ain't hear the news
Neimen Marcus where I'm going shopping buying designer shoes
If you  the work boss dammit I'll fire you
But if your real street smart nigga I'll hire you
Young juice man goddammit I'm fly too

I'm a nigga from the hood can't read real good
But I can sell dope good I can sell weed good
Didn't listen to my mama or the goddamn preacher
On the low I got more money than the goddamn teacher
I'm a street smart nigga didn't read no books
Didn't take home economics but I sure can cook
Eighteen for a whole, nine-five for a half
Were good at English but great at math
