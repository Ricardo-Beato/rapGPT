5 ContributorsRagtime Lyrics
I, woke up this morning got ready to roll
Put on my green bomber it was, freezing cold
Applied long johns with Adidas not matching
I called up Jam Master 'cause I knew he was scratching
(What up?) Jay to the telly music, loud as hell
He said, "Hold up Run, (ding-dong) it's the bell!"
Jay to the door as he leaves the cut
For his eyes a surprise, "D.M.C. whats up?"

I need a little help Jay, I got a little problem
A guy like yourself, maybe you can help me solve 'em
I only want to know why this happens all the time (What?)
Everywhere I go, I start to rap and rhyme
I rock them in the day (Yeah you rock 'em every night)
I rock em when I left so def I knew something was wrong (Alright)
I rhyme when I am sleeping, I rhyme when I'm awake
When I was nine I said a rhyme by putting candles on my cake

I just came from the bank (You said a rhyme?) a rhyme so funny
A song about the line so long they all gave me their money
That's why I came to you, you're my friend (Yes that is true)
Said maybe Jay knows what to say, he'll tell me what to do
Hm, yo you go get Joe, and all the rhymes you made
And we'll go to the bank, and we call get paid!

Cruisin down the block, in the sixty-six Olds
Girls are on the jock like the ride was a Rolls
Feelin' kinda great, got change for the toll
Suckers gotta wait, that's your fate, poor soul
Heard you on the records and I heard you on the tapes
Stop! Switch the conversation over to grapes, because
You're not bustin' none, so stop fussin' son
You're not down with Rush, they call us Russ and Run
Since that's the company, you won't be chumpin' me
Here's the man, ask that fan (Run big brother D!)1Embed
