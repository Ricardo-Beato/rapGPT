9 ContributorsIâ€™m Too Much Lyrics
I talk tough, I'm too damn rough
I call your boyfriend's bluff
You can't beat me, like Kobe come through in the clutch
If you look out once or blink your eye, I'll pack two
Shakin' baby syndrome, I got these rappers so shook
My pops wasn't 'round, but least he gave me good looks
Drop head Phantom, the top down, my rims up
I got cash on me, a nigga stash for me
So I don't need your weed, I got a line on tweed
I got a plug on Ps, I got a plug on lean
I got a Colt 15, I got an M16
I got a bullshit charge, that bitch that lied on me
Tattoos on my face card cause I don't want no job

I'm too much, I talk trash, bitches say I'm stuck up
I don't give a damn, you got me fucked up
Bitch can get past me cause she lucked up
Let her have a baby by Wop, she lucked up
I talk trash, bitches say I'm stuck up
I don't give a damn, you got me fucked up
Bitch can get past me cause she lucked up
Let her have a baby by Wop, she lucked up

Kush smells like root beer, my career just hit 5th gear
Now I make you bitches, haters disappear
I only made 4 million last year
30K a day, diamonds on display
Ridin' in somethin' I can't pronounce
Put a trampoline in my backyard
Just to watch them titties bounce
My rubies rocky and rounded
You are at home, grounded
I might install a Versace money counter
Next to my codeine fountain
They say all I talk about is money
That's all that I think about
I have no idea who you are
My front yard has bodyguards
RiFF!

I'm too much, I talk trash, bitches say I'm stuck up
I don't give a damn, you got me fucked up
Bitch can get past me cause she lucked up
Let her have a baby by Wop, she lucked up
I talk trash, bitches say I'm stuck up
I don't give a damn, you got me fucked up
Bitch can get past me cause she lucked up
Let her have a baby by Wop, she lucked up2Embed
