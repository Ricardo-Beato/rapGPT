Buddah bless this beat
That's a fool, nah
Yeah, trap shit
No, no, no, no, no, no

Up early in the morning trappin' (Trap-trap)
You can get 'em how you askin' (Ask)
How many chickens? You can get 'em whichever way
Nigga, trap turned Zaxby's (Zax)
I beat the pot with a passion (Beat it up)
A hundred acres on the mansion
I dab in the latest fashion (Eat it up)
Bitches need a call castin' (Yeah)

Name a nigga with the pack (Pack)
Name a nigga with the sack (Sack)
Elem' o'clock, I got the MAC (MAC)
She eat the molly like a snack (Eat it up)
This gold on my neck a plaque (Plaque)

Want a nickel, that's a five (Yeah)
One to fly, one to slide
One to glide, ain't got time (Yeah)
