6 ContributorsOne Minute Man Lyrics
Don't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance, be a man, take my hand, understand
I don't want no minute man

Boy, I'ma make you love me, make you want me
And I'ma give you some attention tonight (Shut up)
Now follow my intuitions, what you're wishin'
See I'ma keep you up all night (All night), for a long time, so start countin' away

Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no—

Tonight I'ma give it to you, throw it to you
I want you to comе prepared, oh, yeah (Oh, yеs)
Boy, it's been a long time, a crazy long time
And I don't want no minute man and that's real, give it to me some more
You might also like
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no— (Yeah, uh, uh)

It's time to set your clock back 'bout as long as you can
I stop daylight, it's Ludacris, the maintenance man
Get your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission
You one minute fools, you wonder why y'all missin'
On the back of milk cartons and there's no reward
No regards, close, but it's no cigar
A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last
I jump in pools and make a big splash
Water overflowin', so get your head right
It's all in your mind, punk, so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs
I'm big dog, havin' women seein' stripes and thangs
They go to sleep, start snorin', countin' sheep and shit
They so wet that they body start to leak and shit
Just 'cause I'm a all-nighter, shoot all fire
Ludacris, balance and rotate all tires
Ooh, I don't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance, be a man take my hand, understand
I don't want no minute man

Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Br— Br— Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Br— Br— Break me off, break— break me off, break— break me off
Show me what you got
Break me off, show me what you got
Break me off, show me what you got
Br— Br— Break me off, show me what you got
Break me off, break— break me offEmbed
