5 ContributorsNeon Lyrics
Yeeeaaahhh, yeeeeaaahhh
Baaang, bang

Yaah, yaaah (brrr, brrr) avalanche
We got on scarves, Taliban
We got the beach, just bring the sand
I make bitches fly, like peter pan
Don't hold it in, don't keep it in
She wanna smoke the reefa and
Off too many blunts I can see the wind
The car go fast just like a cheetah
Im from the boat just like Aaliyah
This bitch send nudes, she all the way in Sweden
She know we Glow just like some Neons

Gotta be fool, a fool, a fool
We got nothing to prove
I'm too cool
Baby I'm too slick like some luzips
I'm with my tool, I need some food
Bitch said boy you rude
Who you talkin' to ?
Shawty know that I'm Bossanova
Told her come here and shе walking over
She like thе player in me, she like the player in me, she like the player in me
She said she wanna go out and hit a fair with me
She ain't telling law none, she'll swear for me
Smellin' like the weed inside my property
I’m smoking broccoli, I’m smoking broccoli
I get aggravated, like a robbery
I was born with gorillas, I can climb the tree
I was born with Lynx cats, born with bobcats
I can't just love you baby issa process
Love ain't good for you baby that shit processed

Huh, bang bang, that shit processed1Embed
