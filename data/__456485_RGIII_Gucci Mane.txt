13 ContributorsRGIII Lyrics
Yellow diamonds, red cars (RG III)
My plug just sent a long bomb (RG III, RG III)
RG III, I’m on the run (RG III, RG III)
I’m a young nigga with plenty money
(RG III, RG III)

Touchdown with it, RG III
Scramble with the work, nigga RG III
RG III in the trap with me, I’m the quarterback, nigga and I break down D
Get your 3D glasses ’cause I’m RG III
Already all PG 13
Drinking Louie XIII and watch ‘em train DC
And my whole team eatin’ I’m the MVP
Ran off on the plug, had to use my feet
Quarterback draw, got a strap on me
Never say that you got birdies for me
All of my soldiers get dirty for me
4th and a inch, short by a brick
First we locked up but then Scooter got pinched
The pocket collapse cuz them niggas done blitzed
Double the profit, quadruple the risk
RG III, RG III
RG III, I’m RG III
Too quick, got a get rich quick scheme
Showtime getting close, ref bring the chain
Can’t carjack me like Bobby V
Got a RV full of nothing but RG III
In a drop head Rolls told my TOP
To RIP cuz I’m RG III
Dipped her in gold so she DIG
Ball in the streets like I play in the league
Fumbled the bitch could've passed her to me
Don’t go to the cops, I hold court in the street
Michael Vick money, I bury a beast
50 chains going, don’t cherish a piece
Got clean, I got glass, I got lean, I got swag
Ridin' through zone 3 bout to pick up a sack
You might also like
Yellow diamonds, red cars (RG III)
My plug just sent a long bomb (RG III, RG III)
RG III, I’m on the run (RG III, RG III)
I’m a young n* with plenty money
(RG III, RG III)
Yellow diamonds, red cars (RG III)
My plug just sent a long bomb (RG III, RG III)
RG III, I’m on the run (RG III, RG III)
I’m a young n* with plenty money
(RG III, RG III)

RGIII I'm throwing bombs
Watch out J's cause here I come
I'm the man with the glass
And it's known to numb your tongue
Blowin' on that 93
Robert Griffin I'm going dumb
Pull up on them 32's
With your bitch she smart but dumb
Came up from a crumb
Now I'm buying homes
Million dollar n* still ride around with bombs
Dope bomb, gas bomb, pill bomb, molly bomb
Powder bomb, everybody in my hood done bought them some
Ayee, Mr Ok Yay yeah yeah
Got that RGIII in like he play for Baylor State
Gucci Mane young Juiceman, houses on estates
Red and yellow cars and they on them roller skates
At the round table calamari on my plate
Pimpin' through this mic but my sold bleed through this pen
I'm out here everyday, for my n* in the pen
RIP Duke, Dale, Blockbeater my friends
Yellow diamonds, red cars (RG III)
My plug just sent a long bomb (RG III, RG III)
RG III, I’m on the run (RG III, RG III)
I’m a young n* with plenty money
(RG III, RG III)
Yellow diamonds, red cars (RG III)
My plug just sent a long bomb (RG III, RG III)
RG III, I’m on the run (RG III, RG III)
I’m a young n* with plenty money
(RG III, RG III)3Embed
