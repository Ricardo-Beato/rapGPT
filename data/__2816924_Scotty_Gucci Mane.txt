6 ContributorsScotty Lyrics
Scotty, Scotty, Scotty

I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
50 grand in every pocket, I’m goin’ Scotty
I’m bout to buy a new Ferrari, I’m goin’ Scotty

I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
Like fuck the party, Iced out shawty, shawty
I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
I’m smokin’ Marley, don’t tell nobody shawty
I’m walkin’ through the airport smelling’ like
Everyday I’m to the mall rein’ up Versace
I got a Rari, I want a brand new, Bugatti
30 carrot ring bling, bitch I’m Liberace
If I shitted on you hurt your feelings damn I’m sorry
I didn’t mean it, don’t be salty, I didn’t mean to buy it
I’m gambling hundred grand a game bitch I’m goin’ Scotty
Its Gucci Mane, Ice cream Man, bitch I’m bout it bout it
 x2
I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
50 grand in every pocket, I’m goin’ Scotty
I’m bout to buy a new Ferrari, I’m goin’ Scotty
You might also like
You ain’t tricking’ if you got it so I pay these hoes for pleasing’ me
These freak hoes ain’t deceiving me, I fuck these slut hoes easily
I’m a rap star, I’m a trap star, my earrings cost a Acura
These freak hoes suck like Dracula
Like Scotty I don’t get to attest to her
I’m a bachelor, you a wrestler, I flip these hoes like spatulas
My jewelry game spectacular, it really ain’t no more challengers
For Scotty mane, get naughty mane
Shoot that bitch up like Gotti mane
Y’all suckers not in my lane, I’m riding in a big body mane
Smokin’ cali Dro with a Irish hoe
On a private plane with Waka flame
Sippin’ champagne my campaign so turnt up its a damn shame
I’m off the hook and off the wall off the throttle and off the chain
Bitch you off or on cause I’m tonight
I got cocaine come catch a drank
 x2
I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
50 grand in every pocket, I’m goin’ Scotty
I’m bout to buy a new Ferrari, I’m goin’ Scotty

I feel like I’m a movie star, everyday buying a new car
Go get a Tec then I get some rims, Oh I gotta get me 2 of them, matter of fact gotta get me like 4 of them
One for my bitch like hers and him
Iced out slim with the diamond gems
Iced out slim with the tilted brim
I don’t see nobody, bitch I’m goin’ Scotty
Bitches say they love, but really they love my money
Dirty birds like Roddy, ride off in my Audi
I don’t see nobody, shittin' on niggas no potty
More cars then a car lot, don’t mistake me for car thief
What I’m a bring out this summer
Bitch wanna come take a sneak peak
All white guts I’m a neat freak, pussy ass nigga you a cheapskate
All this cash that my clickbait, bitch think that we won a sweepstakes
 x2
I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
I’m goin’ Scotty, I’m goin’ Scotty, Scotty
50 grand in every pocket, I’m goin’ Scotty
I’m bout to buy a new Ferrari, I’m goin’ ScottyEmbed
