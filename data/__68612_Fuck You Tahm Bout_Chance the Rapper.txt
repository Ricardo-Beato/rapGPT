10 days?
Are you for real? Are you serious?
Fuck it then!

Fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?

Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck, fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you, fuck you, nigga
Fuck you tahm, fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck you tahm
Fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you, nigga, nigga, fuck, fuck, fuck, tahm, tahm, tahm

Nigga, fuck this whole school and everything you tahm 'bout
Don't ask me for no I.D., bitch, I fucking signed out
Bitch, I've been suspended, bitch, I've been on timeout
Waking up in grind mode and sleeping in a grindhouse
So please don't hit my line 'bout the party trying to find out
What time that shit going to start
Or when it end, or who gon' come out
Or if I walked the stage
I've been on stage since I could rhyme out
Shows and shows and tapes
Of trying to get my fucking lines out
So please don't take my BIC out, my book out, my pick out
My hair, my fucking big mouth, you dick head, you dipped out
Of class and now you shit out of luck, who fucking slick now?
And with them rhymes you written down
I hope you get a mixdown
With a diss track from Ms. Rownd
And my dick sack in this bitch mouth
Give a five-hive to my teacher face
And my principal that fist pound
And now you gotta switch gowns
We caught you, little rascal
We got you throwing tantrums
When you could've thrown a tassel, ahh
You might also like
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck, fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you, fuck you, nigga
Fuck you tahm, fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck you tahm
Fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck you tahm 'bout?

Nigga, you're a weakling, why you talking dealing?
Like, "All my niggas flip birds" Nigga, you're a wing-zing
You ain't nothing but my seedling, I'll hang you from the ceiling
And leave yo' little ass leaking, and leave yo' body stinking
Dude, yo' ass been drinking? Or you just wasn't thinking?
I'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink
I hear your pockets jingling
It's calling me like "Ring, ring"
I'll choke you with your bling bling
Then run faster than Tink Tink
And all these goofies mad though
Like, "Why he such a asshole?"
And I ain't even mad, yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver
That shit ain't even rhyme, nigga
I'm fucked up out my mind, nigga
I stay right off the '9, nigga
That's where they try an' find a nigga
Feeling froggy? Better timid up
Harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt
'Cause niggas don't wanna get bended up
Stay talking but donâ€™t send it up
Used to send it up for my Skinner lunch
Savemoney niggas really won't spend a buck
Gimme that cash, that Ben, what up?
Pockets keep that denim bruh like ahh
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck, fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout? Fuck you, fuck you, nigga
Fuck you tahm, fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck you, nigga
Fuck you tahm 'bout? Nigga, fuck you tahm 'bout?
Nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck you tahm 'bout?

Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout?
Fuck you tahm 'bout?13Embed
