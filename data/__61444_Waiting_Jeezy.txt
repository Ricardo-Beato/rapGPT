16 ContributorsWaiting Lyrics
You know the world is waiting, waiting on 103
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting
We need some motivation
So won't you come motivate me?
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting

I done told y'all, and told y'all, and told y'all again
Play the game, play the game, play the game yeah to win
I ain't lose, I don't lose, I ain't lose, never lost
Always on, keepin' on, always on, never off

What the fuck is you hating for like you done something for a nigga?
Would call you out, but that wouldn't do shit for a nigga
I made it this far, a fool with my foolish pride
Look at me what you see? A fool and his foolish ride
Y'all know damn well I wasn't lettin you niggas down
Just to sit back and watch you led by these fuckin clowns
4 albums in, niggas still talking this real shit
3 classics in nigga, and that's on some real shit
Bitch, I'm legendary, bitch I'm a living legend
Been through straight hell so I can get street heaven
Bitch I'm Jeezy, the one you've been waiting for
And them Forgies is off-set, don't they look like they skatin ho?

You know the world is waiting, waiting on 103
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting
We need some motivation
So won't you come motivate me?
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting

Bitch I was born high, and that's how I'm dying nigga
Eyes wide shut with my finger on the cold trigger
You be hearing my word, now don't it sound like my soul bleeding
Hearing my word, now don't it sound like my soul reading
I do it for street niggas and every nigga that's like you
Let's see if you can afford one, even niggas that buy two
Can't believe what I'm hearing, can't believe what ya saying
All that I did, god damn, this how you try to play me
Feeling my words when I be talking that street talk
No, You be feeling my words when I be talking that street smart
Yeah, school of Hard Knocks, yeah bitch I graduated
Straight to them hard blocks and nothing was fabricated

You know the world is waiting, waiting on 103
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting
We need some motivation
So won't you come motivate me?
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting2Embed
