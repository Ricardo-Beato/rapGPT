115 ContributorsS.D.S. Lyrics
(Uh) Uh, uh

Close my eyes before I cross the street
Car 'bout to hit me, then he oughta beep (Uh-huh)
Watchin' Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm underwater in my dreams
I'm in awe, this jigsaw puzzle's not complete
I'm just an idea, nothin' con-cer-ete (Woah)
Came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change wit' us, but come to the same difference (Okay)
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I'm no God
I don't think that I'm a human though, 'cause I'm so odd
People sellin' drugs 'cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off of sellin' the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan
Dylan, (Dylan)

(Somebody do somethin') Somebody do somethin'
(Somebody do somethin') Somebody do somethin'
(Somebody do somethin') Somebody do somethin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'
Yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'
Yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'

Ah—ah, ah—ah—ah
(Woah) Yeah
It ain't no party like aristocratic parties
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yah, yah, yah
Ah-huh, ah-huh
Said, it ain't no party like aristocratic parties
Yeah, yo

Sippin' Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavorin'
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off and leave it danglin' (Woah)
FlyLo's still tryna put me onto Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you (Nope)
Been contemplatin' if I even still believe in the truth, I'm so stubborn
I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are sixteens and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm dyin' for the movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consumin' the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish bitin' nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown (Poo)
Uh, yeah (Somebody do somethin',) somebody do somethin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Somebody do somethin')
(Somebody do somethin') Uh, somebody do somethin'
(Somebody do somethin') Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody do somethin'
And somebody move somethin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'
You right there, somebody move somethin'
Uh, uh-huh, somebody move somethin'
(Yo) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Yo, yo, yo)64Embed
