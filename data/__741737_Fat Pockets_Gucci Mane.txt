10 ContributorsFat Pockets Lyrics
It's Gucci!
Catch Up!
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets

I got fat pockets
I don't like a wallet
I got fat pockets
Money in the closet
I got fat pockets
About three deposits
Hundred-fifty k
Haters can't stop it
Money and the power
Think I'm selling powder
Sipping drank, got me leaning
Like the Eiffel Tower
Money in the shower
Hundreds getting wet
Sell it to you wet
I'm all about a check
My pockets got the mumps like Professor Klump
Gucci on the run, put a shorty in a slump
I'm in the foreign, so the front, Yeah, that's where the trunk
And I'm so hood, park the 'rari, come back in a donk
(Catch up!)

I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets

See the battle of the bands in my fucking pants
Hundred grands worth of dead, old white man
Yellow Red, Drop-top, it's the redskins
Enough jewelry to make a young bitch's head spin
Haters mad, looking at me like "It's you again!"
And nigga its lonely at the top, but I can buy a friend
I got some twins in the back, think I'm a fly em in
And when they land, it's a movie or a drive-in
And I don't see these pussy niggas like a blind man
It's East Atlanta, but I nicknamed it The Crimeland
And my bank account pregnant from my right hand
And my crew get wasted like a Rock glass
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets

Out with the bird, park on the curb
Still get paid on the first and the third
Splurge with an urge, goons on the go
Waiting on Gucci Mane just to give them the word
First 48, I killt  the parking lot
Big blunts of kush I spark a lot
Offset forgs, they sticking out
Park that bitch in the 6 a lot
Hundreds in my pocket, they falling out
Every little week, I'm balling out
Top-drop, bay is falling down
On Pea-Tree Avenue I'm falling down
On pancakes, this rattle snake
Sliding round on a 
Like a hovercraft, giving autographs
Wish my gran' could see me now
Big Kid say he want to be me now
Tell the truth, I wanna be me too
Want a fly on the wall with a bird's eye view
My whole life should've been pay-per-view
Rock solid, make good profit
But I wish I had like ten pockets
Thugged out, then plugged in
I think I got like ten sockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets
I got fat pockets
I got, I got fat pockets2Embed
