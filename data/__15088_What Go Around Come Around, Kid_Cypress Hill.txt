17 ContributorsWhat Go Around Come Around, Kid Lyrics
Come on, come on (Time for some action)
Yeah, yeah (Time, time, time for some action)
Come on, come on (Time, time, time for some action)
Yeah, yeah (Time, time, time for some action)
Come on, come on

Drunk ass fool, just a punk ass, gonna cause trouble
Now let me burst that bubble in a hurry
I ain't happy, so worry
What's a judge and a punk ass jury, homeboy?
Should've known to go home
But you got caught up inside the cyclone
If I go home I'll get slopped and stoned
When I disconnect that fuckin' neck bone
Wa-ta
Then ya get the kick to jaw, kid
And I rip out your eyelids
So you can see the hectic erratic
Killa comin' when I bring on the static

What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around (Go around)
What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around (Go around)
What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around (Go around)
What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around
You might also like
Shit, I get real shit, yo, shit, can ya feel it?
Carbon copy, come steal it
The gat, I conceal it under my jacket
Oh, where, oh where do ya think I pack it?
Under my belt when the cards get dealt to all the players
And though the punk ass fakers just come
And ya get the high pitched hum
Make ya understand where I'm from
The Eastside brown kid looks around
What stands up, it must fall down
It's on, when you wanna take my pound, punk
What go around come around

What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around (Go around)
What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around (Go around)
What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around (Go around)
What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around

(Time, time, time for some action)
(Check me and I'll check you back)
(Time, time, time for some action)
(Check me and I'll check you back)
When I come with the static cling, it's no thing
Make ya sing the blues like B.B. King
I got the roughneck scales to give awhile
Like a voodoo child, nothin' but style
Take it, but you can see the black Glock clickin'
Point my gat at the punk ass victim
Step up or you can step back through the doors
You can bring it on if ya wanna come and get yours
But ya betta look over your shoulder
'Cause a loss of blood gets the body much colder

What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around (Go around)
What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around (Go around)
What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around (Go around)
What go around come around, kid (Go around)
What go around come around

(Time, time, time, time for some action)
(Check me and I'll check you back)
(Time, time, time, time for some action)
(Check me and I'll check you back)
(Time, time, time, time for some action)
(Check me and I'll check you back)
(Time, time, time, time for some action)
(Check me and I'll check you back)Embed
