Pluto

Girl, I've been there for you
Pluto
And you know that it's true
You know it's true, you know it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
I've been there, I've been there for you
Girl, you know that it's true
Aw yeah, out here getting it baby

Never ever let the money stop, dirty police trying to fuck it up
If money come, he wanna pull you over, just to say something under there
Baby momma' back drinking liquor, now she trying to fuck my life up
I'm out here to get this money baby, 37, throwin' dice up
Long nights of the wake up, new check, fuck my life up
Anytime I'm in a new city, I prefer to do light drugs
Police try to hit the tour bus, try and fuck a nigga life up
You can fuck a nigga life up by trying to fuck a nigga wife once
Told you baby this business, please stop tryna ruin it all
Money fucked a nigga life up, new rims, new tires
Just get out here and show it off, next, I'mma take the doors off
Whip browner than a band-aid, take the sore off (Woah!), money coming so fast
You might also like
Girl, I've been there for you
Money coming, money coming so fast
And you know that it's true
You know it's true, you know it's true (You know it's true)
Girl, I've been there for you (Ah!)
I've been there, I've been there for you (Ah!)
And you know that it's true

You know I'm out here getting it baby (It's true)
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Ball hard, and I'm still balling (It's true), stop trying to fuck my life up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Money coming stu-stupid fast (It's true), stop trying to fuck my life up
Yeah-eah-err
Getting money and I count it all (It's true), stop trying to fuck my life up
Oh
Fuck my life up (It's true)

Eight stacks sitting in the club, swipe my credit card, fuck my life up
These drugs gave me my light up, told her "Baby please, don't bite it"
I ain't had sex in a whole week, just so you can get to know me
Gushy, gush, so soaky, I put it in, go so deep (Ah!)
Motherfuck how far you, come over here and get the write up
Homeowners association, they always tryna get right up
You got a better advantage, you always use xannies whenever you plan it
Pussy be fucking my life up and yet at the same time it's giving me stamina
My role model fucked my life up, two bitches in the same room, no light on
So easy getting 100 thousand when the night up
Got cake cookin' up cake bake, my life fucked for a ladies bit
83 to 88, money comes so fast
Girl, I've been there for you
Money coming, money coming so fast
And you know that it's true
Girl, it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
Ah! (Ah!)
And you know that it's true

You know I'm out here getting it baby (It's true)
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Ball hard, and I'm still balling (It's true), stop trying to fuck my life up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Money coming stu-stupid fast (It's true), stop trying to fuck my life up
Yeah-eah-err
Getting money and I count it all
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Oh, fuck my life up7Embed
