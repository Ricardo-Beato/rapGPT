12 Contributors1  King Lyrics
And when we hit the club all the bitches know our name
It's Curren$y, Weezy F Baby, Mack Maine
And when we leave the club, everybody know we came
'Cause all the ugly bitches left standin' in the rain
And when we hit the club all the bitches know our name
It's Curren$y, Weezy F Baby, Mack Maine
And when we leave the club, everybody know we came
'Cause all the ugly bitches left standin' in the rain

I'm the nigga, the nigga, nigga, the nigga, nigga
The Crystal swigger, got shit off in my basement like Tigger
But mama ain't cookin' up shit
Got my lil' mama cookin' up bricks
I be hookin' up with them bitches, who be hookin' up with
Them bitches, who can hook me up with
Them bitches, who be hookin' up with
Them niggas who can hook me up
When they get with 'em, I send my hittas to get 'em
And his reply was, "You know who you fucked with?"
A gun up in ya face and that's all you can come up with?
I'm rawer than a young dick in some bitch, you little niggas
I'm right here, you ain't comin'
You niggas just fuckin' around
I be puffin' the pound
By myself, I don't need nobody else, I need help, shit
I leave whelps on ya bitch from my D&G belt
Hot Boy in ya mouth, I melt
You might also like
And when we hit the club all the bitches know our name
It's Curren$y, Weezy F Baby, Mack Maine
And when we leave the club, everybody know we came
'Cause all the ugly bitches left standin' in the rain
And when we hit the club all the bitches know our name
It's Curren$y, Weezy F Baby, Mack Maine
And when we leave the club, everybody know we came
'Cause all the ugly bitches left standin' in the rain1Embed
