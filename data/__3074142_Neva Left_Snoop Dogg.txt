48 ContributorsNeva Left Lyrics
Dogg, what up, mane?
Word on the streets is you ain't what you used to be

I gang bang to the fullest
A lot of niggas talk about it but they really don't do it, do they?
So I'm doin' it for y'all
Mark or a buster, I'ma ruin it for y'all
Stomp that, strap up, mash up
And get it crackin' with the slapper, jacker
Smacker, rapper? Nah nigga, that ain't me
Gangsta? Yeah nigga, can't you see?
Rider, like the tonners on my Chevrolet
West Coast, motherfucker, that's the only way
Yeah homie, what you say?
Home of the Wook, Wok and Gunplay
A lot of homies shoot to J
But most of 'em prefer to shoot the K
Yeah, that's the good life
And where we come from, loc, that's the hood life
Where you mama and daddy
Throw the set up out the moon while they swangin' the caddy
That's on the set, tats on they neck
Streets sweet with the heat, yep, they stay on deck
I'm dazed and blazed, no confusin', I'm choosin'
This how I was raised
I bring that out and bag it up, no doubt
Swang it out and let it up and bang that out
This Crips, nigga
You might also like
That's crazy, cuz
You know my whole life, I wanted to be a gangsta, mane
I used to see my OG home boys at King Park
Ridin' on bikes but they came with they flags on the end
C-walkin', Stacey Adams, 501's
That shit was fascinating

The Miles Davis of gangbangin' and crack slangin'
Drivin' a fresh rock, rental with blocks in 'em
I'm fresh out the county, I'm boxin' 'em
Moved on up and bought a continental, nigga, with knock in it
Now I'm rockin' it, '61 blockin' it
If y'all ridin' by, my nigga, we cockin' it
We poppin' on imposters, fake ass mobsters
East side niggas, no stoppin' us
My recipe is treachery
The best in me, nigga, the West to be
A better place for the one of Ace
Put a 9 millimeter in your fuckin' face
And let you say your grace before you have a taste
Of reality, set in, yeah, it's your fate
Now your homies at your funeral, plottin' on some get back
But you can't get back 'cause nigga, you dated
Another sad gangsta story
And usually ones with the territory
No nuts, no glory, no pain, no gain
Life for a nigga growin' up in the game
This slangin' thang, drinkin', sell a lil' cocaine
Get locked up for a minute now we in it to win it
Now everybody know me
They watchin' the makings of a real OG
Yeah, they say if you watch somethin' long enough, you'll become it
You know, they say imitation is the best form of flattery
That's what I was told
A lot of niggas is imitatin' this real gangsta shit
You ain't cut from it
You dig?

Yeah, scarin' all the white folk
While stayin' on the right note
And you can quote me if you want to
Don't say what you will do, nigga, what you gon' do?
I'm live in the flesh
Caught him on Imperial left five in his chest
Survive in the west
It's everyday cycle, you never know what might go blam
And how you like me now?
Crip 'til you slip, Mr. Big Bow Wow
Yeah, it's my chance to prance
I got ants in my pants and I needs to dance
I go for broke, no joke
I gotta put my drink down, I'm tryna C walk, loc
See i'ma take off, break off
And make off with the cash
At the pad with, a thick lil bitch, she super bad
Gangsta, gangsta
Futuristic
Snoop Dogg
48 hunnid
C's up, yeah
Shoot or shout out to my home boys
Harlem 30
Yeah, real shit
All my niggas on the East coast
6-0's, Eight Tray, Hoovers
Main Street, all my niggas in Compton
And the South side, ya dig?
Nutty Blocc
Santana
Oh, can't forget them Long Beach niggas
East side the same
Rollin 20 Crips
19th Street
West side, you know what's hatnin'

All hood, yeah
