27 ContributorsLove Thru the Computer Lyrics
You know I've been searchin' for someone
I've been lookin', hah, for the perfect one
Who could share that special love with me
Mrs. Perfect
And your eyes have that glow
She had that glow though
Could it be?
Could it be your face I see on my computer screen
J. White, I need a beat, I can go off on, ooh
Uh, yeah
Go

I was in the jail thinking 'bout my problems
Like all the niggas, when I get out, I'ma rob 'em (Hah)
Shit was hard, up and down, it was '09 (Nine)
Lookin' through this magazine, she was so fine
Pretty brown, black bitch, what a draft pick
Hot yellow thick chick with an accent (Yellow)
I told her, "I ain't ever seen another cuter" (No)
Good brain, she don't even need a tutor (Wow)
Fuck a shooter, I'll shoot a nigga's shooter (Bah bah)
Long money, I don't even need a ruler (Wow)
A big dawg, I ain't ever been a poodle (Grr)
So much ice on my bitch, she need a cooler (Burr, burr)
And I disturb the peace like Luda' (Like Luda')
Been droppin' low like you be doin' on that computer
You want a long distance love, I want computer love (Hah)
So drop it low and back it back like a computer does (Wow)
You might also like
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop (Yeah, hey)
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop (Yeah)
Ooh, when we both logged on, I didn't wanna turn off
That's that computer love (Guwop)

Hit you up on the laptop (Laptop)
I told you meet me at the last spot
You went with me, fell in love
Didn't take long for you to gain my trust, no
With all that I've been through, you make it simple
I never thought I would meet an angel
Until I met you, until I met you (Go)

I'ma put you on the rocks (Bling)
Nobody fuckin' with the Wops (Burr)
Baby give me all that she got
Share it with me, we gon' throw it all in the pot (Hah, hah)
This the type of love more than physical (Hah)
When a king get a queen, he invincible (Hah)
Fought the system every level, it was critical (Ha)
Fuck the feds, state, civil, and municipals (Fuck 'em)
Even then, through computers I was kissin' you (Mwah)
Remember through the computer, I would visit you (Me)
Daydreamin' 'bout us fuckin' in your living room (Huh)
Doin' push ups 'cause I know you 'bout to visit soon (Grr)
I'm from the 6, I grew up in the worst trap (Zone)
I'm way too rich, bae, to fall for a thirst trap (Huh?)
Plus I know the grass ain't greener on the other side (No)
'Cause my house so big, I rarely see the other side (Wow)
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop (Yeah, hey)
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop (Yeah)
Ooh, when we both logged on, I didn't wanna turn off
That's that computer love (Yeah)

(Computer love, computer love
Computer love, computer love
Computerized, digital love
Computerized
A beautiful love)3Embed
