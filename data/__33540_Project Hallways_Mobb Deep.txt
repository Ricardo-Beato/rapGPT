10 ContributorsProject Hallways Lyrics
Niggas catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways

Step in to my highrise hell, you gots to be on the up and up
Watch your back, pump your crack, but don't forget to re-up
A burner's your God and you pray to it all day
Then at night, you catch a body
But it's just the shit you got to do
'Cause if you wasn't watchin', they'd catch your ass too
You gotta go all out if you want props
Or you can just kill a man and it's the same for cops
Now you want a little fame from the drug game
Whether you shoot 'em up or pump cracks, it's all the same
But fuck it, you're in it to win it
Fat Uptown, cookies in the rocks, your spot's hot
Now you're livin' the life of a project sad song
Makin' your loot from all the right wrongs
But that's the way it goes when you choose your path
And you might just feel the pain of a TEC-22 blast
All out war with niggas from the next block
You're pullin' out the Glock to shut 'em down
Now you're Mr. Big Shot in your ride
Niggas know your name from Mt. Vernon to Southside
Comin' from the streets of fright
Where the only thing you learned was how to roll it up right
And load it up tight, you're startin' a block war
Nigga, pull the trigger if you want a little more
Frank Nitty style, buckwild
Thirty-eight slugs from Uptown thugs
No question, you're true to the game
Since the age of a little Brand Nubian
From skelly tops to props of all that
Now you're puttin' your block on the map
A role model to the petty drug dealers
Banana clip style, my neighborhood's buckwild
You can't forget where you came from
See you later, maybe sooner in the project hallways
You might also like
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggas catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggas catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggas catchin' bodies

A little hell-bound nigga, shoot 'em up, light 'em up
Pull the trigger, pass the forty in the project hallways
Runnin' through the doorways, back in the days
Just a little snot-nosed bastard
Always causin' havoc with a blade
But now it's a burner, used for murder
Step a little closer and your ass is grass
You better move fast 'fore I kick that ass
'Cause I'm sharp like glass, but I won't break
Walk into the project hallways is your big mistake
You little bitch-ass nigga, you should've known better
You'll get done did, a kid from the 'Bridge
Who gets buck, and couldn't give a fuck about your daze
I'm talkin' 'bout the project hallways

Catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, chillin' in the project hallways
To survive around my way
You gotta play a knuckle game every day
Lost in the shuffle of hard rocks
And knocks on the streets of the uptown blocks
Load the Glocks, who got the Mott's?
A little gun-bangin' badass project thug
You're in the wrong part of town, kid
Mr. Buddha on the thirteenth floor, give me some more
Sess, bag it up real quick, kid
Tap the snooze, hit the brew, pass the Phil'
What's my name? Niggas call me Little Shorty Gets Ill
And bag 'em up on the street corner
And bust 'em open in the project hallways

Check it out, yo
Around my way, kid, the sun don't shine
Phillie blunts, kid, I got what you want and it's time
My dialogue with the project cause motivate
Move, what? I never lose
Freestyle project hallway style
But the shit ain't real unless you got that Buddha filled
Charm keeps me goin' on when I perform
Charge the brain, lick 'em up, that's the name of the game
So it's the move when I move little smooth
On the motherfuckin' mission and I just improve
Upstairs, niggas dyin' on the sixth floor
'Cause in the projects, shit is mad rough
So take a puff and relax your mind
J.V. crimes, most of the time
You might catch my crew with a sixty-four brew
Watch your back 'cause we're comin' through
With a fat sack of 1-2-1, son
And the shit ain't fun unless I get some
Of the action, little shorty execute
I'm killin' niggas in the hallways 'til there ain't no more left to shoot
So if you can't take the heat, stay out of the ways
Before you 'come a victim of the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggas catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggas catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggas catchin' bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, the project hallways
Niggas shoot 'em up in the project hallways2Embed
