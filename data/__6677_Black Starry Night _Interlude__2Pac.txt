12 ContributorsBlack Starry Night (Interlude) LyricsAgainst all odds, I'm still here nigga
O.P.D. -- what??!
Aiyyy, I got to get my props for 2Pacalypse
When this album come out, niggas can kiss my ass
Did you think I'd fall?
You think you could stop a motherfucker like me?
Introducing you to my criminal crew
Treach, A.D., Apache, Essential
Above the Law, Lench Mob, the Underground Railroad, Digital Underground gets around and we down in this bitch
You got to deal with me on a whole new level motherfucker
Cause I'm gettin' paid
And the more you try to keep niggas away from me
The more I unite with mo' niggas and mo' niggas and mo' niggas
Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major
And there's a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
I owe him, thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of our fathers
And uhh, I'm not goin' alive!You might also likeEmbed
