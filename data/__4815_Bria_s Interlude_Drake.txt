Even though you're all alone
All alone when I am gone
I just wanna keep you warm
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yeah, yes, I'll be there
'Cause when I'm all alone, I think about your face
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah

Come on, Missy, fly with me
Come on, Missy, fly with me, fly with me
Come on, Missy, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
Come on, Missy, fly with me, fly with me

I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet
Promise that I won't forget
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, oh, yes, I'll be there, oh
About to board a flight, sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you, but I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh

Come on, Missy, fly with me
Come on, Missy, fly with me, fly with me
Come on, Missy, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
Come on, Missy, fly with me, fly with me33Embed
