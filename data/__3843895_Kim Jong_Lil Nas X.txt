17 ContributorsKim Jong Lyrics
Lando made the track, so you know we 'bout to turn up

Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong

Thirty niggas with me and they shootin' too, nigga, they will shoot at you
Thus leaving you dead, bust your motherfucking cuticles
Dif'rent color Gucci, nigga, I look like a Rubik's cube
Putting fake niggas on trial, like The Crucible
Delusional niggas thinkin' they up next
That's a shame, 'cause they name ain't Lil Nas X
Young nigga, I was raised in the projects
In the draft, I'm the number one prospect

Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong

Uh, think I was meant for this rappin' shit
'Cause all the new niggas sent really wack as shit
Maybe if I change the game, I'll aim at lame niggas brains
And take the fame off they names, then I will give it back
To a motherfuckin' humble rapper
Conscious niggas always talking 'bout them mumble rappers
Like y'all shit can't be trash too, you niggas be wack too
Pussy fuck ya past, ooh, you niggas gassed
My check better be gettin' to me
Or I'm wettin' necks of niggas who didn't give it to me
Don't expect no respect, I never give it truly
Switch the pivot, gotta get it, that's how I'm livin', ooh-wee

Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim JongEmbed
