3 ContributorsWe Bang We Ball Lyrics
Slauson, Slauson
It's Nip, Hussle, listen, look

Look, I'm a H-double O-D S-T-A-R
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
We bang, and we ball
And we bang, and we ball
Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
(We bang, and we ball)
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
(And we bang, and we ball)
And maybe have a one-nighter
Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
(We bang, and we ball)
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
(And we bang, and we ball)
And maybe have a one-nighter

It's the K-I-two L's, A-R, hood star
Kill 'em in the front then bury 'em in the backyard
Chrome gleamin' on the car, bangin', I show raw
I'm in the buildin', H and R, young black millionar'
Ghetto but a famous star, Perignon to calamar'
Haze, dumped a Shalamar and Chardonnay going hard
You're billy ain't nothin' without a Phantom or a Maybach
So tell the bartender, we need bottle service ASAP
You might also like
Now it's the NH, two O's, D-S-T-A
No info from them CRASH cops and DA's
Gold chain swang, I just swag off the Cliquot
And every day we ballin', pop bottles on the weekdays
Fuck all that he say, she say, we paid
All Money In No Money Out, that's what we say
These fake niggas' worse fear was my release date
I hope they gettin' money 'cause I'm spinnin' like the DJ

Look, 'cause I'm a H-double O-D S-T-A-R
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
We bang, and we ball
And we bang, and we ball
Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
(We bang, and we ball)
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
(And we bang, and we ball)
And maybe have a one-nighter
Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
(We bang, and we ball)
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
(And we bang, and we ball)
And maybe have a one-nighter
Listen, it's the N-I-P-S-E-Y, he fly
Hustle in Girbauds and Levi's, Dickies and Reeboks
H-U-double dollar sign-L-E
From 3600 Baker Row, cell three
To 9900 cash money on me
Keep it under 10 G's so the feds won't see
Spend a thousand on clothes and a thousand on weed
Damn it feel good to be from RSC

I'm still the H.R.O.B
Mr. VVS is still the freshest overseas
Tried to told 'em let him breathe, I need filet migneeze
St. Tropez to L.A., we G6'n with ease
Slauson Boyz, my ice shine like I'm on HD
That's on me, I'ma ride 'til I D-I-E
Turnpike in the V, it's just Nipsey and Reeze
And it's just for one night 'cause you're subject to leave

Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
(We bang, and we ball)
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
(And we bang, and we ball)
And maybe have a one-nighter
Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
(We bang, and we ball)
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
(And we bang, and we ball)
And maybe have a one-nighter
Look, I'm a H-double O-D S-T-A-R
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
We bang, and we ball
And we bang, and we ball
And we bang, and we ball
And we bang, and we ball
And we bang, and we ball
And we bang, and we ballEmbed
