Treat my darkskin like my redbone, yeah
Tell my redbone call my red phone, go
Yeah
I treat my darkskin like my redbone, yeah
Tell my redbone call my red phone, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Treat my darkskin like my redbone, yeah
Tell my redbone call my red phone
It's emergency
I hit you up just with that urgency
Know I need your love like you ain't never heard of me
And I know I was dead wrong, yeah
I wanna turn up, just another sad song, yeah

I focus just to make it stack tall, yeah
Got drip, got sauce, can dress her ass off, hey
We get so geeked, we call that blastoff, ayy
I'ma pull up on that girl, mask off, ayy
No stallin', say that I'm playing, girl, I'ma do this regardless (Yeah)
You fog my brain, them chemicals made me heartless
I'm the one that's normal, don't understand, are you Martian?
I can see her in the rough, she be shining like a diamond (Woo)
All these boys, they can't find it (Yeah), and that lil' boy, he be lyin' (Yeah)
Keep on tryna take my persona (Huh?)
Bite me up like a piranha (Bite)
Buy the real deal, I swear you is a kinda
But over you, I'll still pull up the comma
I put that shit right there right on my mama
Woah, yeah, yeah

My exes, I think they were bad luck, yeah
I promise you gon' be the last one, yeah
Vacation just so you can have fun, yeah
Got 'em wishin' they were you, ain't that somethin', somethin'?
I'm outside in the black truck, jump in
So much better than my last one, that's when I met him
Wondering how he got me wrapped up (Up, up)
You make the rules, babe
I drink on Tuesdays, I stay out too late
But if you do, just let me know who you with
Tell me the truth, tell the judge I ain't do shit
