"O—"
"Open your—"
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor—"

"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy—"
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy—"

Seeing is believin', believe when you see it
They saying I'm the best—shit—I'm just trying to be it
They tied me to a mountain of it, I just try to ski it
Long distance wireless Kinect like I Wii it
W, double-I, spelled so you can see it
Cause it's way over their heads when I Ray Allen 3 it
I'm Rondo on the bongos when giving you my convo
We ain't been home since we were snatched out the Congo
Toast to progress as I'm staring out my condo
Made it this far and I ain't never been a Tonto
Yuh, as you compare me to a fuckin' rookie
You can't respect the new school when you played hookie
Cooked white, turned it tan, sold world Snooki
School of Hard Knocks, look at where the game took me
To the limit like Montana with better grammar
Bigger homes with bigger guns and better cameras
You might also like
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy—"

You are now listening to the future
Open your eyes, nigga, and see what I see
Don't mind me—I'm just here to restore the feeling
Yeah, I'm just here to restore the feeling
You feel the pressure, yeah

I never pitched a penny in a wishing well (Never)
I laid it all on a fishing scale (Yes)
And an apron that hung from a kitchen nail
Straight from my memoirs as I kiss and tell
Big faces like Rushmore, touch more
Fashion trailblazers, trendsetters look to us for
The next mission when the tide dries up
With no innervision yet they eyes wide shut
Fifteen years abducting spies like us
Confidential informants disguised like us
Jail doesn't resonate with guys like us
Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
Didn't listen, so prison is what they did to him
Accountant unscathed, millions is what they hid through him
Same principles you must adhere
Lohans get the breaks, the T.I.'s, we just steer through 'em
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy—"

The odds is against us
No excuses though, we just play harder
Hustle smarter, yeah
They done freed Weezy
Congratulations, my nigga
Now let TIP go, yuh3Embed
