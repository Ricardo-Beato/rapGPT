12 ContributorsSpartan Lyrics
Yeah, shout out to Money Savage Mario
Big NaeNae and them

What time it is?
What time it is?
I'm hot for real
You grindin' still
I'm a doctor like Phil
I'm a Spartan for real
I'm trained to kill
I'm trained to kill, yeah
Ah, and I'm hot for real
And you grindin' still
If you trained to kill
If you trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill
Trained to kill
I'm trained to kill
I got 'em

Head ain't shit, she must've dropped out of high school
Song on her ringtone, got it from iTunes
Instead of sayin', "Bye," you need to be sayin', "Hi," to him
Don't walk, don't run, bitch, fly to him, dumbass
What you mean we ain't eatin', girl? You know my crew obese
And I smoke that strong every day like Wiz Khalif'
Three-five for the cheese, shouts out to my big homie Pete
Let me talk Chinese, shouts out to YL and WeeWee
Nigga talkin' bad but they really wanna be me
Threw thirty-five-thousand on him, Dirk Nowitzki
Joc in this bitch with me
Eight in the Benz with me
Yeah, mag' got red and blue flags on it
And if they talkin' bills I'll put that on it
And if the bitch burpin' put a ad on it
I call Booke and ask him, "Can I smash on it?"
And he like "Smash on it"
So I smash gang freaked the ho
Yeah, I swear I smash gang freaked the ho
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
I'm hot for real
I'm hot for real
You grindin' still
You grindin' still
I'm a doctor like Phil
I'm a Spartan for real
I'm trained to kill
Ho, I'm trained to kill, yeah
Ayy, Joc, I'm trained to kill
And they grindin' still
And I'm hot for real
And I know you trained to kill so say, "I'm trained to kill"Embed
