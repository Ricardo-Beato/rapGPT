8 ContributorsThere I Go Again Lyrics

Yeah yeah
Know what I'm sayin'
Straight burn biscuits baby
Yeah, give it to 'em raw uncut
Turn them headphones up
No doubt son
No problem
Creepin' it though baby
It's gangsta
The truth gonna come to the level

Yo
As this blood flow through my veins
I stand before this mic with a stepped up game
Some things when I look how they never gonna change
It ain't a thing, niggas wild, then I'm cockin' that thing
Cuz you know with every action there's a reaction
And there's no known cure when I'm sick with the clappin'
How many times it have to happen
Niggas talkin' like they generals but just mere captains
The streets there's rules, slugs hit 'em with infractions
And then there's Hollywood if you want some fuckin' acting
You got these niggas out mis-representin' they hood
Give 'em heart now they icin', I'm like nigga what's good?
Cuz you know how I get with these MACs and these techs
Blaze 'em down gives a fuck about the next nigga rep
Play around find yourself getting' cheated by death
Man gone and believe me dog it happened to the best
You might also like
You know a nigga, I be tryin' to chill
But now and then I hafta run these niggas a drill (no doubt)
There comes a time in every nigga life
When he's face to face with that ol' kill or be killed
And here I go again, grabbin' my steel
Cuz now and then I hafta run these niggas a drill (run 'em)
There comes a time in every nigga life
When he's face to face with that ol' kill or be killed

Don't make me have to body something
Fuck you and what you known for, to me you're nothin'
I don't see why in the world, to me you frontin'
And if you was that nigga, then you still mean nothing, homes (what)
My gun is bustin'
Fuck all y'all niggas my stomach is touchin'
And I be right there on Myrtle Ave, come through
You bitch ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
I get bulletproof love, pounds and hugs
You get extorted by the thugs that gew up in your hood
You get killed fuckin' with P, you really should
Not do that, I use that Ruger good
Catch a bad one
Ran dunn raggity
You got fucked up and left for dead in the street
Yo
Who wants it with Hav, who want it with P?
Not near one of y'all and I put that on me
But ifâ€¦

You know a nigga, I be tryin' to chill
But now and then I hafta run these niggas a drill
There comes a time in every nigga life
When he's face to face with that ol' kill or be killed
And here I go again, grabbin' my steel
Cuz now and then I hafta run these niggas a drill
There comes a time in every nigga life
When he's face to face with that ol' kill or be killed

Yo
Believe me dog there's more than cockin' and squeezin' and
Afterward that nigga still be breathin' and
Who gonna snitch if you lucky to leave it then
For a reward, niggas just might turn you in
I take it further and I might just murder him
That mouthpiece all together, I'm curbin' him
It's very clear and there's nothin' to blur my lens
It's very real, ain't got no time to pretend
Yo
Feelin' it thugs, I dump a magazine on you dunn
I'll run up on you niggas with the mask and glove
Dunn, there's nothin' for me to snap and get on tilt
I know it's nothin' for you to pay to have me killed
I respect the laws of war and love, I live by them shits
Y'all niggas not ready for this
You not knowin' how you about to get your head crushed
Spray it dunn, straight out
Shitted when them guns come out

You know a nigga, I be tryin' to chill
But now and then I hafta run these niggas a drill
There comes a time in every nigga's life
When he's face to face with that ol' kill or be killed
And here I go again, grabbin' my steel
Cuz now and then I hafta run these niggas a drill
There comes a time in every nigga's life
When he's face to face with that ol' kill or be killed
You know a nigga, I be tryin' to chill
But now and then I hafta run these niggas a drill
There comes a time in every nigga's life
When he's face to face with that ol' kill or be killed
And here I go again, grabbin' my steel
Cuz now and then I hafta run these niggas a drill
There comes a time in every nigga's life
When he's face to face with that ol' kill or be killed


We've got to learn to swallow our pride
It's hard just to let things ride
Maybe one day things will change
As of right now let me show you something
We've got to learn to swallow our pride
It's hard just to let things ride
Maybe one day things will change
As of right now let me show you something
We've got to learn to swallow our pride
It's hard just to let things ride
Maybe one day things will change
As of right now let me show you something
We've got to learn to swallow our pride
It's hard just to let things ride
Maybe one day things will change
As of right now let me show you something
We've got to learn to swallow our pride
It's hard just to let things ride
Maybe one day things will change
As of right now let me show you something
We've got to learn to swallow our pride
It's hard just to let things ride
Maybe one day things will change
As of right now let me show you something1Embed
