All the things I do
All the plans I move
All the men I shoo
Mm, boy, I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
Can't wait to get next to you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Here's another one about you
Baby, I wanna gush about you
I wanna be the stubborn crust of barnacles upon you
If you were to become a middle-American farmer
I'd read up on every vegetable and harvest them around you
Not to be too much, but I am always me around you
But when you lеave, I'm movin' very awkwardly without you
I have nеver met a man who gets it like you do
Precious as you are
You're cursin' out your mirror, you're takin' it too far
You need to see it clearer, I've seen it all before
I wanna be there for you when the going's gettin' hard
When you're feelin' like the lowest thing that no one even wants
I wanna write you poetry and jokes and even songs
I hope this lasts forever or at least 'til we a hundred
Please know how much I want this
You might also like
All the things I do
All the plans I move
All the men I shoo
Mm, boy, I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
Can't wait to get next to you

Yeah, and I wouldn't do this for no man
It's a understatement if I tell you you's important
I'm just tryna bring you drinks and assortments
Hot towels with a mocktail by the ocean
Top down with our ice shinin' like a snowman
Cook you a crab boil that reminds you of New Orleans
Don't give any time of day to these cokeheads
We too busy gettin' experience and explorin'
I wanna take you overseas and stop by in Paris
And watch you taste the cheese
Take you to Buly and get you smellin' sweet
In love with you, je suis, I love you, mon chéri
And if you feel the need to dip and take a breather
Just know that I will wait or that I'd never leave
I'm givin' you space, givin' you cover, uh-huh
Givin' you true love in abundance, uh-huh
Givin' and takin' because we're not a fling
Givin' me faith that it's not another
All the things I do
All the plans I move
All the men I shoo
Mm, boy, I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you (I can't wait, no, I can't wait)
I can't wait to get next to you (Boy, I can't wait, boy, I can't wait)
Can't wait to get next to you (No, I can't wait)

I can't wait, no, I
