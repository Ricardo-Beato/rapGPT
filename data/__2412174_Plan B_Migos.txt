18 ContributorsPlan B Lyrics
I gave a bitch a Plan B (Open your mouth)
‘Cause she was my plan B (Side bitch)
I got my hoe on a leash (Get over here)
She a real trapper in the streets
My niggas don’t mean no harm, unless you come handling me (My niggas don’t mean it)
Cookie bag and a Percocet, that’s what applied to me (I’m geeking)
The dab is not a sneeze (Dab)
I fuck her once, then she leave (Smash)
She only got her fucking keys; I give her phone down the street

Eat it up - busy bees
Stevie Wonder, play with keys
I told my plug, “Yadda mean,”
That mean, “Come on, with them things,”
I put the work ‘cross seas
Feel like I play with Kareem
I walk around with the nin’
Hundred thousand for the team
I woke up ‘cause I had a dream
I shot at nigga in the spleen
Two niggas looking like Kel and Ken’
Your favorite cousin, dope fiends
I was going on a mission
But I swapped out my hoe for that
Young nigga talking business
Tell that nigga I ain’t here for that
Migo Gang like the Thundercats
And I’m trapping out a Hellcat
Pussy nigga, you a lab rat
Bitch, my diamonds doing jumping jacks
Pull up, gave a Phantom heart attack
Hoe nigga, where your heart is at?
We quick to send ‘em to the cardiac
Cookies and Perc’ – that’s the starter pack
Go to the jeweler; want all of that
Ball on my court, nigga, can’t get the ball back
I be where the money fall at
I take the pot and beat it with a ball bat
You ain’t own it boy, you rented that
If it ain’t broke I ain’t fixing that
I put the dope in the trunk
I put the extras in the kitty-cat
You might also like
I gave a bitch a Plan B (Open your mouth)
‘Cause she was my plan B (Side bitch)
I got my hoe on a leash (Get over here)
She a real trapper in the streets
My niggas don’t mean no harm, unless you come handling me (My niggas don’t mean it)
Cookie bag and a Percocet, that’s what applied to me (I’m geeking)
The dab is not a sneeze (Dab)
I fuck her once, then she leave (Smash)
She only got her fucking keys; I give her phone down the street

Fuck on me, then fuck my brother
Just because she’s your bitch, you don’t trust her
These bitches really trying to come up
Damn, she trapped you, you nutted up
When you went to work, I had picked her up
She said she want to kick it on the bus
Fucking and sucking up all of us
You know how we do; we just slaughtered her
My jeweler made me look like Slick the Ruler
My bitches bougie, walking with a poodle
When I was little, thought bitches had cooties
Now that I’m grown, got a brick in her coochie
Finesse the plug; I hit him with the whoop-de-whoo
Finessed him right out his shoe
I got some boot in my Margiela boots
Bitches running ‘round my mansion in nude
Bitches stick to me like Gorilla Glue
Smoking on cookies did somebody poo?
You niggas is suckers; you a roody-poo
YRN 2, ball alert, got the news
Sipping on Actavis, like it’s a brew
(Aye, Boaw!) Who shot at you?
Yes we can fuck, is your friend fucking too?
(Ooh, Boaw!) I’m killing her too
Plan B, you can fuck her for free
Make sure that shit don’t get back to wifey
Skeet on her cheek, fuck her one time a week
Get a Plan B, ‘cause I know I was geeked
Fucking this bitch, went to sleep
I got to get this bitch a Plan B
She fucking that nigga, that nigga, then me
I just want that mouth, ‘cause I know it’s on fleek!
I gave a bitch a Plan B (Open your mouth)
‘Cause she was my plan B (Side bitch)
I got my hoe on a leash (Get over here)
She a real trapper in the streets
My niggas don’t mean no harm, unless you come handling me (My niggas don’t mean it)
Cookie bag and a Percocet, that’s what applied to me (I’m geeking)
The dab is not a sneeze (Dab)
I fuck her once, then she leave (Smash)
She only got her fucking keys; I give her phone down the street1Embed
