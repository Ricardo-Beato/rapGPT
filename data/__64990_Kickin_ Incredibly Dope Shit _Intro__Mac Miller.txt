45 ContributorsKickinâ€™ Incredibly Dope Shit (Intro) Lyrics
When you're young, not much matters
When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got
When you go to sleep at night, you dream of music
When you wake up, it's the same thing
It's there in your face, you can't escape it
Sometimes when you're young
The only place to go is inside, that's just it
Music is what I love
Take that away from me and I really got nothing
Hah-hah
This shit right here, this feel like a million bucks
Jerm, make sure I'm coming through clear here
Most Dope, what it is?
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to K.I.D.S., uh

Motherfucker, I feel like the hardest working kid in America
Playing with the pros, I remember being amateur
But now I'm rocking shows, see the lights from the camera phones
See my people and they hands is up
Yeah, the game a girl, trying to tease, but don't plan to fuck
My older brother told me that I'm finally manning up, 'cause
I've been a fuckup, if you ask me
But I'm still praying that my teachers gon' pass me
Letters from my soul, scriptures from the Torah
Only give you what you like, I'm a station on Pandora
Rock a sag, my girl tell me pull my shorts up
Rock solid, homie, I'm built Ford tough
Sip a little lean, smoke a little weed
We just trying to keep it cool, so we blast the AC
Some people hate, we tell 'em it's all gravy
Yeah, you got your team, but I'm fighting with the navy
Battle to the top
We in it to win it, we won't stop
No more going to stores, but don't cop shit
Never go another day with empty pockets
Houston, you there? We balling like the Rockets
And now these eyeballs dropping out they sockets
High honor roll, but not thinking 'bout a college
Love with these rhymes, want the cover of Time
Man of the Year, got my image stuck in your mind
Hold up one second
Girl, this my last L, I'ma roll it up with you
Cop some brand new shoes, put me in a good mood
I'ma bring a couple homies, you can call a couple friends
Is there a type of alcohol that you would recommend?
Being young so fun, I don't ever want to age
Haven't came down in the past five days
Just trying to tell it like it is, we the shit
You now dealing with some motherfuckin' kids
You might also like
What?
Rostrum Records in this bitch (Hah-hah)
Thank y'all for tuning in (What up, E?)
Let me do what I do
Most Dope, thumbs up, Pittsburgh
What up, Taylor Gang?
RD, ID Labs, Benji
Big Jerm, everybody, man
Let's do it, yeah
It's my time right now
K.I.D.S., kicking some incredibly dope shit
