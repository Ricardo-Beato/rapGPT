40 ContributorsAUTOBOTO Lyrics
Yeah, man, you know, how you doing? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't nothing to it, ain't nothing to it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Welcome back, you feel me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ha, Trakk, what up? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah

I defend myself in court, this is sport, I get signals from the source
I can twist and I contort, I just feel like I'm a Porsche
I'm Carrera, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
-era, -еra, -era, -era, -era, -еra
I defend myself in court, this is sport, I get signals from the source
I can twist and it contorts, I just feel like I'm a Porsche
I'm Carrera, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
-era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
Ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err

Lies to the judge, rain in the sky
And the sea might rise what slides to the mud
Sty's to the flies from all kinds of demise
Reporting live from the hive and all sides of the sludge
One deep meditate, one street separate
"Hi" to the Crips, "Goodbye" to the Bloods
But it was the Souls, the Lords and GDs
Segregated by the street in the Chi' where I was
Got wise to the nudge
Why buy a tub when they bayou'll flood? Better buy you a sub
How you gon' survive in the club?
You gon' kayak it 'cause when it rise up above
And the waves come in push and the tidals'll shove
What's an infrared dot to a whole dot gov?
Look right in the eyes of a thug
Lil' dumb street shit don't apply to the plug
You might also like
I defend myself in court, this is sport, I get signals from the source
I can twist and I contort, I just feel like I'm a Porsche
I'm Carrera, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
-era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
I defend myself in court, this is sport, I get signals from the source
I can twist and it contorts, I just feel like I'm a Porsche
I'm Carrera, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
-era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
Ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err

My warning shots headshots, cut off all my dreadlocks
I ain't wanna headwash no more
What you mean headshot? Nigga said headshots
Nigga like a helmet with a GoPro but I mean Golgo
13, genius 'cause the verse mean
'Member we earthlings, nigga, can you put that in slow-mo?
Hope so, headshots
Brains in a pan, so that's a no-no
Might not get it, but it's dope though, matter fact, loco
Surrounded by gang members and a lot of po-po
That's real but it might sound like a joke though
Never know, keep both sides in a chokehold
I just wanted credit, used to sweat it like show clothes
Now I don't even know who wrote those
Maybe my ghost knows (Boo) but we both cold
I done used to write all my ghost flows, wrote each other solos (Boo)
Now the nigga say he want co-pros
Money from the shelves and rights to the logo (Boo, boo)
"Do you want a lawyer?" No, ho
I defend myself in court, this is sport, I get signals from the source
I can twist and I contort, I just feel like I'm a Porsche
I'm Carrera, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
-era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
I defend myself in court, this is sport, I get signals from the source
I can twist and it contorts, I just feel like I'm a Porsche
I'm Carrera, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
-era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era, -era
Ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err, ee-err

I defend myself in court, yes, yes, this a sport, yes
Signals from the source, yeah, twist and contort, yes
Feel like I'm a Porsche, just like a Porsche
Yes, I'm Carrera (-era, -era, -era, -era)
I defend myself in court, yes, yes, this a sport, yes
Signals from the source, yeah, twist and contort, yes
Feel like I'm a Porsche, just like a Porsche
Yes, I'm Carrera (-era, -era, -era, -era)
I defend myself in court, yes, yes, this a sport, yeah
Signals from the source, yeah, twist and contort, yes
Feel like I'm a Porsche, yes, just like a Porsche, yes
Yes, it's Carrera (-era, -era, -era, -era)5Embed
