I’m like Kubrick
With 2 bricks
And hoes on the strip
Off a 2 piece
A toothpick I flick
And I preach
Bout how I’m a get this money out here up in the streets
In the Caddy Ron Isley on between in the sheets
And a way a nigga work make a grip in a week
I’m a chill with this freak
Sniff a gram and a half
Plus her pussy juicier than Shalamar curl bag
While she draw me a bath
Roll a blunt then passed
Jiggled and giggled her booty
Couldn’t do nothing but laugh
Credit cards separating
White lines on a mirror
Roll a 100 dollar bill
Now my sinus all clearer
Flat screen porn on
Watching Asa Akira
Nothing on but my pinky ring
Sniff when I get up
On the balcony drunk
Like the world is mine
Staggering inside with my robe untied
You might also like
So fuck waiting round
Nigga I’m about to get it
Dog I’m tryna eat
So I’m staying in the kitchen
Hunched over the stove
Gotta water water whip it
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring
Packing up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping
Lost on the sauce but a nigga ain’t flipping
Cutting up the hard like the yard ain’t filling

I'm like Spielberg
With ill words and hoes on that curb
Gotta screw loose
I'm cuckoo
Mentally disturbed
But still smart enough
To hit this bitch wit a rubber
And with ya wrinkle pussy
Hoe can’t be ya lover
But I still get the head
If you swallow with bubbles
I'm a Linwood nigga I done traveled the world
Made a name for myself use to serve on the curb
Now my words worth a bird
I could front you a zip
Made a million in a year and I still ain’t trip
Bout to put my niggas on make a million for them
Show you that you can make it without acting like them
Do you lil nigga go out there and just get it
Gotta have a hardback
Because these niggas gon’ whip it
Do you lil nigga get up out there get it
Gotta have a hardback
Because these niggas gon’ whip it
So fuck waiting round
Nigga I’m about to get it
Dog I’m tryna eat
So I’m staying in the kitchen
Hunched over the stove
Gotta water water whip it
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring
Packing up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping
Lost on the sauce but a nigga ain’t flipping
Cutting up the hard like the yard ain’t filling25Embed
