4 ContributorsWhat Do They Know Lyrics
It's OK that you got two kids
Got no man
Working two jobs and got no friends
All on your own and got no hands
And it's alright that you leave on your own
Handling on your own
Got two feet and you stand on your own
Girl, you look better when you standing alone
It's OK!
You stay in the house, never go out
Low profile and you never show out
You stay within your circle so no man can ever hurt you
Even if he know how!
It's alright that you don't know how to love
You've been too busy finishing school all in a new city
And TLC, nigga you feel un-pretty
Bitch fly and the motherfucker
It's OK if you don't smoke weed, don't drink much!
You talk too low and you never say much!
Appreciate life and you never hate much!
It's alright if you've got no ass, got no hips
Dance all alone on this night out
Bitch, you're beautiful from the inside out!
Yeah, it's cool, your heart turned cold
Enough's enough cause the last nigga done fucked it up
Now you're just single, never want another nigga
Never wanna give your heart again!
It's alright!
It's snowing and it's gonna rain
First comes joy and then comes pain, yeah
No one's perfect, and it's no way
And I just want to let you know it's OK!

It's OK that you never had sex, never had dick
Never give it up to a nigga that quick
How many women could say that shit?
