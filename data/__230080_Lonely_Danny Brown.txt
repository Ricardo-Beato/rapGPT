48 ContributorsLonely Lyrics
Hé bien peut-être l'oiseau
L'oiseau qui dormait en chacun de nous
S'élèvera

Hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel
Everybody thirsty, and they looking for a refill
If the gang eating, guns barking at your doggy bag
Get took out for your take out now you carry out
Murder by delivery, married at the Paramount
I just coughed up a fair amount of niggas might air it out
Judge a book by cover, so we never educated
It ain't about races, poor and rich segregated
Just to get the bacon, dog, you gotta go HAM
Use to be lost until I found who I am
But it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands
Locked, tryna get real creative with some Spam
Glock tend to jam cause a nigga serve butter
Just to get a little bread had to keep the mayo smothered
All I really wanted was to overdub my vocals
But no one ever thought that I would take it past local
High like 'top a totem, man, somebody shoulda told 'em
That if money grow on trees, being rich is dime a dozen

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self—I don't need your help, homie
'Cause don't nobody really know me
Say, nobody really know me
You might also like
See, that's going on a limb
And I used to sell trees, and I used to rock Timbs
Radiohead shit: Fiends with the bends
Back when Granny used to tell me "Stay Out of In"
Letting the cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts
Gone for three days, ain't nobody ever heard about—
How I got them Jordans, but that ain't too important
When I got a bitch pregnant, and I'm stacking for abortion
And all I really wanted was to give myself a portion
Lit up off the Henny, got a nigga self-absorbing
Smoking on a bogey, no bust-down, who can I trust now?
A lady snitchin', got the whole block down
Now, we gon' eat now
No rebound when you're boxed-out, belly of the beast now
Now, you got me feeling trapped, and I can't look back
When the road ahead is gold and the past is made of ash
And I'm going through the trash, tryna find a little treasure
Living for the better, tryna get myself together

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self—I don't need your help, homie
'Cause don't nobody really know me
Said nobody really know me8Embed
