4 ContributorsSpellbound (The Original) LyricsSolo don't spell like this one, Know what I'm sayin'?
Need to get at me with dat dumb shit
Hit me dawg. Hey Wood, what's up dawg
Ohh, Uhh. Check it out yall. Big vees on the muthf**king tables
This how it's goin dizzee
Spell Bound
It ain't hard to tell
You go crazy, when the S-P-E-L-L
You won't catch it or match it
But ounce you how much it
Heats up the crowd
Yo beats but won't touch it
As long as I'm the D-M-X
The rhymes are D-O-B-E cold
D-A-M-E-G-E-N- E-M-C-E-E
I K-I-L-L the K-I-L-L to W-O-R-K U-N-T-I-L
I hit the fest and up the best of them all
S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G until they fall
Dropping like an F-L-Y the T-R-Y to get built
The D-M-X will allways die
Another body in the M-O-R-G-U-E
You will be trying to battle and can't emcee
S-P-E-L-L-B-O-U-N-D this the S-T-Y-L-E I like the to U-S-E
When I am rhyming I R-I-P-P-I-N-G
Get picked on timing I'm in my P-R-I-M-E
The D-M-X E-L-I-M-I-N-A-T-S C-O-M-P-E-T-I-T-I-O-N and the rest
My hoe in K-R-E-S the dub B-R-O-N-X
Mahnhattan, Brooklyn or G-U-E-E-N-S
S ment I ment for O-M
And I'm gone have to show them
But if they R-P-I-T-E or S I do not they them
How can I S-P-E-L-L
You might also like
W-E-L-L
Raising some H-E-L-L
Weighting to be L-L
Staying after T-O-P
I'm R-U-G-G-E-D
And if you went to Do B-E-T-T-L-E then see me
But you will L-O-S-E-H-E-I-N-S-T
Me the D-M-X cause I'm the D-O-P-E-S-T
I'll allways be a A-T- and A E-M-C-E-E
There hasen't been a part to S-T-E-P -T-O- M-E
S-T-Y-L-E that is W-I-L-D
