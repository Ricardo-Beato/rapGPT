10 ContributorsOn Paparazzi, Celebrities, and Activists Lyrics
The problem I have with the paparazzi is if they’re right in front of you and you’re like, “Can you please not take a picture of me?” And they’re like, “Dude I’m not really taking a picture,” and they just keep on doing it like they’re talking to me like I’m stupid and stuff, and then, with arm sprints, I’m going to grab the camera, that just happens, and you don’t expect that to happen with a celebrity, cause you think they’re like a museum animal and stuff, but it’s like, don’t shoot the animals, then, maybe, I don’t know.

What’s interesting, though, the problem is that once you do something like that, the word’s out. And these guys know that a shot of you losing your temper is worth ten times more then a shot of you remaining calm. So it’s kind of a no-win situation a little bit.

Well except for the fact that I’m going to do something about it. You know, I’m going to make a change. I think it’s my responsibility. My mom, she got arrested for being in the sit-ins at age 6. My grandfather drove the first car at the marches leaving out of Oklahoma. My father was an activist, so I think they just like, messed with the wrong celebrity just now.

Right. Okay so you’re letting them know, leave me alone.2Embed
