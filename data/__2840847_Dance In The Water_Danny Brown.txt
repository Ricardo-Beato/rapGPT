Can you work it
Can you work it
Break it down
And just drop it low
You deserve it
You deserve it
Get it out
And let it all go
Shake it
Don’t break it
Bend over
And touch yo toes
You been waiting
You been waiting
Real playa
Get down on the floor
I know lately I know lately
You been feeling
Like you wanna let loose
No debating
No debating
Do your thing
And just do you
No hating
No hating
Whatever it's
All on you
Put it on me
Put it on me
Lemme tell ya
What we gon' do

Gone head and own it
When you get it

Go and give it to em right
Cause you earned it
Here we go now

Don’t stop what you’re doing
Don’t slow down
Gone take that

Remix on a mixtape
Better get back

They ain’t know
You could do it like that
Can I hit that

Like a champion
Boxing title match
Dance in the water

Make a playa
Wanna go say his wedding vows
Don’t stop now

Keep it going
Just gone head get down
I mean right now

See you showing off
Gone head show out
Do you like that

Can’t never fall off
Get it right back

Bout to body slam

Gotta fever

Only remedy is you
And I need ya
He a monster
He a creature
He a tie you up
And then eat ya
