5 ContributorsTwo Words (Cinematic) Lyrics

Throw your hands up high
'Til they reach the sky


Throw your hands up high
'Til they reach the sky


Red, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)
Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin' "who is that?"
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Ghetto people get this shit off ya chest
North to the south, to the east, to the west
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest
(High) And show it to 'em likeYou might also likeEmbed
