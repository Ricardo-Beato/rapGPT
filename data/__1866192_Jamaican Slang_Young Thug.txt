(Cardo)
Yeah
Blatt, blatt, Zoo Crew, Dulu
Haha, yeah
Ayy (Swamp, Swamp Izzo)

I guess I got your respect
'Cause that Indian got your back, girl (Yeah)
I want you to drop it low
Pick it up and bring it back, girl (Yeah)
And I know you see me in this club with these bands on me
Stayed four songs, then she ran down me
Caught up with us, set plans on me (Yeah)

Yeah, I got rose gold chains 'round my neck 'cause I'm a black dude (Shinin')
She didn't wanna fuck me (Why?), she wanna fuck my tattoos (Truly)
I will tat dude (Blat), I will splat dude (Splat, splat)
My blunts the largest, smokin' Pee Wee's garden (Wheezy)
In the club with fifty hoes, ain't none one of them arguin' (They not)
Weed give me the munchies, might just eat tamale, I'm starvin
Give 'em Biggie, still ballin'
Shouts out to GM, free UnkFunk, G and Marley
Ooh, and I'll miss you baby
You know I-I love you babe
She runnin' circles 'round a nigga like the equator
I gotta date her, I wouldn't rape her, I gotta skate her
(Hold up, let's go)
You might also like
I guess I got your respect
'Cause that Indian got your back, girl (Yeah)
I want you to drop it low
Pick it up and bring it back, girl (Yeah)
And I know you see me in this club with these bands on me
Stayed four songs, then she ran down me
Caught up with us, set plans on me (Yeah, Swamp, Swamp Izzo)

I got hoes breathin' all over my dick like it's a heart (And what?)
I got tons of that weight livin' in my house like Bubba Sparxxx
Got a tall lightskinned ho that like to get tats, she a work of art
Got a bitch number in my phone
Don't call her phone 'less I need her card, oh
You flyin' with me, or you gon' stay with them?
Baby, use your head, you can't lay with them (Okay cool, you trippin')
Not a kid, baby play with 'em (Watch out)
That nigga, that boy say one assist, that's a pair of Timbs
And I'll miss you baby, I love you baby
I was leanin' when I mugged you, babe
And you know I was horny when I rubbed you, babe (Let's go)

I guess I got your respect
'Cause that Indian got your back, girl (Yeah)
I want you to drop it low
Pick it up and bring it back, girl (Yeah)
And I know you see me in this club with these bands on me
Stayed four songs, then she ran down me
Caught up with us, set plans on me2Embed
