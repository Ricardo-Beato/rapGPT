5 ContributorsCompetition Interlude Lyrics[Question:
Are you still competitive in the rap game?]

Uhhm, competition is different these days
That competition is competing for my awesome fan base
My awesome fans
Attention, you know what I mean
For them to still say that they love me
And competing for they love and competing for them to still fucking with me
Things like that
Thatâ€™s my competition these days and I love itYou might also likeEmbed
