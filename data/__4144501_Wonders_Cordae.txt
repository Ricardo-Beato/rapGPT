8 ContributorsWonders Lyrics
Awe shucks
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Hop up on the track with the super funky flow
With these instrumentals, I be putting on a show
Cuz I'm itching for some dough
I could really use some mo
Because I'm poor as hell, my people living in poverty
Tryna get a record deal, but they never acknowledge me
They continue to sign these rappers that sound legitimate
I remade the sound, but still be spitting the illest shit
But I'ma do it big to pay the bills for my mother
I kick it with the Tundra cuz he's known to bring the hunda
I wonder
Why they always knock the brother down
That was underground
But wants to wear the mainstream crown
Wow, please someone give me an explanation
Of the constant hating
On the new Baltimore rap sensation
He goes by Raff Alpha
He's supa, dupa clever
Yelling out, "Rest in Peace to Nelson Mandela"

I'm wondering, will we ever made it out the slumps?
I'm wondering, will our time ever come?
I'm wondering if we ever make it out
If Lord give me chance, I'ma take it now
I'm wondering, will we ever made it out the slumps?
I'm wondering, will our time ever come?
I'm wondering if we ever make it out
If Lord give me chance, I'ma take it now

Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Yeah, uh

It seems that the underground, it start to come around
No radio, so there's no need to dumb it down
I spent the lightning, thunder sound
It make me run the town
Ain't no use to you, running now
We already sonned you clowns
But I'ma make it, I'm confident
They intolerant
But in the future they gon' all know who Entendre is
Wondering about the far skies, whether apartheid
Tired of the dark lies, they say in our eyes
Fuck a history, life is misery with its enemies
Get you mentally, was meant to be this way essentially
For centuries, my niggas been stuffed in penitentiaries
To infinity, they want us all gone eventually
Fuck America, cause hysteria and the chaos
Cuz in my area, life's a gamble like Las Vegas
And they watch me rap off Omega
And may God
I'm wondering, will we ever made it out the slumps?
I'm wondering, will our time ever come?
I'm wondering if we ever make it out
If Lord give me chance, I'ma take it now

Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Yeah, uh

Aye, mother nature's fresh green leaves
Freezing up the paper that we coil
Nigga Giovanni lacks the huge, rooted from the soil
We use it for oil, fueling my aura
When it get sports, with that raw shit that's never gonna spoil
Check the aura, ah
I used to flow from the mainstream
From the rivers to the lakes, creeks
Until I figured out that the swimmer would never shake me
Flapping my fin
You see they attack swimmers safely
Got that ocean flow, that swallowed though, that spaced me
Styling free, with the spirit of the bigs
Lord is killing them softly till they graves, don't you dig
He's taking a swig of the roots that he's made me
I'm the Raff Alpha of these double entendres baby
