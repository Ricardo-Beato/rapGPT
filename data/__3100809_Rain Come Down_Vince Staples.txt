98 ContributorsRain Come Down Lyrics
When the sun goes down
When the J goes 'round
In the middle of the night
Bet your girl goes down
Rain come down

Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down (And the rain)
Rain come down
Did ya man lay down?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Rain come down)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Rain come down)

I'm the man, ten toes in the street
I'm the blood on the leaves, I'm the nose on the Sphinx
Where I'm from we don't go to police
Where I'm from we don't run, we just roll with the heat
I'm the back of the bus, take a seat
Take a ride on my side where we die in the street
And the cops don't come for some weeks
No, the cops don't come for some weeks
Riding in a drop top, sun where I think
Might get JFK'd, hope not I pray if
If so, ain't no thang to a G
I feel just like Snoop on Andre Day
I run North Side of the beach
Run these streets like Ali Bomaye
I'm Lou' Bourgeois on the beat
Best bet, try not to compete
You might also like
When the sun goes down
When the J goes 'round
In the middle of the night
Bet your girl goes down
Rain come down

I'm the man, ten toes in the street
I'm the blood on the leaves, I'm the nose on the Sphinx
Where I'm from we don't go to police
Where I'm from we don't run, we just roll with the heat
I'm the back of the bus, take a seat
Take a ride on the side where we die in the street
And the cops don't come for some weeks
No, the cops don't come for some weeks
Ride in the drop top, sun where I think
Might get JFK'd, hope not I pray if
If so, ain't no thang to a G
I feel just like Snoop on Andre Day
I run North Side of the beach
Run these streets like Ali Bomaye
I'm Lou' Bourgeois on the beat
Best bet, try not to compete

When the sun goes down
When the J goes 'round
In the middle of the night
Bet your girl goes down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down (And the rain)
Rain come down
Did ya man lay down?

Paid a pretty penny for my peace of mind
Never need a girl to love me, I just need 'em fine
On Parisian time, don't be trippin' on a text back
In another world, Covergirl, but her chest flat
Two page spread in the CR
Think it was for Wang
Can't remember spring or fall, read it on a plane
Long flights playin' with my brain
Long nights, long summers we in Spain
Car color of La Haine
She getting naked under covers for the fame
She don't wanna be another what's-her-name
Brown skin, blonde brain, Etta James
Make it rain in the club
Don't you dream of how it feel to be in love?
What, you drinking? Need a buzz?
Don't drown in the brown, just drown in the sound
When the sun goes down
When the J goes 'round
In the middle of the night
Bet your girl goes down
Rain come down

Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down (And the rain)
Rain come down
Did ya man lay down?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Rain come down)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Rain come down)12Embed
