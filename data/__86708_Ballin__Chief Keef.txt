58 ContributorsBallinâ€™ Lyrics
I used to tell people like:
Imma buy this, Imma buy that, Imma get this, Imma get a car, Imma be famous before you
I'ma be rich before you
My sister thought she gon' be rich before me even though she young
They thought I was gonna be some motherfuckin' screw up or somethin', they thought I was gon' be like bad all my life
She thought she was gonna be a lawyer, before I be a rapper or somethin', she crazy
(How old is your sister?)
She thirteen now
The lil kid is crazy, all the little kids are crazy, everybody crazy....
Know what I'm sayin' and that's when I started off......
I got a job now, I got a daughter too
So, gotta make it happen
(It's a LeekeLeek banger)
Sosa baby, GBE baby
You know how we rockin', baby
LeekeLeek, what it do, baby?
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'

Bad bitches keep callin'
I swear this money keep fallin'
I'm best friends with Ben, shawty
I don't even want you darlin'
'Cause I'm ballin' (Ballin', ballin')
Bitch, I'm ballin' (I'm ballin', I'm ballin', ballin', ballin')
