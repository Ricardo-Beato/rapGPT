34 ContributorsW.W.Y.D. Lyrics
Niggas waiting on me to fumble (Yeah)
Niggas waiting on me to fumble
Put my head up to the sky (Yeah)
Put it in your head then you die (Yeah)
It ain't a lie (Yeah, yeah)
Niggas ain't want me to...
True, true, true (Yeah)
True, true, true, true (Yeah, bang bang)
(Damn) Sosa, baby (Damn, damn)
GBE, baby (Put my head up, damn, damn, ayy )
Glo Gang, baby (Damn, damn, damn)
Blood Gang, baby (Damn, damn)
Situation Gang, baby (Damn, damn)
Get-It Gang, baby (Damn, damn)
Fifth Gang, baby
Get-It Gang, baby, baby, baby

What would you do if I get in my coupe?
What would you do if I win and you lose?
What would you do if I'm up and you snooze?
What would you do? I came through with two tools
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do? (What would you do?)
What would Jesus do? What would you do?
You might also like
Pull up, they like, "Sosa, that's you?" It's true
And I got on my damn Trues with a few
Bands in my pants, these booled ups
True'd up, glo'd up, you know it, and poled up
So what? Nigga, glo up
Get mo' bucks, no slow bucks
Glo bucks, O' bucks
Green bucks, blue bucks
Come through, Ku Klux
What would you do? Uh
If I came through with rugers

What would you do if I get in my coupe?
What would you do if I win and you lose?
What would you do if I'm up and you snooze?
What would you do? I came through with two tools
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do?
What would Jesus do? What would you do?

What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do? What would you do?
What would you do? What would you do?
If ya grandma house was a two bedroom
What would you do?
If you left yo tool and you know you snooze
What would you do?
If you making big moves and the cops behind you
What would you do?
Take a step in my shoes, I do not snooze, I do not lose
Bitch, I got guap, what about her? What about you?
What would you do if I up these poles, throw them at you?
I'm rolling with my tool in a bad mood, what would you do?
Pull up on an opp and let that bitch rip like duruh-duh-duh
Scoodah-scoodah-scoo, duruh-duh-duh
Scoodah-scoo-scoo, scoodah-duh-duh
Scoodah-scoodah-scoo
Pull up on an opp, let that bitch rip like
Duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh
What would you do if you was still in the hood?
Pull up where the guap at, nigga, I am about that
You ain't talking 'bout that
Boy, you better get that, before I let six shots
At your six pack
I been coolin' where the guap at, you ain't talking 'bout that
Go where ya skies at
What would you do?
If I came through in a drop-top, knock ya top back
