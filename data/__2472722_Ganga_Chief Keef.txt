Ayy
I told that bitch she ain't coming with me, man
She gotta...
Bitch, she ain't sitting around me for more than three, four hours, man
Bitch gotta get away from me, ASAP, man, you know
Rocky, man

I told a bitch she ain't coming with us (You can't come with me, bitch)
She know I got this money with us (You know I got this money, bitch)
She know ain't nothing between us (She know ain't nothin' between, bitch)
She wasn't on shit 'til the ganja pulled up (Until the ganja pulled in)
Until the ganja pulled up, until the ganja pulled up
Until the ganja pulled up, until the ganja pulled up
Until the ganja pulled up, the ganja pulled up
Until the ganja pulled up, the ganja pulled up

She seen the weed and started to geek
It's an honor to sit by me
Say her boyfriend stalking in the club
I done told her to sit by me
It's a honor to get kicked by me
Honor to get touched by me
More green than a Christmas tree
She's honored to get fucked by me
Hopped in the whip, she like, "What 'bout me?"
I told the bitch don't worry 'bout me
She say she wanna just love on me
I told the bitch don't care 'bout me
Hate these fuck niggas sneak dissing 'bout me
You ain't my partner, fuck your, "Howdy"
Riding in the M6, pull up and fuck your Audi
These bitches, they be hissing like some lizards
These cats want to bite me, I'm no Stuart Little
If I ain't have this cash, I'd be miserable
Sosa Wayne, bitch, I lost my ceilings too
You might also like
I told a bitch she ain't coming with us (You can't come with me, bitch)
She know I got this money with us (You know I got this money, bitch)
She know ain't nothing between us (She know ain't nothin' between, bitch)
She wasn't on shit 'til the ganja pulled up (Until the ganja pulled in)
Until the ganja pulled up, until the ganja pulled up
Until the ganja pulled up, until the ganja pulled up
Until the ganja pulled up, the ganja pulled up
Until the ganja pulled up, the ganja pulled up

I'm smoking dope, you smoking the ew, E-40 I'm sipping mud
Pimp C in my pimp cup, DJ Screw me up
If you getting money, lift your money up
Shooter, lift your toolie up
Icy watch, nigga, put it up
Fake Watch Busta can't put you up
This dope smoke like I'm cooking it
I done put my foot in it
I gotta get the car, 'cause I put my head in it
If I put my head in it that mean it's a gotta get
I know what jail like, I don't want no sandwiches
I hop on and demolish you
My shoes, have 'em polish it
My car, have 'em wax it
I get that thousand dollar shit
I talk it 'cause I'm walkin' it
My bitch Lara Croft-ing it
The green so damn conceited, he like, "You walkin', bitch"
I told a bitch she ain't coming with us (You can't come with me, bitch)
She know I got this money with us (You know I got this money, bitch)
She know ain't nothing between us (She know ain't nothin' between, bitch)
She wasn't on shit 'til the ganja pulled up (Until the ganja pulled in)
Until the ganja pulled up, until the ganja pulled up
Until the ganja pulled up, until the ganja pulled up
Until the ganja pulled up, the ganja pulled up
Until the ganja pulled up, the ganja pulled upEmbed
