10 ContributorsCocaine Lyrics
Where did you get this stuff?
Columbia
Oh, uhh... well, do you mind if I do a line?
Yeah, go ahead
Fuck it, let's all do one
I can't feel my face
I mean I can touch it, but I can't feel it inside

Cocaine
I know police is watchin' (I see 'em watchin')
Cocaine
Hustlin', I'm not stoppin' (I got to eat)
Cocaine
I got to get my money
You think shit is funny
Me, I'm 'bout my business (You're motherfuckin' right)
Cocaine

Columbian girl, Peruvian chick
She make the money roll and I love the bitch
Know she ain't a virgin, but she pure
For the right price I'll let you fuck with her raw
I roll like a pimp, I'm your pusher man
She could make us both rich nigga, yes, she can
You want your own spot, let's talk locations
Then talk market and the public relations
You might also like
Everybody's watchin', yeah
But no one talks about it, shut your mouth
Right now there's only one name you can't call it, ha-ha
She said ''Sex just ain't the same without it'', woo

Cocaine
I know police is watchin' (See 'em watchin')
Cocaine
Hustlin', I'm not stoppin' (I ain't stoppin')
Cocaine
I got to get my money (I've got to eat)
You think shit is funny
Me, I'm 'bout my business
Cocaine

Every little step I take (come on), you will be there
Every little step I make (look, bitch), we'll be together
So grateful (yeah), so faithful (uhh)
Every gram in the hand's more paper (c'mon)
I'll cut it, you sniff it, or smoke it, terrific

Movie stars, models and blondes and cocaine, yeah
New York, L.A. â€“ it all the same, come on
The angels look the other way
'Cause they can understand my pain
Cocaine
I know police is watchin' (I see 'em watchin')
Cocaine
Hustlin', I'm not stoppin' (No, I ain't stoppin')
Cocaine
I got to get my money (yeah)
You think shit is funny (come on)
Me, I'm 'bout my business
Cocaine

You niggas got a problem, yeah
A big motherfucking problem
At a minimum, I'ma have a nigga put speed knots all over your motherfucking head, ya dig?
Oh shit
