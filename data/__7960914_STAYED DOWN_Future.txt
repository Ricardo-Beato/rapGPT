25 ContributorsSTAYED DOWN Lyrics
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob

I got a sports car on my wrist and I'm bird fly
You can hear the money machine beepin' from outside
Nigga pillow talkin', talkin' ain't got they money right
I don't even wanna talk, nigga, unless I see the cash out
Zero to sixty, I get lost in a turbo
Medallions, pink diamonds, started from purple
Yeah, fully loaded, money machine, we some splurgers
He stayed down, got the money up, and now they can't serve us

I'm goin' Jimmy Choo on my new-new shit on purpose
She can get it too, ain't no fool, I'll curve her
If I borrowed your car, I'm sure I filled it up with chickens
Cappers stealing swag, they bitches poppin' on misses
Got more K in the Phantom, you wanna ride the Honda Civic
I'm okay with that hammer, I gotta ride with the extended
Shit be crackin' in the city every day (Every day)
Dropped an eight in a Fanta, I'm okay (Okay)
Penthouse, three stories, got trees in it
Spilled the drip all over, a bitch eatin' it
I threw the money in the vault, ain't even seen it
Money bags everywhere, Lamborghinis, yeah
You might also like
I got a sports car on my wrist and I'm bird fly
You can hear the money machine beepin' from outside
Nigga pillow talkin', talkin' ain't got they money right
I don't even wanna talk, nigga, unless I see the cash out
Zero to sixty, I get lost in a turbo
Medallions, pink diamonds, started from purple
Yeah, fully loaded, money machine, we some splurgers (Light it up, gang)
He stayed down, got the money up, and now they can't serve us (BMWG shit)

We make our own drugs so you niggas can't serve 'em (Nah)
Remix everything, Sproot make it do hurdles (Remix)
Jugg house jumpin' like a rabbit, yours turtle (Turn)
Everything I smoke exotic, nigga, all purple (Yeah)
I just ran a whole M through the money counter (Money counter)
Kept money from yesterday, I ain't even count it (Count up)
Quarter million, tried to break Blacka out the counter (Counter)
A thousand pounds on the road, all wrapped and downied (Road)
Jugg the truck, was servin' a load, all free bands (Yeah)
All my niggas bosses, working like some Mexicans (Like some Mexicans)
Lamborghini 'round my neck, Eliantte (Eliantte)
Hunnid racks just to pull up in the driveway (Street)

I got a sports car on my wrist and I'm bird fly
You can hear the money machine beepin' from outside
Nigga pillow talkin', talkin' ain't got they money right
I don't even wanna talk, nigga, unless I see the cash out
Zero to sixty, I get lost in a turbo
Medallions, pink diamonds, started from purple
Yeah, fully loaded, money machine, we some splurgers
He stayed down, got the money up, and now they can't serve usEmbed
