4 ContributorsWhat If Lyrics
What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

What if I never get the chance tell the world what I gotta say?
And when I die, all I do is just ride away
I try and talk about my life in every song
So you have a little somethin' to remember when I'm gone
I tell it like it is, I ain't pretendin' that I'm on
But I tell you that I'm workin' and I'm gettin' very strong
It won't be long 'til you hear me on the radio
But in my head, I got ways to go
But I'ma take it slow, businesses is the way to blow
So any place I go, I know my bank can roll
The old heads are schoolin' me, I'm takin' notes
I am hip-hop, it replaced my soul
If I sink to the bottom, then I'ma make a float
I heard the real world's cold, I'ma take a coat
Be prepared, and be aware 'cause failure ain't really even there
You might also like
What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

Expectations peakin', they wonder what I'm 'bout to do
Spark interest, music, I can count on you, right?
But do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to misfit in an instant
My friends forgot me 'cause they probably seen me hardly
In the lab when I should be out at a party
It drive me crazy, and money is the fuel
Insomniac, awake, findin' somethin' I can do to put the work in
And I'm certain that I'm flirtin' with the fame
Failure gettin' jealous, throwin' dirt upon my name
Burnin' up my brain, but I'm workin' through my pain
'Cause life's hard 'til you learn it's just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your Scrabble board
If you small, put your heart into your rappin' more
No money? Why the fuck you countin' for?
A thousand truants tryin' to get up my allowance more
What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?Embed
