Yeah
Come on, man (Dump, dump, dump)
You know this shit is ours, man, this is our field, man (Dump, dump, dump)
Y'all niggas need to just leave this shit to us (Dump, dump, dump)
Corny-ass niggas
Ayo, yeah (Dump, dump, dump)

That's that hard shit
That hit a nigga up in his car shit, this war, bitch
Somehow I feel we need more of the thing
Instinct to get that paper, know it's all in my vein
You rookies need to be toilet trained
You faggots shittin' everywhere that you eatin', that's why the coroner came
You never know when the TEC'll blow
Wet you and catch you off guard, niggas know that I crept slow
And never fold, bitch, hollows, we let 'em go
And hope them little drugs you sold cover your medical
Y'all don't wanna bump heads with us
Dump lead head-to-head with us (Nah)
And ain't no leggin', homie, neck and up
It come to beef, you know we cheffin' it up (All day, baby)
And ain't nobody do it better than us
Dry snitch and we wettin' you up (Dump, dump, dump)
You might also like
Many men try to set me up to watch me die
Tie me up and put me in the trunk, then wave bye-bye (Dump, dump, dump)
Everyone who know me know that I'm Mobb Deep and I
Keep it true and ain't afraid to shoot, so duck when I (Dump, dump, dump)
Ain't gon' catch me slippin' up
Ain't gon' catch me give it up (Dump, dump, dump)
Ain't gon' hear me creepin' up
Roll down the window, I'm about to (Dump, dump, dump)

Nigga, I'll smack that smirk right off your face
You listen to jerk music, this is Mobb Deep
You ain't never seen or heard no shit like this
Until you purchase our CD, it's very worth it
Don't confuse our album with that mixtape shit
Those our scraps, basically our throwaway shit
And nobody rap the street like the Infamous clique
Slashed Jive, now we got millions to work with
And we Violators too, so you know we overdoin' it
What's stoppin' the crew? Only death can ruin it (Bring it)
But we been there and done that and still they wanna come back and shoot us down (Blaow, blaow, blaow)
Our advice, you want somethin' done right, then you better come and do it yourself
We give shooters this shits, make OGs get they gun off the shelf
And blow the dust off they old snub-nose three pound (Dump, dump, dump)
Many men try to set me up to watch me die
Tie me up and put me in the trunk, then wave bye-bye (Dump, dump, dump)
Everyone who know me know that I'm Mobb Deep and I
Keep it true and ain't afraid to shoot, so duck when I (Dump, dump, dump)
Ain't gon' catch me slippin' up
Ain't gon' catch me give it up (Dump, dump, dump)
Ain't gon' hear me creepin' up
Roll down the window, I'm about to (Dump, dump, dump)

Shoot 'em up now, bang, bang
Don't fuck around with the wrong man
In every fucking city, it's the same thing
Don't be saying nothin' stupid to a grown man
Shoot 'em up now, bang, bang
It really ain't the same now, the game changed
Got me grippin' on my weapon just to maintain
Fill you full of holes and get my name changed

Many men try to set me up to watch me die
Tie me up and put me in the trunk, then wave bye-bye (Dump, dump, dump)
Everyone who know me know that I'm Mobb Deep and I
Keep it true and ain't afraid to shoot, so duck when I (Dump, dump, dump)
Ain't gon' catch me slippin' up
Ain't gon' catch me give it up (Dump, dump, dump)
Ain't gon' hear me creepin' up
Roll down the window, I'm about to (Dump, dump, dump)1Embed
