Yeah, just ride with a nigga
America's number one, you can bet on ya life!
Statik Selektah
Ride with a nigga like
America’s number one, you can bet on ya life!

Call me the general, pushing that new agenda through
For my millennials, troubled youth and the felons too
Tryna be perennial, but chance of livin' is minimal
She critical, exactly what made my niggas criminals
Typical AmeriKKKa, damn sure ain't no miracle
Word to Steezy, I’ma keep this shit lyrical
'Til I fall out my physical, all my verses is biblical, uh
Flowin' religiously, my delivery spiritual, uh
Feelin' invincible, this here is nothin' new
This is just principle, take notes, if I were you
They say I'm a clumsy king, how I be droppin' jewels
But see, the funny thing is I got lots to lose
Never no fucks to give, only one life to live
So I exchange my negative for a positive and it's all
Good Lord, the pen is way mighty than the sword
Who want war? I told you before

How I kicked in the door
With the rugged raw, back just to reinstall
What you niggas thought it was?
Yes, I’m a veteran, you just a comer up
I can teach you a lesson
How to get your hunger up
Homie ya
How I kicked in the door
With the rugged raw back just to reinstall
What you niggas thought it was?
Yes, I’m a veteran, you just a come up
About to teach you a lesson
How to get your fuckin' hunger up, nigga

Badmon, we ah run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All di gyal dem a come pree
But mi tell them that the buddy never come free
Badmon, we ah run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All di gyal dem a come pree
But mi tell them that the buddy never come free
Super predator, filthy AmeriKKKa
Burn the newspapers and the editors
My dead presidents ain’t dead enough
Blew a zip to the head, still ain't red enough
Pray to Jesus, hope he got you
No I'm not a chicken, I never listen to FOX News
Niggas built the country but never givin' they props due
Payin’ for my people, I'm still payin' for my pops dues
I'm royalty, my momma said it
I'm gold hearted, I'm scum headed
Lost soul in a promised land of promises
Gotta mask on, but no, I'm not anonymous
Built on my lonely, no accomplices
Light a L up for my accomplishments
I'm a real nigga, it's not a lot of 'em
If they were, then the cops probably shot at 'em
Badmon, we ah run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All di gyal dem a come pree
But mi tell them that the buddy never come free
Badmon, we ah run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All di gyal dem a come pree
But mi tell them that the buddy never come free

Yeah, I stomp the grounds in my Timberlands
Ain't nothin' colder than New York when that December in
The coldest shoulders, from average Joes and the simple mans
I pack the heat 'cause I'm known around to be simmerin'
That mean I'm finna hit the boilin' point like real soon
Man, I've been heatin' up, my self esteem been on the moon
The flow is hotter than volcanic craters near the equator
Any debaters is simply haters, they know that I'm greater
I be countin' my paper, forever fuck all the majors
Did it all on my own, don't owe nobody no favors
It's clear, I'm heir to the throne, I've been the best in my zone
Internationally known, forever Brooklyn's own
I mean, come on, but here's for the Presidents, the Congressmen, the Senators
Who got us all slavin' while they reapin' all the benefits
Got the world thinkin' that it's true 'bout what they said of us
AmeriKKKa's worst nightmare, the super predator14Embed
