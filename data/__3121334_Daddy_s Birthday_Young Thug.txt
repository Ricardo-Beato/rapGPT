98 ContributorsDaddyâ€™s Birthday Lyrics
Just a typical day in New York, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm high as fuck, yeah
Diamonds on me

Dropped out of school and bought myself a chain
I must've taught myself a million things
I'm out the trap, I can sell anything
I wish I would allow myself to hear that sold dream
I pray my daughter never ever experience no train
I told her Colgate, baby, you gotta keep your teeth straight

Yeah, bae, I'm flexing, ex textin' (Hold on, woah I'm just textin')
Brand new 'Rari, Smith and Wesson (Brand new 'Rari, woah, skrrt)
Made myself a balla, want my credit, yuh
Speaking of credit, bailiff owe me, I got credit, yuh
Vrrrm, V12, y'all ain't ready at all (Skrrt)
Trapping B's, I'm like "hurry up and buy"
Extra Draco for my pops, 'cause his birthday 4th of July
I'm so busy it's making me feel like I'm in and out my kids' lives (Hey!)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (I'm the father of six babies)
Oooh (You know what I'm sayin?)
New coupe, new shoes (New coupe, brand new shoes)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Red bottoms, I'm kicking shit, I'm flossing on you fools
(Flossin' on you)
Cameltoe big, I see the print inside her suit (Cameltoe)
Rose gold my jewelry up, and I'm in and out it too (In and out it)
Fuck 'em by the two and let them travel with a few (Fuck 'em hoes)

All this fuckin' money got me switchin' out my boo
I'm livin' right and I ain't ever read a book
Chanel vintage, you can put it on the books
The way I whip that pot, they charging me with cruelty, ayy
Yeah, don't try to stop me, don't you try to knock me
You see me got these crackers in the backpack
You gotta forgive my heart, I don't mean to stunt like that
(I don't mean to do that to you, you know what I'm sayin')

Red bottoms on, I'm at Met Gala (I'm 'bout to spaz)
Ain't playin', yeah, I want every problem (Bitch I'm 'bout to spaz)
Two thousand dollars for the newest snake collar (Snake, yeah)
Vintage swagger (Vintage swag), head dollar (ain't playin')
Rock clean (Rock clean), Balmains (C'mon let's get it)
Vintage swag (Just vintage hoe), New Celines (Just want my glasses)
Hands dirty (Hey), watch me turn 'em clean (Clean, clean)
Lil shawty hot (Magic), kerosene
I'ma kill by any means, favorite sound ching-ching
I spray her face with my genes, I'ma turn up with my team
New condo on 17th (New condo hoe)
I turn none to something (I turned nothin' to somethin')
AP match my jeans (AP), Converse is McQueen (woah)
Patek for my queen (Swag), gambling for these coins
Mattress in front of the swing (Uh-huh), private jet living (Pussy ass nigga)
I'm on go like beam (I'm on go), new bag with no strings
I put ice in my cup, indoor pool, no chlorine
Dropped out of school and bought myself a chain
I must've taught myself a million things
I'm out the trap I can sell anything
I wish I would allow myself to hear that sold dream
I pray my daughter never ever experience no train
I told her Colgate baby you gotta keep your teeth straight

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, New coupe, new shoes (New coupe, brand new shoes)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Red bottoms, I'm kicking shit, I'm flossing on you fools
(Flossin' on you)
Cameltoe big, I see the print inside her suit (Cameltoe)
Rose gold my jewelry up, and I'm in and out it too (In and out it)
Fuck 'em by the two and let them travel with a few14Embed
