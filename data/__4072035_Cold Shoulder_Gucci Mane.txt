26 ContributorsCold Shoulder Lyrics
Earl on the beat
(Hah)
(Guwop)

Young and reckless, rich and wealthy
Say health is wealth, that means I'm deadly
That's why they sweat me, successful black man
With a felony, but what you tellin' me?
Don't hire me so I bought the company
Bitch ain't shit funny, I'm not Bill Bellamy
They don't- they don't wanna see you ballin', that's what you tellin' me
I know you niggas see me rollin', that's what you tellin' me (Nyoom!) (Burr) Yeah, my diamonds polar
Gotta hit you with the cold shoulder, that's what you tellin' me

Young and reckless, patiently waitin' on you to test this
Got these diamonds on me up in every section
Every nigga 'round me really with the steppin'
Got a bitch look like Keisha, I call her Belly
You niggas gon' take it as if you let it (Let it)
I'ma say it myself, I won't send a message (Yeah)
If you run up on me, I'ma up and stretch 'em (Bow)
That money ahead of me
Eighteen a felon, I think that they scared of me
Fifty grand for a show if they heard of me
Come to that money, you cannot compare to me (Swear)
Stackin' that check, I'm not spendin' my salary (Nah)
You know that I'm with it, I swear it ain't no cappin' me
Steady be runnin', the police be after me
I'm goin' under if I let 'em capture me
Say you want smoke when you catch 'em, I got 'em
Straight out that North, bitch, I come from the bottom (Bottom)
Workin' that bitch so she called me a doctor
He reached for my neck and get hit with that chopper (Pop-pop)
Sippin' on drank and I swear I ain't stoppin'
I pour a deuce up inside of my bottle
Askin' for somethin', I ain't givin' a dollar
Get shot in the face if that bitch got a problem

Young and reckless, rich and wealthy
Say health is wealth, that means I'm deadly
That's why they sweat me, successful black man
With a felony, but what you tellin' me?
Don't hire me so I bought the company
Bitch ain't shit funny, I'm not Bill Bellamy
They don't- they don't wanna see you ballin', that's what you tellin' me
I know you niggas see me rollin', that's what you tellin' me (Nyoom!) (Burr) Yeah, my diamonds polar
Gotta hit you with the cold shoulder, that's what you tellin' me

Life is crazy, Gucci (Uh), frigid, human blizzard, gator, lizard
Thank the Lord (Lord), a quarter ticket just for thirty minutes (Lord, lord)
I'm so independent, in Atlantic like I own the buildin' (Uh)
Started- Started off with JC Penney's, now I rock Givenchy (Yeah)
Drop top, convertible Wop, my roof is in the trash (Trash)
Thought that I was slow, now I'm right back on they ass (They ass)
Cold shoulder hoes, man, I give a bitch a penny
Took a low, sold the bows and bought myself a Bentley (Yeah)
Heard that I was thirty up and now he get offended (Huh?)
Gave my nig a couple mil and now he independent (Huh)
Gave myself a record deal and I was independent (Yeah)
Cold shoulder, ho, ho, I don't know you, nigga

Young and reckless, rich and wealthy
Say health is wealth, that means I'm deadly
That's why they sweat me, successful black man
With a felony, but what you tellin' me?
Don't hire me so I bought the company
Bitch ain't shit funny, I'm not Bill Bellamy
They don't- they don't wanna see you ballin', that's what you tellin' me
I know you niggas see me rollin', that's what you tellin' me (Nyoom!) (Burr) Yeah, my diamonds polar
Gotta hit you with the cold shoulder, that's what you tellin' me
