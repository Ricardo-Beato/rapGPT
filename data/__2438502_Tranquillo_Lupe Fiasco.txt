41 ContributorsTranquillo Lyrics
Peace, no material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath, attain wisdom and refuse graft
And build upon what I built on and wisely regulate time I do have
Cause what is defeat? But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste, so I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove schism when the rules missin'
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships
Just invest in my business and appreciative of the rarity of my existence

'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout that love
For myself and all my niggas
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga
You might also like
I got bitches on bitches, all my dreams and my visions
I remember me fishin' out of canals in the trenches
Now a nigga be flossy, Rolls Royce lookin' glossy
Quick to put down a demo to get these haters up off me
I like to smoke to myself, I just try to improve
Let my son hold my strap while I swim laps in the pool
Told my daughter the rules which we all must abide
Your daddy was far from perfect, things we did to survive
I just wanted to fly, they always lookin' down on us
School district full of killers, I mean these niggas ferocious
Only violence and drugs, there was nothin' for us
All I had was this music, I couldn't afford to do much

'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout that love
For myself and all my niggas
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga
Young nigga say, ball
Cause he ain't really livin' life 'less he's down to roll the dice
Put it all on the line for a couple dollars
And a bad bitch that only think about him if he, call
Is it really worth the time and the effort?
Chasin' woodgrain and the leather
Puttin' pressure on the pedal, I don't want the devil
Hopin' he, fall
Feed him to his nonsense, mothafuck a contract
You don't need a handout, they gon' bring the bands out
Choppas make 'em stand down, good Lord
But you don't wanna be another nigga chasin' figures
That never really add up, white folk pass your
Face dyin' in the grass cause they wouldn't call the, law
Cause your hood is black and they think you're sellin' crack
Maybe so, you don't give a fuck in a rut nigga
'Til those in the street got you stuck nigga, what nigga?
Buck buck nigga
Buried your partner just the other day knowin' he was too young
Had a tool, tryna roll on the folk
Let it go on the folk but he wasn't down to shoot one
Though the time dead and gone, is YOLO what we on?
I heard different, it's never too late to listen and be reborn
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga, go be reborn
Peace and understandin' is what you should be on
My nigga just, ball
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout that love
For myself and all my niggas
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga12Embed
