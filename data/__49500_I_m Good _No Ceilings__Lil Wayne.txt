27 ContributorsI’m Good (No Ceilings) Lyrics
Uhh... Uh
No Ceilings, nigga
Got T in here, Fuq' in here
Streets in here, Lucc' in here
We in here, biatch!

Okay
Boston Red Sox cap, I get baseball money
Used to do it big, but now bitch, I do it Paul Bunyan
Cincinnati Reds cap, skinny jeans, black Chucks
Hollywood shotgun — Watch me make it act up
Saints cap, new car — Paint that, if it ain't black
Red light, press a button, make the top faint back
That was tough, so are us
No such thing as sobered up
You closed-minded, I shoot you in your head, I'll bet you open up
High yellow woman with her hair to her ass
Bring her home, fuck her like a bear, then I crash
And when it comes to head, I get that head of the class
I got them green-backs, like I laid in the grass
Lucci be my nigga
The East up in the buildin'
Young Mula ba—
The blank's already filled in
Fire alarm dick, them bitches wanna pull
Weezy Baby, nigga, I ain't just good
Motherfucker, I'm—

Yeah
Still no job, bitch, but I ain't hurtin
Phone still ringin, so I'm still workin
Got coke for the snorters, drank if you slurpin'
Even got a couple pills for if your back hurtin'
Uhh, they call me Mr. Pharmaceutical
I'm gettin' money every time I'm in the studio
I'm gettin' money, bitch, even when I do a show
I get the money even if I have to sue a ho
That's how the game go
Eastside play it cold
We love the new coupes
We love our necks froze
You couldn't be me if you could
Weezy Baby, Lucci Lou, and we good

I'm Goooooood
I'm Goooooood
I'm Goooooood
I'm Goooooood22Embed
