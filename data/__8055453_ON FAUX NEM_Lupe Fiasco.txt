57 ContributorsON FAUX NEM Lyrics
And they sing, singy-singy-sing-sing
Singy-sing-sing-sing-sing
Sing, mm-mm-hm

I wish you were lying, oh, oh, oh
Yes, I do
I wish that you were lying
I hope that none of that comes true

Rappers die too much
That's it, that's the verse

I wish that you were lying to me, oh, oh, oh
Yes, I do
I wish that you were lying to me
I hope none of that comes true

Yeah, silent reflection was the first verse's mission
I ain't want to water it down with a whole bunch of conditions
Just give it to you raw how a nigga really feelin'
"Rappers get shot too much" probably has a lot more precision
But that was the dеcision, and with that, I'ma stick
I don't really support niggas 'cause the shit bе making me sick
Look at what we say in this bitch just to get rich
Shoot a nigga right in the head, don't even flinch
You might also like
Nah, nah we can't, we can't talk about that
We gotta talk about something else
I mean, because it's hypocritical, nigga, you got guns
You surrounded by gangsters and killers, all your niggas
Like, the fuck is you talkin' about?
Nigga, talk about something else, talk about something else
Nigga, talk about something else

I've admired many cities through the windows of hotels
From the window of a plane, I've seen the window of a cell
The plane started to fly, the rain started to fell
That's LaGuardia and Rikers, a airport next to a jail
I took a picture looked like my window was crying
'Cause it was sad that all they saw every day was somebody flying
And they was trapped, this shit is wack
But it was crack, hung it on my wall like a plaque
Keep your eyes on the prize and your thumbs on the apps
Facts, I wish that they was lying in they raps
How does that transpire
To be so damned by God, you want your friends to be goddamned liars?
All we talk about are our goddamned priors
Shiny metal boxes on top of goddamned tires
I'm goddamned tired
If I say I didn't indulge, my pants would be on goddamn fire
'Cause I'm a part of the problem
Sometimes the P-, sometimes the -roblem
Fame, all in the name of martyrdom (Yeah)
I wish that you were lying
What's the difference between a posthumous album
And a life insurance policy?
Spotify
A dollar's worth what a dollar buy, go monetize
I wish that you were lying to me
Oh yes, I do, yeah
I wish that you were lying to me
I hope that none of that comes true, ooh

Giving you a fourth, wanna make up for the first
Only 'cause I know that you can take another verse
Want the Quran to be a lie 'cause Hell sounds like it hurts
Also want it to be real 'cause Heaven sounds like it's turnt
Wear my conscience like a condom 'cause I don't wanna be burnt
Wear my dharma like its armor 'cause I don't wanna return
To the wheel of the quivering meat conception
Sometimes I hide inside Kerouac for protection
From the Thanksgiving where bears attacking the dressing
Like Tekken, just lean back and tear into that refreshment
Sometimes real life parallaxes in depression
That's real
Maybe not lie, maybe just chill (Yo)
Maybe not die, maybe just kill (Wait, no)
Maybe survive making a mil'
Greetings wavy but wavy don't make you a Navy SEAL

I wish that you were lying to me
Oh yes, I do
I wish that you were lying to me
I hope that none of that comes true7Embed
