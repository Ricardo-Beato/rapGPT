22 ContributorsWoulda Coulda Lyrics
We ain't done yet, we got so many classics for the streets
Sosa give it to 'em nigga
(Scream, Scream)

Dope so good, they put they foot in it, they couldn't have
I'm flexin', boy, wife that bitch, I wouldn't have
Baby say I'm handsome, girl, you shouldn't have
Check my pockets, Ben Franklin my other half
Niggas always talkin' 'bout what they could've did (Phew)
Man, these niggas always talkin' 'bout what they should've did

And what they woulda did and what they coulda did (Phew)
I don't give a fuck you shoulda did it
I got some niggas in the cut that'll shot you dead
And they gon' do you bad
They shot you 'cause you made the wrong move and you knew you did (Phew)
Niggas say they smokin' loud, they smoke stupid mids
Man, these niggas always run they mouth like some stupid kids (Phew)
As she put my dick in her mouth, I leave that lil hoochie scared
'Cause I can't trust her, try to set me up, I'ma shot the stupid bitch

Dope so good, they put they foot in it, they couldn't have
I'm flexin', boy, wife that bitch, I wouldn't have
Baby say I'm handsome, girl, you shouldn't have
Check my pockets, Ben Franklin my other half
Niggas always talkin' 'bout what they could've did (Phew)
Man, these niggas always talkin' 'bout what they should've did (Phew)You might also like6Embed
