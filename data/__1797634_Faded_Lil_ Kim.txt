5 ContributorsFaded Lyrics
I got a feeling
A real good feeling
I'mma be faded
The bar is open
We just bought it
I'mma be faded
Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur
P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur
Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur
P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur

Damn I look good, Somebody take a photo
I run my his-house, You can ask Jojo
Yank fitted on, My money on Jeter
My girls all dimes, Lou Vuitton Divas
I'm fly like an overnight letter
Shorty sleep with me
Make your overnights wetter
Better I'm faded (I'm faded)
And tonight I'm gonna get wasted
See to everybody listening, if it's on I'm a get at 'em
I can say whatever I'm a tax paying citizen
Middle finger up, I ain't got a conscience
I just go hard like the trio from Yonkers
Head honcho, Kush in the console
Bad boy, now they shook like Cosmo's
I'm all that, everyday all black
Got Ciroc on deck so I'm faded off that
You might also like
I got a feeling
A real good feeling
I'mma be faded
The bar is open
We just bought it
I'mma be faded
Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur
P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur
Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur
P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur

Yo, Bottles on me till the whole club faded
I'm in the VIP and I'm white girl wasted
I'm a rock star party like Van Halen
Phantom comes with a chauffer so I don't valet it
Nah we celebrate pour the ros let it flow
To a New Year new money and some extra 0's
Let's toast to new cars fly condos
IRS we the Celtics and I'm Rondo
Bottles in the air like luggage and jet cargos
We keep the champagne coming till the bar close
These S1 keep the don on chill, I just blew 50 like the shady deal
We faded, me and my peoples we wasted (yeah) the bar is open
More bottles in the V's, kicking up more cheese
Got a feeling it's going to be a good night like the Black Eye Peas
I got a feeling
A real good feeling
I'mma be faded
The bar is open
We just bought it
I'mma be faded
Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur
P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur
Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur
P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur

Two homes on the block
Each one mill and this ring on my finger is an E one deal
Canary yellow stone, can't be faded
Fatigue belt, 45 made for the navy
Young niggas ready to grapple down ya buildin'
I'm living chilling, arms wrapped around a Brazilian
In the presence of a Don, be cautious but calm
Can't be faded, two pills a charm
She licks on my chest, reading tatts on my arm
Hit her from the back, same time my mind blown
Speechless so she scream in silence
A real bad boy and all my speeches violent
I got a feeling
A real good feeling
I'mma be faded
The bar is open
We just bought it
I'mma be faded
Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur
P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur
Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur
P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur1Embed
