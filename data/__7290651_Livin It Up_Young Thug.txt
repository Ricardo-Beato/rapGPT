Hey
Mmm

We got forty-five bitches just livin' it up
Been too damn long without a sip of my cup
Sayin' one's too many, hundred isn't enough, alright
Don't worry 'bout 12, no, they ain't showin' up
Rocky came with the shots, Thug came with the blunts
Sayin' one's too many, hundred isn't enough, alright, yeah

Now you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Now you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Yeah, one's too many, hundred isn't enough
Yeah, a hundred just isn't enough

Oh, hey
Lucky girl, okay
What you want? Andalé
Got ice on the way
Put stones in your face
Calamari, ocean lake
Split a million four ways
My pavilion Saint-Tropez, yeah, alright
Why is it so hard for you to cry when we rich?
I put the sideline in front 'cause I can't argue 'bout shit
I told God, "Protect my life 'cause I'm gon' cum in that shit"
You know I, you know I
She won't fasten up her seatbelt when we ride
Bought the girl a two-story penthouse in the Big Apple like a pie
She was tryna tie me down with all her words, but they were lies
But I let her get away with it 'cause sometimes she wanna die, yeah

Now you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb

I'm on my own
Get high with me, we'll levitate
Get high with me for brighter days
Oh, smile, let me spy the frame
I'm so lit, it could start the campfire
Shorty, where your man? Let me stand by ya
Well, mister, esquire
Seen a fresh attire do a spin-out in my fresh tire
Red stones, I'm a vampire, it might petrify ya, uh
Whole city goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Whole city goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Uh, new semi goin' dump, dump, dump
Four-fizzy on the pump, pump, pump
We got forty-five bitches just livin' it up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Been too damn long without a sip of my cup
Sayin' one's too many, hundred isn't enough, alright (Alright, alright, yeah)
Don't worry 'bout 12, no, they ain't showin' up (Uh)

Now you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
