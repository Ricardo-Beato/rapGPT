39 ContributorsGive It Up Fast Lyrics
Got out the airport, the Mobb picked me up in the truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck, I ain't scared to get stuck
So what's the deal, papi? You heard the feds almost got me?
I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating like Illuminati
Network with catch-a-body experts
In retrospect to the foul connect
When I lost, but that then was my fault
Now it's time to floss, eye for a eye, what's mine is yours
I need a suite with the flowers complimentary at Trump Towers
Sit at the table, we can build for hours
On getting rich, it's a cinch, take a glimpse
"The World Is Yours" written all over the blimps
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning
With Quaaludes and cream and loads of women rockin' linen
I got a plan to blow to Hiroshima, Japan
Moving niggas out the hood and just divide it with fam
And yo, the bitches, like Gee Money said to his man
Will ride the dick like a horse with the cowboy brand

Give it up fast, quick, and not slow
Not goin' to the tables if it's not about dough
Son, you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, nigga, rep your clique
You might also like
Yo, son, I'm feeling it
Opposition want me dead, concealin' shit
From gats, got me living, kid, rushin' through my pyramid
You secondary, go against the grain, then you adversary
Had to bury niggas on my side that snitch
Ran his mouth like a bitch, now he's laying in the ditch
That he dug for himself, on his grave, I had to piss
Scud missile, never miss you, hit you
Scratch you off my list, Gemstar rip through
Your mental, deeper, you ain't havin' it, me neither
It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers
Rapper Noyd, make these niggas into believers

Yo, Noyd, what up with this cat right here, man? Word up

The tough guy screwing me? I guess he got plans to ruin me
He want to do me
Slowly but surely, I peeped his fast ass a bit early
Grabbed him by his wig, his shit was curly
Put the chrome to his dome, let him know it's never early
You can slide, before I snatch the heat from his side
Saw the devil in despise by the look in his eyes
He was surprised how I snatched him up
Regulated his gat and backed him up
Stepped to the side, P, blast him up
Yeah, yo, cannons erupt, you got strucked up abstrusely
Some rapper nigga playin' thug tried to approach me (Yo, kill that nigga, man)
Alls I remember was I shot for his throat, G
You see big guns in 3D, it's haunting
It gets deep, fucking with these Chinese
Thai weed burnin' my hip from hot gats
Burning my lip from roach clips
Catch me on the 40th and Bootlegger in the AM
These ante meridian cats, insomniacs
Four in the morning, we throwing back some cognac juice
Lettin' gats loose, the blue van blitz through
D's pissed too, couldn't find the pistol, ayo
Hopped out the Lexus holdin' my necklace
I'm bent off some next shit, gasoline with a kerosene twist
Stumbling, placing my gun right, it slipped down its caliber
Lookin' for chicks that he can stab now
Numbed up from a fiery cup of hell juice
It's sin's nectar, Satan's fountain of youth
Mega action, bitches all around ready to fuck
Big asses, you raw-dogging shit, pressing your luck
My pipe game's like a night train
Top speed through your womb-piece
Rated X to say the least, ayo

Give up the pussy fast, quick, and not slow (Give it up, shawty, word up)
Not goin' to the 'tel if it ain't a freak show (Show)
Son, you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit (You know what time it is)
QBC, niggas rep they clique
Give it up fast, quick, and not slow
Not goin' to the tables if it's not about dough
Son, you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, niggas rep they clique
And that's how it go (And that's it, nigga, word up)
In every show (You know what I'm sayin'?), don't go
Niggas don't go
You know the deal (Rapper Noyd, Rapper P, Nas, Havoc)
To the exit, niggas, we out, what up?
The Infamous (It's over, baby)
Fuck nine-six, nine-seven
Tell the rest of the crew3Embed
