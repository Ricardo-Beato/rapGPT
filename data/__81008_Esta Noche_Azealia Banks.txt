21 ContributorsEsta Noche Lyrics
Tonight's the night, the mood is right
Anything I choose he buys
I observe by his shoes and ties
He prefer the exclusive kind
Converse over blues and wine
Tonight's the night, the jewels is bright
Any way I move he likes
He is searching for cutie pie
He could scoop and sign
Keep that blue dress down to my Louboutins
Keep my calm, keep my cool
Heard you got a girlfriend but she's a deuce
Wanna see the little Bambi in the nude
Chocolate candy, liquorice too
Wanna book a ticket, get physical soon
Head of the class, but I got principles too
Arching my back give him a view
He wanna taste the cinnamon too
Sex is a race, I'm winning it too
I'm a rude bitch but I like gentlemen
Who spend dividends, benjis, residuals too
When he put it in, not remembering you
Who's his girlfriend, never a clue, what? (what?)

Girl if it's alright, Hello?
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
Let's get it on, Yeah
I got a girl but you look good tonight
You look so good, baby, Ha
It's one on one tonight, tonight, Ha, ha
You might also like
Drink in my hand, hand on my chip
A vamp bitch do it like this
Here with your man, hand on my hip
A bad bitch do it like this
Drink in my hand, hand on my chip
A vamp bitch do it like this
Here with your man, hand on my hip
A bad bitch do it like this
I entice, I supply what your girlfriend can't provide
That tight grip twat, I got that slip and slide
You got that top, tonight's the night, more like
I'm your type, it's alright, young and right
Delay your flight and stay the night
Out of sight, out of mind
Dim the lights and lay the pipe

Girl if it's alright, Hello?
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
Let's get it on, Yeah
I got a girl but you look good tonight
You look so good, baby, Ha
It's one on one tonight, tonight, Ha, ha

Drink in my hand, hand on my chip
A vamp bitch do it like this
Here with your man, hand on my hip
A bad bitch do it like this
Drink in my hand, hand on my chip
A vamp bitch do it like this
Here with your man, hand on my hip
A bad bitch do it like this
I entice, I supply what your girlfriend can't provide
That tight grip twat, I got that slip and slide
You got that top, tonight's the night, more like
I'm your type, it's alright, young and right
Delay your flight and stay the night
Out of sight, out of mind
Dim the lights and lay the pipe
These weak bitches talkin' out of their neck
Banks 'bout: money, power, respect
Old girl on powderin' necks
Old girl owe some power, respect
Niggas took the flower then jet
Should've stuck to the script instead of suckin' on sect
Bump on the dick, never forget
These niggas is hexxed... nasty5Embed
