17 ContributorsMe & My Crew Lyrics
Me and my crew, me and my crew we'll be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew we'll be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed

Yo, I'm takin' it Uptown and niggas know my name
Little shorty insane, so feel the pain
And the wrath of the five foot murder
I'm goin' out baby Uzi style
Catchin' bodies like I hit skins
The hostile juvenile, fuck what you heard
More four-five, motherfucker die
My crew is live and real with a street feel
Automatic causin' havoc when I hit
I flip and rip shop, I'm on some homicidal shit
Little nigga loco, catchin' bodies on a solo
Props for killin' cops, I'm Hell-bound
I'm on a motherfuckin' mission, I'm goin' at it
You want a freestyle, kid? I'm wilder than the penile
Back up off me, gimme room to breathe
And you takin' up my spot? Nigga, please
I'm as bad as they come, there ain't nothin' good
Used to be a gentleman, but you can call me hood
Matter fact, fuck that, kid, you know my name
Peace, I'm outtie, me and my motherfuckin' crew
You might also like
Me and my crew, me and my crew, we be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew, we be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed

A-one two, microphone check, who's next?
The five foot three, time to catch wreck
Set the situation, motivate your mind
I'm a step ahead and not a step behind
Bass now come again, checkin' for the little lyrical
Dark-skinned don and chat be milky like cereal
Poof, I make you move, when I move, I bet I make you
Buck, I make you bugged as I kick the mega-flavor
So I'm the kid just slippin' the slang
What's my name, what's my motherfuckin' name?
Fight, I make ya fight motherfuckin' buck wild
Shootin' niggas up like it's goin' out of style
So what's to mention? Sharpen up your blades
Load up the clip, take a sip, what's the flav'?
I roll the streets at midnight, the little terror
Huh, I get better by the letter
A true weed head, the juvenile once more
A twenty bag of funk, shall I say more?
A real little nigga with real motherfuckin' skills
Far from weak, so get off the fuckin' deals
Do the do 'cause I'ma do mines too
Just chillin' with my crew, peep the flavor
Me and my crew, me and my crew, we be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew, we be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed (Check it)

My man Hav' got my back with the Tec 20
To shoot 'em up if the niggas get funny
My shit is real, I had to pioneer this
Around the way, all the fake niggas fear this
Paragraphs bust your membrane
On and on I bust through like Teflon
The Little P is not to be stepped upon
And if you think so, kid, then you're dead wrong
Little, far from big, yo, a type small kid
P, I represent the brothers from Queensbridge
To make a long rhyme short, I smoke weed
Sip a forty, yo, fuck the court
So bad they tried to lock me in a group home
Prodigy's hard, but fuck it, I can rip a smooth tone
I catch wreck with the Einstein's intellect
And get stupid like a Stimulated Dummies mix
Feel the wrath, feel the aftermath
Even if you took thn notes, kid, you couldn't pass the class
I keep a loosie in the chamber 'cause beef got me shook down
Paranoid, ain't got no time to fuck around
So bypass the clock when it's time to go at it
So we can pop 'em off if the chumps want static

Me and my crew, me and my crew, we be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew, we be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed (Check it)

When I rap, I kill mics like a nuke blast
Little Hav's the man, the man gettin' Van Damme
Buckwild, rockin' with much style
Check it as I wreck it, strip ya butt-naked
Pause and stand still while I just split a Phil'
And double up on ki's and make somethin' like a half-mil'
Shorty's in it to get paid
No doubt, I got clout with the females
Put it in detail and write it
And if you ain't givin' pussy, then bitch, you ain't invited
I'm on some other shit that you couldn't fuck with
Destructive and couldn't give a fuck kid
Little niggas don't die, if they said so, they lied
Immediate death to those who tried
The dark-skinned brother, unlike the others
When niggas see my crew, they know to burn rubber1Embed
