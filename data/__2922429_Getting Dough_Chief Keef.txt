10 ContributorsGetting Dough Lyrics
I be getting dough (Getting dough, getting dough, getting dough)
I be getting dough (Getting dough, getting dough, getting dough)
I'm smoking dope, got pound and hoes and you know (Pounds and hoes)
I be getting dough (I be getting dough, I be getting dough)
I be getting dough (I be getting dough, I be getting dough)
I be getting dough (I be getting dough)
I fucked your hoe, kicked her out the door
Told her don't come back no more
'Cause I be getting dough, ayy, ayy, ayy
I be getting dough, ayy

I be getting dough, smokin' dope with my pole
I be getting dough, fucking hoes with my bros
I be getting dough, ridin' 'round my city
I be getting dough, ridin' 'round with my fifty, ayy
I be getting dough
I be fucking hoes and I be spending rolls
I don't spend rolls on hoes, that's a no no, ayy
You know how I rock and how I roll, though
I'ma spend it on some clothes though
Spend it on some furniture for my house, though
Spend it on two thousand on a couch, though
Spent three thousand on my mattress just to slouch on
What your house on?
I'm only 18 with a house long
It's Yao Ming
My house so long that I can walk into my car

I be getting dough (I be getting dough, I be getting dough)
I be getting dough (I be getting dough, I be getting dough)
I be getting dough (I be getting dough)
I fucked your hoe, kicked her out the door
Told her don't come back no more
'Cause I be getting dough, ayy, ayy, ayy (I be gettin' dough)
I be getting dough, ayyEmbed
