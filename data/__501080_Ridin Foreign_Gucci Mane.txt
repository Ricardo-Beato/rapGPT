10 ContributorsRidin Foreign Lyrics
I touch a lotta paper, I been havin' this shit
I got a bookbag full of hunnids, I been stashin' this shit
Private jet to Las Vegas, I've been gamblin' and shit
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (We ain't the average clique)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ride-ride foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ride-ride foreign)

Gimme the keys to the van, fi-fi-fifty keys in the van
You can bleed in the van, you can leave in the van
Take a chance with the man, then I'm squeezin my hand (HA!)
But the man in the back ain't part of the clan
Slapped him with the gun 'bout as hard as I can
Took the dope out the van then I ran with the bands
If a nigga try to follow, find his head in the trash
Smash on your ass, I'll blast at your ass
100-yard dash in the grass for the cash
Brick and a Carbon-15 in the stash
But he still got found with his brains on the dash (EW!)
You a big bully, was a fool in the past
Fuck that nigga, I ain't cool with his ass
Two bags of the gas, now the wolves on his ass
Fuck around with Gucci Mane get some holes in his ass
Fifty goons on me when I came to the Bash
Po-Po-Point a nigga out that you want me to smash
Two size of the trap, put the trash on the track
If that the only son track then it might be a crash
Yellow ice, white ice, little shitty glass
Swag so sick that I might have a rash
Rollin a blunt while I'm hittin it from the back
Where your name tatted at, where I'm dumpin the ash
You might also like
I touch a lotta paper, I been havin this shit
I got a bookbag full of hundreds, I been stashin this shit
Private jet to Las Vegas, I've been gambling and shit
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (We ain't the average clique)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (Ride-ride foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (Ride-ride foreign)

Hahn!
I can't even lie, I'm in my own lane (GUCCI!)
Talk so much shit cause I got my own slang (huh?)
Bricksquad is my own squad, I got my own gang (SQUAD!)
Stamps on the bricks, got my own 'caine (GUCCI!)
These niggas followers, don't got they own brain (durr...)
Tr-Trickin off but won't take care of they own kids (damn...)
This Gucci Mane and people say I'm on drugs (true)
I tell them people "go get on your own dick"
When you the boss nig-ga you make your own rules
I'm the only nigga that don't need no cosigner
And my suede shoes match my suede headliner
And my closet filled with the top designers

I touch a lotta paper, I been havin this shit
I got a bookbag full of hundreds, I been stashin this shit
Private jet to Las Vegas, I've been gambling and shit
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (We ain't the average clique)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (ridin foreign, ridin foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (Ride-ride foreign)
And I'm in love with ridin' foreign (Ride-ride foreign)1Embed
