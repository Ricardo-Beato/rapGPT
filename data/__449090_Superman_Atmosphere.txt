(Yo, what happened to you man?
What, you just woke up like that?
You weren't like that yesterday
What have you been eating?)
And he got bored one day and jumped out of a third story window
Hit the curb in a sprint position (what?)
And that was the first time he found himself different from the rest
Thus began him on his quest for individualism (why?)
He felt he had some big decisions to make
Superpowers can't be all fun and games
Piece of cake in the park under sun rays
I mean wait, he wishes he understood
Wait, hold up, does this mean now
That he's obligated to roam around and do some good?
Maybe he should keep it hidden from his neighborhood
I doubt his girl would even try to comprehend it if she could
And he ain't trying to be nobody's circus sideshow freakshow
Better keep it discrete and hide it from these people
But one day on his way to Falafel King for some lunch
He was approached by these three cats that he'd gotten stoned with once
He cracked a smile, extended an arm to give the first one a pound
Brought the fist down, and sunk him deep into the ground
Whoops, cat's out the pillow sack
You see that puddle?
Well that particular molecular displacement has a mom
Who's gonna want an explanation
As to why her son Jason, her pride and joy
Is now liquid boy dripping down the pavement
Save it
You'd better bolt and hide
Because war patrol gets a hold of your throat you'll probably hope to die
Oh snap, you can fly
It's time to take it to the air
And quit tripping, who ever told you that existence was supposed to be fair?

Yo dawg, this kid owed me like ten dollars, dude
Why'd you have to kill him?)
Made it, landed in the backyard
Fast like a track star
The flight was basic
And the landing, it wasn't that hard
Now act smart
Pack the things you need and leave
Say your peace to this diseased place and keep it free
Face the east, spread your wings
Wait, I hear police sirens coming to inquire about the deceased
I wonder if your chest can deflect bullets
Contemplate surrender to escape this excess stress
Bet nobody thinks about the emotional drain
That it takes to have special strengths and advanced brains
And now he's dancing with sanity solo
Trying to hold his inner ground
Devising a rushed blueprint
Blocking all sight and sound
And pictures of all the childhood trauma
All the livelihood, the drama
The time spent wondering, pondering the secrets of imagination
No way could anyone have understood this present situation
Yo mom
If they take me down, believe I'm gonna miss you
And if I ain't around take comfort knowing I went out with a fistfull
I swear it was accidental, I never meant to
It ain't my fault
I don't know how it started off nor how it shall result
But I'll be damned if I give the man the satisfaction of taking down the man who could have taken out that man with all his bastard plans
And at one glance it was romantic if you think
The freak slit his own throat
And bled to death in the kitchen sink
X3
No longer worried about health or wealth
A superhero's true weakness is themselves
X4
I need to lower my expectations
I never said I was Jesus
Nah, I'm Superman
With a capital S
(Ayo man, you got 35 cents?)4Embed
