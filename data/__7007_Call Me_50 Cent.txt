(Call me) Why you naggin me?
(Call me) Girl you houndin me (yo why you houndin me)
(Call me) Why you harassin me?
I don't want alone time, I just wanna fuck
(Call me) Why you naggin me?
(Call me) Girl you houndin me

50 Cent, Yayo, featuring Hope, uh huh
As we proceed, uh

You didn't like the way I wore my hair (what up)
You didn't like the style a clothes I wear (uh huh)
You didn't like the little things I do
Just tryin' to be close to you (c'mon, c'mon)
Look I done changed up bitch, I done came up
My neck, my wrist, my ears, my fists are all blinged up
In the hood they say 50 "you a grimy nigga"
With the rims in that Coupe stay shiny nigga (stay shiny nigga)
When you disrespect me is where I draw the line
You seen my artwork but you ain't seen me draw the nine (blaaattt)
Come through the hood, you'll get shot homey just cause I say so
I'm the hottest shit on the street
I don't need J.Lo (here we go)
