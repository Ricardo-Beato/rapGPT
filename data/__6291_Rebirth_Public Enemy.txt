4 ContributorsRebirth Lyrics
And right 'bout now, we get ready to get live to this beat. We get live to this beat, so I want everybody in the house to help me count this beat down. Yo, later for that! We ain't count down nothin', know I'm sayin? We ain't count down nothin', 'cause the beat is too large for that, know I'm sayin'? The beat's too large...

When I get down, I give what go around
And when I cough, I do my best to cut it off
I don't claim to be a preacher, not paid to be a teacher, but I'm grown
I try to be a leader to the bone
Never could follow a man with a bottle
He's a baby with a beard and not a feared role model
And they ask me where I get it, I got it from my pops
With a man in the house, and all the bullshit stops
Then I sing a song about what the hell is goin' wrong
You never know if you only trust the TV and the radio
These days, you can't see who's in cahoots
'Cause now the KKK wears three-piece suits
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
In fact, you know it's like that y'all

Yeah, that's right straight from Bricktown, boy! Know I'm sayin? Freeport, LI, Roosevelt on the map, know I'm sayin'?You might also likeEmbed
