5 ContributorsLow Lyrics
Yeah
Secret love, that's what this is
I gotta go, the wife and kids
Don't want to leave it, you already know
We so in love but what can we do?
My wife is your best friend
How the fuck did we let this thing get so far gone?
There's no way we could fix it
Baby boy on the way, if she only knew that's mines
Shit is like a daytime soap or movie on Lifetime
But nah, nigga, this real life and it hurts
Missin' you or lyin' to her I don't know what make it feel worse
And me puttin' her first makes me feel like shit
I hate seein' you cry, wipe away your tears
Fuck it, I'ma just leave her but what about our kids?
Don't wanna break they little hearts, let's wait a few more years
Oh God, I swear to God I wish that we could just bounce
Don't even pack no bag, just break the fuck out

How can we love when we love
If this love is never supposed to be
Livin' lies that the truth could see
So now tell me love, can we love
If we know this love can't be this way
Let's keep this love low
You might also like
My feelings for you got me feelin' foul
How we even get here?
Feel funny being in here, my homie used to live here
When he died, a part of me died
Seein' you have to suffer, just wanted to comfort not turn into lovers
That shoulder you could lean on, I know shit got you stressin'
The kids askin' for daddy, they keep askin' the question
Came around to check up on y'all, I know my homie do the same
Guilty like a motherfucker, how we get into this thing?
That love shit is real, is all that wrong?
People lookin' at us like we crazy
Now we spend nights on the phone all night long
Got so much in common, this shit is crazy
It's more than just physical 'cause mentally you stimulate me
And if I ain't up on it, baby, you just educate me
And vice-versa, that's what we both in search of
Want to love and get it, somebody that we could nurture
Is it wrong?

How can we love when we love
If this love is never supposed to be
Livin' lies that the truth could see
So now tell me love, can we love
If we know this love can't be this way
Let's keep this love lowEmbed
