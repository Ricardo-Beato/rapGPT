Oh, oh, oh
Mmm, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh yeah (Oh)
Oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world, it seems so very small
'Cause nothing even matters at all
See, nothing even matters
See, nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
See, I don't need no alcohol
Your love make me feel ten feet tall (Yeah)
Without it, I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing matters at all
You might also like
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still, there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothing even matters to me (Ooh)
See, nothing even matters (Yeah)
See, nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters (Oh)
Nothing even matters to me

You're part of my identity
I sometimes have a tendency (Ooh, oh)
To look at you religiously (Baby, baby)
'Cause nothing even matters, to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me (Nothing even matters)
Said it don't matter, baby, baby
Don't matter

Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either-or (Oh)
'Cause nothing even matters no more
See, nothing, it don't matter
See, nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Now my team could score (Oh)
And make it to the Final Four (Ooh)
Just repossessed my four by four (Yeah, yeah, yeah, take it)
'Cause nothing even matters no more (No more, no more)
Nothing even matters (No more, uh)
Nothing even matters no more (No, oh-oh)
Nothing even matters (No, oh-oh)
Oh, oh, oh

To me, to me (No, nothing)
To me, to me (No, nothing, no, oh, oh)
To me, to me (Nothing even matters for you)
To me, to me (One more time; More than you do)
