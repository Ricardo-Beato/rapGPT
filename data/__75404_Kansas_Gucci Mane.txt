33 ContributorsKansas Lyrics
Shawty cooler than fan, but her man not me
Got a real hot mouth, she a stone cold freak
10 girls in my suite, brought sand to the beach
Got a nigga from the country, call two times a week
I'm in a red Maserati with some snow white seats
And when I skeet I try to aim it at her snow white teeth
Red bottoms on the wood, watchin' the Hawks play the Heat
Brought the whole Bricksquad, 10 grand every seat
6 ounces and a liter that's a dirty sweet tea
I'mma put this game on bad bitch that I meet
I'm a zone 6 king and my jeans got wings
I'm a rich girl's fantasy, a poor girl's dream

Hold up stop the track, let's get some'n understanded
I'm servin' softball, I pitch underhanded
Your girlfriend said she like me but I'm too demandin'
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas
My stash done got so big that I can't rubber band it
My plug speakin' Spanish, I can't understand it
So stop the track my nigga let's get some understandin'
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas

Now I can't dance a lick but look my diamonds dancin'
Rap or trap my nigga I'mma take my chances
I had a couple jugs didn't go down how I planned it
I guess I fronted him too much, he couldn't handle it
You disrespect the Squad then you get reprimanded
Blowin' kush in her hair, she smokin' second handed
I got the whole pack sold 'fo the pack landed
Chicken bags in the trap, call it hand to handin'
And you ain't gotta shop with me that's fine and dandy
Two ways, four nines call it Georgia candy
Cookin' dope in Louboutin cuz I'm kinda fancy
I met your bitch at the bar, got her two shots of Brandy
You might also like
Hold up stop the track, let's get some'n understanded
I'm servin' softball, I pitch underhanded
Your girlfriend said she like me but I'm too demandin'
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas
My stash done got so big that I can't rubber band it
My plug speakin' Spanish, I can't understand it
So stop the track my nigga let's get some understandin'
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas

Hold up wait, let me explain
Half my niggas move ki's of 'caine
Jewish lawyers what we've retained
In my car's where she give brain
Bought the _____ of Dorthy
Yellow road, sellin' bricks
Big face, yellow wrist, drop top, hello bitch
Cut the shit, make sure that we see eye to eye
We got them birds and they don't fly up in the sky
Bitch, and you gon' take this trip to Kansas
And you gon' get them bricks of dandruff
I wash the money like it's Head & Shoulders
I watch the money like a deadly cobra
And hit my phone once you got the bricks
You hit the road you better hold it if you gotta piss
Hold up stop the track, let's get some'n understanded
I'm servin' softball, I pitch underhanded
Your girlfriend said she like me but I'm too demandin'
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas
My stash done got so big that I can't rubber band it
My plug speakin' Spanish, I can't understand it
So stop the track my nigga let's get some understandin'
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas4Embed
