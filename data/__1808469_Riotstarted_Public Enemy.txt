You spend a buck in the nineties, what you get is a preacher
Forgivin' this torture of the system that brought 'cha
I'm on a mission and you got that right
Addin' fuel to the fire, punch to the fight
Many have forgotten what we came here for
Never knew or had a clue, so you're on the floor
Just growin, not knowin about your past
Now you're lookin' pretty stupid while you're shakin' your ass

Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter

Some people fear me when I talk this way
Some come near me, some run away
Some wanna take heed to every word I say
Some wanna build a posse, some stay away
Some people think that we plan to fail
Wonder why we go under or we goin' to jail
Some ask us why we act the way we act
Without lookin' how long they kept us back
You might also like
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter

Yes you, if I bore you, I won't ignore you
I'm sayin' things that they say I'm not supposed to
Give you pride that you may not find
If you're blind about your past, then I'll point behind
Kings, queens, warriors, lovers
People proud, sisters and brothers
It's their biggest fear, suckers get tears
When we can top their best idea

Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matterEmbed
