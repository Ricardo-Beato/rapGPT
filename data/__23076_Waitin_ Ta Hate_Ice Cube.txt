6 ContributorsWaitinâ€™ Ta Hate Lyrics(Ain't no 'California Love') (Love) (Love)...
I see them niggas
You see them niggas?
I see them niggas
Look at them niggas just waitin to hate (wait)
Waitin to hate, waitin to hate (look at them niggas)
Look at them bitches just waitin to hate (wait)
Waitin to hate (wait) waitin to hate

Get your ride on, ride on
This ain't the day for you to die on, die on
I'm a nigga that they lie on, lie on
See these shoes you wanna try on, try on
Yo, we can go to war with the enemy
All we need is A.K.s and Hennessy
This ain't back in the days of Tennessee
Pull the trigger and release the energy ( *shots* )
See muthafuckas run till they catch one
In the back, and it might cause a cardiac
Bitch act like he died and we brought him back
Him screamin for his mama and his sister pack
Flatline -
These niggas wanna act like
They ain't never had a full can of act-right
Make me pull out my gat, right
And smoke his muthafuckin ass like a crackpipe
You might also likeSo what you sayin, muthafucka?
We ain't playin, muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
So what you sayin, muthafucka?
We ain't playin, muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
Look at them niggas just waitin to hate (wait)
Waitin to hate, waitin to hate (look at them niggas)
Look at them bitches just waitin to hate (hate)
Waitin to hate (hate) waitin to hate

Get your smoke on, smoke on
Here's another verse to choke on, choke on
To all my niggas in the pen, get your yoke on
To all my thugs in the house, get your loc on
We can really give a fuck about a broke home
All we care about is bitches we can poke on
Nigga, what's that bullshit that you spoke on?
Better roll on 'fore we split your whole dome
Cause you're fuckin with Ice Cube the Terrible
Fuck around, I make your life unbearable
Make you live all scary and careful
Come through my neighborhood, you better tip-toe
Cause if you loud, then you might get chased down
Westside Connection catch a case now
Po-po's find your monkey ass face down
Tell your mama that you in a better place now
So what you sayin, muthafucka?
We ain't playin, muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
So what you sayin, muthafucka?
We ain't playin, muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
Look at them niggas just waitin to hate (wait)
Waitin to hate (hate) waitin to hate (look at them niggas)
Look at them bitches just waitin to hate (wait)
Waitin to hate (hate) waitin to hate (look at them bitches)
(Ain't no 'California Love') (Love) (Love)
'You can hate me now'
(Ain't no 'California Love') Ah-ah (Love) (Love)

To all my niggas with the lleyo
They rock it up like Play-Doh
They cook it up like Waco
Better do what I say so
Better lay low, cause you fuckin with a halo
Death to the niggas with the big mouth
And death to you devils from the Old South
And death to you hoes turnin tricks out
And death everyone that go the bitch route
Check it
If you infected by this record
Bow down butt-naked
And pray to God
Ice Cube won't spare the rod
Westside Connection here to mob, nigga, rob
We can take it to the streets
We can take it to the concrete
You niggas know where the Don be
You bitches ain't tryin to find me
All you haters need to shut the fuck up and get behind me
Look at them niggas just waitin to hate (look at em)
Waitin to hate (look) waitin to hate (look at them niggas)
Look at them bitches just waitin to hate (ugh)
Waitin to hate (ugh) waitin to hate
So what you sayin, muthafucka?
We ain't playin, muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
So what you sayin, muthafucka?
We ain't playin, muthafucka
A.K.'in muthafuckas
This is dedicated
To them haters
Who ain't gon' kill nothin
And who ain't gon' let nothin die
You know em
You know em
When you see Ice Cube you better holla
And pop a collar
When you see Ice Cube you better holla
And pop a collarEmbed
