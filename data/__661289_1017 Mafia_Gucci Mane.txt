14 Contributors1017 Mafia Lyrics
Thugga and Guwop got 100 choppas
1017 we the, Mafia
We the motherfuckin' mafia nigga
No less than 20 in my trousers lil nigga

Got these bitches bending over like a lineman
Make the pot, bitch straight over like a linemen
Everybody get that green, we the live men
All my slime crickets, I think we need lemons
1017 the mothafucking movement
Pipe that bitch down, I'ma duel it
The way I  throw em through  it, my arm  a Uzi
Bought a bitch a pair of shoes, and fuck her booty
Hol'  it, don't let up, these niggas can't catch with thugga no thugger
We eatin' no other
I'm chubby like my brother
I'm chubby like my mother
We take all yo goodies, and go straight to Costco
Catch up with yo bitch, and turn her into a sucka
We not overseas but you know we Russian
Picnic early, clubbin later
I'm not no candy,  but I am a jawbreaker
You think I'm gay,  I'ma send ya to meet your maker
Put a hole in yo head like you's  a piston
