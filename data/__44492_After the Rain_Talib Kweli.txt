10 ContributorsAfter the Rain Lyrics
Ay boy, I got moves to make
See the hood ain't my last stop, you understand me?

Walking under Gutter Rainbows
 Man fuck that noise man
 Walkin under Gutter Rainbows
 I'mma peel this popsicle stand man

Yo, son said he 'bout to peel pop's testicles
{*woman starts laughing loudly*} PAUSE~!
 Hey boy...
 C'mon son, what'chu gon' do? C'monnnn
 When I make some money man
 Word, word
 I'mma ball at one of your Circle Line Books
 Park that motherfucker on Nostrand Avenue
 Hop out and get me a muh'fuckin peach pattie
 Y'knahmsayin?
 Word man, yo don't forget that cocoa bread son
 I'mma get some rims, with rims on 'em!
 With 32, 32 rims? 32 28's?
 Have you been all {*unclear*}
 Why you gotta bring that up?
 I'll have a big ass house in the middle of the hood
 E'rybody house look little, his house big and shit
 That's what I'mma do
 I'mma get me one of them big ass houses
{*laughter from the Hood Comedian*}
 All cakin up
