5 ContributorsA Word Witchya! (Intro) Lyrics(Snoop Dogg inhaling)

Greetings loved ones
It's the big boss dog, Snoop D-oh-double-G
I want you just to lay back one time
And let yourself unwind
Yeah, this album number nine
I call it Ego Trippin'
Fo' shiggadal
Ain't nuttin' to it but to do it
I know, I know, I know
I know y'all  trippin' off how I be doin' my thug thang on TV
But I never forget about what I love the most, and that's makin' music
So uhh, I hope y'all enjoy this shit right here
I took my time on this one
Oh yeah! Be on the lookout for QDT
That's Quik, Dogg and Teddy
Oh, my nigga Terrance Martin in this motherfucker too
Ay, press play homey!
Nah, on the real, press play!
Right now-now-now-ow-ow-owYou might also likeEmbed
