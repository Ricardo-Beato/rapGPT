(Band—)
I've given up this time (Shh, shh)
I don't like the way that you're holding me hostage
It hurts when I'm alive (Shh, shh)
Alive on this Earth that you think that you've created (Free the gang, 1017, brr)
I've given up this time (Shh, shh)
I don't like the way that you're holding me hostage
It hurts when I'm alive (Shh, shh)
Alive on this Earth that you think that you've created
(Let the band play)
Go

I look in the mirror and look at a killer
I grew up with niggas crop you out the picture (Huh)
Bodies keep stackin' up year after year
Got these young niggas thinkin' thеy serial killers (Wow)
Totin' choppers with switchеs, they scratch off the serial (Grrah)
Left blood in the whip and fucked up his interior (Ugh)
Watch what you say 'cause this shit can get real
And watch how you move unless you made of steel (Damn)
Shot in the car and now God got the wheel (Grrah)
These niggas I'm with, they got bodies for real (God)
My dawg just got out, he did twenty-some years
'Cause he took it to trial, but he lost his appeal (Free him)
I went to school with some serial killers
They break in your house, then eat cereal with you (Huh?)
The same nigga cut first period with you
Watch who you trust, they might be out to get you (Damn)
And one more step, you get put in the Swisher
Say the wrong thing, get put in a Backwood (Woo)
Wipe a nigga nose, no tissue, bless him
Last nigga tried me found in the backwoods
Ain't none of these crews more vicious (No)
Just play a good role and they sure can act good
Plenty folks in my business (Bless you)
Nigga spoke on my name and got smoked like a Packwood
You might also like
I've given up this time (Shh, shh)
I don't like the way that you're holding me hostage
It hurts when I'm alive (Shh, shh, it hurts)
Alive on this Earth that you think that you've created (Yeah)
I've given up this time (Shh, shh)
I don't like the way that you're holding me hostage
It hurts when I'm alive (Shh, shh)
Alive on this Earth that you think that you've created (Yeah)

How many bags in my trap in a day?
My shooter a cheetah, we stalkin' the prey
If he get caught, ain't no walkin' away
And we ain't doin' no talkin', just talk to the K (Brrr)
These little bitty niggas better stay in they place
'Cause they like to play games and they know I don't play (Wow)
Playin' with Wop, it ain't nobody safe
It won't be no more rats, ain't nobody safe (Nah)
He must got angels that's watchin' from Heaven
Wasn't his time, he got shot in the face (Woo)
Main Slime say he got caught on the seventh
He thinkin' 'bout droppin' a tape on the eighth
These niggas ain't real, these niggas some fakes
That pressure put on 'em, these niggas'll break (Pussy)
Free every artist behind the gate (Free 'em)
That made a mistake, hell, give 'em a break (Free 'em)
Foo tryna parole out, they gave him a date (Foo)
He gettin' impatient, he tryna wait (Huh)
The district attorney keep tryna hate
He fightin' the feds and fightin' the state (Foo)
I did some time with some sick-minded niggas
Stabbed in his cell and left blood on the pillow (Ugh)
Free all the hitters that keep it official
Not the ones in the booth that turn serial killer (Damn)
I've given up this time (Shh, shh, yeah)
I don't like the way that you're holding me hostage (I'm tellin' the truth when I'm teaching to you)
It hurts when I'm alive (Shh, shh, you niggas get caught and start tellin' the truth)
Alive on this Earth that you think that you've created (Serial killers on the 'Gram and in the booth)
I've given up this time (Shh, shh)
I don't like the way that you're holding me hostage (Haha)
It hurts when I'm alive (It's Big Wop, shh, shh)
Alive on this Earth that you think that you've created (Burr)

I've given up this time (Shh, shh)
I don't like the way that you're holding me hostage
It hurts when I'm alive (Shh, shh)
Alive on this Earth that you think that you've created3Embed
