7 ContributorsEverywhere I Go Lyrics
Now the question has been raised, what the fuck happened to you?
Well I can tell you what did not happen to you
You didn't get your ass on this Cathedral mixtape
Sissyyyyyyyyy

For not knowin' the ways you can be capped like a NBA salary
Lives taken haphazardly, them sons of bitches is bastards, G
That's why I be high B, so don't ask me why I'm not speakin' nigga
Just ain't countin' no money up wit' cha
The fuck we got to talk about?
Not seachin' for Bobby Fischer
But somethin' sticky and super official
To burn with my girls in the parkin' lot
Surrounded by 'em before I got out
Parched aren't we?
Honestly shorty, let me check make sure I ain't got no fleas up on me
From minglin' with them ol' pussy ass niggas and dog ass bitches
Old veterans get bit by the youngins
I swear to God that them puppies 'll kill ya
Field of dreams, they come true if you build it
So I made myself if y'all can dig it

Everywhere I go we roll up
Everywhere I go we pour up
I know you think you shinin' nigga, so what?
It wasn't going down til we showed up
You know it's going down-n-n
You know it's going down-n-n
You might also like
Across the water or across the border
See my second line deep like I’m from New Orleans
You a snitch nigga type that’ll call the law
So before the slaughter I get my thoughts in order
Seen your rapper on stage you and your little crew
We so sick of these Thelonius dudes
Annoyance grew and the audience boo
We had enough of your corny excuse
Living in the world of my own adventure
Life a gunfight, a knife is your only weapon
You don’t really know what the fuck you stepped in
Better chill right now, life such a blessing
Save the feedback, where the weed at?
Imagine me at an intervention
You the one who need an intervention
To stop you from interruptin’ sessions
Wow that’s such a nasty habit
Wow this marijuana marriage got my wifey jealous
I get selfish when I’m making fuckin’ classics
Amsterdam or California, Washington, Oregon or Colorado
When we blaze in the club the Jamaican bud
Got me feelin’ so special, no bravado

Hey ya I emerge from the south with the mind to get paid
Cup of some drank keep it stuck in my ways
Livin’ life tryna catch me a wave
In the same state they used to wholesale slaves
Pimp tight nigga hold up
Presidential when I roll up, like a playa do
She in love put nothing above purest the drug in a day or two
That’s a playa move, in this game of life can’t cruisade or lose
You gotta be willin’ to be the villain to give it  gator shoes
I heard it from an old school kid, say I had an old school soul
Told me I was bound to be great, never fall for the fake
And never ever chase no ho, gotta make that dough
Crack my seal, pop my trunk and work my wheel
Cause every now and then, reflect on times
That I ain’t have dimes to fuck or dough to spend
So I gotta keep my mind right, forever run from the limelight
I don’t need no fame, my aura shine so bright
I’m a star in my own right, forever loyal to the game


I love this nostalgic shit
This whore right here
Is literally like the perfect blow job
