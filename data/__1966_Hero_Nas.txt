QB
Where the fuck y'all at?
Ha, ha
Yeah, let's go
Gets Money

Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (Fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (Yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want
They lookin' for a hero
I guess that makes me a hero

Another chapter of the cleanest rapper, distinguished gentlemen
Crooks & Castle on his back, Maybacher
Exotic lady eye-catcher, holla at ya, call me the chiropractor
Workin' like Muay Thai class, get perspire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rockin' D Boy, Fila velour in one-ninety black Benz
Now they shut down the stores when I'm shoppin'
Used to be train robbin', face covered in stockin'â€”I'm him
You might also like
Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (Fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (Yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want
They lookin' for a hero
I guess that makes me a hero

Rubber-grip-holder, reloader
Come at me, I'ma rip your soldiers in half
Silverback ape, nickel-plated mag
Young, rich and flashy; young bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes 'til ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough, I can still see the Bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw
To chillin' in wine cellars, sticks and humidors
That's what I call mature
That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest, shit
I try to make more cream
By every September 14th, that's my dream
So I can be more clean, as I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly, that's why they fear me (let's go!)
Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (Fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (Yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want
They lookin' for a hero
I guess that makes me a hero

This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side
Blockin' y'all from goin' to stores and buyin' it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was ridin' with it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs
They said "Nas, why is he tryin' it?"
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winnin'
Forgettin' Nas the only true rebel since the beginnin'
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel
They can't sing what's in their soul
So "Untitled" it is
I never change nothin', but people remember this
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids
With new ideas bein' told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it
I'm a hustler in the studio, cups of Don Julio
No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable y'all, let's go!
Yeah, Nas, Polow da Don18Embed
