3 ContributorsWinter Jacket Lyrics
Pat White

Ran into a east side thug, but I'm peace sign throwin'
Said "wassup?" and asked him how the street life's goin'
Told me he'd been chillin', "tryna keep my eyes open
'Cause anything can happen when them street light's glowin'"
The sun goes down, but the block keeps lit
Steppin' over cracks where the concrete splits
Wind blowin' got me on my long sleeves, y'all see
I've been feelin' good like all weekend (Pat White)
And the streets lookin' desolate, late night pedestrian
Silhouettes extra thin, paranoia settin' in
Worst-case scenario is runnin' through my head again
Thoughts that I been thinkin' I've been tryin' not to let 'em in, uh
Errybody needs friends, because every week we tryna have an awesome weekend
Pitch-black, ain't no tellin' where the darkest street ends
By the way, has anybody seen Brent?

Slippin' on my winter jacket
Watch me as I slip into the winner's bracket
Chillin' for a minute 'til we get it crackin'
Girl, I'm so invested in this interaction

Da-da-da-da
I know it's cold out, I know it's dark out
Da-da-da-da
I know it's cold out, I know it's dark out (Cold out, Pat White)

Sweatshirt tight, we about to start the winter
Hand my garbage to my friends, 'cause I don't have the heart to litter, uh
Too young to interact with bartenders
But these bars that I tend to are harsher than sharp splinters
Money equals food, so I ask you if you've got the dough
Calories, I pack 'em in, metabolism got me though
Borrow just a couple bucks, but every week it doubles up
Enough's enough, I ain't comin' back until my funds is up (Pat White)
Bumpin' with the tempo, bustin' that extendo
Chillin' with my friends, doin' something to someone else's expense
We were outside McDonald's last week, and my friend put his nutsack on the window
Right in front the cashier, that's as funny as it gets, yo
Took off and booked it like we runnin' for the end zone
They puffin' on the window, but you should know I been though
Yeah you should know I own it boy, you somethin' like a rental

Slippin' on my winter jacket
Watch me as I slip into the winner's bracket
Chillin' for a minute 'til we get it crackin'
Girl, I'm so invested in this interaction (Pat White)
Da-da-da-da
I know it's cold out, I know it's dark out
Da-da-da-da
I know it's cold out, I know it's dark out (Pat White)
Da-da-da-da
I know it's cold out, I know it's dark out
Da-da-da-da
I know it's cold out, I know it's dark outEmbed
