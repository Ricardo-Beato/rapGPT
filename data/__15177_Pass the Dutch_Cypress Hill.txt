Do you want to get high?
(Put it in the air)

Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Then put in the air if you wanna get high

Spark it up in a circle
With the kush weed that would hurt you
If you got the purple we can blaze it
Either way, the high you search
You shoulda bought
Then you know the rules before you hit it once
When you catch my blunt
You know which way to pass it when it comes
(Pass the joint on the left hand side)
Don't ever pass it on the right
Never ash it on my Nike
If you sprinkle hash in it
Just don't let it out your sight
'Cause if you take it outta sight
Well ya just beggin' for a fight, aight
Give me a lighter
So why you can't decipher, ignite it
Puff Puff Pass homie
Don't just stand and try to hide it
I smoke a bowl or a spliff and uplift my spirits
Then I take a bong hit
Hit it fuckin' hard and clear it
Hit it with the left hand
Pass to the next man
Feel the buddha bless
And his weed is from the west
And you'll never get it done
Your bitin', you can bet it on your life
It's 4/20 every night, who wanna get high?
Do you want to get high?
You might also like
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side
Pass the joint on the left hand side
And then put it in the air if you wanna get high

I'm Green Evidence
On the podium, stands the minister
I see weed from cypress trees
I just finished up
I'm center stage high
Civic center stage dive
Even summer, winter, spring
And fall, ain't the same
My heads in the clouds
Of smoke then I choke and laugh
Then toke on the left hand side
No joke work
Can touch these Los Angeles souls
We twist herbs up
The word's a dangerous flow (Go!)
(Only on the left hand...)
When I smoke, I'm tilted to the side like a kick stand
Roll up a rock and call me a middle man
I'm sinkin' a riddle like it was quicksand
One *snort* clear out your nasal passage
Wit the medicine of Dristan
Voila, my mind at ease
The Policeman (Whoop-Whoop) wanna come find my trees
Hashish from Iraq
Will make my eyes chinese
Tearing up the studio just tryin' to find my keys
(La, la, la, la) It's like that ya'll

Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side (la, la, la, la)
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Then put it in the air if you wanna get high
Do you want to get high?Embed
