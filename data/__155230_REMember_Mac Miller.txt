Yup, yup
Yup
Uh

I hope you're proud of me, dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories like they were movie scenes
I know I been the shit, all these people full of me
I admit, I guess I'm full of myself, too
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you, but
This life move fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hittin' your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stop
For now, I need to run to any place that a train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listenin', couldn't get real interested
My days gettin' darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up

I remember
When we were just kids
We knew nothin' at all
And we would talk about the life we lived in
West Virginia
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia
You might also like
It's a dark science when your friends start dyin'
Like, "How could he go? He was part-lion"
Life goes on, the tears all dried and
Couple years are gone by by then, uh
Can you please help me find my friend?
I give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
So you don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Yeah, life's short, don't ever question the length
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought
Go 'head, just give it a shot, you'll remember shit you forgot

'Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
When the world's lookin' hopeless
I'ma still hold shit down

I remember
When we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
And we would talk about the life we lived in
West Virginia
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia
