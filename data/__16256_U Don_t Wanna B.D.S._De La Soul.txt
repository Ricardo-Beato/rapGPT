5 ContributorsU Don’t Wanna B.D.S. Lyrics
Ha, check it out
It's Bumpy Knuckles, baby, also known as Freddie Foxxx
That's right, and I came to check my niggas De La Soul
See, y'all niggas don't really wanna bust that shit, huh?
You know what I'm sayin'?  So I'ma show you niggas the super-laser-gamma-ultra-killer-nigga special
You niggas ain't no killers
You motherfuckers ain't gon' hurt nobody, nigga
You better keep rhymin', nigga
'Fore I smack the shit out of you, you little fuckin' sissy
You niggas ain't real, that's right
It's De La Soul, baby, and Bumpy motherfuckin' Knuckles, baby
Alright, come on

Check my stats, entire, apparat'
Even from the days when I had to roll strapped
Wonderin' if I got to go back to that
Just to rub records from rap and kick facts
To tracks and stack, one ho got K'ed
Yeah, some got paid, some waved in a phase
Fact of the matter, my style will never fade
Managin' to keep it all A-grade
So you can stay nourish and flourish with the truth
Ain't no lie  some niggas I know
If I need a mayday
For some fuckin niggas tryin' to play me crazy
Causin' interruptions to my big payday
Playin' with them guns make them fuckin' leary
But if it's clearly
Merely and surely and how it's gotta be
I got some thorough niggas that's ridin' me
So with your bullshit, I'm not buyin' it, B
Don't come around thinkin' you can try it with me
'Cause, uh
You might also like
You don't wanna bust that shit (Uh-uh)
You don't wanna bust that shit (No, no)
You don't wanna bust that shit (Uh-uh)
You don't wanna bust that shit (No, no)
You don't wanna bust that shit (Uh-uh)
You don't wanna bust that shit (No, no)
You don't wanna bust that shit (Uh-uh)
You don't wanna bust that shit

Shick-shick, click-a-clack
This is where my people headin' at
Innocent people are carryin' gats
Now what the fuck is all that?
Is it 'cause times live like a wire?
Gettin' shock-treated by the crossfire
Ha-siyahh, burn bare, well prepared
To make my decision for my livin'
I ain't the one robbin', I'm the one givin'
Hip-hop driven and willin' to die for it
When Scott LaRock died, man, I cried and shit
Then some cats got rich callin' a woman a bitch
But ain't no woman like the one I got
And if you call her a bitch, well, you might get—
And I know the feelings is mutual
It's uncivilized and unsuitable
Crips and Bloods are recruitable
But you don't wanna bust that shit (Uh-uh)
You don't wanna bust that shit (No, no)
You don't wanna bust that shit (Uh-uh)
You don't wanna bust that shit (No, no)
You don't wanna bust that shit (Uh-uh)
You don't wanna bust that shit (No, no)
You don't wanna bust that shit (Uh-uh)
You don't wanna bust that shit

Haha, yeah, you get the motherfuckin' point, huh?
You niggas get the motherfuckin' point, huh?
That's right, so while you niggas is sittin' up in central booking, cryin' like bitches, huh?
I'm in the motherfuckin' holdin' block waitin' for your sweet pussy punk ass
And I'ma whoop the shit out of you for gettin' on a fuckin' record, actin' like you a fuckin' killer
I'ma show you niggas what a motherfuckin' killer's all about, huh?
You niggas ain't no motherfucking gangsters
You don't wanna bust that motherfuckin' shit, punk
I'll punch your whole chest cavity out, faggot
You ain't no real nigga, nigga
I'll smack the shit out of you
'Cause you ain't a fuckin' live nigga
You sittin' in central booking, cryin' like a bitch, waitin' for your father to come bail you out
And Freddie Foxxx don't play that shit, nigga
That's right, Bumpy Knuckles, motherfucker
And if you don't know, now you motherfuckin' know
Ayo, De La, check it out, it's your motherfuckin' man
And if anyone of them niggas get sidewindin' with you, nigga
Let me know and I will send them niggas hot ones like I'm a motherfuckin' Mexican
Feel me on that one, huh?
'Cause them niggas know me, nigga
Believe me, nigga, they know me
The motherfuckin' troublemaker, that's right
And De La Soul is rollin' with Bump' Knux', nigga
So what? Tell me, what?
