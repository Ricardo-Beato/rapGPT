15 ContributorsDeserve Lyrics
Yeah
21
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

Man I feel like I deserve this shit (I deserve it)
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't help me grind for this shit
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more

Shootouts on shootouts on shootouts on shootouts
Young nigga done been on them shootouts
Where yo ass was at dog?
When we was in Wynhollows, nigga, with them tools out
Compton Red's in the cut tryna hit the dope, nigga where the cut in
Tied his partna up in the cut
Me and Lil Harold had took a laptop
That nigga had bussed so the nigga got popped
Me and Johnny tried to rob everything
Mookie tried to tell us, do the right thing
Larry died, man, I cried twice
Chevy went down the road nigga twice
They tried to give my nigga T-Tay life
Tip and Metro nigga ready to fight
I keep Lotto with me, real ripe
Pussy niggas, nigga we don't like
Free Lil Tooto, he gon' open a fight (Pew, pew)
RIP Tayman, that's why I got that knife
I don't get excited about the fame (21)
Bitch I'm still with the same gang (21), bitch I still claim the same thing (21)
Still take a pussy nigga chain
You might also like
Man I feel like I deserve this shit
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit, they what?
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more

12 can't arrest me no more (No more), ain't no roaches on the floor
Ain't no flowers in this clique, ain't no flowers in this shit
We done cut the snakes off (Off), had to cut them niggas off (Off)
Niggas don't wanna see you with nothing, unless you giving these niggas something
I had to get me some money (Some money), bitch and that drum hold a hunnid
You run up, you know that I'm gunning, 2Pac nigga, thugging (2Pac)
A lot of niggas changed on me, I just bought some chains on me
I just bought a Range Rover, this shit ain't 'bout the fame homie (No)
Mookie told me I deserve it (Mookie), momma told me I deserve it (Momma)
I know if Tayman was alive (RIP), he would tell me I deserved it (My brother)
I got the sack and start splurgin', balling like I'm James Worthy
Pussy niggas ain't worth it, before I did some other murders (21)


Man I feel like I deserve this shit
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit, they what?
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling no dope (no dope), 12 can't arrest me no more (No more)6Embed
