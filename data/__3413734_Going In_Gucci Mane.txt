4 ContributorsGoing In Lyrics
Standing in V.I.P. a hundred fifty deep
Jelwery all over me I look like Mr. T
My necklace is full of diamonds hell yea I'm shinnig bright
And bitches starrin at me starring so inpolite
What a sight to see tattoo all over me
A walkin work of art I took a lot of ink
Kids want my autograph hoes want my phone number
But I'm so damn conceited gave her the wrong number
No need to speak I rather keep it brief
I took a couple keys 
Maybe to you but damn sure not to me
Five hundred fifty a piece now that's a lot of trees
 (2x)
I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in
Once again, once again, once again, once again
I play to win, I play to win

I ride exotic cars, I smoke expensive weed
Yeah, that's the life of Gs and you are not a G
And you can't walk with me because you are not with me
He wants to get in free but he is not with the team
This is not a dream and this is not a game
Step on my denim jeans, is up by 50 grands
Of in the club wgrams
That's a half a pound we blew it like a fan
Nigga I'm the man, women taking pictures
They want to touch my hands they want to hit my swishers
I'm fuckin with you, if you fuckin with me
Cause we just bought the bar, so is ya drinkin with me?
You might also like (2x)

I'm in magic city, the center of attention
I'm standing in the light I'm lookin like a tiki
A whole a milli I mean a cool million
Since they know I'm ballin they want to have my children
Want to feel it, do you really feel it?
This isn't just rap is really how I kick it
I'm chillin like a villian cause really I'm a villian
So listen to my struggle I make you see my vision
Like a blind man you can't see the kid
I'm like a deaf man cause you can't tell me shit
Bitches fight daily you ain't fight cases
Got money so out wasted I'm thirty rolling glacier
 (2x)Embed
