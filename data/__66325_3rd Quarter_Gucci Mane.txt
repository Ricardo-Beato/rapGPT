21 Contributors3rd Quarter LyricsChorus:
Is you rollin'? Yeah I roll kush daily, Fuck you pay me, Fuck you fuck you
Fuck the CEO, Fuck the artist and the goons too
Smell like pussy over there, nigga fuck you
Verse 1:
Money keep coming in so I ain't even worried
I'm richer than your Daddy baby and I ain't even thirty
A nigga made a diss song and I ain't even heard it
Never mention homie's name cause he ain't worth it
Thought about a charm cause I felt like splurging
Showed my jeweler love then he made the chain perfect
Man, I'm one take perfect, VVS diamond chains, don't they look pretty
And I don't leave with the ones, Nigga thats petty
This pretty red girl said fuck it I'm quitting
Dance till your white big toe start splitting
I'm hood rich, stupid rich, and I ain't bullshitting
A thousand carats on baby I ain't bullshitting
Eight grand gone I ain't been ten minutes
Baby gimme two minutes, twenty more coming
Later do eighty-four hundred I'm throwing
Dually truck, Hummer truck, my truck game stupid
Just like Lo I pull up in something foolish
Red diamond chain but it sure ain't cupid
I came along way from that '84 Buick
ITS GUCCI

Verse 2:
My car game foolish boy, I'll show you how to do things
Dirty shoes shawty first you need to change your shoestrings
All on my dick like a bitch with a g-string
Sucker ass nigga like a nigga with a tongue ring
Gucci got a pump and I bought that thing for one thing
Smoked nine joints now the nigga think he John Wayne
Yea I think I'm bad cuz I got a stupid fight game
One punch shawty I will make you see the light mayne
Stomp-out shawty I will make you read my Jordans
Try Gucci Mane boy you must be retarded
Glock forty-five but I still got the forty
Have your ma-ma screaming oh lord
Shawty dirty whoadie pimp juice
So Icy trap boss, try me I will kill you
Shawty dirty whoadie pimp juice
So Icy CEO, pussy I will kill you
Chorus:
Is you rollin? Yea I roll kush daily, fuck you pay me, fuck you fuck you
Fuck the CEO, fuck the artist and his goons too

Verse 3 (partial):
Drumma Boy on my mixtape how'd you do that?
Gucci what it cost cuz I know he charge a whole lot
Cash out shawty man I think I want the whole lot
If it ain't pimped out then I got a whole lot
30 minutes gone and I think I smoked a whole ounce
Not by myself man I smoked it wit the whole house
Drop top Chevy when I pull up to my ol' house
Damn it feel good ridin round my hood iced out
Lights out!Embed
