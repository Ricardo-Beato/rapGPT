8 Contributors2 Worlds, Pt. 2 Lyrics
Ohhh we had to do this shit to 'em again man
I need to make these niggas right
Wo (Wo)

Look! I started off, niggas hard and soft
But acting hard and raw
Sneak dissing, you retarded
Raw, they wasn't smart at all

Shoot 'em up, Then I watch 'em fall
Fuck that bitch and kick her like a soccer ball
Pull up on her pussy just to pop it off

Double life and a nigga been stressin'
Played your song, damn that shit was depressin'
Niggas flexin' in studio sessions
Bad bitch and I swear she a blessin'
Boy I'm the man, you rap and don't got a plan
Free my little bro off the gang

You play with me, I'm let that shit blam
And where you stand is where you gon' land, Wow
You might also like
Drop my new shit, its exclusive
How I do dis' they be clueless
The way I'm killing these rappers, its ruthless
But I pity the fool 'cause they stupid

Niggas talk crazy, won't do shit (Talking stupid)
Talking that looselip, They already long as a pool stick
And we uhaul when we move shit

Running looselip, bro got blue tips
But be ducking niggas on some guc shit
Pulling fucking triggers on a nuisance
But I'm not a gangsta I be coopin'

Fuck her on monday and call her a cutie
I'm fucking another bitch by Tuesday
No fucking, no nigga I'm toting a tooly
These bitches don't mean nothing to me

Hollow thrills, I don't swallow pills, I'm bout my dolla' bills
A real nigga, cause my father real but people plot and kill
Real nigga, you should fucking know
And its double S fucking O, we'll fuck your ho
And we'll slap your bro, wow

When they see you down, they don't see the vision
Grinding hard was a sweet decision
Pocket stuffed they on Peter Griffen
Now I'm making money I complete the mission
Bitches used to block me, now they wanna jock me
And she give me sloppy like her teeth is missing
Bro they keep a shotty like a fucking hobby
Chop a haters body now he breathing different
Quarter back shit in the field due
They keep your ass down to conceal you
The killing our kids on the steel moon
They'll be busting at niggas, what will do

If bro see you up, I'm like kill who
If he point at you imma kill you
I'm out on the field and niggas be fake
And I'm paraplegic, don't feel you

Nigga straight, she don't mind my posture
Eating steak, benihanas and lobster
Wish a nigga with em like Mr. Crocker
Put a fo' with a sprite of a boxer
Sippin' on lean so it fuck up my posture
While young niggas on my roster
If I ain't a chopper you gon' need a doctor
Or a breathalyser, he ain't breathing properly
I fucked her throat, so she ain't speaking properly
If the fans come, we ain't speaking louder, Shhh, Don't say a sound
In my trap you gon' work bitch and don't lay around
I don't like sneak dissing and don't play around
If you got a problem won't don't you go say it now
If your plug work with us we gon' show em some love
But if he taxin' we gon' take em down

Gang (Gang, Gang, gang, gang,)
(Skrt, skrt) (Huh, Huh) (Wow, wow)1Embed
