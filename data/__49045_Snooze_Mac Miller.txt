25 ContributorsSnooze Lyrics
Get some brand new kicks, couple hundred on the jeans
I been spendin' all this money, got me feelin' like a G
Hand-me-down gear, this some shit you never seen
Droppin' three stacks, now I'm so fresh, so clean
See, we never coulda dreamed of
All the shit me and my team does
Girls see me like, "Damn, you look good, now you cleaned up"
Feelin' fresh, got my teeth brushed
I'ma new kid, been waitin' to do this
They hatin' up on my plate, got some steak and it's Ruth Chris
Been feelin' like a true pimp, biatch
It's '05, I'm the Steelers, you the Seahawks
This weed I keep hittin' makin' me cough
The jolly giant, I'm Jack, smokin' the Beanstalk
I get hoes in boat shoes, style, I won't lose
Welcome to the old school, bitch

Now my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer
We be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)
You might also like
Hit snooze, I ain't tryna wake up yet
I'ma keep on dreamin', be the straight-up best
And I'm blessed, everyday I'm gettin' straight-up fresh
My homies like, "Mac, damn, you get your cake up"
Yes, I did, that's the life I live, I grind all day
High school, sellin' mixtapes in the hallway
I bet they never thought I'd be this cool
Now they understand why I skip school
Had my dreams, wasn't worried at all
That's why if I'm gettin' bored, I go splurge at the mall
I got money (I got money), I got bitches (I got bitches)
I got everything they dreamin' of, and I ain't done shit yet
This major leagues, big business
Used to have a wish list, now I just give gifts
Shit, it make me happy
Here's how to reach me, you can get at me

Now my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer
We be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)
When the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)

Now my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer
We be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)1Embed
