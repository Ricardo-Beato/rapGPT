14 ContributorsHold It Now Lyrics
Now here's a little story I got to tell
About a gangsta-ass bitch y'all know so well
It started way back in history
With Lil' Kim, Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G

Go Kim, go Kim (Hold, hold it now)
Go Kim, go Kim (Hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim, go Kim (Hold, hold it now)
Go Kim (Woah, hold it, hold it now)

Now here's a little story I gots to tell (Uh-huh)
'Bout the first rap bitch to rock Chanel (Uh-huh)
Taught you how to get money and pop Cristal
Even gave y'all tips on ridin' cock as well (Hey)
The Beehive, stickers say, "Better beware"
If it's buzzin' in the spot, you know my boys is here (Bzz)
If we in the parking lot, you know the toys is there
Pushin' drop Bee Wagons, two doors, ya hear?
Hold it now, the Queen's sittin' in the chair
Now y'all wanna dress sexy and dye your hair?
Will the real Kim stand up? There's frauds in here
I'm 'bout to pull the plug on all y'all broads this year (Lights out)

When we come to the clubs, they be like (Hold, hold it now)
When we pull up on them dubs, they be like (Hold it, hold it now)

Now all my, all my, all my bitches rub ya titties if ya love Biggie
And all my niggas grab ya dicks if you feelin' a bitch
I'm in the middle of the dance floor (Go Kim, go Kim) killin' this shit
With the Belve', tryin' not to spill in this shit (Go)
You know the Queen show love when I'm up in the club (Uh-huh)
I like to play with my coochie when I'm up in the tub
You a sensitive thug, let me give you a hug
Y'all thirsty-ass niggas, take this bottle of bub
I'm the first lady, so I can't lose
Because of me, y'all rock rhymes in high heel shoes
Lil' Kim the Grammy winner get love worldwide
Now hold that, yo, Havoc, let the beat ride

When we come to the clubs, they be like (Hold, hold it now)
When we pull up on them dubs, they be like (Hold it, hold it now)
Where my bitches and my thugs gettin' right? (Hold, hold it now)

You see, Frank White taught me how to play the game
La Bella Mafia, nigga, I play to reign
They pump my album in the street like they pump the 'caine
I'm like bleach, Lil' Kim leave a permanent stain
I'm feared in my country like Saddam Hussein
I might give a little head to— (Hold it, hold it now)
All we ask is y'all show respect
'Cause we don't want talk, big homie, just cut the check
Now I'm sittin' outside in my 6.6
Just signed a lil' deal, about 6.6
Used to transport bricks and make 6.6
If you look in my garage, I got six joints (Hold it, hold it now)

When we come to the clubs, they be like (Hold, hold it now)
When we pull up on them dubs, they be like (Hold it, hold it now)
Where my bitches and my thugs gettin' right? (Hold, hold it now)
Come chill in V.I.P. with us for the night (Woah, hold it, hold it now)
