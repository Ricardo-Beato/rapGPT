21 ContributorsAlphabet Bitches Lyrics
Santana I see you, haha
Citas's son!
Mama please don't be mad at me for this one
But I gotta tell my story...
I had to do it
Check, my name is Weezy baby
Please say the baby
If you're not, don't say it at all
This is my story

Well, the A is for Ashley, she always ask for me
To take it out her pussy, put it right in her ass
And the B is for Britney, she right in the class
She be hating on Ashley, 'cause she tight in the ass
The C is for Christina want me to big screen her
The way she dick Kiss should be a misdemeanor
So if you seen her, I been searchin but can't find her
Ever since I been with Diamond with Diamonds in her vagiña
And the E is for ever-elegant Erika
Sweet red bitch, we used to call her Miss America
I ain't gon' lie, now, Erika is a dog
And to them Magnolia niggas, she done fucked 'em all, Slim!
Speaking of Slim, the F is for Fat
A real skinny ho so you know why they call her that
And the G for Gabrielle, you can call her Gabby
But all my homeboys seem to call her "Nasty," man!

H is for my H-town homegirl Heather
Head, haze, purple, pussy, pills, forever
My mami's dedicated, aww, yeah
She neva tell me n"o," the most she say is "Not here"
And then, uh, I is for Isis, mami a Pisces
She fuck rappers for free, but hit them actors with prices
They always pay 'cause her body the nicest
But I hit that everyday, back when I had the wife-ahhhhh
J for Joanessa, kinda sexy with light eyes
She didn't make the band but she still doing quite fine
The K for Kia, I hate that bitch
Because she super fucking fine but she can't take that dick
And then the L is for LaKia, that's Kia's twin
Night and day, every time we fuck, I fall right in
And the M is for Maria, María, Mariá
She hangs out with NeCole whose fucking Olivia, well!

P for Paulina she go all night
If I don't fuck her once a week, she pro'ly go on strike
And the Q is for Queen 'cause she is my Queen
No, she can't ride it like Renata, but her body is mean
And the S is for Shayna, a sucker in bed
She take advantage of the fact that I'm a sucker for head
And the T is for Tara, too much mascara
Tone down on the blush, like you tryna scare us
U for Ursula, she with Vicky
They both come over and work out with me
The W for Wanda, she kinda remind ya
Of that game Street Fighter, hands like E. Honda
The Y for Yvette, she get wetter than most
She always tryna get high, but I just let her get low
And last, but not least, the Z goes to Zara
She get high off zinfandel and masturbate to The Carter
Yeah!
