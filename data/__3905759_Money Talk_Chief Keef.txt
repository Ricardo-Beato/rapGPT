8 ContributorsMoney Talk Lyrics
O.k., I'm throwing money
I'm talking by any means
And I'm in the trap shawty
Tryna get a lot of green
Smokin' kush, and sippin' lean
Shawty gone off a bean
Shawty gon' fuck the team
Get lost, all my niggas is a boss
And if he ain't with the clan
Then that nigga get lost
She gettin' off
And these bags I'm gettin' off
No shorts, no loss
All we talk is money talk
In the hood bitches know, everywhere know my name
Run a bitch in a minute
See, I got a lot of game
If she say she love me but she really love my head
And if she ain't tryna fuck I tell that bitch get outta here
In the trap countin bands, countin money, gettin high
And I'm so high I can't even touch the sky
Ballin me and my niggas
Where that money? gotta get it
And I'm diharrea shawty, excuse me cuz I just shitted
You might also like
O.k., I'm throwing money
I'm talking by any means
And I'm in the trap shawty
Tryna get a lot of green
Smokin' kush, and sippin' lean
Shawty gone off a bean
Shawty gon' fuck the team
Get lost, all my niggas is a boss
Work on deck, all we talk is money talk
Get lost, all my niggas is a boss
Work on deck, all we talk is money talk

My double barrel beat this beat
I'm drummin' in this industry
Smokin' sour diesel got me buzzin like a bumble bee
My coke white as a toilet seat
You know I gotta keep a heat
For a hundred dollars, man, my own guys tried to murder me
Not physically but mentally
You know I gotta watch these streets
Niggas still be watching me but now they do it sneakily
Fuck a friend, don't need em
I'm all about this money
My cash come in time, but my watch still as a frozen tree
Creamy in the middle but outside it is all diamond
Get off of me, get off of me
These bitches can't stop stalking me
They all up on my dick like it's a mountain
These bitches work for me
Couple stacks I'm eatin' G
Creamy soda, double C

All we talk is money talk
We talk is money talk
We talk is money talk
Pussy nigga I talk money talk
This money walk
These bitches goin'
That money talk
I said that money talk
That money talk
These bitches goin'
That money talk
