10 ContributorsHot 4 U Lyrics
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Knew a girl named Shelley, six-pack belly
When we made love, she made it shake like jelly
Put her own video star on my tele'
Lived in the Bronx on the block named Fteley
Had to be jetty 'cause this other ho Netty
Kept blowing me up, her jonesing was steady
Told my man Louie that I really wasn't ready
Louie, when we did it, man, we both got sweaty
This girl from my past had ridiculous ass
She attended UMASS and she passed every class
Walked down the hall with her stuck up sass
Talked to basketball players, she liked how they passed
But when I use to hit it, the bullcat, she quit it
She wouldn't admit it, but shorty was addicted (Say word)
Word, nigga you heard
Like a fiend with a clean when he catches a bird
Knowing how we living, I'ma talk about Mayo
Sagittarian mami, her love was a K.O.Â 
We was on the under, had to stay on the lay-low
Used to go so deep that she used to say "ayo"
Rocked with her friend, but her friend drove both way
Asked her about it and she used to say "no way"
Just let it go, yo, I used to say okay
Just another day, but Phife, anyway
You might also like
I put it down, man, what you gon' do?
Well, I put it down, son, what you gon' do?
We put it down for the area crew
All the shorties that's smoking yahoo
Looking good if you sipping on your brew
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you (The truth)
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you (Ali Shaheed)
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you (Come on, Phife)

Met a shorty named Kenny from East Saint Louie
Body good and plenty, the finest in Missouri
If you had no money, you better hit the highway
Even in her own right, she had to do it her way
It was an ill situation when I met Dantanya
Worked in Saint Louis in her mother's hair parlor
Use to hit her man for cake to come see me
Her and her man from home, they sold heemy
We had it hemmed, locked, sold and shit
When I dug her, yo, she said I was the ultimate
Broke her up kid, driving the drill like Truck Turner
All other things, they did not concern her
People that we love, yo, we love with a passion
I'm the type of cat that brings forth the action
You feeling me, yo? I hope you hearing me, yo
One more thing before you start cheering me, yo
I put it down, Phife, what we gon' do?
Well, I put it down, son, what you gon' do?
We put it down for the area crew
All the shorties that's smoking yahoo
Looking good if you sipping on your brew
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you

Come here, ma, we make it hot for you
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you
Come here, ma, we make it hot for you
Come here, ma, we make it hot for youEmbed
