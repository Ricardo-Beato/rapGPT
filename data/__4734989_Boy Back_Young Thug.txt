67 ContributorsBoy Back Lyrics
Mustard on the beat, ho

Got rackity-rack-rack-racks in my knapity-sack-sack-sack (Racks)
Ever since Tap-Tap-Tap, I feel like the brown boy back-back-back (I'm back)
Prada shoes with the strap, in every color, I'm proud of that (Proud of that)
All they see is success but they don't know where I started at
I can't take no days off, I got money I gotta get (No)
Hit the gas and I take off, pipes be cracklin' when I shift (Skrrt)
It's clear as you can see, got a big bankroll on me
Got a coupe, got power seats three months before release

Tattoos under my sleeve (Yeah)
Got nigga old girl on her knees (Yeah)
I spent a hundred thousand dollars on trees
I spent a whole 'nother hundred on tees (Woo)
She got hair all down to her knees
Now I call her Maybelline (No cap)
I got a cougar bitch in my driveway
Tryna make a nigga pay her lease (Swear)
Trap, trappin', trappin'
Whole lot of bales and bricks, Ikea
Woah, woah, woah
I just been sippin' on lean, I don't see us
I would never trap, I was tryna rob him and his dealer
Never goin' back, switchin' my shit like Ron Artest
(Switch it up)
Rickity-rack-rack-racks
Throwin' off the Maybach hatch-hatch-hatch
I've been on set-set-set
Throw it down the field, no crack back-back-back, ooh
Ran up my sack-sack-sack
I done went and bought all the set-set-sets (Slatt)
Duck tape the patch-patch-patch
Three hundred horse on the Cadillac, woah

Got rackity-rack-rack-racks in my knapity-sack-sack-sack (Racks)
Ever since Tap-Tap-Tap, I feel like the brown boy back-back-back (I'm back)
Prada shoes with the strap, in every color, I'm proud of that (Proud of that)
All they see is success but they don't know where I started at
I can't take no days off, I got money I gotta get (No)
Hit the gas and I take off, pipes be cracklin' when I shift (Skrrt)
It's clear as you can see, got a big bankroll on me
Got a coupe, got power seats three months before release

Rackin' up Krispy Kreme
Every day I wear crispy tee
I know you ain't gettin' no cheese
Your shoe tongue ain't got no C's
All my diamonds cold, on freeze
Got designer A to Z
I know B's and I know C's
Make your bitch fall in love with a G
Now I don't wanna wear no J's
Pointers in the Cartiers on my face
Stackin' up for my future, came up livin' day to day
Should I buy a new watch? I just made a hundred racks today
Gucci my tube socks, I got a different pair for every day
I can't get no sleep, I got some habits I gotta kick
I been drippin' all week, minimum three thousand on my 'fit
When you work for a boss like me, there's lots of advantages
In my wildest dreams, I don't think that I could imagine this
Got rackity-rack-rack-racks in my knapity-sack-sack-sack (Racks)
Ever since Tap-Tap-Tap, I feel like the brown boy back-back-back (I'm back)
Prada shoes with the strap, in every color, I'm proud of that (Proud of that)
All they see is success but they don't know where I started at
I can't take no days off, I got money I gotta get (No)
Hit the gas and I take off, pipes be cracklin' when I shift (Skrrt)
It's clear as you can see, got a big bankroll on me
Got a coupe, got power seats three months before release8Embed
