Lean, lean
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Turbo)
Bang bang, bang bang

You throw it, I'ma catch it, teach you a lesson (Yeah, bang bang)
He be texting, and we be sexing (Sosa baby, bang bang)
I'm dressed in designer, and she be naked (Louis, Gucci)
And she go up and down, I'm like, "Let's get it, let's get it" (Bang bang, bang bang)
Girl, you got a hold of me, don't let go of me (Sosa, yeah)
I'm sorry but I can't eat it like groceries (No, I can't)
I'm sippin' on lean and smokin' on OG (Lean, dope)
You don't have to worry, girl, it's just you and me (Sosa baby, GBE baby)

She like, "What were you doing with your friends at 2 AM?"
Sippin' lean like soup (Lean, lean)
I'm finna pick you up in this coupe, what it do? (Skrrt, skrrt)
I don't see nothin' wrong (Nah)
With a gangster being on your mind (Sosa baby, GBE baby)
You know I got them bands (Ftftftft, beep)
You can't throw shade because I was taught to shine (Bang bang, bang bang)
You might also like
You throw it, I'ma catch it, teach you a lesson (Yeah, bang bang)
He be texting, and we be sexing (Sosa baby, bang bang)
I'm dressed in designer, and she be naked (Louis, Gucci)
And she go up and down, I'm like, "Let's get it, let's get it" (Bang bang, bang bang)
Girl, you got a hold of me, don't let go of me (Sosa, yeah)
I'm sorry but I can't eat it like groceries (No, I can't)
I'm sippin' on lean and smokin' on OG (Lean, dope)
You don't have to worry, girl, it's just you and me (Whoa, bang bang, bang bang)
