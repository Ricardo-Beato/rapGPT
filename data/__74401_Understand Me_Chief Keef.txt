Sosa baby
Ftftftftftftftftftft, beep, beep, beep, beep

That bitch say that she don't understand me (Fuck her)
I be flexin' now my money come in handy (Flexin', flexin', flexin')

I gotta get this money, understand me? (Stand me)
Understand me (Stand me), understand me? (Sosa baby, know I'm rockin' baby)
Bitch, my name is Sosa, you can call me Sammy (Go, go, go, go)

Everywhere I go I spend a lot of cash (Ftftftftftftftft)
Spend them stacks, spend them stacks and get it back (Beep, beep, beep)
OTF, my niggas they invented that (OTF)
Smoking on this loud, call it the stinky pack (Dope)
Countin' so much money that my fingers cramp (Let's get it)
All my niggas wildin’, we don’t give a damn (Looney)
Ask your main bitch, she know who I am (Sosa baby)
Rob him for his taxes if he’s a son of Sam (Bang bang)
Who gives a fuck, we don’t care bout nothin’, fam (Nah, nah, nah)
You got money for a verse, send it through MoneyGram (Beep, beep, beep)
I'ma drop the top when I buy me a Phantom (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Kidnap this fuck nigga for some ransom (Bang, bang, bang bang)
And if his mouth movin', my gun dance some (Bang, bang, bang bang)
I pull up in that Porsche, they like, "Damn, son" (Skrrt, yoon, yoon)
All these bitches on me, I won’t wife none (Nah, nah, nah)
I have them bitches runnin’, when the pipe come, ayy

Bitch, my name is Sosa, you can call me Sammy (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

Fake ass niggas that’s a shit I don’t like (Don’t like)
Kilogram flow, that’s the shit I dont write (Nah)
All these fucking games, that’s the shit I don’t play (Play)
Two door Murcielago and it's smoke grey (Yeah)
Keep that 50 cal. that bitch come in handy (Woo)
It will open up a nigga like some candy (Boom)
In the barrel, look like a Cambell’s soup can (Soup can)
Banana clips in the closet like a fruit stand (Haha)
Talkin' 36 O’s and I'm the OG (OG)
One time I sit and watch a nigga snort a whole key (Damn)
Muzzle on the rock, while it flash it go bang (Bang)
Spent a hundred grand one ring, no chain (That's right)
Got a bitch in wild 100‘s, keep it 300 (300)
Man, that head so good, bought her a 300 (300)
Understand me (Stand me), nigga, understand me? (Stand me)
If thuggin' was a category I'd win a Grammy (Yeah)
That bitch say that she don't understand me (Fuck her)
