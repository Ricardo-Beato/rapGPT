(Welcome to Eternal Atake, the dark world)
(你准备好了吗?)

I turned to an addict, I bought me a Patek
I bought her a baby one
Yeah, I bought me a Maybach, it came with two doors
Yeah, that's the Mercedes one (For sure)
I stay with the baddest, I'm countin' the cabbage
While makin' my lady cum (Yeah)
I bought a G-Wagen, that shit was the BRABUS
That's why I be racin' 'em (BRABUS)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war (Go get it)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war (Go get it)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war

I got static in my city, who fuckin' with me?
Pull up with this 30 and this chopper hold a fifty
Man, I heard that nigga Mickey, that's too risky
Man, we spray his car, spray his window, icky, icky
She keep suckin' on my dick, tryna get a hickey, hickey
Girl, I swear that pussy too wet, sticky, sticky
I kicked her right out of the front door, I'm picky, picky
Yeah, and every time she go to call my phone, I'm busy, busy (Yeah, yeah, hello, hello? Hello?)
I heard it's some niggas that's on my head (Brr)
I heard it's some niggas that want my bread
Oh my God
Y'all niggas better chill before y'all all be dead (Oh my God, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whole lot of, whole lot of hoes, whole lot of, whole lot of meds
Yeah, whole lot of, whole lot of clothes, niggas be stealin' my swag (Hold up)
Whole lot of, whole lot of emeralds, please tuck your baguettes
Yeah, whole lot of, whole lot of red rubies on my neck
Uzi, it came with a TEC
The brick, that came with a vet
I can teach you how to flex (Yes)
The Draco, it came with a vest
The condo, it came with a pit (Yeah)
My new bitch, she came with some neck (Yeah)
Man, these boys ain't believe me
Until I pulled up and my neck was on squeegee (Woah)
Man, these boys ain't believe me
They thought I believed in the devil like ouija
Man, these boys ain't believe me
A real rockstar, Chrome Heart on my beanie (Yeah)
I swear these boys cannot see me
That's why I be livin' my life like I'm Stevie
Wake up, Versace my bitch
I got on that Tisci, I eat fettuccine
