Rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
I'm rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean

I ain't neva seen a nigga like me
Where he at, where he from? I'd like to meet him
I'm a rolling stone, cookin' with the Rollie on 32 shots in my Nina
I'm a rolling stone, get my rollie pollie on, fuck it, Aquafina and Katrina
Traffic gas bags in the beemer. (or bimmer)
Pussy bald, head like leukemia
Watch me set it off, like Khadijah
Stuffing my cigar with the diesel
Pull up, jump off for the Keisha
C.O.D., I need my mo-ney-fa
Puerto Rico, and I don't need a visa
Dope white, name: Mona Lisa
Frank White head shot Tito
Longway not Carlito
Boot up off the molly, I don't fuck with the hijo
Porsche 9-1-1 got it out the repo
Trap house, naw bitch, I'm trappin' rollin stizzo
Gas bags, I got them bitches going for the lizzo
Fake chopped glass'll have them J's at the dizzo
I'm runnin' them, I'm a mob boss calling me Sunny
I'm connected with the pharm-ist, got them pints by the hunnids
Whole lot of C notes rubberbandin' my hunnids
Still makin' drug deals out the trunk of my Honda
Leanin' off a double seal, like I'm dumber than dumber
Rollin' off a molly pill, tryna fuck on yo mama

Rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
I'm rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
Rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
I'm rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean

I'm servin' you Xanax to lean the neighborhood pharmacist i'll serve you coedine
My bitch she servin' up P's and buy different bags then go by Saline
She speak different languages but she Portuguese
She drop in the fishes then whip it up in grease
My trap house but her name on the lease
We might get married like Nas and Kelis
My bad I'm trippin' I'm back on my G
Matte black the Forgi's and SRT8 the jeep
Just got an endorsement from servin' the lean
Thanks to extortion I'm cleaning the streets
Double R Royces I roll them in fleets
My trap house stay rollin' I'm never off beat
I'm baggin' up pounds to a new C Note beat
Trapper and rapper still strapped with them hammer
(I make the dope dance like I'm MC Hammer x2)
Chopin' up pharmacists I'm servin' you the grammar
And lean I get it from over the counter
Chopin' up pharmacists with cameras like Tony Montana
And choppas with clips like bananas
Rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
I'm rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
Rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
I'm rollin' round, juugin' P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean15Embed
