47 ContributorsWIFI LIT Lyrics
(Zaytoven)
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woo

Gone in the sky, over twenty thousand, I keep my WiFi lit (Woah, woah)
I spend over five thousand, that's just on one fit (Woah, woah)
I'm not goin' back no more when I ain't have shit (No)
Pray I get a new connect, pray I get a brick (Woah, woah)

I leave a bitch in the cold, oh
I don't act poor no more (No)
I left her sitting at the Loews, oh
'Cause she wasn't touchin' her toes, no
I'm on some rich nigga shit (Woah)
It's all about rich nigga timin'
Fully loaded whip
I'ma curve you with kindness
I'm in Hermes drip, not in the store, you can't find it (Not in the store)
I got stacks on me and they won't fit no wallet (Stacks, Freebandz)
I got Gucci socks on me and money in every pocket (Yeah)
I got Burberry seats, the color teriyaki (Yeah, woah, woah)
I'm on another wave
Cut the head off the Porsche (Cut it off)
Running with a pack of wolves, ain't no extortin' (No extortin')
VIP with AK's, very important (Brr)
Always riding with a gas torch (Gas)
Always riding with a mask
Young nigga playing with a pinky ring (Young)
Cost over five hundred bags (Five hundred bags)
Already know your homie singin', they 'bout to get him whacked
Soon as you let up, relaxed (Soon as you let up)
That's when they wait to attack (That's when they gettin' him)
Platinum majority of the plaques (Platinum majority)
Strikin' it off like a match (Skrrt, skrrt)
You might also like
Gone in the sky, over twenty thousand, I keep my wifi lit (Skrrt, skrrt)
I spend over five thousand, that's just on one fit (That's on one fit)
I'm not goin' back no more when I ain't have shit (Ain't never)
Pray I get a new connect, pray I get a brick (Uh, oh, oh)

You came from public housing, you servin' hand to hand, oh
You got that good salmon, it's smokin' and fresh out the can (Oh, oh)
You know how to stir your bowl up, you know how to flip your bands (Oh, oh)
I'm bout to go take two hundred thousand, just to go shop in Japan (Oh, oh)
I know the opps, they thinkin' foul, we 'bout to take out they mans (Ooh)
We gotta make some bullets shower, show you we ain't playing (Ooh)
You gon' smell this gun powder, it's gon' make you dance (Ooh)
I've been countin' it up for hours, done cramped my hands (Woah, woah)

Gone in the sky, over twenty thousand, I keep my wifi lit (Woah, woah)
I spend over five thousand, that's just on one fit (Woah, woah)
I'm not going back no more when I ain't have shit (no, no)
Pray I get a new connect, pray I get a brick (Pray, yeah, yeah)

WiFi lit (Woah, woah, woah)

Pass the bitch (Woah, woah, woah)
That's an assist (That's an assist)
Cookin' grits (Woah, woah, woah)
