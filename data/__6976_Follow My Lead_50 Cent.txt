Yeah... ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank y'all for comin' out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm

Girl when I go, where we go
I wanna take you 'round the globe with me
I got dough,  plenty baby you can blow with me
And baby I know that money ain't everything
But it's fo' sho' (fo' sho, fo' sho')
And ain't for nothin when you fuck, with, me
Now when I go

Follow my lead
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby, follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fucking crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And have to say, "baby I apologize"
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for telling lies
Like Janet Jackson said, I miss you much
I really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent
Baby, I can pass the day watching you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if it's okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha - I got a great sense of humor
First I make you smile then I woo you
You know I wanna do ya
Or do ya?

Follow my lead
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby, follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

After seven hours, New York to London, you're wonderin'
What's gon' be the next stop - I told you
I'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurting in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask your fan about me, they say 50 we love him
Without them there's no me, so I love them
Man they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
As my niggas are stressed, I pass the test
Every time I drop I'm burning hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't looking for commitment
We can fuck and be friends
Matter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz
I get it done with speed
Follow my lead
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby, follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead11Embed
