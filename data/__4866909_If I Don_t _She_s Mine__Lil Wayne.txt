8 ContributorsIf I Don’t (She’s Mine) Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, uh

She never say, "Never say, 'Never,'" yeah
She never wake up before 7 PM (Uh)
She never dressed for cold weather, uh
And she's mine, she's mine, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

She got the whole world in her panties, yeah
And she mean the world to me, I just don't know what that mean, oh, oh Lord
She got some first class pussy, she got some world class pussy
And she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

And who gon' love her if I don't, if I don't
And who gon' fuck her when I don't, no you won't
I choose to fuck her how I want, when I want
She's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

Sleeping ain't the same if I ain't sleeping with you, girl (Uh, yeah)
'Bout to drive myself crazy, u-turn after u-turn, oh
Looking at myself in the mirror like, "Nigga, you sure?" (Uh)
Baby got me all shook up and I'd rather be shaken not stirred
(Talk to 'em) I love her no matter what
I love her through thick and thin
I love the way her breath smells as soon as we wake up
I be like, "Ooh, give me kiss," yeah
And no matter what my friends try tell me
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that
You might also like
And who gon' love her if I don't, if I don't
Who gon' fuck her if I don't, no you won't
I choose to fuck her how I want, all I want
'Cause she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

She never say, "Never say, 'Never,'" yeah
She never wake up before 7 PM (Uh)
She never keep up with the weather, uh
And she's mine, she's mine, yeah, yeah, hol' up, hol' up

I fell from a cloud to her tongue
I fuck her so good, I got to bow when I'm done
She say all she wanna do is get wild and have fun
My hands in her panties, find a diamond in the rough
If they bottled her up, I'd be a lousy ass drunk
Tell her, "Rivers run deep, I'd rather jog than run though"
Tell her, "Swallow that pride, I ain't cutthroat"
Then she sit on the dick proud, like the front row
And we don't care about what you haters care about
So we don't hear about what you hating about
That's why we gon' move in a bigger ass house
With a whole bunch of rooms with no room for doubt
We got too much going on
Oh Lord, she ain't got no drawers on
But she decide if she wearin' em with a coin toss
Hold on, let me turn my phone off
And who gon' love her (And who gon' love her) if I don't, if I don't
And who gon' fuck her (And who gon' fuck her) if I don't, no you won't (Nope)
I choose to love her (I choose to love her) how I want, all I want
'Cause she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

And who gon' love her (And who gon' love her) if I don't, if I don't
And who gon' fuck her (And who gon' fuck her) when I don't, no you won't
You used to love her and you won't, now you don't
'Cause she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah

She never say, "Never say, 'Never'"
She never wake up before 7 PM (Uh)
She never dress for the cold weather
And she's mine, she's mine, all mine, yeah3Embed
