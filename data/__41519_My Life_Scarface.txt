2 ContributorsMy Life Lyrics
Oooohh, yo Vice drop this heat dog, ugh
Hit the bass line, yo Vice what you're doin' man?
Straight up, ugh

I'm too deep to quit, and too strict to fold
And you need to split nigga G into code
Come on, cause this year's to teach, homey speak to know it
Body bout what we talk about, you weak, you're row
The game is overcrowded so we fight for space
Neighbourhood show the hustle, still we grind to win
Tryin' to find a way, to come up on 2 pounds of yay
And double up it, ain't never happened touch it
A lot of niggas focued on their candy paints
Diamonds in the grills, steering wheels and grains
But I ain't trippin' out here, flippin' I just need to think
Money miny on a mission tryin' to steal me bank
Rlidin' in homicides we get it, fuck it, peepin' in horn
Killin' all these pussy niggas think they're keepin' in God
Pistol cocked on the block and all I'm fearin' is death
But then again nigga, roaddog you feelin' me yet
So if I died I'm tryin' to get it mamma, merely deed
And pray to God that he kept this spot in hell for me
Sad as fuck, but it makes me stuck down the row
Bust friends, back in the prison, foundin' rock to the truck
Here I smoke and tryin' to hide it but was played by the rule
And if live like the dope fiend then you can do what they do
I'm on my own in this whole dog world, all alone in the ghetto
Deep in weed, sweat in Jelly Nose
Worrey eyes, you either do it or you die
Crimin' in flood, ridin' in blood, cause this is your life
You might also like
Our golden law, no foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
Seen first ?? how to know the game can do
Will I loose it when you pumped the face?
Real nigga blues and it hold your owes
You're bold or fold no in betweens
Console your seems don't blow your creams
Also don't you loose your dreams
This is my life, this is my life

I just got word; my uncle done died
But ain't no tears on my face cause I done already cried
I been here before, dead to me is nothin' new
My heart's heavy, mamma gone, popps too
I tried my best to get my purpose to the Lord
But sometimes this shit be fuckin' with me hard
And I'm heartless, I'm a kid again
Lookin' out my window watchin' niggas get murdered
In college worked the parties
Stomack growlin, drinkin' water, just to get through the night
Goin' to school on an empty stomach gettin' the fights
Cause sure there were fights and I was bustin' like the sun bitch
The smallest nigga on the block lettin' the Guns click
I'm convicted before eleven walkin' through unto the tails
Searchin' for heaven and livin' in hell
They say I'm wrong for teach this on
Fuck what you believe, can't heal by myself
That's the way I'm livin', this is my life
Our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
Seen first ?? how to know the game can do
Will I loose it when you pumped the face?
Real nigga blues and it hold your owes
You're bold or fold no in betweens
Console your seems don't blow your creams
Also don't you loose your dreams
This is my life, this is my life

I only got one eye, but I see things ever so clear
Bein' acquainted with debts, but I never known fear
I still roll to spots, cats scared to go then
If it's a heaven for a G, if not, prepare to go then
I'd live for today and not promise tommorrow
Smoke weed and sip LEE and try to dry my sorrows
In this game of life ain't no rules to follow
And infact I'mma liver for them; it's a hard heal to swallow
I'm still the smallest cat with the biggest rep in H-Town
Stress in my life is gettin' hard to take down
Havin' visions of cats goin' to rip in my wake now
It feels like I'm about to have a nervous break down
It takes a big man to share this pride
Tryin' to get my soul right and put the bread inside
Y'all niggas just too scared to ride
They got it from "Still I alive" though "Why I Feel So Dead Inside"
This is my life....
Our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
Seen first ?? how to know the game can do
Will I loose it when you pumped the face?
Real nigga blues and it hold your owes
You're bold or fold no in betweens
Console your seems don't blow your creams
Also don't you loose your dreams
This is my life, this is my life1Embed
