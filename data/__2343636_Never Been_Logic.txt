91 ContributorsNever Been Lyrics
C-Sick
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams?
I know I'ma do it, go get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money
Don't make me mention
It don't cost nothin' but time for you to pay attention
Now don't get me wrong
I know there's people out there hatin' on ya
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative
Talk all you want about me homie, I'ma let it live
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive
Hatin' in your blood, you was born to be negative
You might also like
Never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

This is dedicated to everyone that never made it
And the people that persevered even though they was hated
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion
But on the real, the road to success is prone to collision
And every now and then something happens that's unexpected
Like that newborn in your life 'cause you was fuckin' unprotected
And I swear nobody perfect, hell, I know I ain't
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow, teach 'em everything I know
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

Um, you like that take? I like it
Yeah, should I make it more surreal though, or...
I think it's good, hey Bobby run it!62Embed
