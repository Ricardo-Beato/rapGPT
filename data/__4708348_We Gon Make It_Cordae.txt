Yeah, God bless the dreamchasers
If you got a dream, keep chasin' it
Never let nobody here trap your dreams
You gon' make it, yeah

I could've died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like, "Wait a minute'"
She know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it

See I know how it feels on the late nights, swimmin' with the great whites
Drownin' in the deep waters, know you got three daughters
Could use some resources, nah, we just need order
I got my own bad news, fuck a reporter
Niggas ain't even safe, they wanna deport us
Or rather keep us boxed in on the street corners
If you gon' stop and frisk a nigga, shit, at least warn us
My dawg still on probation, they got a leash on us
Far from stupid, in fact, I'm smarter than Harvard students
Sparked a movement and put an end to this garbage music
Got me thinkin' like this can't be life
These stupid ass niggas voted for the Antichrist
You might also like
I could've died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like, "Wait a minute'"
She know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it, yeah

It was hell here, my people killin' and it's 12 here
Got my mom a Black Card and she was just on welfare, that's goals
Did it on my own, I got myself here
When God asked me do I want this shit? I said, "Hell yeah"
I'm ready, when I put the crown on, it was heavy
I was drownin' in my past like when Katrina broke the levees in New Orleans
In my city, to them kids, I'm like Jordan
Every move I make like chess, it's important
I just went against the system, spending nights tryna reform it
Lay at night thinkin' I could lose my life just from doin' this
It's a sacrifice, I know it wouldn't be right if I forfeit
But I do it for the young kings that never had no voices, for real

I could've died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like, "Wait a minute'"
She know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it
Yeah, okay, I reminisce the cold days in wintertime, got home by dinner time
7-Eleven runs, Gatorade flavor lemon-lime
Hot Cheetos, Arizonas, oranges, clementine
The first job I ever applied for was Finish Line
Sometimes a nigga be forgettin', then remember I'm
Savior of the rap shit, the leader of the renaissance
Self-appointed, well anointed for my endeavors
I'm eyein' cheddar, applyin' pressure, defyin' set-ups
The rap game is based upon what niggas lyin' better
If truth is told, then you can grow and dyin' never
No, I'm everlastin', better graspin' this thing in life
I heard Meek hook and I told him to sing it twice, my God

I could've died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like, "Wait a minute'"
She know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it11Embed
