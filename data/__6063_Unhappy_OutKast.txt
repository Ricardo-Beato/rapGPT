36 ContributorsUnhappy Lyrics
Drowning in the gray cell to dwell in earthly hell
A pimp warrior fell (Fell, uh, uh, uh)
One-two, Sir Lucious L. Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth
Lucious, Luâ€” Lucious
Sir Lucious Left Foot
Has just entered
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked

First rule in this thang, never let 'em see you sweat
Never let 'em be a threat, and your feelings you must protect 'em
As well as your rectum, must keep self out of harm
Out of danger's way, let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell, you thought you was happy until that court date came
Couldn't abort that case, nobody to take your place
Family home is at stake, too late to escape and get on the run
You might also like
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked

Once upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child
Flip that smile upside down now
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny
Didn't have many, but had enough to get by
Enough to get fly, only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went
Like mom and dad's relationship, take a trip, you bring potato chips
I'll bring the hot sauce (Hot sauce)
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
1979, Dirty South, local lounge
Flip that smile upside down now
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
Graphic language, mild violence and the silence
Of the the fams, no members to remember
But I know just who I am, I've grown into a man
And like my nigga said, we executed the game plan
'Cause we got that hot sauce
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked (Flip that smile upside down now)

Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked (Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done
And your goose is cooked (Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done7Embed
