4 ContributorsGet â€™Em Up Lyrics
This 'bout is for the heavyweight championship of the world
I give you the one and only Cypress Hill

I say get down with us
Go smoke a pound with us
Shoot another round with us
Welcome to bounce with us

Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)

Straight up, we raise up
Been around for awhile we still blaze up (you hear it, man)
And haters pay up, I lay up in the cemetery
Bow down son, it's customary (do that, man)
We show up and blow up (boom)
Take over the whole show, then it's over
You know what (show what) feels good throwin' bones and such
Let lemme burn this track so I can light your blunts (blunt it up)
You might also likeEast coast, west coast, we mash up
Down south, overseas we cash 'em (huh)
In a whip we bunk, homie, stand up (stand up)
We back on the block, get your hands up (get your hands up)
Get dazed up and baked up (naah)
One little hit from the kush you're spaced out and fade out (here we go)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now
All the people in the back come on up now

I say get down with us
Go smoke a pound with us
Shoot another round with us
Welcome to bounce with us

Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)

Take notes, we make notes
We livin' that real shit, boy, no fake hoes (smoke that)
You know we break through, tear open the fuckin' coffin
No stoppin', so take precaution (it's easy man)
Get high strung and die young
But I'll calm you down with what's in my lungs (err)
Scared to try some, put you in a state of bliss (bliss)
Need some, homie? I give you a hit (take one)
Gangstas, hustlas we play rough
Everybody wanna talk, we don't say much
We roll so thick that you hate us (yeah, hear y'all)
You plan an attack on the paper (haha)
One crime, it's all time (yeah)
Never givin' in 'cause we ride the hardline (uh-huh)
Watch the star shine, we bring the whole house down (what?)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up now)

I say get down with us
Go smoke a pound with us
Shoot another round with us
Welcome to bounce with us

Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
In the green corner, undefeated as a professional
Is the one and only Sen Dog

 you spit nice
Go in all in the paint, you just get by
See me get high? Puffing like Mr. Marley, (uhh)
Hear his twitches in the low low of who's a Harley
We hang out and bang out (bang out)
All you scatter, when I pull the thang out and ring out (right now)
You don't know me, I shout my name out
Try to test me, boy, I blow your brains out (haha)
East side, west side,  we get 'em up (yeah)
Any enemies guess who set 'em up (ha)
You afraid of me, guess who let me up (let me up)
Take my stack, see who wet 'em up (c'mon)
Tengo mi fierro, no te olvides
Soy pistolero, te quemo
And we smoke all y'all asses up
Put 'em up, light 'em up, smoke 'em up, get 'em up now

I say get down with us
Go smoke a pound with us
Shoot another round with us
Welcome to bounce with us

Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up now (get 'em up)

The winner by knockout, the 17 time world champion
The better man of the stage
The one and only, the kush-staff., the hash-staff
Cypress Hill
Hill, Hill
Hill, HillEmbed
