16 ContributorsIf Itâ€™s Alright Lyrics

It's alright with me if it's all right with you
Big P representing from the Mobb Deep Crew
It's alright with me if it's all right with you
Big Hav representing from the Mobb Deep Crew
It's alright with me if it's all right with you
Big Noyd representing from the Queensbridge Crew

I'm representin', you know I'm representing kid check me
Got to pack the gat when the beef is getting heavy
I'm going all out
You know moves I never fake
But every time I blink at night all I see is snakes
And I'm alone
Trapped in this trife life zone
But Fuck it, y'know I'm turning snakes to stones
You say to ya man that I'm pussy but you wonder
You stupid, I'm putting niggas 6ft under
So check my style go deep into foul
I was catching rec with the tecs since Juvenile
Listen, cut your conversation 'til I'm finished
I'm about to give the definitions to the rhymes I'm kicking
Real reality, life is just a tradegy kid
Don't get mad at me
'Cus that's the way ya had to be
Struggling Striving
Asking why my peoples dying
Its too late to ask shawty, who got hit with the iron gat
All up in his back
Like my man P said it's that unknown fact
But it's like that
The drama get iller down in the projects
Catch a rec with the what what (nickel-plated tec)
Guns are blasting, bodies dropping to the floor faster
Than years are passing and I'm gasping for air I swear
'94 kick it raw. The B-I-G N-O-Y-D kick it hardcore
Escalate, elevate my rhymes to another level
Huh, Im I share my feelings with the devil
(Im fiending!) No you got me dreaming
Like Christopher Williams a bip in a BM
You might also like
 It's alright with me if it's all right with you
Big Noyd representing from the Queensbridge Crew
 It's alright with me if it's all right with you
Big P representing from the Mobb Deep Crew
 It's alright with me if it's all right with you
Big Hav representing from the Queensbridge Crew

Ayo it's the hard times that got me generating hard rhymes
I'm confined to the projects running from one time
Confide in my peoples they confide in me
'Cus if It's alright with them if it's all right with me
So we be, upstairs at the tables planning
Thinking of ways we can make this happen
On this planet, I'm struggling
Wanna be hustling
So I'm ready to face any kind of repercussion
If its Jail or death, crippled up or broke
The only thing I'm thinking is slinging that Coke
To get on son, hitting niggas off for packs
Only niggas from my block 'cus we get down like that
As I combat the snakes and rats, watch my back
Don't wanna be the one caught swallowing cracks
Looking reazy, before it goes down I be ready on point
Jump on my bike and get deady
It's a family thing. I got love for my crew
Pour some beer for the niggas that ain't here (True)
Yeah my man Richie Lou, rest in Peace
To my man Poochy you know we still love you
My man Loui
Lloyd, WeeWop, and all of that
My man Tyeed
Word Up just keeping it real, Ill Will and you won't stop
 It's alright with me if it's all right with you
Big Hav representing from the Mobb deep Crew
 It's alright with me if it's all right with you
Big Noyd representing from the Queensbridge Crew
 It's alright with me if it's all right with you
Big P representing from the Queensbridge Crew

Don't ask why It's just like that. I was brought up to live the wrong way
At night to God I pray
Will he let me breathe another 24 hours of air?
I really don't deserve it
But really I don't care
From what I see, whatever is, it's meant to be
So untill I drop, its the crime life for me
Some say I need help, because the way i'm living's sick
I reply, "Mind your own 'fore you be another vic"
Many years of corruption, what will I end up with?
Nothing but a pocket full of memories of foul shit committed as a youngster
Grand larcenist/petty thief
Yo imma make this brief
In my early years, I was living fouler than most
Smile all up in your face take your money and get ghost
Shit ain't right
And I might regret it later that night
While I be laying in bed holding my thoughts tight
Waking up early in the me-our
Do my thing correct so it don't lead to the pe-nal
'Cus fuck that shit, I'll rather roam the streets freely
Plan a box to get
Send you home hurt, crying, broke feeling upset
Don't take it personal, I'm only tryna live
Tonight we taking donations so what you got to give?
The dirt underneath my fingernails got a story to tell of they own
All things is shown, ain't nothing to hide. I speak the raw truth
Uncut
Rewind my whole verse if there is anything you overlooked
'Cus I don't got time for your bullshit talk
'cus niggas getting murdered in the streets of New York
So at the same time, I'm outside taking mine
I'm taking yours
'til I hit the figures in the fours..
Yeah Uh huh
I wanna give a shout out to my man up north
My man Stobo (Yeah) hold your head baby
Be home in a little while
No Doubt, I wanna give a shoutout to all the brothers that's doing it real
Ya know what I'm saying
Word up
Peace out to my man T there up north
Representing to the fullest
Mobb Deep in the house (yeah)
All the family that passed away
'95 We won't forget you
'95 and you don't stop
...we won't forget you....representing..
..representing..
..representing....we won't forget you...3Embed
