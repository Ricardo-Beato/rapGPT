4 ContributorsThere Is a Way LyricsThis is a song, got two lyrics
Very simple and plain we can all sing together
Nobody should feel left out
Join in, this is the song people need to be singing right about now
When they tell you you can't, you shouldn't, you won't
Tell 'em this:
There is a way
No matter what they say (X4)
Don't give up, don't give in (X8)
(Repeated until end)You might also likeEmbed
