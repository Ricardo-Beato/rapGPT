You see the rarri, you wonder how fast it go
These real diamonds if you wonderin’ why it glow

Aye, we be ballin’ all summer
And we be hustlin' all winter
And you have no idea
What it takes to be a winner
I know you wonder

The way I feel is make these niggas choke
Until this shit is painful and it’s impossible to cope
The only magnifying glass I look through is a scope
Snap back leanin' - lyin' face, dangle from my rope
Get to know the meaning
Me and Future, chopper in my coat, while we both be leanin’
Fuckin’ bitches, sloppy on a boat, While my homies sleepin’
Picking up all of this money like it’s only dough I’m sweepin’
Grippin’ up all of this money like you know we only eatin'
Grabbin' up every bag, fuck the talk, we beastin'
Your memory is really gramp, why waste time competin’?
And I know you thinkin' it’s funny - close your mouth
I'm only here to get this money, the fuck you talkin’ ‘bout?
And never doubt we gettin' this dough ‘til it hurts your head
‘Til my accountants fall asleep while they count the bread

Break it down, stretch it out, punch it up, work it out
I remember pullin’ up, now all I do is pick it up
First we train the money, it come every day
Thank goodness for my hustle, thank God I got my muscle

Go
Buck, buck, buck

I think I was born inside a cabana
With diamonds and gold on top of the Phantom
Jesus told Mary, "Go get me a hammer
I'll kill any nigga that try to get near him"
All of the angels were drinkin' tequila
And Michael was sleepin' with Dirty Diana
And now I can't look at the man in the mirror
My life is a movie and here is the trailer
I ain't no killer, but don't try to play me
I'm out of my pills and now I'm just crazy
I jumped out of Heaven 'cause Lucifer paid me
I needed the money to buy a Mercedes
I fucked a few bitches, I had me a baby
I hope that my son don't grow up to hate me
I'm out of my mind and no one can save me
I wish I—(Urgh)

Back when a nigga was jobless, tryna get by
Plottin' on shootin' myself (Brruck, buck, buck)
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry
Think I was losin' myself (Brruck, buck, buck, buck)
I prayed to God, and promised if he made me rich
Then I'ma stay true to myself (Buck, buck, buck)
But fuck it, I lied, and now I just stare in the mirror
Like what did I do to myself? (Brruck, buck, buck, buck)
I think the old me died
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
All the damn promises, I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied

I told my girl I'll give her the world
Whatever she want, consider it done
Soon as I'm rich, I'll buy you a crib
And get you a whip, whatever you want
Promise my niggas, "I'll give you a million
A couple of cars just so you can stunt"
Then I got famous, blew up my head
And fuck what I said, my nigga, I'm gone
Hop out the foreign and jump in the stretch
Life is a bitch, I fucked her to death
And how do I feel? I'm somewhat depressed
I'll probably get killed, but fuck it, I'm blessed
Nigga, I'm rich, I'm done with the stress
Now I got drip, and blood niggas sweat
They love when I trip, they want me in debt
Go choke on a dick and cut me a check
All of these meds done got me a fever
I wanted a chain but got me a Visa
I came in the game, just proppin' my feet up
You niggas is strange, you follow the leader
And me and my pistol like Martin and Gina
We plot on you niggas, I'm probably a schemer
I'm easy to hate, I'm harder to love
You say you don't trust me, I wouldn't either, woah
(I wouldn't either, woah)
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated (Buck, buck, buck)
I locked myself in the room to hide all my demons (Buck, buck, buck)
I told my uncle to give me a loan 'cause I really needed it
"Soon as I'm on, I promise I'll pay you in full"
But (Buck, buck) I didn't mean it

I just put some gold Dayton's on my fuckin' Benzo
Hit the switches, told your bitch, "Come fuck me 'cause I said so"
They say, "Joyner, you done changed, you done lost your mental
You blew up and all that humble shit went out the window"
I ain't the same, I used to be different
They say that I changed, well, maybe you right
Maybe them pills the doctor prescribed me
Got me wantin' to kill, and maybe I might
Maybe my family upset 'cause I made it
'Cause no one expected that I would be famous
And just 'cause we blood don't mean we're related
I'm threatin' the plug, I'm not with the fake shit, I'm not with the— (I'm not with the—)
Grandma told me, "Tone it down," I said, "Bitch, I'm older now"
I ate at my auntie house, she think that I owe her now
Cashed my check, got paid again, make you's think I'm Oprah now
Took my girl to H&M, she told me, "It's over now" (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck)
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated (Buck, buck, buck)

After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
Shit'll never be the same no more
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more

I was standing in the rain in the middle of the trenches
Running from polices, jumping over fences
Serving in the them hotboxes living life relentless
Taking penitentiary chances still dodging the penitentiary
The teachers taught my cousins go to school and you done listen
Make your outlook on life different, damn you look suspicious
My granddad died a boss, and that's been on my memory
If you listen closer to me, feel the pain in my delivery
The struggle and the pain, I still remain the same
I'm grinding so hard I'm just strengthening up my brain
Flyer then the plain, moving faster then the train
Get the fuck up out my lane, some things gotta change

I swear I grind and I grind going hard every time
Going hard on my grind
Selling damaged bricks, shit be at a bunch of licks
I write a hundred songs every time I think of this
Take a 2 liter fill it up with codeine
Let's take a toast to all my niggas who ain't here with me

I don't plan on coming home I might leave you this year
And shawty I know you ride for a nigga
But you get tired of a nigga, tired of crying over your nigga
So many lies, so many broken promises
I hate it come to this, I took you through a bunch of shit
Feel good to your side, I tried to buy you a bunch of shit
But you don't take it no more, you sick and tired of it
After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
Shit'll never be the same no more
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more2Embed

I didn't call to start a new relations, no
It's been a long time coming, babe

You ran across my mind, and I ain't trippin'
 canary yellow birds are drippin' off me
I was young when I fucked with you
You wouldn't understand the person that I grown into
I put in overtime inside this vocal booth
It's amazing how crazy in love you wit' the kid
I used to hold you by your waist and you'd look up to the kid
You was out cryin', why you ridin' on the kid
We should've won an award off the movies that we did
We both moved on, I bet you still reminiscing
I hurt you so bad, I just need for you to listen
We was friends before all of this
I wanna see you happy girl no matter who you're with
On some real shit...


Over the weekend went to Vegas, crossed my memory
I was taking out the limo thinking
How much you was there for me, I got you forever, wherever
That's just the man in me, I look at you like family
Wanna see how you been doin'
I turned you to a fucking beast
Remember how we ran the streets and fucked until we'd go to sleep
I know you ain't forgot that, I doubt that
Even though that nigga housed that, you still left yo heart back
I'mma wait for you to call back, I'mma fall back
I'm over that, yeah
Ay, let me reflect for a second

All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits

If you knew what it took

If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
I lost a baby mama and a good girl behind that

I'm standing in the middle of the rain
Trying to wash off this pain
And when them drops stopped
That's when I come to my senses and I finally realized
I'm scarred for life, and fuck the hype I go hard for life
Ain't it precious, I'm thankful
For every second I'm in the leather room
My phone up, actin like a piston
You so caught in the present
You don’t wanna stay down for your prison
You bout that drama, drama, I want that llama, llama
Behind these raps behind that trap I ask my baby mama
Go see my vision, my dreams maybe too big for you
You better thank god everyday I had a kid by you

All them nights in platinum
Throwin up the cash

I lost a baby mama and a good girl behind that
I'm standing in the middle of the rain
Trying to hide the tears running down my face
And when them drops stopped
I come to my senses and I go hard for my block
Kirkwood for life, Lil Mexico I got so many stripes
I coulda went to war twice andcame back nice
With a few scratches all I need is some green plastic
And I go morherfuckin get that cash
I'm a survivor, with plenty fashion
And a whole lotta soul with my voice raspy
I'm gonna try to spit my lung up
When the sun down till it come up, find a way to come up

All them nights in platinum
Throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I hit it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits

What up Grandma like
Told you I had to do it
I'm just scared for you baby

I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you
Just so I can give you this good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on all my pocket loss
And when you in the streets thats how we roll
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise

I got some money but it’s all dirty
I got a partner doing a James Worthy
And I done took my heart through so many surgeries
Last night I woke up ‘round 4:30
It's hard to go to sleep sleeping with the birdies
These niggas play for keep the streets they real dirty
You have to practice what you preach gone take courage
Your pain running hella deep don't get discouraged
You in the belly of the beast don't get worried You know these niggas play for keeps you still working
You gotta pack miami heat they always lurking
You can't think about the gifts its so many curses

When you in the game playing foul
I hit a lick for hundred eighty-thou
Blow it in 3 months I'm going out of town
Get two bad bitches and hit Grey Hound
I had to cut the couch down
They tried to burn the cross down
They even tried to bring God down
We shooting for the stars now
We live above the ground, fly from town to town
Riding round the city they treat you like Diddy
With all the crimes you done committed this must be winning
This only the beginning and we ain't even finished
I came from the highway riding with a life sentence, this ain't the ending

I go through hell so I can walk with you
I'm taking chances when i talk to you

Man fuck yo attitude, you 'bout to make me fuck your friend
I should've been ashamed, bitches fucking bitches too

They gonna knock a nigga off for you

I'mma get the office in the building to make my quota
I can't never have no feelings for bitches, they so rogue-ish
Trying to come to the club with a nigga to get exposure
I'mma buy shawty a bag, I feel sad for her
She can't come around a rich nigga rocking a Coach
I done beat a couple cases and did'n show up at court
Everything Versace, Medusa including my locs

And I always got the pretty girls

Turnt myself to a astronaut, if you believe you can achieve
I want ya spot homie numero uno
And I brought a check with me bigger than a sumo
Blood Sweat Tears inside this rap as I flow
I know some niggas dead and gone want the best for me
And I know some niggas living praying for the worst for me
I seen darker days I know this ain’t the end for me
That’s why every chance I get cuz I’mma give em hell
Me and my niggas we the last real niggas left
Me and my niggas we the realest niggas left

It’s like my body made of diamonds, I can’t stop shinin’
I ain’t never been this high (I ain’t never been this high)

I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud

I got it out the money, that nasty ass money
Brown paper bag ole dope boy money
Foreign with the frog eyes, Bentley with the big head
Fast lane with no hands, counting money with both hands
On the road with checks like a motherfuckin’ mailman
Started from hundred, no-one gave me shit
I jugged off bricks, Got rich off bricks
Forgiatos on that jag I cashed out off a lick
So many bands in my pocket make me walk with a limp
Full of dirty ? Valet at Fifths
Finesse I got Freebandz to get
Black amigo, who live life like this

Forgiatos standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS rapped around the Breathing with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Yo Campaign hot it rolling, you ain’t made a real jugg
Ain’t no way that money folded
Got myself hot these hoes in VIP patrollin’
Boogers in my ears around my watch and they loaded
Solitary clips, I’m in the studio devoted
If you knew what it took to get here you could understand my flowin’
Doja, I Hit the dope my words come out folded
Turn the lights our, I’m going inside the mic raw
More Diesel than a 18-Wheeler, I’m with them killers
Forgiato’s on the coupe creeping like a caterpillar
Got the money in the Louis bag, right by to the pistol
Long as the money come, you know I’m gone deliver

Forgiato’s standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS rapped around the Breathing with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening

You know how we be rocking, ya heard

Bright light shining all bright on the Bentley
Work the Cadillac, panoramic, no panties
Old school Chevy '55 granddaddy
Gotta throw some salt on it, 'cause you know I'm getting at it
Throw the fork on it, then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it, got it flying out of Dallas
Hope you didn't do it to yourself, that's tragic
Hope you didn't throw away what we established
Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look 'round here, they'll back stab you
Word from your motherfucking brother, young nigga
I just wanna see you happy, I just wanna see you happy
Coming through the cut like a known Grim Reaper
'Bout to get it straight finessed, tryna get a little cheaper
Hold on to that clip like a doped up needle
Girl hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle

Known to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
'Fore you gon' knock someone down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
Man down over yonder
Young came through holding on the cane like a drummer
They done took a boss out nigga, no wonder
Niggas getting crossed out nigga, no wonder

Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time

My granddaddy was a boss, he was a kingpin, you heard?

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe

Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
'Sco came to me, said, "They think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one"
We going back in soon as we get off tour

How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag, we gettin' back to the paper

I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick layin' on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doin' some real life porno
And I ain't worried 'bout nothin' in the world, keep a badass bitch

They ain't know me in the cut, they just know me from rhymin'

Sippin' on Easter Pink like it's Tanqueray

These streets is harder than your diamonds
You representing gangsta, but that ain't got a damn thing to do with rhyming
Ain't nothing wrong with shining
But get right, 'cause you'll never see your light if your iggnerance is blinding
You significantly grinding
You love the hustle, but be warned, the hustle  muscle  infinantly binding
Have you tell it to the concreet
But is the pimpin and the robbin and the killin and the trappin just for drum beats?
You know your trials and your hardships
Well for a better reason then the treson, you can  talking hard shit
Ain't no hating, I got love for you
For twenty years, I been going way beyond and above for you
The streets is where I got respect at
Where I got my stripes, and Wikipedia can't check that
So come down off your high horse
And give back to the hood, our communities is 
Jail ain't  one man
We in a world where you can die for being born with a suntan
The game's a lesson, if you studdy long
You can live the kind of life to make a nigga wanna write a song
But too long and you study wrong
I'm just speaking what I know, never preaching, I ain't 
The future us need leadership
I just keep it one thousand

The bigger the pot get, the drama it come with the money
The trips, the fame, the luxury whips
You talking that rich talk, I cooked up with a pitchfork
Lord forgive me for my sins these niggas need chalk
Your career already dead before you get on
Study my mixtapes, write about my fancy wardrobe
I embrace niggas, I made you a killa
Dope boy superior, Bloody green interior
As the plot thickens you niggas get more serious
Where your comfort come from
Your mom your dad your homies
They lied to ya you barely survivin'
Championship too you ain't coming back alive
The day I stop using Autotune thats when its gone die
Until then I create melodies thats influenced by promethazine
I was chasing bricks before I chased the dream
Plotting on a scheme
I smell the fake I smell the phony I smell the thieves
You can’t get rid of me
I'm a problem to be reckoned with, I'm wrecking shit

Let me inhale the chronic smoke
I can't lie I'm addicted to the dope
My brain on drugs
I fucked around and took a prescription pill
Ask my ex how it feel when my my brain on drugs
Sip, sip, sip, sip, cup after cup, I can't get enough
My brain on drugs, and it's sad to say
All the kids out there it's very bad to say, my brain on drugs

I'm crumbling herb , I stuff me a swisher
I light up the tree, every day round here it be Christmas
I'm clouding my thoughts, my words comin' out doper
And I'm always high, that's what I got locs for
I'm on a real strong pack, that California OG
I'm smoking blunt after blunt , like snoop D-O double G
It's hard to keep it low key , when you smell like a whole P
I wake up every single morning, twisting up me some green

Broken lies, ain't no love without us
It will die, roses turn into dust

Can't be the one and then you get exposed

How can I not ball until everything fade away
How can I not, how can I not

How can I not make a movie
How can I not do this shit that these niggas don't love
How can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup
How can I not take my style back from niggas
When niggas was taking my style way before
How can I not? How can I not? How can I not?
How can I not get this guala and flip all this guala
Because a young nigga was starving
How can I not make this music for dealers and killers and niggas who out there be robbing

Run in your spot, smashing your ho, fuck on your couch
Quit running your mouth, pimping my pen beginning to end
Telling the plot, look at my watch, fuck all your thoughts
I appreciate you niggas I appreciate you bitches for keeping me relevant talk all you want
Brag all I want, how can I not make you niggas regret
How can I not go and get me a check
How can you not get hooked on percocet
How can you not be the one who was star
How can you not be the one who was king
How can you not come around and I stare at these niggas and niggas be rocking this bling
Cum bitch then cum again, how can I not want to fuck your friend?
Proper game make em all wonder how it feel being with a pimp
Everyday something different money cars clothes different
Me and money got a chemistry, me and you a big difference

When I think about it
It's cool
It's one thousand

Got on a million dollars in jewelry when I think about it
Got more guns than a terrorist when I think about it
All these cars, my kids inheritin' when I think about it
All this money I can't cherish when I think about it
These niggas rather see me suffer, now I think about it
I know they playin' undercover when I think about it
Ordered more whips, more jewelry
We take more trips, fuck the whole jury (fuck 'em all)

They got me in the courts like I'm losin'
I gotta be the one most improvin'
I know they gon' try to misuse me
Patiently wait while they come up with solutions
Twenty chains on my neck, man, they can't figure me out
Put a Rollie 'round my neck, they try and figure me out
They 'bout to gas up the jet, they try and figure me out
I had to get some more Fugazi, they tryna figure me out
Wetter than a pussy, got your nose runnin'
Kamikaze comin' out on all or nothing
We just gettin' the money, fuck the whole public

I askin' a Latina, 'cause I'm in the very latest
They tryna keep up with me, that's just like investigation
They use a track up on me, thought I wasn't in Mercedes
I'm droppin' out of school but that didn't stop my education

Called a few chicks on my line, they slobbin
Girl on a girl, if they eat that's the topic
Thought she was true, she was fuckin' the opps
Can't tell her none, might be workin' with cops
Told me she loyal, I found out she not
Can't trust a unfaithful girl at the spot

Head over water, I ain't never gon' flop
Everything I do is super galore
Fuck on rich niggas, she don't care if you broke

Throw 'em in a lake, you gotta teach 'em somethin'
Seen a wing on the pedal, and I stomp to the floor
Cost a couple of Ms tryna save a whore
Lucky as a blessing and there wasn't a loss
Wrapping a bale feel like my hand was forced
Put one of the girls in an executive Porsche
Crib with a maid, and it came with a horse
Cover the green like a golfer on course
Purchase that lean with no problems, of course
Brought the machine with the money ain't short

When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so cold

Walk like a ball player, talk like a migo
Watch worth a bale and my neck on a kilo
Guacamole stuffed in the TRUs you can see notes
Long wave racks on that alley where I trick her
Strong in my system I can barely even see ya
Young fly mamasita slice it like pizza
Heard she was a diva and i did her with my people
Didn't your wifey tell you how we fucked and had a threesome?
Didn't your wifey tell you how the ice shine brightly?
Didn't she tell you 'bout the Audemar or the Breitling?
She told me how the diamonds had her dripping wet excited
Smashed her in the studio and kicked her out politely

​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind

​We don’t talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied, I ain't never satisfied

I'm putting pressure on these niggas and I know
But I still be on the road like I'm scared of going broke
Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied

And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied

Speaking for a million, this is bishop
Official Certified Legendary signee, no mercy
No mercy is death before dishonor
No mercy is taken from the oppressed
Unmercifully keeping them hungry
No mercy is the judge chambers
Trying our children as adults
No mercy is facing two life sentences, plus forty
Which is psychological breakdown to the base
And causes a slow death or suffocation, and to steal your faith
No mercy is the systematical system programmed agenda at all costs
By any means necessary to kill, steal, and destroy you
No mercy is the system allowing our babies to die
Or so-called "justified slaughters" by the agents of oppressors
No mercy was, and still is Nat Turner, Jared Jackson, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby SealeYou might also likeEmbed

Poppin' tags and I'm heartless
I'm a hustler and a artist
I roll me up a forest
I can freestyle a portrait
A couple hunnid thou' cash, comin' for the fortunes
I'm livin' in the skybox, Louis V, Porches
Purple drink endorsin', horseshoe, no horses
Six gear Porches, y'all niggas extorting
Lesson for a check, Corvette on my neck
Catch me runnin' to the guala, bet I won't break a sweat
Bad bitches, good sex, good bottom, good neck
Give her two thumbs up, real niggas rock baguettes

On the flight, thinkin' 'bout them long nights servin' K
Cross my heart, hope to die, in the sky, livin' legend
Granted me the gift to God, I'ma do it with a passion
Over two hunnid on the dash, bitch, catch me when I'm passin'

Ex con, 100 rountad drum...Batman the paint James Bond
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go

Stay with the fork and the powder to cook
'Cause we whip and we add on additionals
Niggas be claimin' they working, they working, but nigga we just don't agree with you
Don't none of these bad bitches sleep with you
Ain't no real nigga gon' eat with you
Everybody want a dollar, everybody want a check
Nigga there's only one future messiah, now higher than what you respect
How the fuck you get my number? Hungry ass baby, karma
You ain't never knew my struggle, they will never ever understand my hunger

I'm stainless
Tempered by earth and flame
Mixed with time and pain
Ingrained with higher purpose know the worth of my name
And the product I done came with
Not blameless for the straps and the dope that I hold
The sacks that I sold
Kept my baby out the cold and her belly full of food
And her back never lacking of clothes
This game is so grimy it's impossible to win with your innocence intact
Matter of fact it deranges
The person that you wanted to remain intrinsically changes
We can actualize but our actual lives are affected by a hunger for sane-ness
In the back of our minds are the nastiest lines that a dope emcee never came with
Once we get tired of fakin', unchain the beast in the brain that awakens
See the clear path that I used to couldn't see
Be the kind of artist that I thought I couldn't be
Become that man that'd rather die standing than ever live head down bending a knee
So I purify my soul in the land of the fire
My sweat and my tears dull pain
And the blood that I leave on the battlefield proves what I've always known

I swear they on to us

Spent 5 bands on a fit and wore it for three days

Hit the studio all day to stop myself from catching plays
I know the alphabet they looking for the rappers with them K's
My life is more than a stage paranoid why you watchin
Is you watching me preform or is you watching cause you copying
Try to convict me on the ice: I'm rocking
Could it be my ears
Man tell me what it is all these damn designer gear
I'm bout to stop rocking jewelry I can't tell who people is
Just by looking in the crowd you looking blurry over here
Something bout to happen in a minute I can't tell it
Something fishy going on X-Rayed and I smell it!
I just bought a new watch
I think they on to us
I got four or five spots

All we drive is foreign cars

Every time I'm in the club I'm with a foreign brand

Thirty-five racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting, you must don't respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened, they was hating on us
You know when we was jugging for it they was mad at us
Ayy, this a letter for my dawgs, how we let the money get between us?
How we let these bitches get between us?
How we let these niggas get between us?
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain't like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
My lil' dawg caught a murder, gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me
R.I.P. my granddad Quick, he should have seen this shit
Twenty thousand on some child support, I seen this shit
Riding around with all them choppers, I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me, but these niggas ain't doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit

The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships

That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Fuck that white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Playin' poker, now we're back in Stroker
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control it
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles, these niggas too bogus
Let's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint like I'm Kid Cudi, probably
I fuck around, faint, I'ma fall on the drank
Rockin' Tom Ford, poppin' mollies
Married to this motherfuckin' money
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might get after Madonna
I get it crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partner
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Don't you panic, panoramic companion
They was tryna serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that come with these millions
I'm taking everything that come with my children
Yeah, yeah

Pour that bubbly
Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it
I was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit
That's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches
That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly

You live and You learn and it ain't always yo fault
And we ain't always gone see eye to eye: compromise
And I just want you hold me down 3-6-5
With no complaining
Relationship get draining
I pray for my sanity
I'm tryna better my family

Sometimes I wanna get inside the Escalade and crash it
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean

Leather jackets, no motorcycle
I'm spiked up like a bad drink
9 to 3, that good supreme
With all the stress to blow a gas tank
I work hard and it came out
I turnt up and turnt ya bitch out
Then I went from dead broke to layin' up in a penthouse
There are no secrets when you leakin'
I woke up this evenin'
And I seen a demon
I'm on that pure codeine and
Tryna clear my thoughts
Niggas mourn for my pain
All they see is fame and what it bring
I paid dues, graduated from finesse school
I showed and proved, I never lose
I'm too smart, I should've went to Harvard
Drinking out the bottle, holdin' my revolver

No longer can I remain earthbound
The future is now
Time and space are one in the same
Enough time in space and we running the game
Almost is unacceptable
The cosmos is a receptacle
For the spectacle of my ascension
Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective
All my actions selective
At all costs, I must obtain the objective
Regain the inception intended at the conception
A living lethal weapon
I'm the natural selection
Moving in my own eccentric orbit
A rebel amongst conformists
So far gone, you might catch me on Pluto
4 billion miles away
Do a whole week in one day
Live for keeping it real, you already know what it is
I rarely ever speak without something to say
But if you can't remember the who, what, when, or the how
Remember one thing I said: the future is nowYou might also like2Embed

Every day for me a fashion show

I’m a rockstar forever, I need to get my act together
We’re changin’ up the weather, it’s so hard to be subtle
Since we first got together things changed for the better

And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, you are who you are
And when you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold as your heart, you as cold as your heart

I keep that same mentality when I was facing casualties
Goin’ through my tragedies, I practice like a athlete
Wouldn’t believe the half of me
Show and prove, don’t make believe
I’ll make you believe, all my thoughts free
Purer than the rawest coke
This ain’t no shit that I wrote
I’ve been down this road before
And I’ve been on the rollercoast’
So many ups and downs and turns
Homies droppin’ like flies
Full strapped forty times
Doin' a life sentence and he died
While I’m on the road, doin’ shows, takin’ this ride
I just got word my uncle tried commit suicide
This the second time I’m goin’ back in, the second time
You’ll get a second chance at life, nigga I ain’t lyin’

I know the kingpin’s on, the name is Legendary
They smoke crack right now, this ain’t a Tyler Perry
This real rap, real life, it’s very necessary
For me to go on in, so I went back in
Wish I could stay in this booth and never come out again
My lil’ cousin caught a body and he’s still fightin’
And I got killaz walkin’ the yard, Future all they recitin’
And I can’t forget you niggas did too much biting
But I ain’t gon' hold no grudge, I just know your type

I take a trip, unwrap a gift, run ithere like Emmit Smith
Go to New York with this gift and I come back with a lick
Break bread with my team
Partner money here, here
I ain't come for this, I want my music global
I wanna see people pump their fist
I’m gonna change a nigga life
So he ain’t gotta go through this
Don’t get caught in my fit
Till I’m runnin’ 1 0 6
They tracked me ‘cross the globe
You can have the fame
Just give me my soul
I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat
Before I lose my respect
I stick to the code
I hold a tol on my shoulder
But I will never fold
No snitches allowed, case closed

And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are

I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby
When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter in the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose

Sip on the lean like a fifth of the dark
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Telly then rally and gather the squad

Just ridin' around with this .40
She gon' thug for me, she gon' thug for me

You move your momma to a crib from the 'jects
It's so much alcohol and kush on my breath
We prayin' five times a day to catch a plug
A few bean pies stashed in the trunk
Shoot dice all day and sell dust

Told yourself a million times, you don't give a fuck
Sold over a million dimes, hangin' in the cut

Sitting behind five percent, you can see the chinain
Lil' one going crazy, ready to sprrt for the ginang
If it wasn’t for Google, man that bitch wouldn't know my nickname
Dropped a Maybach truck on a watch and it was plain jane
Let the door swang, swang the door open, smell cocaine
Trafficking drug money and trap out this one lane
Stepped all in mud, this bitch can't wait to tie my shoelace
Oh, she don’t like girls, bet this money make a bitch so gay

Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff
Digging in hеr back, pull out my money, make a bitch bust a nut
Came out thе bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick
I bought the Tahoe from the trap money, haven't even seen a brick
Cocaine by the kilo, these days put it right on my wrist
You can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent

Every time I re-up, they gotta advance at least twenty M
I been getting richer and richer my whole career
Took the dope money, went and record a mixtape, it's rappers way out
Sitting on a bail toting a big K, ain't even got a couch
To Australia, I'm familiar, spent two million on a jet
In that dualie doing the dash, I let lil' dawg he hold a TEC
I got molly with the crystals, but I been back doing X
Got a Rolex on my wrist, this bitch cost 'bout a Corvette
Give these niggas a couple bands and hit your face and hit your chest
I was rolling off the pill, I should’ve never fucked the bitch
I got hoes these niggas married, I don’t let 'em go, they come through
I got fentanyl in my diamonds, I spend a nine on a pair of shoes
I don’t even care who these niggas shot at, ain't nan of 'em got murked
I got some real killers, they'll kill a nigga, then go and shoot up the hearse
You think a nigga like me give a fuck ’bout a nigga shooting up the church?
I gotta take this shit up with God 'cause I'm a god on the earth
I got this motherfuckin' new Benz, I ain't even drove it since it came out
Couple of bad bitches, they twins, walkin' naked through my house
Cook good dope up in the kitchen, I could do that top chef
Bitches still claiming me, I ain't fucked in over a year

Valentine's is the worst day

Valentine's Day, the worst day, got too many to please
I popped half a pain pill, and put my mind at ease
I bought you all these gifts, tearin' your heart all in pieces
Try to pass out new whips, yeah, but all you want is me
Got a Glock under her pillow, she blowin' for my gang
Not tryna lie to you, I don't wanna explain
Took off on a store run and jumped on a plane
Every single birthday, another private location

Valentine's Day, the worst day, got too many to please
Spent over a hunnid Gs and she still wasn't pleased
I done gave her a hundred Gs, all she want is me
It's a treat when we meet up, whenever we meet
She just want me to be there on February 14
I come through when I get a chance, but gotta be brief
Tote a LV briefcase, I'm just keeping it a G
Made it out the trenches, got more stripes than a zebra
When you got more than one, two, three, four, five, six bitches, Valentine's Day the worst day, when a nigga rich
Got more than one, got Catholics, got Christians
Got a Muslim, got Egyptians, they saying they miss me
Won't settle for no quickie, got 'em waiting up in they vickies

Tried to talk to you, but I know you won't get it

I danced with the devil so long, she pulling me closer
Been sleeping with demons and how they get there? She invited them over
And he came in girl form, so pretty, I fell for it, it felt like I known her
I pray to the angels but the devil is stronger
Wonderin' why I'm in hell, still?
Nobody's nice, nobody cares here
I tried to break free, she wouldn't let me
She said, don't waste my time, thinking I'm going to heaven
'Cause all my blessings she telling me, she the one who sent them
808 Mafia
Ayy, Southside, where you get all that drip?

Way out of they range, got to feel my rage, drug traffickin' made me
Ambition saved me, hold up on the pavement
Ain't going out sad like Jose Canseco, I up my status
Had to 'crease me hunger, get me pesos, I was right with the Yayo
Droppin' off a hundred elbows with a fine bitch in stilettos
Got stars in it, it's a shuttle
Gettin' nauseous, all the decimals
She give me sloppy on another level
Doing crossfit, I'm getting healthy
Bitch moshpittin' at the W
You live marvelous, you get a W
Keep a short stick and a duffle
Tryna flex, I show muscles
Hi-definition, totin' cutters
I was presidential, more bullets
Feel played 'bout it, get to trippin'
I'm with the Cartel every time I re-up
On the plane by the runway, that's how they greet us
Getting it grande from Sunday to Sunday
I knew I'd be the plug one day

Streets turnin' boys into men

Pay you off before I shot and kill
Drive them up the trenches, it ain't fair
I throwed 'em away, didn't give it one wear

I bought her diamonds, she keep it a secret
Knock your shit down, you know I'ma agree with it
Take off flyin', goin' off a G6
I got that cooler with me when I'm whippin'
Rollin' with demons when I'm in your city
Couple of pink toes gettin' nasty
Send all the Fentanyl to Cincinnati
Gone on a mission, niggas ain't really havin' it

Whole lotta racks on me be precise
Lil' one gon' whack somethin' when they bitin'
We been on demon time, say I'm nice
Ain't been gettin' no sleep, I'm outside
Kick down the doors in some Dior Dior
Put double numbers on the billboards
I take the flowers, we gettin' awards
Too many shoot-outs, I was paranoid
Young nigga poppin' off anywhere
Catch up and spray, nigga, anywhere
I gotta make sure I ante up
'Cause I'm in touch with the mob
A goonie ready, yeah, she anywhere, Jada finish up the job
But to the hood I'm a god
I did residentials, I was loitering
Just another product of poverty
Hit them niggas up, no recovery
I had Benjamins, Frank callin' me
Got them demons with me, ain't no argument
Swappin' out my pain with Givenchy
Forever wish death on all my enemies

I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the way
30K in the club, shit, you wanna play?
I got them old hundreds, them new ones on the wayEmbed
Said I'll swap it out
I'm swapping everything out here brand new

I swapped out my True Religion, put on my Robin jeans
I swapped out that clean Sprite, mixed it with codeine
I swapped out that old school, pulled up in that new thing
I swapped out a Puerto Rican, and now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame, now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet hoe, cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe, make my pockets fatter
Swapped out them VV1s, now I got better carats

I went psycho with that Sprite
I went a drug addict with that sprite
I got hoes that like to dike
But to tell you the truth they fly like kites
I got bad bitches who write
Went to space and took a flight
Yeah I'm fly but ain't no kite
Cause they're too short for my life
I'm on Pluto, you on Earth
I had Burberry at first, now it's Pluto on my shirt
I don't go crazy, I'll go berserk
Had the Maro hardtop
Pulled the Rari with the vert
I'm the king in my hood
Aye the globe is my turf
See me rocking diamonds and you know them diamonds very bright
Had to swap out the mid, then we start sellin' white
I was True religion saggin', now them Robin's on me nice
Paid the cash in, cash now, all I do is swipe

I swapped my Louis scarf for Alexander McQueen
I just brought a Sprite and it's no longer clean
Was a True Religion kid then I Designer'd my jeans
Hey I run ATL, man I feel like the king
I'm red bottom walking when I walk on the fly
Rosalina pop a pill, now I'm no longer tired
Marijuana in my system, you can see it in my eyes
I've got a pocket full of hundred men I feel like Plies
I was old school shopping, now the Rari what matters
I once trip off light, now I'm in Pluto forever
Yellow Stone, White Stone, stepping up on my bezels
I VVS the face, took out canary yellow
