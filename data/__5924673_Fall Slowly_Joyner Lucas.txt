Fall slowly
Fall slowly

I love you more than I love myself
If I weren't with you, I can't picture me with someone else
And every time we separate it's like we under spells
'Cause when we hurt each other we come back to help each other heal
You say I'm crazy, but at least you know my love is real
But shit, you crazy too, and that's why they say love is hell
And it's forever, so I hope you never up and bail
And if you ever left me for someone, you gon' get someone killed

You know the vibes we on be like some movie shit (Word)
And we don't always get along, but when we do, we lit (Lit)
I never understood love or what it truly is until I met you
Now we just inseparable until we trip (Yeah)

And every time you try to leave, I'm chasin' after you (Chasin' after you)
And every time I go, I keep on comin' back to you (Comin' back)
'Cause you belong to me, and I'm the other half of you
And as much as I need you, deep down I know I'm bad for you
You know I'm bad for you (Bad for you, bad for you)

Fallin' slowly, fallin' slowly
Fallin' slowly, fallin' slowly

You're not perfect, but you make life worth it
Maybe that's why we stick together like cursive (Like cursive)
Hella toxic, but I know that I'm determined
If we can make it through the fire, we can breathe inside a furnace (Facts)
Your family never liked me, they all think that I'm a burden
They know when we're together you're a different type of person (True)
Whenever things get bad, it never seems like it's worth it
It's like we're drownin' really fast until we get back to the surface
And we never learnin' self-love (Yeah)
So we been there for each other when no one else was (No one else was)
And all the times I was broke and you kept me held up
And got me back focused or held me down when I felt stuck (Word)

And every time I try to leave, you're chasin' after me (Chasin' after me)
And every time you leave, you keep on comin' back to me (Comin' back)
'Cause I belong to you, and you're the other half of me
And as much as you need me, deep down you know you're bad for me
You know you're bad for me

Fallin' slowly, fallin' slowly
Fallin' slowly, fallin' slowly
I love you more than I love myself
If you weren't with me, I can't picture you with someone else
And every time we separate it's like we under spells
'Cause when we hurt each other we come back to help each other heal
You say I'm crazy, but at least you know my love is real
But shit, you crazy too, and that's why they say love is hell
And it's forever, so I hope you never up and bail
And if you ever left me for someone, you gon' get someone killed (Killed, killed, killed)

The swing that takes me now
Of crawlin' down me skin
Hold me by your name
Hold me 'til the end7Embed
