And all I rap is that real nigga, real nigga shit
Yeah, only rap it if I did it, shit
Look, on a mission on some killa shit
Huh, obligated by the ignorance
We was, raised in it so we livin' it
Lifestyles of the lost, illegitimate
Kids of fathers who never was a figure in
They life, and not a world, 'bout to deal with it
They might lock him up if he innocent
But they won't explore ways to prevent the shit
You know, you was into small business
But you know through this gangbangin' benefit
Look, they got prisons on the stock market
This is not preachin', this is not smart shit
This is survival, nigga Noah’s Ark shit
Brynhurst Ave and Hyde Park shit, ohYou might also likeEmbed
