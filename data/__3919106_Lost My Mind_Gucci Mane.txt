6 ContributorsLost My Mind Lyrics
Listen to this track, bitch
Ha, ha
Gucci Mane livin' like ha, ha (Morocco Drama)
Everything high, I get, high, high
I live my life so iced out (It's The Movie, nigga)
Ha, ha, 'till I die
Die, die, I'ma live everyday fly (So come get me, Gangsta Grillz)
Fly, all these niggas hatin' but why, why
'Cause I'm that type of guy, guy (It's Gucci, Gangsta Grillz)
So until I die, die

Peepin' out my blinds, I think I'm going crazy, they say I'm rapping crazy
Call me Gucci Mane, I'm going damn insane
Call me Gucci Mane, my flow is insane (We are the streets)
Put that on my name, I'm keeping all the blame
Got forty in my pocket, little bitch, like, can I shine?
I think I lost my mind, I'm keeping y'all upline
Got forty in my pocket, little bitch, like, can I shine? (AMG)

Smoking while I'm leaning with my dawgs up in my keenie
Get a brand new Lamborghini, same colour of her bikini (Gangsta Grillz)
Money over Howie over Hardaway like Pilly Milly
Hardaway's my partner, man, so shoutout to my nigga (Shoutout)
That's where the hustle be, they prayin', where's his bottle, do you see him?
Do you see him? I don't see him, I've been looking for a fiend
Call me Gucci, got a Brightly and a Bentley and a bitty
Cost a pretty pretty penny, Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm skinny
You might also like
Peepin' out my blinds, I think I'm going crazy, they say I'm rapping crazy
Call me Gucci Mane, I'm going damn insane
Call me Gucci Mane, my flow is insane
Put that on my name, I'm keeping all the blame
Got forty in my pocket, little bitch, like, can I shine?
I think I lost my mind, I'm keeping y'all upline
Got forty in my pocket, little bitch, like, can I shine? (Brr, brr)

Got a whole lot of options, whole cup for an auction
Pass by, like I pass for stocks (Go, go)
Gucci got a Porsche-painted porcelain, so have an abortion (Go)
Seventy, watch your bail with a whole lot of turkey
Vroom, can't you catch me? Nah, I think you can't, dawg
Shawty, I bet you're tighter if you're fucking with La Flare, ho
Bet you tight, I bet you tighter, no licence but I'm a rider
No licence but I'm a rider, the bitch is scared, the bitch is tighter
Prada bill, Prada bag, Prada'd up my Prada swag
Gucci Mane, Gucci hat, Gucci'd up my Gucci swag
Louis belt, Louis hat, Loui'd up my Louis swag
Gucci Mane, So Icy, nigga, go and buy the swag (Bah, bah, bah)

Peepin' out my blinds, I think I'm going crazy, they say I'm rapping crazy
Call me Gucci Mane, I'm going damn insane
Call me Gucci Mane, my flow is insane (Gangsta Grillz)
Put that on my name, I'm keeping all the blame
Got forty in my pocket, little bitch, like, can I shine?
I think I lost my mind, I'm keeping y'all upline
Got forty in my pocket, little bitch, like, can I shine, shine?
Inter-central station with a hundred Haitian killers, ho
Million worth of jewellery on, you don't want to do it, ho
And I'm in my own zone, I'm so fucking crazy
Kush got me trippin', man, my eyes are fucking Asian
In the mansion in Miami, talk to being a slave and
Dinners waiting on Mami' and she say she want to play me
If I play, I'm talking to the bitch for more than eighty
More than I ever knew that bitch, she say she want to play me
Zone 6, a billi, yeah, all the Christians go to race
Gucci Mane, So Icy Entertainment, and I know they hate it
Bouldercrast originated, East Atlanta, affiliated
Boil it back, cross the R, Glim would've graced my neighbours
I'm out my mind

Peepin' out my blinds, I think I'm going crazy, they say I'm rapping crazy
Call me Gucci Mane, I'm going damn insane
Call me Gucci Mane, my flow is insane (Gangsta Grillz)
Put that on my name, I'm keeping all the blame
Got forty in my pocket, little bitch, like, can I shine?
I think I lost my mind, I'm keeping y'all upline
Got forty in my pocket, little bitch, like, can I shine, shine? (Gangsta Grillz)

Shoutout to my Pittsburgh nigga
My Cleveland niggas
My Columbus niggasEmbed
