6 Contributors3 Forties and a Bottle of Moet LyricsFunkdafied one time for your mind
This is how we gonna get it off baby
Now dig the flavor, ohhhhhhh yeah
I got the Mister Cee in the place to be
Of course, I be the Big Daddy Kane, here to entertain
I got Ax-el, ready to max well
Yessir, we gon' get busy one time for ya dig it right?
We gonna call this 3 Forties and a Bottle of Moet
Why? Cause I drunk 3 Forties and a Bottle of Moet
Plain and simple, but this is how it's gonna go for ya
Mister Cee, yo
It goes a-one, two, three..
Some people call me Kane some people call me Big Daddy
My momma's name is Ruth and my pops is Clay Bradley
I got a little brother, some of y'all may just know him
I would say his name, but we ain't speakin at the moment
I walk through the streets of New York everyday
I hang with rappers like Doug E. Fresh and Cool J
I hang with Tone Loc and Don Cheadle in L.A., plus
I Got a Man, you know the Positive K
I get blasted with the Ol' Dirty Bastard
So peace to the RZA, the GZA
And to the rest of the Wu-Tang niggas
My man Shyhiem with the gangsta lean, da cream
To rise to the top, and you don't stop
And Mister Cee, is in the place to be
And Mister Cee, is in the place to be
Oh Mister Cee is in the place to be
And missjones in the house most definitely
Ax-el, ready to max well
Ax-el, ready to max well
The B to the I to the like to the G
Rockin on to the break of D
As I keep it strong I won't steer you wrong
I'm tired of this, let's go on to the next songYou might also likeEmbed
