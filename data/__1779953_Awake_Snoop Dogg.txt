15 ContributorsAwake Lyrics
You're awake
When lightening strikes, you know that you're awake
It definitely starts glowing
All the girls that's in this room
Get up close, you'll feel so much better
It feels so good to know that you're awake
When the G come to the light

Put your hands together and close your eyes
Smell the aroma, visualize
Do not try to get higher than me
Why stop it there? Get high as can be

It's time to spark up some (Ideas from oblivion and)
Feel the blaze (I remember, the—)
Who's the number one? (There's nothing new under the sun)
Feel the awake, yeah

You're awake
When lightening strikes, you know that you're awake
It definitely starts glowing
All the girls that's in this room
Get up close, you'll feel so much better
It feels so good to know that you're awake
When the G come to the light

My name is Snoop Dogg, not to complain
I gets my groove on, I do my thing
My planet's Krypton, home of the freaks
Come get your moon rocks, I am a G

It's time to spark up some (Ideas from oblivion and)
Feel the blaze (I remember, the—)
Who's the number one? (There's nothing new under the sun)
Feel the awake, yeah

You're awake
When lightening strikes, you know that you're awake
It definitely starts glowing
All the girls that's in this room
Get up close, you'll feel so much better
It feels so good to know that you're awake
When the G come to the light

It's time to spark up some (Ideas from oblivion and)
Feel the blaze (I remember, the—)
Who's the number one? (There's nothing new under the sun)
Feel the awake, yeah
You're awake
When lightening strikes, you know that you're awake
It definitely starts glowing
All the girls that's in this room
Get up close, you'll feel so much better
It feels so good to know that you're awake
When the G come to the light5Embed
