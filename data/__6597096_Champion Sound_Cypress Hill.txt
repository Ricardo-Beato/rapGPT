6 ContributorsChampion Sound Lyrics
So whatever he decided to do, he was going to do it well
He always wanted to do better than anyone else, always

Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Who's the champion? (Wе are)
We the champion (Thе one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)

Foundation lane, we paved the way
Remain soild while most just fade away
Drop knowledge, no college, just day-to-day
Narration of what we facin' around the way
And this the one ton champion
Big Sen Dog came to get the job done
Forever ready if there's ever a problem
Haters don't want none 'till I move in caution
You might also like
And you could never stop runnin'
When you see me pop
When you could predict the outcome
Hands raised, I'm the champion
It ain't a riddle
We never play in the middle
We spin it, you feel a little
Hesitation, you're so riddled
Ready to break
Listen concentrate
Like a dabber now
Slabbin' out
Take another hit of the wedding cake
Bop it out
Doctor Greenthumb
I prescribe it out
Competition, wipe 'em out
Fast ball, strike 'em out

Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Show me the stage
We came to work
'Bout to hit 'em where it hurts
Champions coming first
'Cause we don't know no second place
I'm the one that set the pace
Roll one and elevate
Celebrate
We've been winning so long
Maintain so strong
While others couldn't hold on
But this that all mighty Cypress Hill shit
Stop a hater real quick
Evacuate the building

Evacuate the children
We bringing down the ceiling
You comprehend the feeling
Champions winning
But it's only the beginning
You're still stoned
I'm running game, the unsung
Get it done, get it won
Top guns, top notch, top heavy
Ready to pop heavy
Ready to rock steady
Was so deadly
Who's the champion sound?
Boy you're looking at 'em
Listen to 'em
Drinking witches brew
And spittin' venom
Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)
Who's the champion? (We are)
We the champion (The one)
I the champion (With the champion sound)Embed
