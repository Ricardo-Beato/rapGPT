4 ContributorsSterling LyricsI was early bornday a Thor's day
Laying on the carpet staring up at the plaster
When the preachers and pastors speak about the rapture
I think about eating the Stratocasters
Drowning in the deep end feet first
Dialing in the reverb trying to catch a Freebird
You trying to normalize the deception
But never forget the Porsche 911
Rip the emblem off the hood and let it dangle from the sterling
925 if you're discerning
You trying to ask me like I know I'm still searching
Just spray somе water at the ocean if it's burning
I usеd to keep my money in my sock
But I'm afraid that I might drop it 'cause I'm running like I'm up against the clock
In a minute we can surf the wavelength
The currency is digital I'm barefoot and pregnantYou might also likeEmbed
