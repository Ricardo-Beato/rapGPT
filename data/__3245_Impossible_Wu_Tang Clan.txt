Yo, check, check it
You can never defeat
Yo, check the method of this shit right here one time
The gods
Sparkin' your brain cells to the upmost
Impossible
Unlimited epidemics bein' spreaded
You can never defeat
You know, we try and add on for y'all niggas
The gods
Yo, yo

Fusion of the five elements to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate, livin' irrelevant
The most benevolent king, communicatin' through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen
Everywhere, throughout your surrounding atmosphere
Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here?
Understanding makes my truth crystal clear
Innocent Black immigrants locked in housing tenements
Eighty-Five percent tenants dependent welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through, third eye as bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes, robotic probes
Takin' telescope pictures of the globe
Babies gettin' pierced with microchips stuffed inside they earlobes
Then examinated, blood contaminated
Vaccinated, lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration
Testin' poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan, so I come to slay men
Like Bartholomew, 'cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A spaceknight like Rom, consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron
You might also like
United Nations, gun bias style patient
Formulating rap plural a capella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon, military bomb fest
We want sanitary food, planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free and escape is sleep
For a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
The sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
The whole Babylon, time's up, move on
Kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes
Supposed through the gate, case closed things get froze
When it comes time, chosen ones will hold the guns
We take flight with no fright and attack
Never fear 'cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone, son, we can't care
'Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown by the righteous ones
Divine minds bind, we unified as one
Half of Black folk, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlastin' essence stay flyin' over Egypt

For you to defeat the gods
Impossible, you can never defeat the gods
Impossible
For you to defeat the gods
Call an ambulance, Jamie been shot, word to Kimmy
Don't go, son, nigga, you my motherfucking heart
Stay still, son, don't move, just think about Keeba
She'll be three in January, your young God needs ya
The ambulance is takin' too long
Everybody get the fuck back, excuse me, bitch, give me your jack
1-7-1-8, 9-1-1, low battery, damn
Blood comin' out his mouth, he bleedin' badly
Nahhh, Jamie, don't start that shit
Keep your head up, if you escape hell, we gettin' fucked up
When we was eight, we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In '69, his father and mines, they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
I opened it, seen the God holdin' his kids
Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one
Oh shit, here come his Old Earth with no shoes on
Screamin', holdin' her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
Rubbed his hair, turned around, the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats, Officer Lough, took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin', Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car, Dirty Tasha tellin'
But suddenly, a chill came through, it was weird
Felt like my man was cast out my heaven, now we share
Laid on the stretcher, blood on his Wallies like ketchup
Deep like the Paul assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be, from Yoo-hoo to Lee's
Second grade, humped the teachers, about to leave
Finally, this closed chapter comes to an end
He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at 12:10
Now what my man is tryin' to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe
The murder rates is increasin' and we decreasin'
So at the same time, when you play with guns
When you play with guns, son
That causes the conflict of you goin' against your own
You hear me? So let's pay attention
Straight up and down, 'cause this is only a story
