Got the kids goin' wild like I'm sellin' ice cream
Like I'm, like I'm sellin' ice cream, (cream)

I'm the prince of my city, yeah they know about the kid
You a tourist in this bitch doin' hella sight seein'

We been on the move for a minute now, (ey)
Movin' through the city with the windows down, (ey)
Only got a couple months till we graduate so, (so)
Ain't nobody out here really tryna sit around, (ey)
I just hit her phone with that "WYD", (yeh)
She said, "Boy I'm down, if you wanna come find me", (cool)
I said, "Watchu wearing girl? There's something I'm tryna see"
Told me, "Come and get it", said she wanna surprise me
Bet, give me like an hour and a half
With the homies right now and we bout to get a snack, (yoh)
In the mean time, you can take a shower or a bath
And relax, wait for me, I'll be out there in a dash, (yoh)
Close knit, how we sharin' the wealth
I can see that they don't like how we carry ourselves
You can tell by how we act, we don't care how they felt
I can see it in your eyes that you're scared of yourself, you lil'

Pull up at the party, now it's lookin' like a kangaroo
Remember when I used to never get the invite
Now I'm the motherfucker that these people wanna cater to
Smooth criminal, y'all are too cynical
Hottest in my city I ain't even hit my pinnacle, (yeh)
First round draft pick, you might get your ass kicked
Post up, step back, every move is pivotal
And I got the people sayin', "Why the boy is so lyrical?", (what!)
They hatin' on me, but they still enjoy what they hearin' tho
Honestly, I think you need that shit I pour in my cereal
She ain't tryna hook up with me cause I'm boyfriend material, cool
But now she pullin' on my cardigan
Dick went soft, but I think it's gettin' hard again

You mo'fuckers just clocked in
And you doing it but I been did it
My potential that's Ben Simmons
Like blue jeans at the state fair
I might cut you off straight mid-sentence
She love the way that I'm quick with it
We have sex and I'm quick with it
If I put it in with no condom on
Then I might last like 10 minutes
On a good day
But baby it's cool we can do it again
This is the moment and this is the year
I'm predicting that I'll prolly be losing some friends
Please do not tell me about all of the bullshit
That y'all have been doing and who has been with
I feel like I should have been famous a year ago
I ain't got interest into just shooting the shits (woo)
When are we doing it big?
They made it cool and you ruined it quick
I got a hit's I don't usually miss
All of the shit you'll be shooting the bricks
It's crazy to me that you think this shits working
We don't give a fuck about you and your clique
All that I need is a year
And I swear the whole country gon' wonder like
"Who is this kid?"

Been about a week now
Been sleep deprived
Teachers' see me I'm easing by
C's and D's I don't need to try
But that piece of mind's what I need to find
And these people 'round me don't help
I've been dreaming like I'm still twelve
I was thinking 'bout what I want to be
I been redefining myself
Watch me as I break the ceiling
Watch me as I make a million
I think yo girl faking feelings
She just want to date a real one
I'm the man that got the hits
I think I should get payed to kill him
Pigment look like sour cream
They treat me like I'm Jason Williams
I'm trying to get to the top of the pyramid
Obvious to me you not really serious
You can not sit with me
Do this shit differently
If you pick Sprite Ima cop the Sierra Mist
I feel like Hell isn't as hot as my lyrics is
Tell them to give me my chops as a lyricist
All of these rappers look nervous as fuck to me
Like when your girlfriend ain't gotten her period (Uh)
Yeah I can tell it's a struggle for you
Seeing this happen with me and this rapping
I'm doing just what I been wanted to do
I did not bring 'em a thing in the spring
So we gon see now what the summer can do
Only way they get themselves into shape
Is I bring in the facts and they run from the truth
I remember in the morning

I been gifted from the start to the finish
But as I've gotten older it's been harder to listen
Middle school is when I started resistin
My teachers' told my parents
Yeah as smart as this kid is, his heart isn't in it
Now they got me arguin with them
Cause Mom and Dad never thought I'd start a new mission
Had it all planned out like I be part of the system
Now I'm shaking things up like the Parkinsons syndrome
I wasn't made for that 9 to 5
I am not the same as you
I can see a difference between everything you say and do
I can tell you need somebody round
That's gonna state the truth
So basically I'm saying
You just talking while we making moves
And this is just the start of my life
I done came a long way from that Guitar Hero mic
And writing raps with Copeland
We recorded in the basement
Might've thought is was a phase
This is more than dedication

I never woulda known
I never woulda known
I be flipping switches got these bitches
That be fiendin' for a playa
Man they beggin for the bone
And my phone is always jumpin
Man they tryin to get a hold of me

She say you different yeah I know it
It don't need no explaining
I got music inside my mind
I know they eagerly waiting for me to create it
It's guaranteed to be on they playlist
I tell my teachers' bout my dreams
And they gon think that I'm playing, but nah
I'm really going for this shit
My parents talking College
I ain't going to that shit
I got people that's around me
And they know I'm bout to win
Don't expect me to respect you
We don't know about you kid
We don't know about you
You fiendin' for attention
And searching for a chance just a reason to get mentioned
And we got the whole neighborhood terrified
Before you ask me for a favor tell that  mine

I feel like the Chosen One, I feel like the Chosen One
When I come around, they be actin like they owe me something
I just got the motor running and we still got mo' to come
Treat me like a father, I'm a teach you how to hold a gun
From day one, I been an independent thinker
Not a money on my mind, try and get it to my fingers
And it's not about the money or at least I think it wasn't
But I'm all grown up now she diggin' my demeanor
Attracted to my confidence, swagger hella prominent
It's actually astonishing they mad at my accomplishments
And bitch I got the sauce, you can check inside my kitchen
All you ever gonna find is fucking packets full of condiments
Jack ain't got no common sense, I think something wrong with him
Y'all ain't fucking with we now, I ain't gonna call it quits
If I beat it up I guarantee she tellin' all her friends
And that shit ain't okay with me, so I will never call again
I can hear them talking shit, I feel like it's fuel for me
No I don't wanna pop a pill, that shit isn't cool to me
I don't wanna do a feature please don't ask me for the price
Guarantee it's out your budget, give it up there's more to life
I am not the one that you should be triflin' with
They see I got it now they all wanna ride with the kid
And you ain't got it, so I wish you stop trying and quit

So if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it
And you don't really love it, uhh, you're going to give up
And that's what happens to most people actually
If you really look at the ones that ended up you know
"Being successful" unquote in the eyes of society
And the ones that didn't
Often times it's the ones that are successful
Loved what they did so they could persevere

I can't fucking help you if I could it wouldn't even matter
If you want to get up on my level, you 'gon need a ladder
Really though, man, I swear it's simple to me
If I want to get this music poppin', it's a pimple to me
I can feel the pressure, but I don't feel like it's gettin' to me
When it comes to people that's around me, I be pick and choosing
Yeah, yeah, working like I got no other choice
If you think it's dope, they probably got it from the boy
Heard them talking bout me but they never stepping to me
Cause they know that that's an option
That they probably should avoid
I got people round me don't know how to act
We 'gon spend a weekend in Atlanta, going down and back
Winner's derby weekend in the city
I be working like a thoroughbred, catch me in the studio
I'm going round and round the track
These rappers had me for a second then they lost me
Never leave the studio unless I'm out with Chauncy
'Member when these girls, used to never want to call me
Now I hit the stage and they sexually assault me
Shit been crazy as of late, couple things that we been working on
Gon' take me out the state, all that shit you been tweetin'
Come and say it to my face, if you ain't down here making music
You just taking up the space, so get the fuck outEmbed
Yeah

I don't think we can be friends
I don't think that I can even pretend
We used to be such a hit
Now it just feels like a swing and a miss
You used to think I'm the shit
Sometimes I wish you could meet me again
I know you always believed in the kid
And my music and that I'd succeed and go big
And subsequently, I'll be bringing you with
We would get married, and we would be rich
Everything changed, I wasn't the same
Now you think that you believed in a myth
I cannot tell you the reason for this
Summer is coming I'm facing temptations
Maybe I'm selfish and I think with my dick
Remember we spent all of those nights in my basement

I know that I'm really all that you want
Wish you could say "This is all that I need"
I know you see right through all of my fronts
I don't know who I've been tryin' to be
I do not think that's a problem with us
I just think that is a problem with me, me, me, yeah
I don't know when she can stand anymore

I know that you've always been honest with me
Can't help but think that I took you for granted

Yeah, and now we just stuck in the grayest of areas
Thinkin' back to when I'd say I would marry you
Thinkin' back to all of them days I would stare at you
Thinkin' back when you would be drunk at a party
And I was right there I be taking good care of you
I still remember the first time I saw you
And I do not think there was a way of preparing us
For the inevitable, that's how it seems
When you go to college and I chase a dream
Eventually, you'll find a man of integrity
Someone that's better you think I could never be, uh
Probably a guy with some muscles
The type that be smokin' and drinkin' that liquor
Probably a guy with a beard, probably a fella whose penis is bigger
I gotta get myself focused again
Sometimes it feels like you're all that I know
I know you think we should only be friends
'Cause it might just help us to soften the blow
But I don't think that I can even pretend
I do not think that I'll have that control, oh, oh

And kiss and just ball up and cuddle with

And I know I'm not giving you the attention you deserve

You ain't have to say all that
Damn it, I been on my shit
Since about 11 years old I been setting these goals and I handle them like it ain't shit
My mom introduced me to Outkast and I done examined Aquemini since
I'm in the pocket, they sending the blitz
Know I'm gon' scramble and head for the fence
I done ran through about every option
Don't ask about me, I'm very modest
When I'm in that thing, know I'm cherry poppin'
When I'm in my bag, that's Marry Poppins
Blue and black 1600s, need the blue stacks that's gon' keep coming

Come on, give it to me
Sheesh!

Riding through the city with the windows down
Heard that you was talking 'bout him right there
Boy I swear to God you better switch pronouns
I don't ride waves, I don't switch no sound
I don't hang ten, I'm ten toes down
Had a little song I was gonna put first but boy, god damn, this an intro now
Right back to it never left though
Except for that week I had strep throat
Know this shit boom when we come down south and I had to bring my own Lil Metro
2for's on it, man the kid psychotic
If you looking for the flows or the hits, I got it
When the sun goes down I'ma creep up on it
Like a thief in the night, finna pick your pockets
I ain't really fucking with you hypebeasts (nah)
Really though, I put it on everything (everything)
I don't really be in no shindigs
I ain't been happy since 13
CyHi told me how to deal with the writer's block
Got me thinking maybe I was thinking inside the box
Now we in the house, finna bring it around the block
Know they wanna hang, but we hanging them out to dry (woo, woo, woo)
Guess he never seen this shit coming
She a little older, didn't think she be coming
Only thing I'm trying to do is keep this shit jumping
So I turned this motherfucker to a pole vault
Chicken finger plate for the road, dog
Heard that you was working on a mixtape
Really you can keep it like the coleslaw
Bring the beat back like the overalls
Your boyfriend a tool, that's a Kobalt
When I'm in the booth, make the snow fall
Ain't nobody in my class, check the role call
One name on it, bring the beat to me I'ma come skate on it
Something like Timmy, I'ma Wuntayk on it
Boy, I know this shit's hot, no one takes on it
Pre-Med shorty, turn me on like she hit the reset on me
Told me that we living different lives right now
When I graduated, it was recess for me
All these frat boys won't fuck with the boy
Even when it's really something they could come to enjoy
She don't listen to the lyrics, but she fuck with my voice
I got one-hundred situations that I want to exploit and I'ma do it
That's right, riding through the city on my last life
Know I had to beat it down last night
When she leave the crib she get baptized
Every time, funny how it all works out
Right before I did this, I was feeling burnt out
Now the whole city 'bout to get burnt downYou might also like10Embed
I'm on Eastern Parkway, flyin' on a carpet
Through the yellow lights, I'm gliding on the way to her apartment
And I'm ridin', takin' in the smell of the street
It's night time by the way, but you can tell by the beat
That bass knockin' in my whip, just like some elephant feet
Catch a wave when I'm driving past my elementary
Grew up round the kids that made a belt with a string
And made me feel like I belonged 'cause they could tell I was me
Since then, whew feelin' like I might've lost track
I been thinking too much but I can't help what I think
That shit that's s'posed to make me happy only melts in the heat
If I could freeze it, maybe I could turn myself into steam
Bendin' corners through Cherokee Park
Way I'm driving you would think I was scared of the dark
Another ticket and my momma gon' tear me apart
Well… shit

Young and poppin', I been soakin’ up my adolescence
I took some time to find the balance, now we back in session
Ain't goin' to college, I decided that's a bad investment
But I'm still takin' notes and siftin' through my past and present
I been having trouble socializing
Go out to these parties to make people like me, nah I really don't feel like it
Can't relate to no one, I should stay home they'll miss me
I told this shit to Copelan on the way home from Cincy
He agreed with me, felt the same
Damn, that shit's relieving
Maybe time to reassess my standards for an evening
Shit ain't perfect, we just searching for a plan or just a reason to
Fall in love with life and be a fan of fuckin' breathing
I ain't suicidal, but lately nothin' seems to interest me
And I ain't got the time if it don't gratify me instantly
Thought that I’d be smooth if I ain't smoke or drink
Still I got some vices that be stopping me from focusing
Like wassup with my dopamine, searching for a doper me
I don't want that Adderall, bitch, I ain't got no broken wings
I grew up with the poetry, at 12 I wrote a hot verse
Relying on a pill to do it only means I got worseYou might also like3Embed
Ayy, you got me fucked up if you think I'ma fuck up this time, alright
It's the kid, come on, ayy

I rock the tan cargos with the velcro seams
I can't feel the vibration when my cell phone ring
I like to watch them split the swisher, make the 'rillo bleed
I know that Sunny keep a pound inside the L.L. Bean
And this that wasted youth, killing time
Say the truth, feel the vibe
Baby let me bring you 'round my friends, yeah, they the purest
I might act a little different that's just 'cause they give me courage
When I need it
I mean I'm joking but I'm not
Yeah the story of my life, said I play too fucking much
And I say that way too much, guess that still don't justify it
But I been that way forever, I don't feel like even trying to change
She the one I'm tryna' be real with
But this that tick-tock, she ain't got no time for my feelings
I need a pit stop every time I ride with my villains
They up in Big Rock blowing smoke inside the pavilion, you know

Wasted youth, killing time
Say the truth, feel the vibe
Wasted youth

Wasted youth, wasted time
Wish that I could press rewind
Don't fuck with sunshine, stuck in my confines
Yeah, I'm worried 'bout real shit, you worried 'bout punchlines
And I was coolin' with my niggas
Talking 'bout stacking them figures
Wasting my time with them bitches
Chilling, kicking, she gon' stuff them swishers
And I don't even smoke for real but I'ma puff it with her
And we gon' fuck and I ain't gon' see her for a couple weekends
'Cause I been drinking, I been smoking, going off the deep end
She said that she gon' be my baby well I guess it depends
Catch me faded maybe we can see then, maybe we can be friends
If we don't hit it off, I'm sorry
Lately, I been distant, you can cut this shit off
I just been lost in my thoughts
Wasted money, chasing truth
Wasted time, wasted youth

And the people tryna' hang with us
Y'all should know that I ain't playin' with it
Girl you know I get tired of the same ol' thing
So that's why I couldn't stay with it
I ain't mean to do you wrong though, hey

But I ain't trippin off what y'all gon’ say

Something ‘bout the east end at night
Floatin’ through ya neighborhood below the streetlights
And I’m headed to ya culdesac
Told me park a couple houses down
Cuz your neighbors on surveillance
As a favor to ya parents while they out of town
I been tryna' catch a vibe from ya
That's exactly why I texted 'Hi' to ya
Wouldn't believe me if I told you that I’d never lie to ya
And you shouldn't really
I’d explain it, but you couldn't feel me
She said it wouldn't kill me just to have a real conversation one time in my life
I don't know what's wrong with me, girl I know you right
Staring at the ceiling while I listen to you talk about the things that i be thinkin’ bout too
And everything made sense for a second right then, but tomorrow I won't have a damn clue

Thinkin’ back when all of us in town
Remember we was always ridin’ around
Doing nothing, and that shit be so nostalgic to me now, like fuck
Ain't no option, man, I gotta make y'all proud
‘Cause the shit is in my blood, in my genes, you gon’ need some better denim
Local scene fucking with you 'til you doing better than 'em
They the type that's gon' pretend that something you said offend them
Just so they can have their boys hold ‘em back
Like, "Lemme hit ‘em"
What a stupid ass evening
But I could prolly use a ass beatin’
Help me write about something besides what I was doing last weekend

I just wanna feel alive
Maybe I should start smoking?
Maybe I should tell her how I feel
Maybe I should go and get my heart broken
Maybe I should take a long walk
Maybe I should put my got damn phone down
Maybe I should do a lil more
Maybe I should stop by my grandmas house
I was thinkin ‘bout a sunny day
I was wondering how to make my dad proud of the son he raised
I was wondering how these kids get hooked on these one-a-days
Funny thing, I be lookin’ at em in a judgey way
Truth is, I ain’t never felt like I should run a way
I ain't never had to live a life that I fuckin’ hate
I know people livin’ with a never ending stomach ache

But I been wondering if I'm really happy
I ain't sad, I'm just wondering if I'm really happy
I been wondering if this shit that I been chasin’
Gon’ be gratifying for me when it really happens
I should be feelin’ blessed to just be breathin’
Lately I can’t seem to fight the stress and all the demons
Lately I just seem to treat the sex like an achievement
Goin’ deeper with no depth and all I left ‘em with is some semen
I hope that shit was worth it
Look at the mistakes that made me grow into this person

All they worried ‘bout is if they need you
Can you help now?
No
All this shit gon’ bring me to a meltdown
Woah
I done spent some weeks in the dark
Only listening to beats in a seat tryna start
On these words and accelerate the beat from my heart
Searchin for that high again
And I want that shit to last me more than
5 or 10 minutes at a time, take control of my environment
Choosin’ how my time is spent, gotta let you know that
Anybody with me in the middle of the night is liable to become my psychiatrist
Ain't it funny how that goes

Momma called
Asked me if it's worth it to me
I’ll be honest, not at all
This ain't what I thought it was
I guess don't get me wrong, I know I'm blessed
Sometimes I'm tempted just to hit that fucking ganja for the stress, but
I make that pussy my getaway vehicle
She give it up, but she wish I was dateable
I don't say much when I notice the pain on her face
It reminds me of kids I would see in school
Empathy coming in waves
Then it just tends to be something that fades
Me, I been searching for something that lasts
Don't want no remedy numbing the pain
Told me her wrist is in love with the blade
Damn, I wish there was something I could say
I know this life doesn't come with a key
I know the kitchen don't come with a maid
I got the hits they be wanting to play
Fuck with the vision is what they gon’ say

I'm still trying to be the best version of me
I got a whip plus room in the front seat
And it's so up-scene
She make me look like 2010 Kris Humphries
Y'all been getting too comfy
I been spending my time going off
Just in case you're wondering, never just one drink
Eighty proof all up in my bloodstream
Used to talk shit, now I wonder what they must think
Blame it on the crushed dreams that we used to all have
All I know is that we can't fall back now
And we rocking from side to side
Tell me now if you're trying to ride with me
You know I can find some time just to get
In tune with you, ayy, ayy, ayy
Used to be the one that I idolized
Now I can't see you the same as I used to
I guess I need me a ride or die
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too

If they catch us, I don't care 'cause we all gon' die (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, we all gon' die
I was worried, to be honest, but it's all goin' right
When I first laid eyes, I was awful enticed
And I might be off something, but I'm all in now
She gotta call in now
I don't think that you should work tomorrow
She said, "First of all
I'm still goin' in," like Rich Homie Quan
But with you and me, God, man, it feels so intense
I already seen that movie but I will go again with you
I got a few I been tending to
But tonight, I forgot all about 'em

Through the night
I would try to get it tonight
Yeah, the phone on my head like, "You better do right"
I'm alone in the bed, yeah, I know what you said
Better cope with it
Don't take me for a joke and I won't get a friend that's tryna be more than that
I'm convinced that it's sorta that
When I seen you in the pics, I could tell you was forcin' that
I got time for this
Minus the bullshit, I'm cool now, look at my common sense
And I'm just realizing this
Know my soul isn't trapped
But what's holding me back is the old me, in fact
I'ma get intact, I'ma get it back
Mama, hold me to that
Just, just, just hold me to that
On stack, me and Jack got the city on smack
That's word, huh, that's words
Used to catch 18 all the way to Newburg
It was only me and her, I don't care what you heard
Only me and her, I don't care what you heard
Got a Southern accent, she'll slur a few words
That's virtue, sir, let me share a few words

I know you wish that you were still a kid
Woke up from a dream wishin' I was in the Ville again
I can see my pops silhouette in everything I do, but I don't see him anymore
It makes me wonder what I even do it for if I don't see him anymore
Will I be happy with the things that I achieve? And what's more
I don't even want to think what's in store for me (Store for me)
I wrote a note and I'ma leave it on the door

Still working
Still waking up looking for real purpose
Still trying to figure out what it's gon' take
Still trying to find connection with some real surface level types
Back when I was young, I used to pedal bikes
Now I'm riding cross country, doing several nights
In and out the Sprinter van, pull up, get the levels right
Get a bite to eat, do the show, and then we settle like
What could be a better life?
But I'm still staring at the ceiling in my bed at night
Thinking 'bout what I don't got yet
Why I'm not hot yet
Why the last project was something that I thought would make me something that I'm not yet
It's all a work in progress
That's what they tell me and I respond with, "I guess"
I been wanting to get something off my chest
But it's not time yet
It might never be time
My kid won't get no screen time
At least that's what I'd like to think
'Cause my childhood was filled with tree climbs
And Oatmeal Creme Pies and looking at the street signs
I guess that he gon' be fine, or she will
I just feel like it's hard to be thrilled in times like this
When our hands can't keep still
And if it's not Insta then it's emails
There's beauty in the details
So I'ma try my best to pay attention to 'em
Spend your day with this and it can get you through it
I ain't seen an institute since I ended schooling
Used to hate it, now my dreams take place in it
Sun shine through the blinds 'til I wake in it
I just got done stretching like the eighth inning
Now it's time to get something 'fore the day's finished
You might also like
I got
Well wishes in my cellphone from my classmates that let themselves go
Well aware that I'm well known
Know we had a stretch of time between us that you felt close to me, but
It's been a minute since
Did I change or did they rob me of my innocence?
Inner city kids I grew up with, we had some differences
But inside gymnasiums, it's almost like they didn't exist
Time's tickin', my mom's 50
Told me that she been thinkin' 'bout spending time different
It's more precious, what if I took the same method at 21 and adopted it?
Sometimes I feel like I'm tripping for dipping out of town while my pops living still
Palms itching, but this money is not Benadryl
Ain't no pattern to the way I tend to feel
It's all over the place
I'ma lower the shades and sleep in
I ran into a kid I grew up with
He shook my hand and told me, "No one thought you'd do this shit"
I can't relate, but see, I understand
'Cause when they hear me now compared to back then it's like, "Who is this?"
Don't know if I changed, but the music did
In my old shit, I used to just admit things
Now I sit around and wonder, "Is that something you admit?"
'Cause when I hear it, all I do is cringe
I guess I did change
Two years in ATL
Before I moved, I had never got drunk
Now I'm getting tore up like an ACL
Meeting people that my friends idolize
That they only ever get a chance to see on they TL
Artists that they playing through a JBL
In somebody's basement, smoking, getting wasted
Something in the air and I can taste it
2018 I couldn't be on my own
Every night I'd call a girl and fall asleep on the phone
I guess it was how I coped with leaving from home
Discipline, I gotta keep in control
It gets more difficult to rap every day
'Cause it's less and less things that feel like worth saying
Nothing is for sure except life sure ends
I tried to keep that in mind but it's not workin'5Embed

Got some friends in the east end loadin' full clips
I'm not 'bout it but they are
In the end I know that they got me like State Farm
I can hit 'em with a textbook, left hook
Knock 'em out cold so he wakes up with a fresh look, lets cook
Ima Heisenberger rhymin' words
Mighta heard that I'm a quiet nerd 'til I start to write a verse
It's time to work, put together a franchise
Started from the ground up now I'm a landslide
People don't like the way I'm spendin' my damn time
Guess that they don't know that my career is a landmine
Anti lame-o's with ant-sized bankrolls
Got the same love life as Manti Te'o
Ya'll been hatin' on me since the man was like a day old
Now I'm 'bout to blow up have the fans like ayo
I used to know him when he wasn't nearly that size
Never really thought it'd all materialize
Bounce that ass, yeah I told her "bounce that ass"
Broke right now but I'm sittin' on a mound of cash
Ain't got it yet but soon I'll be countin' racks
Ima get this music movin' like an ounce of crack, no jokeEmbed
Pat White

I used to know that I could rap, now I know I'm a prodigy
Lately I’ve been feeling, emotionless honestly
So I'm thinkin' with my head, ’cause I know where I gotta be
When I put my mind to it, man, no one is stoppin' me, but
I don't wanna talk about my aspirations
'Cause sometimes, I be havin' trouble havin' patience
I'm an aggravatin', masturbatin’, rap sensation with the swagger of a premature ejaculation
Uncontrollable, and I don’t know when to stop
As long as the beat's playin’, man, the flow doesn't stop
When I roll down the block, all the bros wanna talk
And tell me, how they're tryin' not to get exposed by the cops like
"I’m really getting sick of this place"
"I gotta blow up on that dro to help me get through the day"
"I can't trust the government because the system is fake"
"And if I have to break the law, well that's a risk Imma take"

Chillin' with the bros, I think we're 'bout to go somewhere but really I don't know
We're all about as flexible as acrobats, and I'm just waitin' on this girl to Snapchat me back
We're kinda friends, but at the same time we're not
'Cause I'm pretty sure she knows that I think she's hot
I try not to make it awkward at all, but, you know?
Just forget it, let's get on with the song
You might also like
I'm a sneaky young fella, but they never notice
I be stealing Wi-Fi if that network open
I be Edgar Poe'n, with them clever poems
She said my pale skin make me look like Edward Cullen
It's like Guinness when you talkin', record broken
They try to understand, but won't ever know it
So give it up one time for my side of town
Mean-muggin' other people when I ride around
Now it's the H-A-R-L-O dubs
Flow so tight it never felt so snug
Felt my cell-phone buzz over a elbow nudge
I be dishin' out that dope but don't sell no drugs
But I'm sneakin' 'round the city while I'm lurkin' in these alleyways
Everybody act the same, wishin' they was out of place
Proud to say I'm doing me, only me for what it's worth
Sick enough to buss a verse that make your fuckin' stomach hurt

Chillin' with the bros, I think we're 'bout to go somewhere but really I don't know
We're all about as flexible as acrobats, and I'm just waitin' on this girl to Snapchat me back
We're kinda friends, but at the same time we're not
'Cause I'm pretty sure she knows that I think she's hot
I try not to make it awkward at all, but, you know?
Just forget it, let's get on with the song
I'm just tryna give 'em lyrics that they could pass on
Perfectin' every line when I'm makin' rap songs
But perfection ain't perfect if it's takin' that long
Lazy with my retainer so my braces back on
But I look good, I feel nice, the weathers' amazing
I'm becomin' a man, I'm gettin' better at shavin'
I'm feelin' handsome at the moment, borderline sort of fly
Can't wait until my facial structure gets more defined
And I shed a little baby fat, ooh I think I'm Johnny Depp
Ask 'em when I'm finna make it, man I swear I'm probably next
I promise that you not as fresh
I'm going hard, you not a wreck
Stop a check, detail-oriented 'til it's all correct
I know that I suck  I know I'm appealing
Everybody sees me different, I'm a social chameleon
You might want an explanation for the things that you are seein'
Just know I'm a extraordinary human being

Chillin' with the bros, I think we're 'bout to go somewhere but really I don't know
We're all about as flexible as acrobats, and I'm just waitin' on this girl to Snapchat me back
We're kinda friends, but at the same time we're not
'Cause I'm pretty sure she knows that I think she's hot
I try not to make it awkward at all, but, you know?
Just forget it, let's get on with the songEmbed
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum

Rollin' 'round town in the passenger seat (What)
My boy got the whip, as we pass through the streets (Okay)
Slumped to the seat while I bump to the beat
While my dad's on the phone tryna ask where I be (Yeah, but)
But, I ain't feel the phone vibrate in my cargoes
You know what it is, man, you know it's young Harlow (Harlow!)
See a fine chick, and I'm peepin' that shit
'Cause you know the boy gotta check her out like a barcode (She bad like)
Woah, in the zone, man, I gotta get home
Curfew twelve-thirty and it's twelve-fifteen (Fifteen)
Drive by slow, and I'm high off life
So my eyes hang low like my self-esteem (Kush)
Nah, just playin' I'm the man right now
Man, I swear to God, life ain't never felt this sweet (Never felt this sweet)
Haven't felt this free since elementary
And tonight is a night that I'm relishing
I am just trying to get through the obstacles
Hoping tonight doesn't end in the hospital
Working things out like that shit was abdominals
Then I just cruise, Mission Impossible
Like a white vacation
Man, I swear sometimes life's amazing
Sit back in the nighttime, at the right time
And you know the young boy mind is racing (Okay)
White suburbs to the all-black ghettos
Top to the bottom, first to the last levels
To the last lights in the dead night, like, woah now
Slow down, put his foot on the gas pedal (Skrrt!)
Got that hype and I got that metal
Got that bass and I got that treble
Time stays tickin' on this life I'm livin'
So goin' back home ain't on my schedule

Oh shit, I just turned eighteen
No curfew now, gotta work that thing
And my new girlfriend got her tongue just pierced
But she goin' down on me tryna hurt that thing
I'm unprobable, smokin' through all of my obstacles
Like I'm a agent on Mission Impossible
They tryna throw alcohol on my cup
Well, bitch I got a bottle full
Young kid flye'd out, well I really didn't fly here
But I'm lookin' real fly now
Put me up in my house, got a swisher for the beat ride
Now we really finna vibe out
Enemies on time-out, lookin' for jokes to get the rhymes out
I ain't stickin 'round to find out
Plus I got the boy J-Harlow spittin' straight bars
In the dark until he ready to shine out
This my jam, we ain't never make no plans
Weekends throwin' up bands, gimme that advance
And give and Harlow a chance, bitch
You ain't never rolled no grams bitch
You ain't never seen these girls
But I'm 'bout to get between 'em like a sandwhich
And I'm tryna see this world
Got the globe in my mo'fuckin' hands bitch
Now I ain't tryna be the king of the world
But I also wasn't tryna put my thing in your girl
Heard of accidents?
Mo'fucka yeah that's what happens when you talk shit like a laxative
So gone give it a swirl when you around
The white boys holdin' it down for two towns
From Louisville to Manassas
We get it packin', we rappin and spreadin' love

When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one

Okay these people think they know me and they might
Imma be honest but that's only for tonight
If you step up to me homie then you know we 'bout to fight
And she want a real man I could show her what that's like
Not really, I'm kind of a pussy
Every fella in the building wants a bite of the cookie
And to be honest I'm overwhelmed
You prolly don't know me well
I'm frontin' like I'm somethin' but it's honestly show and tell
I'm tryna trade my v-card in for a driver's license
They said that I should wait until I find the right chick
So I guess I'll get a girl that I could ride my bike with
And when we grow old she can ride on my nine-inch
Set of rims that I'm gonna buy for my car
Gotta get 'em chromed out 'til they shine with the stars
I tell the truth, I ain't never lied with these bars
On a lazy Sunday man I'm tryna re-charge

They don't ever know what to expect, ha
Ima have to show 'em I'm the best, ha
Never knew that I was doper than the rest, ha
Got your girl touchin' on my shoulders and my chest, ha

Halfway home and I'm feelin' like a winner
Still the young boy but I ain't no beginner
We can get it poppin' if you really want to
You deserve a round so baby come through

Flows so stupid I be parkin' in the handicap
Parking spot night or day, dark or not hard to stop
 I just hit the mic, lay it down and mark the spot
I  in the studio
Chillin' with the boys while we steady playin' Yu-Gi-Oh
Girls want my heart 'cause they know the kid is truly dope
Ion play with love though, I ain't Ricky Rubio
But the other side of me thinks maybe I'm just scared
I want a girlfriend that understands and likes playing with my hair
I want a girlfriend that comprehends that everything ain't always fair
And doesn't passive-aggressively have to say that she don't care

They don't ever know what to expect, ha
Ima have to show 'em I'm the best, ha

'Cause I'm extroverted, introverted
Drop a beat I'm finna murk it
Write the bars and spit the verses
All you rappers been deserted
Skippin' dinner, get dessert, I hit the track and get to work
Analyze the situation tryna pick out which is worse
Watchin all these women twerkin', vicious when they get it workin'
Swear to God it's picture-perfect even if it isn't worth it
And I'm writin' 'til the pen is burnin'
Still doin' me just a different version
I'm 'bout to get it go ahead and tell 'em fall back

Everything 'bout you girl it's oh so great
Used to think this shit was corny 'til I saw your face
Then it clicked for me, now it make sense to me
Now I'm thinkin' bout you and I'm only livin' blissfully
'Cause when I look at you, girl, I don't get an erection
I think about how I wanna give you affection
I'm only sixteen, so it's better to do it
And take all this love and invest it in you

I got a bad chick with me who ain't interested yet
She's always in my mind I ain't gettin' no rest
And if she says she don't like me I might give it a rest
Until then, no, I'ma have to give it my best
Every single time that she sends me a text
I feel the butterflies slowly creeping into my chest
I'm fantasizing thinkin' 'bout the way she fits in a dress
And to be honest, I don't think that I can live with the stress
I know I might sound a lil' cliche
Every time I see her, I just wanna hit the freeze frame, replay
Gotta talk to you 'cause the rest don't listen
And them yoga pants give your boy X-Ray vision
You the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Put that down on on everything
Ever since I met you every night I've had the wettest dreams
And that's real

Swear your body bangin', let me grab it while I kiss you
I know I'm not the best but I'm just glad that's not an issue
'Cause most of the time I'm stuck at home masturbatin' to you
Tonight is lookin' different though, I think I'm in the zone
With you, all the time, but I swear we never been this close
If the feeling isn't mutual then I can hit the road
But if you're vibin' with me, baby, we can get to know
Each other just a little, you've been all on my mind
Maybe we can spend a little quality time
If I gotta wait for you I can fall in line
I'm only sixteen, we've got all of our lives
So tell me, if I got a chance, what's the probability?
If I'm so in love with you, how could you not be feelin' me?
Everything fell into place and everything is makin' sense
I just don't know why she ain't convinced

Ran into a east side thug, but I'm peace sign throwin'
Said "wassup?" and asked him how the street life's goin'
Told me he'd been chillin', "tryna keep my eyes open
'Cause anything can happen when them street light's glowin'"
The sun goes down, but the block keeps lit
Steppin' over cracks where the concrete splits
Wind blowin' got me on my long sleeves, y'all see
I've been feelin' good like all weekend (Pat White)
And the streets lookin' desolate, late night pedestrian
Silhouettes extra thin, paranoia settin' in
Worst-case scenario is runnin' through my head again
Thoughts that I been thinkin' I've been tryin' not to let 'em in, uh
Errybody needs friends, because every week we tryna have an awesome weekend
Pitch-black, ain't no tellin' where the darkest street ends
By the way, has anybody seen Brent?

Sweatshirt tight, we about to start the winter
Hand my garbage to my friends, 'cause I don't have the heart to litter, uh
Too young to interact with bartenders
But these bars that I tend to are harsher than sharp splinters
Money equals food, so I ask you if you've got the dough
Calories, I pack 'em in, metabolism got me though
Borrow just a couple bucks, but every week it doubles up
Enough's enough, I ain't comin' back until my funds is up (Pat White)
Bumpin' with the tempo, bustin' that extendo
Chillin' with my friends, doin' something to someone else's expense
We were outside McDonald's last week, and my friend put his nutsack on the window
Right in front the cashier, that's as funny as it gets, yo
Took off and booked it like we runnin' for the end zone
They puffin' on the window, but you should know I been though
Yeah you should know I own it boy, you somethin' like a rental

Go out for that cheesecake
Stay up late with a plate of cake
And a young boy still tryna make that bank

I just hope that college fun
All they throw is hunnids 'cause they glad that I'm their daughter's son
Ridin' round now I'm well behaved
Working hard 'til my wealth is safe
Mess with me and you melt away, man, name a rapper do well as me
I'm straight to the point Tim Hardaway
Got 'em jelly, like marmalade

Good luck tryna find a boy hot as this
'Cause I'm tryna be the key, Stoyanovich
Go and drop a hit so they jockin' it

Got me feelin' out of date
Class room feel like outer space
Every day's about the same

Got the same routine every day this week
Good chance it'll be the same next week
All I'm really tryna do is stay asleep
Livin' this life but it ain't for me
Everything the same now, every single day now
All I'm really tryna do is figure everything out
Stand up, lay down, same bed, same house
Chained up life style, know I'm 'bout to break out
Right now I'm waking up at 6 in the morn'
Mom gets pissed and she kicks in the door
Home from school watching clips of the porn

People watchin' while I'm sittin' there just not talkin'
It's November in Michigan and this family vacation feels more like imprisonment
But I know it's all gonna be nostalgia soon
And when I look back, I can say I called it, tooEmbed
Yeah
Uh
Guess who?
Indeed

Okay, check one-two, the lyrical kung fu
Killin' these tracks every time I come through
Not just some dude I'm a mother lovin' beast
Ballin' on the mic like number thirty-three
Yeah, and I'm sure to be a legend
Keep on spittin' 'till they heard of me in heaven
Go the distance with no assistance
People all know that I'm so consistent
Yeah, and you're all getting slayed
Takin' down anybody sittin' in the way
Got no hops but I'm gettin' rebounds
And all you other rappers 'bout to get beat down

Yeah, Larry Bird
Anyway, I just wanna let everybody know
That in the next few, uh, weeks or months
I don't know when, I definitely got some kind of project coming out
Maybe a mixtape, I don't know
But, all these tracks you've been hearing, remixes, covers, of course a few tracks you haven't
They're all gonna come together
So I hope you download it
And if you know me, hope you get a copy, cause it's sure to be free
But then again, I don't even know what's gonna happen yet
So, stay tuned, cause I'll let you know
Anyway, for now, I'm out
Peace!

I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on

I tell the critics, "Shut up," like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, "Throw it on"
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on

I became exactly what I wanted to
I became a millionaire at twenty-two
Telling girls I love 'em and they love me too (Ooh)
I don't question if they mean it 'cause I know they do
Started being me when I realized it was okay to
Middle school bumping Waka Flocka, "O Let's Do”
First album and I know just how it's gon' debut
Track three is where I tell her we gon' rendezvous
I'm signed to the gatekeepers
Don't believe the gossip 'cause it ain't true
Half of the dreams I had already came true
And they never told me anything I couldn't do
I got a mirror in my room I like to look into
At seventeen, I never thought that I would look this cute (Woo)
Classmates can't believe the place I took it to
If I didn't rap then I would be a good masseuse
Fun fact, but it's a hidden talent, 'cause she rubbing my back
All these different cities, I'm becoming sidetracked
She leaving my hotel wearing something I packed
My wardrobe's spread across a whole map
JWise used to book me for the open mics
Kills me when they act like this was overnight
Like we didn't do a tour in a tiny van
Eight deep at the show, it might be eight fans (Mm)
That builds character, something y'all could probably use more of
If I told the truth to her, I know she'd be tore up
They love it when I rap and I don't even put a chorus
Turkey on ciabatta from the deli, shout to Morris
Thirty grand to show up, we might as well pour up
Fake handshakes, we know you ain't going for us (Ooh)

I played you my first hit before it dropped
You were in the driver's seat and I was on the aux'
You made the stank face, that's how I knew it was hot
Lookin' back, I gotta wonder if you would have thought
That my life would've changed like this
That every station in America would play my shit
That I would do a remix and I could take my pick
Of any rappers that I wanted and they'd get on the shit
Hmm, I can't imagine you did
The way you see it, ain't no way that I don't have a new bitch
And it ain't fair, 'cause you know I got a whole lotta friends
That's gon' tell me who they seen you on the avenue with, uh
The playing field ain't level, that's how I engineered it
You don't know when I'ma pop up and when I'm disappearin'
Lately, it's been somethin' I don't really like in your spirit
Wallis Lane made the beat and Nickie Jon engineered it, uh

She ain't flyin' in Spirit
She's a Delta bitch, not the kind with the pyramids (Ah)
You got somethin' that I'm tryna experience (Uh)
Leavin' comments, got 'em all gettin' curious
Couple phone calls, now we callin' it serious
I say I'm in love when I fall for appearances
It's a lotta clubs tryna call for appearances
Last one I did, I caught a vibe with the bottle girl
Told her that, "I'm leavin', but I'll call when I'm here again"
That was West Virginia, don't know when I'll be there again
People in my circle wonder when I'll be arrogant
Feel like they can't wait to say I stepped out of character (Ah)
She said that she wanted me to take care of her (Nah)
She said she want me to London and Paris her
She said, "Do your thing," long as I don't embarrass her
Damn, I ain't even get to test out my character (Ah, ooh)

She ain't flyin' in Spirit

I know you hate the way we drifted
But we both inside this party and we lifted
So what's up?

I'ma sip my drink and crack a big smile
Just to see if I can still get you 'cause it's been a while, yeah
It's been a minute now
Your friends just started listening to my music, but I been in style
You say that I play too much, but we both know I been a child
Asked you when you got to town, you say that you've been in town
That's fucked up
So you just wasn't gon' hit me?
Lookin' like this, you thought it wasn't gon' tempt me?
I'm sorry, but you ain't gotta bar me up
You should come and step into my world just like Narnia
I won't do no harm to you, come on, let's find a quiet spot
How's your sister and your niece? Does she still cry a lot?
Who you talkin' to now? Are y'all 'bout to tie a knot?
Hope not, speak now, hold your peace, I will make that show stop
'Member back when I would come and spend the night at your house
Wake up by myself in bed 'cause you'd be at the stovetop
Walk inside the kitchen, put my hands up, ah, let me stop
Please excuse me, I know these are heavy thoughts
A man's greed can't see the things that he's already got
Fucked it up between us 'cause I wanted you and every thot
Things would only worsen when you'd let me rock
Your bestie tried to warn you, but you told her that, "He said he stopped"
You used to say her man was trash and tell me 'bout the way he'd act
I would shake my head until I realized I'm the same as that
Now I wonder, did she tell her man that I'm a trash dude?
And would he shake his head until he realized he was trash too?
I know this reunion's unexpected, but it's past due
At least if you ask me, I won't ask you
So what you 'bout to do?

Hol' up

My dad built houses, my mom painted pictures
They both gave it up once I came into the picture
Me, I'm like them, just a fifty-fifty mixture
My mom rode horses, she wish I had a sister
I prefer the pen to a hammer or a brush
But I build things up and my imagery is lush
I used to play soccer but I never had the touch
Basketball, too, but I ain't love it that much
Much of my time's spent lookin' for a rush
Tryna find something to afford me that feeling
I fall in love with girls 'cause they physically appealing
A couple weeks pass and the convos hit a ceiling
I've smokеd a few blunts, cookies, and runtz
Gotten high еnough to know it isn't what I want
Met the celebrities, seen through the fronts
Dated one girl and I've seen two at once
I ain't upset to be inside for some months
And get back in touch with the person that I was
Know I've given too much of my time to the chase
Tryna get in touch with a person that I lust
So this the perfect time to hang it up
Used to sleep until noon now at nine, I'm waking up
More time that I'm inside then the less I want to talk
I don't wanna FaceTime, I ain't tryna say, "What's up?"
Careful with the ways that my time is taken up
Bunch of geeks tryna take the shine away from us
Reaching for critiques and they tryna say I suck
Got me reminiscin' back to a time I gave a—
But my skin's gotten thick since then
And my high school crush has done the same thing
So when this blows over and I'm back home
I'ma tell her that I'm really done playin' games
Seven figures in my bank statements
Seven fellas that I'm that stayin' on the same page with
We been shootin' for the stars and our aim's dangerous
Hasn't been a single thing that the gang can't get
My main thing shall remain nameless
Know they ask about her often but I ain't sayin' shit
There's a level of discretion that I'm maintaining
She don't understand it, but she ain't famous
We gon' see who's still around once the game changes
She's a businesswoman, but I got her playing favorites
You ain't rooting for me then I gotta make changes
Ex girls watchin' with a lot of fake pages (A lot of fake pages)
My OG showed me what a Plain Jane is and a bust down is
Now I got a hankering to spend a few thousand
KY used to take me up to Icebox when he'd get his jewelry cleaned
They would ask if they could help me and I say, "I'm just browsing"
Woyne worked at Enterprise Rentals discounted
Ville to the A and back, we was putting miles in
Always wondered to myself if I could really be the leader
Of a group of brown-skinned boys when I'm not brown-skinned
Certain things they grew up on that they get but I don't get
Differences in how we raised make me feel like I don't fit
Not to mention the distance between our parents' houses
Shared some money with 'em so they know I care about 'em
I'm tryna do it right and figure what a fair amount is
But I fantasize 'bout a day that we all swimming in it
No contracts and we independent
Stay close, never start a convo' with "It's been a minute"
'Cause it never will be end of sentence

I say thank you like twenty times
Try to talk about somethin' else
Reminisce on some funny time
Truthfully, I'm not comfortable with gettin' all the praise
Even more when y'all get to drinkin' and start tellin' me all the things
That you really think
Likе what I should've done differеntly
What you think of my energy
The downsides that come with being friends with me
I can tell you think this the realest that anybody's ever been with me
But luckily I got PG
And luckily I keep them with me

I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine

Once people lose touch with ya
They start to hate ya
Start to show you they true nature
Start to be the ones in the comments
That's talkin' 'bout you like you a stranger
Talkin' 'bout ya like y'all didn't have class together
Talkin' like you not humble now or you acting better
Speakin' on the things you've done that they haven't ever
I play the game, you watch the game like Adam Schefter
I created this added pressure
I'm the one that made Jack get better
Tone it down? I could never, ooh
All the greats caught all the hate
All the rappers I love most at one point got called a fake
Everybody seem to know the song that I oughta make
Know the route that I oughta take
I put too much work in to just call it fate
But I keep it humble so you can have a good time
I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine
And I sleep at night just fine
I tried to be kind
Now I'm speakin' my mind

(Time, ah-ah)
I told your brother this, so I'ma tell you this
This is probably advice I keep giving you frequently
And probably will continue to give it to you frequently because
It's made a difference in my life
Take some moments today during the shoot to look around
Look at the faces of all the people you've brought together
Watch their reactions
Look at the joy on their faces
Take a moment to really absorb what you've created
What you're creating
And try to savor it
I know that you and I are built the same and that it's never enough
There's always some other thing we want to accomplish, but
Just lean back for a moment today
And really comprehend the greatness that you've made
Love you, babe4Embed

She came to kick it with her friends
They takin' shots, shots, shots

Met her at the club and I took her to the casa (casa)
Get bread nonstop
Know my name, ring a bell like Raja
From the city like Rondo, Rajon
But I'm from the white side like Hassan
Way too fly but I'm not trying
Had y'all's fun but it's my time
Chain go bling

Young and I got time
But I finally got one, it's about time
Make the whole city shine every time that I shine
Let me know now if you not down
'Cause you left and you not 'round
Need a Julep and a hot brown
Go 'head, let that top down

I did everything I said I would, and said it first
I mean the world's in denial, but they all know what I'm headed for
Ah

We 'bout to feed these youngins to the metaverse
Meanwhile I'm over here just tryna pen a verse
'Cause I'm done bein' extra with the extroverts
The label used to wonder how I'm supposed to stand next to Vert
Prolly never thought that I would get these legs to work
I work hard, but hard shit don't need no extra work
That's why I show up in a sweatshirt and let it burn
The world's mine, I just say, "Fuck it, let it turn"
The girl's mine, I just say, "Fuck it, have a turn"
The G.O.A.T.s call me to the side like, "Can we have a word?"
I could've fronted but I did this shit how I preferred (I preferred)
Mmm, I know I should be humble, but it's somethin' I just haven't learned
Soon enough I have to make these bad habits burn
Soon enough we 'bout to come and get the shit we earn
You not a fan now, but I remember when you used to be fanned out
I'm guessin' when the whole world loves you, people only got one way to stand out
All that time in the kitchen finally panned out
I put some flavor in a pot and took the bland out
I know my grandpa would have a heart attack if I pulled a hunnid grand out
So I'm not gonna pull a hunnid grand out
I'm hip-hop, do you fully understand?
Fully automatic with the jams and they don't jam
At the shows I'm 'bout to start handin' out programs

Ain't too many cons when you playin' with the pros
'Cept for how your life get exposed, but I make that sacrifice for the life that I chose
I know in Toronto they got salt for the roads
But schools closed in Kentucky, so I like when it snowed
The kids carry chopsticks not for rice in the bowl
School counselors all know how they life is at home
Cold like the Minnesota Vikings at home

Lucky me, people that don't fuck with me
Are linkin' up with people that don't fuck with me to fuck with me
This shit is gettin' ugly
And every situation is transactional

But I gotta get a nigga back for that, it's non-negotiable
It's not even debatable

Prayin' on my downfall don't make you religious, man

Kentucky derby races, my presence in the spot is so abrasive
Box at the Churchill Downs, that's motivation, yeah

Why am I so bold to double back when I've been caught?
Why am I not the superhero I thought?
Or is it perfect as these diamonds I bought?
When did I start texting so dry?
When did I becomе this type of a guy?
When did the tеxts you send me stopped getting replies?
What if things don't turn out how I planned them?
I wanna be more than just a random
What if all these people in my life go Danny Phantom?
I'm sick of down to earth, I wanna throw tantrums
I'm sick of these lil' raps, I wanna make anthems
You feel me? It's either you or it's my schedule, y'all both can't be demanding
I keep you under wraps, you told your mom it's for my branding
I hope she's understanding
What if I don't meet the expectations?
What if I don't reach my destination?
What if I don't live up to the hype despite all my dedication?
Why you think I'm scared to take vacations?
What am I supposed to do?
Assume her accusations aren't true because I'm close to you?
Who should I believe? Is it her? Just 'cause it happens so commonly
The masses never heard your boy rapping so honestly
What makes you think I'd rather have backpackers applauding me?
Why do I feel I need approval from all my skeptics when I fill arenas up with a passionate following?
When that's actually all I need?
But what if they stop caring 'bout me?
What if they stop swearing by me?
What if they stop riding for me how they used to do before I was in front of everybody?
What if they went and found some new kid that got an air about him?
How many people in this town follow my whereabouts? And
What would I say with the barrel aimed at me, staring down it?
I rep the state, but do they care about me in Barren County?You might also likeEmbed
Can't live without you, baby
Live without you
It’s like (Oh, baby)

I been smooth for so long, I'm tryna get rough
Fuck buffin' my nails, dawg, I’m tryna get buff
Fuck shapin' my beard up, I'm likin' the scruff
And fuck the hills 'cause I'm livin' my life in the cut
Can't imagine that I’m gon’ meet my wife in the club
We gon' see though, I feel like she more of a CEO
Or maybe she doin’ volunteer work in Rio
It's not like I need her but I would love to meet her
Another day, another dollar, another phone with another feature
I don't play goalie but I'm my brother’s keeper
Surrounded by family, I'm not with other people
They say I got my pops' demeanor and mother's features
The Garden still Private as ever, the gang thrivin' together
Ya boy's strivin' to be the most dominant ever
The hardest white boy since the one who rapped about vomit and sweaters
And hold the comments 'cause I promise you I'm honestly better than whoever came to your head right then
They ain't cut from the same thread like him
They don't study, doin' work to get ahead like him

I don't care how you feel about it, I do what I wanna
I used to look up to the people that I'm movin' in front of
It's not that crazy anymore, my city used to a come up

My peers get upstaged, the fans are obsessed
My city is upcomin', its people are oppressed
And I'm gon' change things

It can't be the way that I stuck with the same friends
It can't be the swag I got when I walk in, it can't be

It can't be the way I treat people or how I make time to see people
Or make sure that they feel like we equals
It can't be the smile, it can't be the eye contact with these crowds
It can't be my pen, it can't be these verses
That make people feel like I'm talkin' to them
It can't be the homage I've paid
Nights when I could've left the studio early, but I stayed
It can't be the tone of my voice
It can't be the thought I put into every choice
It can't be the Jeep instead of the Rolls-Royce
It can't be the downtime with my boys

It can't be some understanding or branding

Or all the South American fans that meet me at the airport upon landing
It can't be my aunties and grannies

It can't be that I simply make ear candy
Especially when the industry could just plant me
Especially when I didn't grow up on Brandy
Especially when I'm havin' dinner in Frankfort with Andy
It can't be a bit of good karma

We grew up in the same household, for years, we were close
Throwing football in the yard 'til the lights turned on inside the lampposts
Years go by
Somethin' changed when you got to junior high
Started hanging with them guys
Suddenly I meant nothin' to you, you wanted nothin' to do with me
You run with a crew that doesn't include any room for your little brothеr
I was destroyed, but I still loved you
I still wantеd your approval, if I could get it, I'd cherish it
Embarrassing me any chance you got, but I didn't care
Because maybe if I was tough enough to take it, you would love me
Instead of lookin' at me like I'm disgusting
Like I'm nothing, like I'm not the person that you grew up with
I wanna reminisce and ask you if you miss those days
But I'm terrified of broaching the subject
I'm terrified to hear your answer, so I just don't touch it
I don't say nothing

We grew up in the same household, for years, we were close
One on one, I would dominate you in the post
Years pass, but the bond didn't last
And I hate the man above the sink lookin' at me in the glass
Treated you like I hated you, never needed you
Even if I had the same opinion, disagreed with you
Insult after insult, hoping they'd eat at you
Pokin' at your deepest wounds
My baby brother, I don't have an excuse
But I know you remember the way that dad would let loose on me more often and way less you
He criticized and tested me so I'd test you
I got so much wrongdoing to confess to
And you act like it never happened, God bless you
Huh, I'm terrified of broaching the subject
I'm terrified to even ask, so I just don't touch it

They say, "Run"

Put the blame on me, oh
You grew up in my household, under my roof
Raised you with discipline and taught you life's truths
Lashed out at you for things you'd misplace
Reprimanding you in public 'til you're red in the face
Made you feel the weight of every single mistake that you made
My hot temper turned up full throttle
'Cause I needed you to be your little brother's role model
Everything that you do, he just gon' follow
Don't you understand?
It's okay, I understand
'Cause the way I parent you is how my mother did
And the way you treat your little brother's how my older brother did
And now I'm not even my brother's friend
There's so much I would do and say if I could have it done again
But I'm terrified of broaching the subject
I'm terrified to break down, so I just don't touch it
I don't say nothing
They say, "Run"
They say, "Different phases"

No airports and no flights, that's how I wanna live my life
Is that aight?
Ten girlfriends and no wife, that's how I wanna live my life
Is that aight?
No sport cars and no ice
Okay, maybe a little ice, we all got a lil' vice
No selfies, just say, "Hi"
I'm so healthy and alive
4L, we them same guys

Equity for my dogs, only time you see gang signs
I'm looking to change lives, I already changed mine
Our ambition just ain't the same size
You pint-sized motherfuckers watching my paint dry in real time
Telling yourself it just takes time
The time's now, stop waiting for the inspiration
They say it's a flaw being impatient but

No airports and no flights, that's how I wanna live my life
Is that aight?
No retweets and no likes, that's how I wanna live my life

No breakups and no fights

Wonder, oh, why this ever had to be? (Uh-huh)
So many losing hope in those dreams that they—

Walkin' past the homeless in a Rolex
Just got off the stage on the TODAY Show and I basically felt soulless
Years go by and I keep saying I'm gon' use my phone less
But I should just be phone-less
Ignorance is bliss and so is bein' underground
'Cause it was fun when we were known less
Sorry, that's cliche, I know I'm so blessed
But Jason keeps on tellin' me, "Say yes"
And truth be told, I know he knows best
But I don't wanna do no press
I've seen enough of me on this lil' screen
I've become so vain and insecure 'bout everything
I feel all this pressure to live up to what they tell me I'm gon' be
So I isolate myself, you can't help me, it's on me
I'm hidin' any sign of weakness from my guys
I don't want 'em second-guessin' with me
Nemo said to keep my foot on necks 'cause I can't let 'em just forget me

So I'd rather just (Wonder)

And I wonder if my exes are oversharin' 'cause they know a lot about me

Sober and focused, I cannot walk down no deli alleys

Will I see you?
Just talkin' about what I see
It's not opinion-based, it's just, just shit I see (Uh)

The suburbs are filled with ebonics and trap sonics
Frat boys sayin', "No cap, put racks on it"
The dialect got a lil' splash of some black on it
Cap and gowns bought by the money in dad's pockets
White girls squattin' tryna get that ass poppin'
Caught back-talkin' to their mom and dads often
Recitin' rap lyrics 'bout murder and cash profit
Get to feel like a thug but don't have to act on it
Local homicide rates got 'em astonished
Readin' 'bout it on a laptop and pajamas
Microsoft Office to complete their assignments
Never seen the hood, still can't help but have comments
Never had a convo with a kid from that climate
That really has trauma, that really got taught to survive by any means
Fuck bitches, stack commas
Common ground ain't that common

The festivals are filled with Larry Bird jerseys
College students in a hurry to jump to a four-count and say the "N" word
Business interns takin' Molly then Percs
Tramplin' on top of bodies in dirt
Condescendin' suburban kids growin' up to be rap journalists
Writin' urban myths about who they think is the best urban kid
And who the worst is and who's authentic
And what the real hip-hop is and who's all in it
Thrift shoppin' for articles and garments
That feel like they came from a foreign environment
Secondhand Bape, Supreme, and Gallery Dept.
Anything to feel less harmless
Adderall dealers carryin' 'round guns just to make it feel realer
House with white pillars
No rough, just diamonds
The education private, it's all by design and

Twins, but it depends, brothers until somethin' is uncovered
Dawgs until the lifting of the fog
"I always got you," turns into "Well, I never thought you"
Years of camaraderie suddenly disappear
Almost like you never were here
Unconditional love becomes very conditioned when push comes to shove
And all that talk of takin' bullets suddenly feels foolish
Pictures with him turn to ad campaigns, you gotta pull it
Feet held to the fire
We hold accountable the ones we hold dear out of morals, but mainly fear
The choice becomes clear
And years of camaraderie suddenly disappear
Almost like you never were here

And I'm cummin' in my girl like I'm sterile
Totaled my whip, I thought I had the green arrow
I was never meant to be a college applicant
Fuck I look like goin' to college after this
Class clown type that like to holla at the chicks
Friend group solid as it gets
Recordin' in my room with the air conditioner all up in the mix
Did a couple local shows, okay, my following exists
Even if it's fifteen high school chicks
Better than a front row of dicks
Onе day I'm gon' be front row at the Knicks
Wait until the world gеts a load of this (Ooh)

Ambitious nineteen-year-old
I just signed a deal, now my neck sub-zero
Mustache coming in, I really want a beard though
And I really think this might be my year though
Suddenly, I've made some Moncler, my apparel
Playin' dive bars and stoppin' at Cracker Barrel
No security, my brothers gon' step, Will Ferrell
Gettin' high, gettin' drunk, no more straight and narrow for me
Street raps make me ask if this the era for me
Is the playing field fair or is it fairer for me? Whew
A couple karats in my ears enough karats for me
I'm feelin' like the local scene finally cherishing me
Selling out my hometown so my parents can see
Charismatic, naive, young, arrogant teen
Givin' everything I got to the American dream
