So if you gon' be great you gon' have to be on live instrumentation
You feel me? I said it, let's go
Come on
Turn my vocals up
Bring my vocals more to the front
Uh, yeah
This shit is like (Alhamdulillah)
Everything and more, you could actually sing this verse (Thank the Lord)
You gotta remember, no matter where you at, shit could always be worse
Toast for the better, little better

Men lie, women lie, numbers stay stuck
All my opps unified, I wish 'em all luck
Nobody's untouchable, still I never been touchеd (Never)
Ain't no chinks in my armor, not evеn a cuff
I scour the whole game in these Cartier buffs
How the fuck could I complain? My nigga, just look at us
Trips down memory lane, we took the bus (Right)
Now we getting escorts to the plane, we way up
Yesterday's price ain't tomorrow's gotta pay up (Yeah)
Say my stock like a teenage cock, it stays up (Haha)
Knowing that my time is borrowed so I stay prayed up (Uh)
My pockets got octaves I got my weight up (Weight)
Over time I learned to move smarter with this paper (Facts)
'Cause when I had my daughter, yo, that was the wake up (Facts)
529B for my lil' baby (Uh-huh)
Indigo Rain, already six figures in her name, shit crazy
What's the aftermath? God, niggas get shady (Uh-huh)
We gon' see who get the last laugh, they tryna play me
My lifestyle a movie, I'm feeling like Scorsese
Sexy like Swayze, just a bit more wavy (Uh, right)
Catch me in the 'Cedes, dirty dancing with your lady (Right)
She threw it like Brady, really, how could you blame me?
Niggas can't relate so they hate me (Uh-huh)
That's why I keep the Glock by the waist, it's no safety
Lately, gotta stay dangerous 'cause niggas taking aim at us
Paparazzi tryna spot me sloppy on the cameras (Uh-huh)
But I see the bigger pictures, I set the parameters (Right)
And anyone who beg to differ, I smoke 'em like cannabis
You amateurs can't handle us, trust me they ain't finna blow
They just really fans of us, they just think I didn't know
I see them hide behind the critics and the analysts
They get to talking scandalous when they ain't understanding us
But I'm a seasoned veteran (Right), always get the upper hand (Yeah)
Niggas going nowhere fast doing the running man
Joggin' in place with their feet up on the brakes
Tryna expand but stay the same size like rubber bands
In the meantime I rolls like the son of man
Shine like stunna man, looked out for all my pros
Forever my brother them, even if they all became cons
In the end, I would do it all again
No hesitation, they taught me patience
Brought me many revelations that I'd be taking
On this path that I'm blazin', this top position that I'm now embracin'
Could give a fuck about the praising, bitch I know I'm God
I'm half man, half amazing, I defy the odds
Leader of my generation, down to die for the cause
We all fighting the wars, hiding invisible scars (Right)
Legend in the making, these bars was written in the stars
You might also like
Yeah, legend in the making, these bars was written in the stars (Stars)
Legend in the making, these bars was written in the stars (Stars)
God
Grateful for this abundance
That we receive
Every day that we breathe
For new opportunities, new lessons, new blessings, no stress
Yeah
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Right, that's right
Men lie, women lie, numbers stay stuck
Somebody get hurt (Right)
Hmm
Do this all with the ease
Move with godspeed
Cheers my niggas, can y'all hear me out there?
Can y'all hear me out there?
It's alright now
Remember I told y'all, it's alright now
It used to be us all fucked up but nah, it's all right
Yeah, let's go up, congratulations
To my little brother, the Baddest, you know what I'm saying
Yeah, you in your boat now, kid
There will never be another like us, yo
Ayo we come from that dirt, that fucking concrete, you know what I'm saying
New York niggas gotta start acting like New York niggas unless everybody get lost, you know what I'm saying?
Congratulations to the top, never stop
