10 ContributorsEverything Lyrics
When I was younger, I didn't think that I would live
For as long as I've been living it
And I ain't saying I expected to die before that number got high
Just never deliberately considered it, go figure it
Who'da known I'd 'a had so many kids
And the first one's grown n' doesn't answer his phone
The third sun from the stone got me supposing
I'm supposed to focus on keeping this home
Outta foreclosure from all four corners
Feels like I'm riding on an old roller-coaster
The ghost of Christmas sober
Mostly, but I'mma overdose on these four leaf clovers
You can dance like a crash survivor
You can laugh or cry, whatever pacifies you
Funny how time flies
Till my family sets my raft on fire

I don't pretend to be cool, don't pretend to be young
I don't pretend to be smart, don't pretend to be dumb
I don't pretend to be hard, don't pretend to be first
And most of all I don't pretend to be concerned
I don't pretend to be rich, don't pretend to be broke
I don't pretend to be asleep, don't pretend to be woke
I don't pretend to be deep, don't pretend to be clean
I’m everything and everything that's in between
You might also like
They said you only get one life
But I lived at least four lives in the life I'm living in now
And if I could handwrite what they say when I'm gone
It's that he said everything that he could fit in his mouth
I got the coldest shoulders in the solar system
I know because I drove around this whole existence
Resistance to personal growth seems suspicious
What, you really didn't want to go the distance?
I don't stand still, wander off, I’m a drifter
Look at the bigger, digital, panoramic picture
You catch a panic attack from tryna handle the facts
You inanimate on a map
Wait though, I'll never be finished, infinity
Grateful for every opportunity you give to me
And when the time’s right, y’all can lighten up
Like there's too much life to love

I don't pretend to be cool, don't pretend to be young
I don't pretend to be smart, don't pretend to be dumb
I don't pretend to be hard, don't pretend to be first
And most of all I don't pretend to be concerned
I don't pretend to be rich, don't pretend to be broke
I don't pretend to be asleep, don't pretend to be woke
I don't pretend to be deep, don't pretend to be clean
I’m everything and everything that's in betweenEmbed
