Yeah!
Uh, yeah

I got too much swag for these bitches (Got too much, got too much)
That's why I'm 'bout to gas on these bitches (I'm gassin', I'm gassin')
Two hundred on the dash, on these bitches (Hundred on top)
And stack up all this cash on these bitches

Now catch my wave, catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave, now catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave, catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave, now catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave

These hatin' hoes can't take me
Guess the swag just way too much
Mad cause they can't break me
I see a lot, but I don't say too much
These bozos can't fade me
Clown bitches, y'all play too much
I'm Plain Jane on the AP, nigga
Plain Jane on the AP, nigga (Ow)
Time's up, picking a long range
You see us coming, know you in danger (Yeah)
Two Glocks, call 'em Crips and Bloods
So you know I'm riding with both bangers
You fuck boys need to stop frontin'
Know you in the closet like coat hangers
I'm so tired of you fuck boys, I rather play with my fuck toys
I'm gassin', I'm gassin', that Ferrari dick got horse power
I'm gassin', I'm gassin', I rode that dick like a whole hour
Too wavy (Too wavy), bitch, I'm a savage (Bitch, I'm a savage)
I get the bags (I get the bags), you come with baggage (You come with baggage, on it)
You might also like
I got too much swag for these niggas (Got too much, got too much)
That's why I'm 'bout to gas on these niggas (I'm gassin', I'm gassin')
Two hundred on the dash, on these niggas (Hundred on top)
Just stack up all this cash on these niggas

Now catch my wave, catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave, now catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave, catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave, now catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave

You bitches been riding my wave forever
But y'all gon' drown tryna catch this drip (Cowabunga, lil' bitch)

Blue bills like the wave, nigga (Woo)
Too many chains, like a slave, nigga (A slave, nigga)
I might ride a Wraith but a Ghost bigger (Skrrt)
You run up the check, he want six figures (Figures)
My shooter pull up like he taking pictures (Pew-pew-pew)
Gelato my Back, we don't do the Swishers (Do the Swishers)
My bitch is too bad, can't kick it with you (Kick it with you)
My niggas pull up if he want a issue (Woo)
Ayy, I went and got the Audemar bust down (Ice, ice, ice)
Ayy, I fuck her, she bad, I thought she gon' bust down (Ice, ice, ice)
Ooh, the Lamb is blue like a wave, too (Wave to)
I told my bitch to behave, too (Woo)
Kill the pussy, an assassin (Assassin)
Tom Ford with the fashion (Yeah)
The Maybach, not the Aston (Skrrt)
Got the Bentley, I might crash it (Might crash it)
Ain't cuff the bitch, had to pass it (Pass it)
Might dive in, if it splashes (Woo)
Tell her open wide if she nasty
Let her ride the wraith if she classy (Skrrt)
Dropped a hundred at Gucci, my socks nigga
I pull up the top, it gon drop with you (Woo)
I got too much swag for these bitches (Got too much, got too much)
That's why I'm 'bout to gas on these bitches (I'm gassin', I'm gassin')
Two hundred on the dash, on these bitches (Hundred on top)
And stack up all this cash on these bitches

Now catch my wave, catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave, now catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave, catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave, now catch my, catch my, catch my
Now catch my wave

Uh, got too much swag (Got too much swag)
Yeah,, I'm gassin' (I'm gassin')
Uh, yeah, hundred on top (Hundred on top), on these (On these), yeah1Embed
