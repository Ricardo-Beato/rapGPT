4 ContributorsOhh (Showin Her Draws) Lyrics
Bounce
Yeah, we make your crew run run
Bounce the bassline and bend your backside up
Uh, we make your crew run run
Bounce the bassline and bend your backside up

Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib

Girl, why you think it's a hole in your mouth?
And don't try to flip the question, I don't go down south
But I could, show you the bounce
I could show you how to flip that ounce
Tuck it in your purse and cover your blouse
Set up shop, bring the work up in your house
Really show you what this hustle about
That's if you game for it
You in the club, what you came for?
To meet a baller with a car and get all your drinks paid for?
You and your girlfriend with your French tip
And the MAC lipstick, and the black Baby Phat fit
Knowin' that your ass and tits
Is enough to have most niggas blind about the cash they spent
But not Nipsey, you can't knock Nip's hustle
Convince you I love until I got a limp muscle
I flip ruffles until my chips double
Let's hit the Sunset Strip and get in some trouble, come on
You might also like
Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib

As soon as I stepped in, there's nothing fresher
Don't test him, the .4-5 under the 5X, it's a Heckler
The S500'll hit Sunset from zero to 60 in six seconds, quit flexin'
Plus mami in the red's interested
Tongue ring probably mean head's in the question
Back out, open toes, all around sexy
Invite her to the session in the VIP section
Come chill with some real bosses
I'll treat your inner thighs like Florence and Slauson
And stay all off and in between 'em
Cough when you hit the green, huh
Yeah, baby, take a breather (Ahh...)
Then she asked me to dance
With a spectacular, immaculate ass I had to have
The whole, not the half, she touched to the floor then damn
I could see your G-string through your pants
Bounce
Bounce, bounce

Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib

Now the scene switch from the bar to the barrio
Hopped in the car, on the floor, she let it all go
Stabbin' through traffic, she tryna get it crackin'
Say this ain't a habit, she just feelin' the atmos-
Phere, and I ain't killin' the cat yet
Here's an opportunity to do what I do
I, pulled over in the motel parking lot
Forget the room, I got tint and it's dark inside
The big body, you thick, hottie gon', get naughty
After you give head, give body
And don't think about it, just go with the flow
And I'ma act like I don't know you a ho
We could pretend, can't we?
And baby, you my bitch and his lady
I'm the one to chirp when your nigga act shady
When you're feelings is hurt, and you're tryna repay him
Just hit the boy up, I satisfy like crazy
Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib
Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the cribEmbed
