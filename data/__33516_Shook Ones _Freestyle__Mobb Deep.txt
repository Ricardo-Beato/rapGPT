4 ContributorsShook Ones (Freestyle) Lyrics{*opening automatic gunfire courtesy DJ Whoo Kid*}

Yo, as I look to the sky and ask God why he put me here
I know why {*GOD*} to have you cowards shook {*DAMN*} runnin with fear
See that glare in my eyes and my focus clear (uh-huh)
I'm that head coach, benchin you rookies and fake players
Only spit, collector's edition shit
So in a few years it'll be ten times what you spent
When niggas claim they movin that weight, knowin they lyin
My niggas put more drugs on the block than Pfizer
All you niggas on the dick, little secret admirers
Let it out... baby girl, don't be ashamed
When you shorty run the choo-choo train
Have her sippin the deuce-deuce dame, Mobb and the group remains
From the stain I was down for the game
Never went against grain, and never let a bitch borrow my chain
From day one, to the micro-pain
Up inside these veins is dat real nigga, ain't shit changed

Dem niggas shook, cause ain't no such thing as halfway gangstas
Nigga got bumped and ain't look
Niggas shook, cause ain't no such thing as halfway gangstas
Nigga got bumped and ain't look
You might also likeNiggas caught up in the gliss' and the glamour
And then got' sleep with the hammer, let somebody tell you different
And that ass will, die for (?)poor grammar(?)
Fuck around if you wanna, I don't think you coward heart got the stamina

I had (?)Claudette all tense(?), pussy sore for days
I'd rather, beat my dick than go the R. Kelly way
I'd take Felice for nine and a half weeks
Fill it back, pourin Henny on her ass cheeks
I fucked Missy in that Lamborghini
Give Foxy the ecstasy without the pill, see me
I give Alicia Keys quickie while she on tour
Nuttin' but +Gangsta Love+, then I take a flight home
I told Lice' she need to bark at me
So I can, kill her with the collar and the leash
Shit I got plans, I need to get in touch with Stacie Dash
Cause she doesn't have a clue what she missin over here
Scratch Jenny Lo' itch, whenever Ben ain't there
I have Whitney doin lines off my dick, you hear?
Throw Trina big fattie in a wheelchair, fuck dreamin
P and them is doin this for real
{*GOD.. DAMN!*}
{*Mobb Deep album.. comin soon.. pick it up*}Embed
