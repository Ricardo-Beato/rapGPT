7 ContributorsGame Court Lyrics{*funkafied version of "The People's Court" TV show in the background*}

Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts
Of flexing his G's, popping his P's
Dotting his I's and crossing his T's
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts
Of verbal and reckless endangerment
From the million dollar mouthpiece;
And leaving these super-sap suckers
Discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice
The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg
Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game
Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system
Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather
Bring him before 12 G's and open up his files
And you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup
His tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll
And charge from a ho to a henchman about his pension
So all you jerks with them $11 words
Comin out of your $2 mouth
About a multi-million dollar Crip
Who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant
And the tongue of a mack - I said
He's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars
While you suckers is lookin for stripes
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle;
And with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court
To grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissalYou might also likeEmbed
