Chief Keef
Almighty SO, nigga
That DJ Scream Long Live the Hustle coming soon
Salute to the streets and we out of here
(Scream, Scream, Scream)
Let a nigga, gat is gonna bang
(Hoodrich)

I'm fuckin' on these hoes, I'm swaggin' on these hoes
Let a nigga try me, gat is gonna blow
I'm nuttin' on these hoes, I'm splashin' on these hoes
Pull off in that 'Rari draggin' on these hoes
You gotta know me though
My gat is on me though
And I'm still off these blunts from yesterday
Shoot a nigga ass for today and yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday

Bitch wanna fuck me, let's see what my schedule say
She a dumb thotty, I met her yesterday
Got a pound of dope and it's smelling great
I bought that yesterday, yesterday
Had she been gone, I smoke that yesterday
I remember posted on FrontStreet selling that yay
I remember that shit like yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday
You might also like
I'm fuckin' on these hoes, I'm swaggin' on these hoes
Let a nigga try me, gat is gonna blow
I'm nuttin' on these hoes, I'm splashin' on these hoes
Pull off in that 'Rari draggin' on these hoes
You gotta know me though
My gat is on me though
And I'm still off these blunts from yesterday
Shoot a nigga ass for today and yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday4Embed
