16 ContributorsIran Lyrics
Not going to Iran, I'm not going to Iran
Free all the shootas (Yeah)
Never backed down from a man, nigga, I ain't never ran

Never backed down from a man, nigga, I ain't never ran (No, no)
If they book me for the draft, I'm not goin' to Iran (No)
Call me Gucci Peter Pan, I keep flyin' to the bands (Ah)
I do stunts like Jackie Chan, I just touched down in Japan
Since they let me out the can, I keep runnin' up the bands
In the Arab with the sand, I'm so hot, I need a fan (Hot)
I'm so black, can't get no tan (Ah), but I feel like I'm the man
I put diamonds in my bands, ice so cold, can't feel my hands

I can't go to war for nobody
Bitch, I got my own bodies (Yeah)
Everybody got a couple skeletons in the closet (Huh?)
Bodies go to droppin', it's on and poppin'
Me and my niggas went shoppin' for choppas (Pow)
Bought bombs and bazookas, is that what you want? (Pow, pow)
Life of a sniper, pray for my rifle
Pray for my rubber then shootin' my rival
I don't go to sleep, I just drink with my Bible
Thinkin' 'bout bringin' home member survivors
Jump off the tower, money and power
Send me to war, but you nothin' but a coward (Woo)
Children in Broward, students at Howard (Yeah)
Play with my life 'cause you feel you in power (Pussy)
Bum in a blouse that blew out our boss
Got caught then got raped then got for tortured for hours
Think I'ma lick, got a stick in my trouser
Reroll machine, I'm piledrivin' the powder
Flag on your casket then send ya some flowers
Gucci on bucket, I'm tellin' ya now (It's Gucci)
I see my opp, then I'm gunnin' him down
Tell my lawyer to start pointin' him out (Him)
Know what he do, so I keep him around (Him)
Gave him the bag and he didn't say a sound

Never backed down from a man, nigga, I ain't never ran (No)
If they book me for the draft, I'm not going to Iran (No)
Call me Gucci Peter Pan (It's Gucci), I keep flyin' to the bands
I do stunts like Jackie Chan, I just touched down in Japan
Since they let me out the can, I keep runnin' up the bands
In the Arab with the sand, I'm so hot, I need a fan (Hot)
I'm so black, can't get no tan (Ah), but I feel like I'm the man
I put diamonds in my bands, ice so cold, can't feel my hands (So icy)

Real shooter, been reckless (Uh)
Put them boys on my guest list (Woah)
.50 cal on my resume, 1017 on my necklace (Word)
If I slap a mag and put it in the dirt (Yeah)
It's just automatic reflexes (Woo)
Got two bad bitches from Texas (Yeah)
I might slap a ho if she messy (Ah)
I burn them off for my kids
Damn, I'm legit
Pour the Johnson with the shit (Who?)
I break 'em off like a Kit-Kat
Hard as a brick, ain't got no time for no kickback
I'm a motherfuckin' veteran (Yeah)
Obama is my president (Yeah)
Might pull up to your residence
Friendly fire, bitch, I'm negligent
Open fire, I might fine ya (Woo)
Pin the gun, White House might blind ya (Ooh)
Damn, my conduct so disorderly
I check a nigga quarterly (Mmm)
They closin' up the doors for me (Yup)
Might slip, my drip too watery (Oh)
You can blame it on the saucery (Uh)
Eat a pill, bitch, take it orallyEmbed
