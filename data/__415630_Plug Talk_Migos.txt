10 ContributorsPlug Talk Lyrics
I talked to Pedro, Pedro told me talk to Nino
Nino he been jugging he got everything illegal
And Nino he dont know that Pedro told me about the kilos
If i ever catch him slipping bet i take all his burritos
I called Nino up and said I want a half a brick Plug Talk
Walking ATM bitch you can't front me shit
Pick me up on the block at 6 o'clock make then birds flock
What the Fuck there go 12

Ahh shit look at this 
This nigga Nino tried to hit a fucking lick
Thought I was sleep
He think he slick
Had to hit'em with that F&N lil bitty bitch
Look at you now
All on the ground
Where is yo chain where is yo work weight, gimme it now
Looking around watching for 12
Loyalty over royalty my nigga won't tell, gas bags call em Shell
38 revolver catching shells
I'm not leaving no evidence shooting all witnesses even yo manager
Look out for cameras
Nigga trying to catch me slipping flip em like a spatula
I tried to bargain with Nino but Nino he told me I had the monifah
Caught him and his se√±orita
Slipping and took a trip to Argentina
You might also like
I talked to Pedro, Pedro told me talk to Nino
Nino he been jugging he got everything illegal
And Nino he dont know that Pedro told me about the kilos
If i ever catch him slipping bet i take all his burritos
I called Nino up and said I want a half a brick Plug Talk
Walking ATM bitch you can't front me shit
Pick me up on the block at 6 o'clock make then birds flock
What the Fuck there go 12

Pedro hit my phone say he ready
'Bout to touchdown on some p's good gas unleaded
They say the plug in the jungle with machete
And Takeoff with the choppa Offset got the Mac 11
Flippa go get the pound, fuck nigga don't move better lay it down
This a M&M lick lil bitch if we hit this shit we gone be rich
I take a look under the sofa
It's keys to a brand new Rover
Offset went and search that whip, when he came back, he had a 100 bricks
Now that's what I call successful, you niggas is peasants
My bitch is so bad she came from Miss Universe beauty pageant
You talk about shit that I've done
You cannot judge my chromatic
Look at me now, counting my millions in mega mansions
I talked to Pedro, Pedro told me talk to Nino
Nino he been jugging he got everything illegal
And Nino he dont know that Pedro told me about the kilos
If i ever catch him slipping bet i take all his burritos
I called Nino up and said I want a half a brick Plug Talk
Walking ATM bitch you can't front me shit
Pick me up on the block at 6 o'clock make then birds flock
What the Fuck there go 12

See Nino and Rico related
They heard that I'm trapping out vacants
These hundreds the come from the 80's
My money old, my money is ancient
I'm on a mission like a agent
Ducked off in the bushes be patient
Got plugs across the whole nation
Got Haitian, Jamaican and Asian
I'm serving the J's the white, Caucasian
Back in the day selling knicks on the pavement
Extorting you niggas, nigga make a payment
 on the block, send my niggas to take em
This nigga Nino really think that he slick
30 clip left a nigga in a ditch
My nigga Pedro got a young nigga rich
And every story he tell is legit
I talked to Pedro, Pedro told me talk to Nino
Nino he been jugging he got everything illegal
And Nino he dont know that Pedro told me about the kilos
If i ever catch him slipping bet i take all his burritos
I called Nino up and said I want a half a brick Plug Talk
Walking ATM bitch you can't front me shit
Pick me up on the block at 6 o'clock make then birds flock
What the Fuck there go 12
