23 ContributorsIâ€™ll Be There Lyrics
Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh, like), I'll be there (I know you feel me)
For the good times or bad, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh), I'll be there (That's how it's always gon' be)
For the good times or bad (That's how it's always gon' be), I'll be there

Hey, hey
See, I was six years old with a dream
When my moms told me I could do anything
Said she'd be there forever, no matter what's the weather
She'd always have my back even when we weren't together
And I took her for granted, thought I had a plan
This a different generation, I don't think you'd understand
In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family
It wasn't for them, I'd be way closer to insanity
It ain't about the vanity, think about what's important
The reason I was six years old rockin' some Jordans
The reason I had food, my own damn room
A TV in the livin' room to watch my cartoons
I just hope she know I love her, the world's best mother
Yeah, it ain't fair, so I'ma take care of her in her gray hair
When I get rich, I'll have her livin' like she should be
No stress, no worries, you can call me 'cause it's

Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh), I'll be there (I know you feel me)
For the good times or bad (I know you feel me like), I'll be there (Hey, hey)
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there (That's how it's always gon' be)
For the good times or bad (That's how it's always gon' be), I'll be there

Hey, hey, hey
Dear momma, please don't start to cry
You the reason I'm alive, how these years have gone by
You were there when I was on my first bike ride
Ridin' in the street and that delivery truck almost ran right over me
You were at my games when I was sittin' on the bench
And when I skipped school, you lie and say that I was home sick
Had my back before I had my own
I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home
I just want to bring you out on stage to get a standin' ovation
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
If you have your moms, you better treat her right
Call her up, say "Wassup?" before you sleep tonight
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
You may be grown now, but remember bein' a kid
When she fed you in a bib, shit, you were her baby
So find out what she doin' lately
Uh, I wanna tell you, momma

Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there (I know you feel me)
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
(Haha, what's up, Mom? You didn't think I was gonna make a song for you, did you?)
For the good times or bad, I'll be there
Hey, hey, haha
Hey, hey
Some shit ya just gotta say
Mm-hmm, like
