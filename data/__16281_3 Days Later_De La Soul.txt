18 Contributors3 Days Later Lyrics
Smoothed out without the R&B
(Mercy) Come on!
(Mercy) Come on y'all!
(Mercy) Come on!
There's no R&B in this song
Now come along my children, come along
Come along my children, come along
Come along my children, come along
There's no R&B in this song!

Pushed up a dame by the name of Crystal
Her flaunt's to the point just like a missile
A habit with ears kiddin' with gold mags
And since she fancies facial hair she asked my name
(Hey baby what's your name?)
Now ever so fab I said I'm wala
Miss Wild who used to run tough with Koala
She was a winner of my metaphor and she knew that
I said "I'm gonna feed your mouth," she said "You do that"
Now Crystal stops the jeep I think I'm mad fly
She used to have a man wit lots of mad signs
Her strut was guaranteed to make a gay smile
And in bed she had proved to be real agile
I show her to her lounge and I dined her
Then she gave me some digits where I could find her
I licked her like a stamp
Laid and sticked her like a champ
But the (Tramp) gave me burn
I had to go see the doctor

(3 days later) Skeezer, skeezer, skeezer
(3 days later) Skeezer, skeezer, skeezer!

Well it was thirty after nine and I was loungin'
Tokin' on some smoke 'cause I was poundin'
I rang up seven up so we can skip to the mall
Thinkin' a good day to shop, but then we got stopped
A shooter man said "Yo well it's a stick up"
A whole lot of dirt was 'bout to kick up
I had screens in my pocket
And man, tonight's my date
Wit Smokey Sue, now what was I to do?
In my head I'm thinking, 'Should I dodge the bullet?'
'Man this kid is bluffin' you can pull it'
I feared the whole scene
The shooter didn't bluff
Now look at me now
He shot my ass dead
(Yeah)

You shouldn't have..
(I did, so let's get in the van)
You shouldn't have done that
(But I did, so get in the fucking van!)
(I love you Dave)
(I.. I love you Dave)
(I love, I love you Dave)
(I love, I love you Dave)
Skeezer, skeezer, skeezer
Skeezer, skeezer, skeezer
Skeezer, skeezer, skeezer
Skeezer, skeezer, skeezer!Embed
