12 ContributorsMajestic Accolades Lyrics
Yeah, yo, yo
Close your eyes, let the track just play on repeat
All I hear is the genius on this beat
So I cradled the word, street to blame, spice the lingo
Breaker-breaker, one-nine, copy that, Kinkos
Bagged up flamingo, gave her the Mandingo
Met her on the first, amazin', I bounced on cinco
No Coronas, no lime, no Spring Break tequila
Kissed the blue sued coat, a pair of Filas
All white shit, I like that Mike Ty shit, Punch Out
A chick'll suck dick and take her fronts out
No lunch out, no four-elevens
No Sunday at church, takin' flicks with the reverends
I gotta move baby, gotta date with the jeweler
Big shit, son slicked out like The Ruler
Don't test me, bulletproof vest me
I get crunchy, all chunky like a Nestle

Bars, lines, verbal wordplay
Spit, darts, sharp like a DJ
Keep cuttin' 'em, I call 'em the butcher
See your bitch on the street, but I'ma push up
Bars, lines, verbal wordplay
Spit, darts, sharp like a DJ
Keep cuttin' 'em, I call 'em the butcher
See your bitch on the street, but I'ma push up
You might also like
Yo, desperado designer, renaissance
Head of the wave, I freed the slaves
Lickin' shots up in the synagogue
Tramplin' the trendy, what up with all the Walmart models?
Frontin', gettin' over like counterfeit twenties
Switch topics, I crack atoms
And study how to transmutate metals with the talent to transform medallions
I came and lit it up from Spain to Libya
My next video should be shot in 
My  productive, my time managed
By nine planets, I shine equality, God illustrious
Make me wanna pop somethin', no champagne
Two fives on me, that's only if the pockets boney
Cannabis cups, to only spit like I'm sellin' dope
You couldn't visualize it with a dogan telescope
Knowledge I sprinkle it, with fresh trinkets
A man is what he think
If so I guess I be the most successful of my species
Tyrannosaurus mind, my outfit is forest fire
Grind, Gorgeous lord, the scoreboard is more than minds
Hold that chica, my pop-up shopas are lyin' around the corner
So loud like throwback sneakers

Bars, lines, verbal wordplay
Spit, darts, sharp like a DJ
Keep cuttin' 'em, I call 'em the butcher
See your bitch on the street, but I'ma push up
Bars, lines, verbal wordplay
Spit, darts, sharp like a DJ
Keep cuttin' 'em, I call 'em the butcher
See your bitch on the street, but I'ma push up
Clean my guns with God
I look down on niggas who I look up to
Blood pool, backstroke, Lord
 on coupe
Shrooms in the iceberg jean coat
Superdry speedboat, all black like Catwoman
Tryna go up, sniff a coke plant
That forty inch rifle, man
We loud, proud, liquor niggas
I used to rock the fat lace
Caesar with the moon halfway
I'm movin' like the wind breaks
Wu chain when the acid face
The time minds provoke thought, you stuck in a war
Y'all niggas only beefin' with time
A couple wine bottles was enough
Impressed your bitch, had a fuckin'  on her tits
She squirt like the star split
We all hit, and back flipped
Now that pussy like a mosh pit
Huh, Wolves jumpin' like Chris Bosh
Jumper in the fourth
You dealin' with the wave, love
Batcave killer, I'm writin' letters to silk, huh
Gandhi carpets you bleed on like milk
From Hempstead to killer hill
