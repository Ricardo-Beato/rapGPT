33 ContributorsSilent Night Lyrics
The force will be with you....always

She left and broke my heart like twice
(twice twice twice twice)
Now everything is dark and it's fucking up my life
(life life life)
And I just wanna make it right
(right right right)
But I won't make it through the night
(night night night)

Cause suicide is painless, so I'm about to aim this
Weapon of steel right to my brain and just bang it
32 in the clip but one is in the chamber
Click clack, hope it freeze me from my anger
If you don't plan on staying, I'm saying
I'm better off just laying
Six feet deep underneath the fucking pavement
At least you work the grave-shift for treating me like ape shit
I even wrote you love songs but money's was your language
Just look at all the damage that you did
Chuckin' up the deuces to the suicidal vital motherfucking nuisance
I knew it, and now I'm about to lose it
Blood splatter on the wall recognize what you did
You might also like
She left and broke my heart like twice
(twice twice twice twice)
Now everything is dark and it's fucking up my life
(life life life)
And I just wanna make it right
(right right right)
But I won't make it through the night
(night night night)

I mean I just don't understand
Thought I was the better man
And we had a fucking plan just to make it all work out
Turned out, you not the one for me and it wasn't meant to be
But I still can't see, need to face reality
Cause your everything i wanted, a goddess
I said that on your behalf just trying to be modest
To be honest, but if I can't have you nobody can
Let me see you with another man and it's done for him
Call me fucking crazy but baby
How you gon' play me? I mean, have you seen me lately?
Went from elated to a swayze, ghostin'
Taking my life the only escape from your potion

She left and broke my heart like twice
(twice twice twice twice)
Now everything is dark and it's fucking up my life
(life life life)
And I just wanna make it right
(right right right)
But I won't make it through the night
(night night night)
Cause homicide is painful, bitch you should be thankful
I turned that fucking anal licking nigga into an angel
Fuck you mad at me for? Because I put the C4 in the car
And blew that motherfucker up, swerving off the Detour
Well hee haw, boo hoo; Now it's just we two
What you propose that we do?
(You hate me bitch?) Well me too
You turned me to a reject, dejected
But that presidental keeps me free stressing, I should be elected
I bet I'll win but I'm lost without you
Me minus her wonder what I'd amount to
Perhaps the suicidal bridal nigga I am currently
She ain't with my loving, she just only wanted currency

She left and broke my heart like twice
(twice twice twice twice)
Now everything is dark and it's fucking up my life
(life life life)
And I just wanna make it right
(right right right)
But I won't make it through the night
(night night night)9Embed
