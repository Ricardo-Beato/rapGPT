5 ContributorsDon’t Be Commin’ (In My Face) Lyrics
VA, haha, yeah, New York (Uh-huh), Atlanta (Uh-huh), DC (Uh-huh)
LA  (Uh-huh), New Jersey (Uh-huh), Philly (Uh-huh)
Say what  (Uh-huh)
Say what  (Uh-huh)

You'll never know a good thing 'til I'm gone, oh
And you'll be spending many, many nights home alone
You won't be seeing me around your way, no, no
And if you don't get it together, baby, I can't stay

Don't be comin' in my face tryna tell me you love me (No, no)
Shoulda thought once or twice (Uh-huh), sacrifice to make it right (Oh-oh)
It's the thing that you do, make me not love you
So just wait and you'll see, get no other love like me

You'll never know I'm for real until I leave (Uh-huh)
And when I pack up my clothes, don't be calling me
You won't be seeing me anymore, no no
'Cause when I'm long, long gone, I won't be back in this door

Don't be comin' in my face tryna tell me you love me
Shoulda thought once or twice (Oh-oh), sacrifice to make it right
It's the thing that you do (Yeah), make me not love you
So just wait and you'll see (Say what?), get no other love like me
You might also like
To my East side people to my West side
To all my bitches who sat home crying
Over these niggas and over these fellas
Shake 'em off like Jello, uh-huh
To the East side people to my West side
To all my bitches who sat home crying
Over these niggas and over these fellas
Shake 'em off like Jello, uh-huh

Don't be comin' in my face tryna tell me you love me
Shoulda thought once or twice, sacrifice to make it right
It's the thing that you do, make me not love you
So just wait and you'll see, get no other love like me

I used to stick closer to your side then a beeper
'Til you smoked that cheaper reefer
Now you loony as fita, shut up
Don't say a word, yep, I got the word
Yeah, I heard it from a little bird (Uh-huh)
Now I'm out the door about four-four
You don't know? Get your bags and your things, take the door
Don't take the shit no more
When you leave, you can leave out the back door, oh, oh, oh, oh (Uh-huh)
Motherfucker, huh
Stupid niggas (Yeah)
Always think they can play somebody
Y'all know who y'all are (Aha)
Tryna run 'bout three and four, five women at one time
Then you wanna come back all in our faces
And tellin' me how much you love me and all that bullshit
Whatever man, fuck you
Alright, I'm outEmbed
