10 ContributorsOrdinary Gangsta Lyrics
Said I'm ridin' 'round town with my top let down
And my seat laid back and my strap cocked back
I'm a Gangsta, I'm not your ordinary gangsta
Said I'm ridin' 'round town with my top let down
And my seat laid back and my strap cocked back
I'm a Gangsta, I'm not your ordinary gangsta

I'm Smokin' Kush (smokin kush)
In front the police ( in front the popo)
I gives a fuck about the police
I'm a motherfuckin' OG (imma og)
I'm sellin' dope (sellin dope)
I'm sellin' dope right on front street
They call it 21 Jump street
They call it 21 jump street, a lot of niggas wanna jump me
But they ain't got the nuts to do it
If you a Gangsta then prove it
Fuck Nigga making music
I got a Motherfuckin uzi (mutherfuckin Chopper)
Your girl choosey susey (she choosing on Gucci)
I know her freinds wanna do me(know they wanna fuck)
I had a threesome with the groupies

Said I'm ridin' 'round town with my top let down
And my seat laid back and my strap cocked back
I'm a Gangsta, I'm not your ordinary gangsta
Said I'm ridin' 'round town with my top let down
And my seat laid back and my strap cocked back
I'm a Gangsta, I'm not your ordinary gangsta
You might also like
California rari' all red top down
Red 4g autos when I'm flexin' through your town
Hatin' ass Niggas need to sit they ass down
Mink coats I got cheap prices on the pound
So you don't got no juggs don't you come around me
A basic ordinary you just ordinary
It's some gangstas in your city when brick squad in your town
If a nigga get wrong we'll lay his ass down
Four Four been to every city on the map
I can't go to nobody city without no strap
When the bank close they got my money I make 'em open it back
Alot of plug mad at my prices fuckin' up the trap

Said I'm ridin' 'round town with my top let down
And my seat laid back and my strap cocked back
I'm a Gangsta, I'm not your ordinary gangsta
Said I'm ridin' 'round town with my top let down
And my seat laid back and my strap cocked back
I'm a Gangsta, I'm not your ordinary gangsta

And I'm back right everybody know I'm straight nigga I'm a gangsta
That truck all black right riding through the middle of the A twistin out famous
Ok now Rich Homie my clan Bitch Me and Gucci handlin' buisness
Invested 100,000 in one hand bitch mix through the flix and its ridicululous
I heard them bitch niggas getting offended and that money coming by the plenty
So Fuck nigga who don't hear me im a make sure you feel it ho, that right too
Said I'm ridin' 'round town with my top let down
And my seat laid back and my strap cocked back
I'm a Gangsta, I'm not your ordinary gangsta
Said I'm ridin' 'round town with my top let down
And my seat laid back and my strap cocked back
I'm a Gangsta, I'm not your ordinary gangstaEmbed
