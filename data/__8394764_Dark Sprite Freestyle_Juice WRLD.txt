3 ContributorsDark Sprite Freestyle Lyrics
Tonight's gonna be a good night
.40 on me like I'm Suge Knight
Poppin' Xannies in the moonlight
Baby girl let the moon drive (That's good)
I just made my girl some dark sprite (Literally)
She said it's good, right? (Literally)
But it ain't good, right?
This shit gotta be dark bright
Purple in the double cup
I sip a couple 16's I ain't had enough
I spit a couple 16's, and it's finna cost
Hundred K for a feature, get the money off (Mm)
All I know is get the cash I'm gon' get it all, yeah
Baddie with her ass, she gon' give me all
Codeine, never sick
I don't nevеr cough
Codeine over liq', Fuck a Smirnoff
Hеy, all my niggas killers like they Adolf
Yeah, leave the dead nigga in the graveyard
Yeah, I can't see these niggas like they Ray Charles
Yeah, leave 'em OD'd that's what I'm on
Yeah, I look up the legends like Big Smalls and Tupac, Nas all them niggas, aw
But I'm a young nigga balling like Ming Yao
Dunkin' on a nigga like I'm six feet tall
Acappella with the flow I don't gotta write it
I see what I say before I say it, feel like a psychicYou might also likeEmbed
