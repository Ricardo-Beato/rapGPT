28 ContributorsMoments in Time Lyrics
Do you feel good?
Baby, do you feel good?
Do I make you feel good?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Moments through the night, I turn to your side
Rub my index finger through your thighs
All of my life, I been feinding for a wife
I don't wanna share
Right hand gripped with the bun of hair
Waking up without you is such a scare
Gripping on your hips while you hold the chair
At around 3, it's just not fair
Baby, let's live in slow mo
I don't wanna share
Baby, let's live in slow mo
Baby, let's live in slow mo
I don't wanna share
I don't wanna share

We at a peak
Oh, you my favorite freak
Every day, every single week
It's my job to make your knees weak
Shh, I repeat
I am not ashamed
I will not forget your name
I stood out in the rain
I feel your pain
I give you everything
I, I
The deeper I go, you feel in your toes
You know where home is (You know where home is)
Just focus (Just focus)
Are you for this? (Are you for this?)
Are you wasting my time?
Please don't do that
Oh no, noYou might also likeEmbed
