24 ContributorsNo Tears Lyrics
Yeah, put your lighters up
Where the love at
Ear Drummers
I forgot niggas like you don't love back
It's like y'all niggas dead out here
Mike-WiLL Made It

You know I come through on some boss shit everytime I come through
I'm from the place where don't nobody make it, but you know they want to
You wanna see a nigga fucked in the game, nigga, don't you?
But I refuse to cry or shed a tear, that's the shit we go trough

This is what it sounds like, when you open your soul
Tell the realest story that was ever told
Riding dirty in the West End, yeah, so ambitious
Them chicken plates at Chanterelles was delicious
Po-po closing that BP, the block storage
If I can get them things back down South, I'll make a fortune
Fucked around and caught  dawg with a nine, now it's a wrap
Gotta find a new game to conquer, I'm thinking rap
And it's a whole new game, new players, I gotta grind
Put them diamonds in my name and my chain, I gotta shine
Stunting everything'll real when we do break bread with 'em
Swear it ain't been the same since the day the FEDs hit 'em
And that's when I traded the scale for the microphone
Made a few calls, got rid of my last four zones
And just like that, welcome back, my nigga home
Won't look me in the eyes, something different, what could be wrong?
You might also like
I can never let a tear fall down my face
(I can never let a tear fall down my face)
For the niggas like you who ain't with me today
(For the niggas like you who ain't with me today)
I've been real from the beginning
I can never let a tear fall down my face
(I can never let a tear fall down my face)
I'm losing all my friends like every single day
(I'm losing all my friends like every single day)
I think I've been too, too real from the beginning
(I think I've been too, too real from the beginning)
They say you lose all your friends when you finally start winning
Hey, where the love at?

I guess this is what it feels like, when you're royalty, holmes
And you wake up and the loyalty's gone
Them short sentence niggas come on yeah, feel in the way
Same niggas that were hating back then, still in the way
I swear these niggas think my life is just bitches and Champagne
Iced out, Audemar, just to go with the campaign
Every night Rolls Royce's doing their damn thing
If there was ever a reason to wear all them damn chains
And why you keep a cup in your hand? To numb the pain
Niggas see you on something different, these niggas changed
And I ain't one for dry snitching, won't call no name
So really at the end of the day I can't complain
Hive niggas gon' be happy with you and be happy for you
If them niggas scheming on ya demise then they ain't for ya
I'm like not you too, my nigga, I could've died
If I had a weak bone in my body I would've cried
I can never let a tear fall down my face
(I can never let a tear fall down my face)
For the niggas like you who ain't with me today
(For the niggas like you who ain't with me today)
I've been real from the beginning
I can never let a tear fall down my face
(I can never let a tear fall down my face)
I'm losing all my friends like every single day
(I'm losing all my friends like every single day)
I think I've been too, too real from the beginning
(I think I've been too, too real from the beginning)
They say you lose all your friends when you finally start winning
Hey, where the love at?


I remember them days where I thought I couldn't live without you
(Aye, where the love at?)
Now I'm driving in a coupe and I can't even think about you
(Aye, where the love at?)
We was counting millions on the living room floor
I forgot, niggas like you don't love back
And I was with you when we kicked in our own first door
