45 ContributorsFetti Lyrics
Freebandz Sunny in this motherfucker
Original Black Migo Gang
(808 Mafia)
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm tryna dodge another case
Order Ace of Spades by the case
Tell 'em shoot the nigga in his face
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I hear the styrofoams are goin' crazy
I got my chains on, they like lasers
Now you gon' make me go and get the carbine
And I was tacky back when I was starvin'
And I ain't lookin' back with these fortunes
I'm pickin' up hella endorsements
My chain is yellow on yellow
My bitch, she yellow on yellow
In the kitchen remixin' this yola
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow

Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti

'Fetti, 'fetti, 'fetti, 'fetti
Reincarnated Makaveli
Audemars Piguet a presi' (Presi')
Presidential with a bezzy (Bezzy)
And I'm sharper than machete (Petty)
I done made it, now I'm greedy (Greedy)
Takin' the codeine, it's ready (Ready)
I shake it up in a Tahiti ('Hiti)
Two hundred somethin' sittin' on the dash (Dash)
The Bentley Spur makin' 'em crash (Crash)
Sippin' codeine, rollin' grass (Grass)
I don't agree what you're doin' (Doin')
I don't agree who you're screwin' (Screwin')
I fucked around, opened a traphouse in Europe
I fucked around, throwed away all of my problems
They ran out of singles, I'm throwin' up hundreds (Freebandz)

Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm tryna dodge another case
Order Ace of Spades by the case
Tell 'em shoot the nigga in his face
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I hear the styrofoams are goin' crazy
I got my chains on, they like lasers
Now you gon' make me go and get the carbine
And I was tacky back when I was starvin'
And I ain't lookin' back with these fortunes
I'm pickin' up hella endorsements
My chain is yellow on yellow
My bitch, she yellow on yellow
In the kitchen remixin' this yola
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti

Tell me you came with the wax (Wax)
Man, I'm about flippin' some stacks (Racks)
Man, I'm about flippin' some racks (Stacks, yeah)
I had to flip me some racks (Woo, woo)
You can treasure and honor this (Future)
I'm the one breakin' my promises (Sorry)
I started losin' my conscience (Barry)
We creepin' like Jeepers Creepers
That codeine is sleepy, sleepy (Sleepy)
That codeine, it got 'em so sleepy (Young Metro)
I'm plannin' on savin' my soul (Metro)
Ain't fuckin' 'round, savin' no hoes (Hoes)
I burn up a zip, that's an O (Burn up a zip, that's an O)
You can smell all this weed on my clothes (Smell all the weed on my clothes)
Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm tryna dodge another case
Order Ace of Spades by the case
Tell 'em shoot the nigga in his face
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I hear the styrofoams are goin' crazy
I got my chains on, they like lasers
Now you gon' make me go and get the carbine
And I was tacky back when I was starvin'
And I ain't lookin' back with these fortunes
