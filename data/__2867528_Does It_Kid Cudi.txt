76 ContributorsDoes It Lyrics
You can depend on Cud Life to kill it
Having guillotine dreams with my enemies, oh
See 'em in the ditch, see 'em out, hit the exit
Can't stand to hear a bitch nigga mouth
I took a hook in the road to get in the mode, geronimo
Get in my jeans, white tee, and clean fitted
Hoes know me 'round the map, I can't hide the old summers
Hit the fuse and I lit it, the rest unfolds
Tell me how the fuck does he does it?
Levels unreachable, can't pin him to a mold
It's like a nigga been here before
Shit is a bore, my thoughts soar in the AM
Slay them like a machine round the clock
With the 12 gauge aim, telling Satan to fuck off
Hated the hand I was given
Tossed that shit back, like God must be kidding
And not for a nigga like me, not for the family
Not with a similar plans I just dumped
And I made me some choices, heard voices follow
No, can't stop a man with passion
These hoes don't distract a god, I am no clown
Grown man laying the stones all around in my throne
My kingdom, throwing from space
Fuck off expression on face, this is the case
I'm in place to be great, hmm
No fakes, raising the stakes
I'm in place to be great, hmm, hmm, hmm
You might also like
Uh, doing music, TV and movies
Sitting on the floors we ain't heard of
And the media wanna act like I ain't out here (I'm out here)
Running laps around these hoes (for years)
Running the game with no cheat codes (uh)
Unfuckwittable with two T's nigga, who else but Cud?
Give a motherfuck

I does it, I, I, I does it and, I does it, yeah
I, I, I does it yeah, I, I does it yeah, oh, oh, oh
Nigga, I does it, yeah, oh, I, nigga, I does it, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, I does it, yeah, I does it, yeah, oh, oh

Thought the kid dough cause I'm in a oven often
The kush in the lungs, a bushel of nugs
Awaken the dope, but they never dissolve the coke
Got the homies in the hood and they wanna rage on
Fast lane, pushing to the limit
Uh, enjoy the spoils, but don't bask in it
But see, I really wanna get me a farm and grow crop
Live with some girls who love me and this cock
The more I grow, the more I double in powers
Non-ambitious for cowards, trippy go for toe
Won't be a drone clone, half-hearted
Sheep in the herd, brainwashed at what cost
I'm a raise some hell, you know this
And if I piss people off along the way, bonus
Cause these niggas are stale chips
All around thinking they're fresh with the stale shit
And corny bitches need corny niggas, that's well fit
God has a plan for everybody but I'm it, Chosen
Scotty 'bout to even the mood, get lost in the tune
Forget it all, take flight my doves
Say we are the, we are the knights in the world
Listen baby can you see in the club, we gettin' bent up
The sun up, egg, cheese, sunny-side up
I'm waiting for you, and taking the cue
Having a drink, let's make it a few
Here's to you, you, you, and you
Salute, hmmm, I bid you adieu
Salute
Uh, doing music, TV and movies
Sitting on the floors we ain't heard of
Uh, and the media wanna act like I ain't out here (I'm out here)
Running laps around these hoes
Winning the game, no cheat codes
Unfuckwittable with two T's nigga, who else but Cud?
Give a motherfuck

I does it, I, I, I does it and, I does it yeah
I, I, I does it yeah, I, I does it yeah, oh, oh, oh
Nigga, I does it yeah, oh, I, nigga I does it yeah
Oh, oh, oh, I does it yeah, I does it yeah, oh, oh13Embed
