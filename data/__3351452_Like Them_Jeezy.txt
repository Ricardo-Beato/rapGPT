11 ContributorsLike Them Lyrics
Yeah
This is dedicated to them
Them solid bitches out there, you know
Dedicated to the real ones
Uh
Talk to em homie
Yeah

I could ride for you baby
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
Know the limit is the sky for you, baby
You know what this shit is
Come slide with me, baby
Yeah yeah
You nothing like them, no
I need a bitch like you
Like them, no
Nothing like them
So I won't fuck with bitches like them
Nothing like them
So I won't fuck with bitches like them
Oh no

Shorty's a rider, she know I'm a roller
Lend me ya ear baby, just let me hold ya
I hustle, I got plenty ambition, what's not to love?
I got her if she need anythin', yeah that's my thug
'Cause she loyal, she all about loyalty
Rollie on that wrist, now she lookin' like royalty
Yeah, we kick back, sippin' Avion in the glass
Plus she got 'em rolled up, smack that ass, hit the gas
As I exhale, she sittin' behind me, rubbin' my back
Got me goin' out like Pookie or somethin', that pussy crack
Meanwhile I'm kicked back, visualizin' them stacks
Said, "My nigga, just do what you do, I got ya back"
You might also like
I could ride for you, baby
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
Know the limit is the sky for you, baby
Come slide with me, baby
You nothing like them, no
I need a bitch like you
Like them, no
So I won't fuck with bitches like them
Nothing like them
Nothing like them
It's that rich nigga shit
Oh no

Maybach Music
Fendi heels, my Atlanta bitch out in Windy Hill
She too real, left her in the room with like 20 mil
When she cared, back in Miami when we did the deal
In the middle of war, fuck it I'ma let em live
Get this money 'fore they sentence me to a 100 years
Fuck her slow, might tell her where some of the money hid
Fell in love, must be, told her she the one I need
Only rule, you roll with me that mean you rollin' weed
Settle down, 20 thousand to go and get a gown
Wear the crown, menage trois, it's whatever now
Chanel shoes, Chanel bag, Chanel dress
Call her Chanel, she exhale only the best (I'm the biggest, Boss)
I could ride for you baby
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
Know the limit is the sky for you, baby
Maybach Music
Come slide with me, baby
My nigga Young
You nothing like them, no
I need a bitch like you
Like them, no
So I won't fuck with bitches like them
Nothing like them
Nothing like them
Oh no

I feel them other broads be doin' too much, let's keep it real
And I ain't tryin' to hear all that, call Dr. Phil
Best believe that I ain't got no time for these lame hoes
You know how the game goes, in the club in her girl clothes
Tryin' tell me baby that you can't afford your heels
Yet you tryin' to push up on a nigga worth these mils
And she help with the stove, damn right, she a chef
I ain't playin' no games, when she out need a ref
When she in the bedroom, shit she get nasty and shit
When it's time to hit the streets, she get classy and shit
Sendin' pictures to my phone, see I'm like, "What the hell?"
Love ain't always A1, swear to God, it never fails
I need a
I need a bitch like you
So I won't fuck with bitches like them

I could ride for you, baby
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
Know the limit is the sky for you, baby
Come slide with me, baby
You nothing like them, no
I need a bitch like you, yeah
Like them, no
So I won't fuck with bitches like them
Nothing like them
Nothing like them
Oh no
It's that shit that you do
Yeah, uh uh
That's why I don't fuck with bitches like themEmbed
