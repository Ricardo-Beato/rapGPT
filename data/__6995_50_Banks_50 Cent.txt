13 Contributors50/Banks Lyrics
Uh, yeah, G-Unit, uh, yeah 50 Cent, uh, yo

Timbaland sounds so good, but I might not be ready
I don't know
If I spend a 100 grand on the beat, then we done bumped already
Now here we go

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (Pee Wee Herman)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (Niggas look down to Pee Wee Herman)

50, lefty, no gun in my right palm
Bronx niggas love me, like they think I'm Mysonne (Woo)
These rap niggas not like me, they too soft (Yeah)
Get shot down, I get up, shakin' shit off
You know white collar crooks, do jokes on lap tops (Uh huh)
Real niggas snatch Glocks, and run up in spots
We can talk Trump talk, real estate, stocks, and bonds
Or gangsta shit, my Rugers and Glocks in palm (Uh huh)
Danger, ring the alarm, kiss the ring of the Don
I conquer like Genghis Kahn, I said song in this song (God damn)
I won't hesitate to put a knife or a slug in you
And watch you bleed out, that little bit of thug in you
You don't want to bump heads with me, and get hit up
You, you ain't got what it takes to fuckin' get up
Holla niggas names on records, that shit is played out
But holla mine in your next line and get laid out
You might also like
My jewels look so good, and my chain is so heavy
I don't know
If I should stunt for these hoes again, cause I did that already
Now here we go

(Lloyd Banks) I don't give a fuck if your favorite rapper dies, to me that's my spot
I'll celebrate his burial and eat at IHOP (Yeah)
I've been hungry since a little nigga weed in my high top (Woo)
Face burgundy red, in need of a eye drop (Uh huh)
I had the black Delta Force, blue in the front
Back when Jordan was flyin', and Ewing could dunk
Of course, you can fuck now, you was buyin' the shrimp then
Me on the other hand, Don Bishop and Pimp King (G-Unit)
I'm runnin' from a digital Munster
I do this for the hood and every kid in a dumpster
My name is poppin', and I ain't been at it long
My neck's sixteen and made Flex drop a Bin Laden bomb (G-Unit)
I'm the best thing to happen to hip hop
Since (uh huh) "Life After Death" and that 2Pac shit drop
I'm even good to a white boy with a slick top
Stuck up in the mountains with a gun and a rich pop
Who wear masterpieces? Our watch don't tick tock
I'm cleanin' out my six shot, watchin' the Knicks flop
Damn near the whole day I'm passin' the green
That's how my bedroom, look like the World Trade after the scene (Smokin')
Breaking news, hijack, bus passenger scream (Yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare, I crush half of your team
To me your line up is pussy, three wet Pampers
The uzi will have you shakin' like them G-Dep dancers (Damn, dude)
Doo, doo, doo
What the fuck happen to the rest of the beat, man?
