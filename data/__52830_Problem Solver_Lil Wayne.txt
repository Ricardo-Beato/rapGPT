He dead and gone, no more problems I'm the problem solver
Click click pow problem solved!

Gun on me faithfully nina how I adore you
How I hold you from the side when I control you
I won't miss
Don't slip then I get closer and I can't miss
Stand over him like a pianist with no bench
I hold the key like Mariah when I fire
No lip all 4 fifth
Throw clip cutthroat niggas I know them
Throw them somethin to wipe out ya hold shit
Notice me never I'm all black
Masked up Jason
Part 11 I'm more scarier terror
I look fear in the eyes like a mirror I don't fear him(Uh Huhn)
I share 'em with the rest of the pallbearers, Barry him
Very low I'm kerosene gasoline
It's asinine to fuck with me
Come and see
That's like running into a fucking tree
Climb up mother fucker I'll leave you hung for weeks yea(Stupid)
You might also likeGet 'Em


I run with niggas consider themselves gorillas
I feed them banana clips
Head stomachs and hips
Quick tip quit sippin' that Patron
That shit'll get you flipped like a baton
In two arms
Who calm, I'm calm, you calm?
Tick tick make a nigga drop the bomb
Weed lit yea I'm from Hollygrove Vietnam
Military status captain gone
Yeah ask them all they'll tell ya
You fuck wit the boy and they'll smell ya from anywhere
Big Bleezy I'm on like the mayor
When it's beef I feel like Lil' Jon nigga YEAH
Scare you right out your draws
Act up and the AK 47 knock ya right out ya truck(Get Up)
Back up turn ya lights out your done
5-4-3-2-1..yourself
That mean GO N-E..GONE...Get 'Em!

Gillie man I don't think you niggas should really fuck with me
The gun off me urgently workin' and twerkin' it perfectly
Circle the block I'm like fuck it I'm bustin 'em I'm cussin' 'em
Like fuck 'em I buck 'em I buck 'em I buck 'em
Buck 'em til it's empty
Get at me spit at me you make this a shootout nigga
I hit you, you missed me I left and you missin' That is really good
I waitin' I'm sittin I'm patient I'm loadin' I'm clickin
I'm spittin' I'm spittin I'm spittin I'm spittin
Till it's clickin' and clickin'
I ain't trippin' I'm givin' them to the river
Callin' them shark dinner
They human tuna
Weezy Baby, Lex Luger, Freddy Kreuger
Do Ya (Bitch)
Who you playin' with
With that back and forth shit
Nigga I ain't sayin' shit
Bitch I clap quick
You ain't nothing but a sandwich
To a man bitch

Eat you niggas lunch..eat you niggas for lunch...Get 'Em!
