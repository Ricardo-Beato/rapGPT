14 ContributorsMoney Do Lyrics
I don't have an ego, but my money do, money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you its Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do ,my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do,my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do,my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, waoh

Call that ballin', I call that hopscotch
He gettin' a little cash, but he ain't got what I got
Twenties in my bankroll, 150 on my watch
Like Dikembe Mutombo, get a lot of them big blocks
Gucci brought them bands out
You brought a lil' cash out
Our sets, they poke out
Interior smoked out
Homie you a peon
I'm ridin' European
Emmitt Smith on the back tire
But the front tire's a Deion
Get this shit for the 17
Sell shit for the Keyshawn
My wrist colder than freon
That bullshit, I be on
In the club, I'm wasted
Better yet, I'm faded
Got home, don't know how I made it
But this shit all gravy
You might also like
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you its Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, waoh

When I'm pickin' up weight I need a personal trainer
My money got its own fuckin' personal trainer
I'm in the club throwin' hundons
Smokin' out an onion
Garlic bread, inside paint like lasagna
Gucci be fresh like first day of school (Gucci!)
Diamonds drippin' wet, it's like they pushed me in the pool
Makin' paper airplanes out of hundreds, what I do
Passin' Ace of Spades like it's bottled water to the crew
Brick Squad, nigga!
Excuse me
Let me introduce myself, they call me Gucci
And all my kicks, they be the flyest, call me Bruce Lee
And I don't talk, my money do the talkin' usually
I'm super chillin', but my money be the rudest
I don't have an ego, but my money do ,my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, Its Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, waoh it Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, its Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you , waoh its GucciEmbed
