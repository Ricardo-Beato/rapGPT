You might also like
You think I'm not grantin' wishes
You think I'm not hungry and ambitious
You think them xans did it
You think them molly and percocet did it
Don't you be mad silly?
Don't you be one of the ones who would laugh at me?
I'll load it up on you fire like a gun
I'll spit the brrrr cash at you
You think you ridin' in foreigns right now
I'ma throw the whole dash at you
Mink coats, we can walk on 'em like red carpets
Walk on 'em if you choose to
You can walk on it like Jimmy Choo's
You can walk on it
I put a mink coat over you, under you
Gon' head, girl, walk on it
This for the ones tried to step on the name
Like you was a valedictorian
Like you wasn't gon' be queen queen
Like you wasn't gon' be bling-blingin'
Don't get caught up in your ring finger
We gon' spend this shit until your fingers wrinkled
I ordered diamonds up without blinkin'
Without thinkin'
You can walk on minks, baby (Woo)
You can walk on minks (Woo)
You can walk on minks, baby (Woo)
You can walk on minks now (Tell yah the truth)
You can walk on minks, baby (Tell yah)
You can walk on minks now (Lemme tell yah)
You can walk on minks, baby (Woo)
You can walk on minks now (Look at us)
You can walk on minks (Woo)
You can walk on minks (Woo)
You can walk on minks (Woo)
You can walk on minks (Tell yah the truth)
You can walk on minks, baby (Told yah)
You can walk on minks now
We can walk on minks, baby (Woo)
You can walk on minks now (Ya)
You can walk on minks

Such a ballerific hot topic
Manolo Blahnik packed inside the closet
Get the llama, put it in the blender
This is for the winners, this is for the sinners
This is for the Dolce, this is for the Gucci
This is for the Rollie, this is for the Prada
This is for the dollars, this is for the guala
This is for the bad bitches, gotta holla
Step inside it if it's mink inside it
If it's fur inside it, you can really buy it
You killin' bitches in them Christian Loubs
Every time you step out, there's a homicide
Winin', dinin' in the finest fabrics
Your ears and neck and wrist, a bunch of karats
No comparison, it's no comparin'
You dryin' off in a mink towel
Wash it down, baby, wipe it down
This money got your quieter than a mouse
Boss bitch when they see you out
You're a boss bitch when they see you out
You trip and fall, you gon' fall on a mink
$20,000 cash, under your feet
You can't be mistreated
You gotta be greeted with superstar treatment
You can walk on minks, baby (Woo)
You can walk on minks (Woo)
You can walk on minks, baby (Woo)
You can walk on minks now (Tell yah the truth)
You can walk on minks, baby (Tell yah)
You can walk on minks now (Lemme tell yah)
You can walk on minks, baby (Woo)
You can walk on minks now
You can walk on minks (Woo)
You can walk on minks (Woo)
You can walk on minks (Woo)
You can walk on minks (Tell yah the truth)
You can walk on minks, baby (Told yah)
You can walk on minks now
We can walk on minks, baby (Woo)
You can walk on minks now
You can walk on minks3Embed
