6 ContributorsThrow It Lyrics
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait (HitKidd, what it do, man?)

Wait a minute, tell 'em strippers, "Hold fast"
Some bitches from out of town 'bout to show they whole ass
It's a go, it's a go, it's a go, it's a go
It's a throw, it's a throw, it's a throw, it's a throw (It's a throw)
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw that ass, yeah
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw that ass, yeah

It's them North Memphis ratchet-ass bitches for me
It's them H-Town hot girl bitches for me
It's them A-Town city girl bitches for me
It's them Chi-Town pretty girl bitches for me
It's them Carolina country bitches for me
It's them down by Louisiana bitches for me
It's them overseas foreign bitches for me
It's them dark skin Hershey Kisses bitches for me
Juicy J, I specialize in ratchets
Soon as I see what I want, nigga, I gotta have it
I gotta grab it, I got blues, Dallas Maverick
She clappin' ass, throwin' pussy, I wanna smack it
My AP a skeleton, this shit can get Jurassic
And everything I'm lettin' go, she tryna catch it
She turned around, said, "It's a throw" and started snappin'
She turned around, said, "It's a throw" and started clappin'

Wait a minute, tell 'em strippers, "Hold fast"
Some bitches from out of town 'bout to show they whole ass
It's a go, it's a go, it's a go, it's a go
It's a throw, it's a throw, it's a throw, it's a throw (It's a throw)
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw that ass, yeah
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it

She a rockstar bitch, she got her asshole pierced (Asshole pierced)
You want liquor, fuck the bar, we takin' shots right here (Shots right here)
Roll a joint with no hands 'cause she good with her mouth (Good with her mouth)
Ain't got a problem with another girl eatin' her out (Eatin' her out)
Now, where them dollars at?
And where them ones that like to eat it up and swallow at?
She wanna get thicker, so she let me hit it from the back (From the back)
Straight shots, marijuana, she a freak, she do porno
Feed her steak, Benihana
Wanna fuck in the Rolls-Royce 'cause she love rich niggas
I just seen her real clothes, but she get naked in them pictures (In them pictures)
We at Puff Daddy's house goin' crazy
Lot of bitches with me and we gettin' high like this the '80s (High like this the '80s)
Wait a minute, tell 'em strippers, "Hold fast" (Hahaha, uh)
Some bitches from out of town 'bout to show they whole ass (What up, Juicy?)
It's a go, it's a go, it's a go, it's a go (Gang, gang)
It's a throw, it's a throw, it's a throw, it's a throw (Mafia, it's a throw)
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw that ass, yeah
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw that ass, yeah

Show me how you throw it back, show me how you ride it
Shawty pop that pussy like that man was inside it (What Juicy say? He like, "Shut the fuck up")
Show me how you throw it back, show me how you ride it
Shawty pop that pussy like that man was inside it
Show me how you throw it back, show me how you ride it
Shawty pop that pussy like that man was inside it
Show me how you throw it back, show me how you ride it1Embed
