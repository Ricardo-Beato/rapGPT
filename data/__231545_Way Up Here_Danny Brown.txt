Bitch, I'm way up here (Style)
Can't hear what you saying (Check)
Go on with all that hate (Hate)
So it's fuck you, pay me
I said, bitch, I'm way up here (Style)
Can't hear what you saying (Saying)
Go on with all that hate (Hate)
So it's fuck you, pay me (Style)

Bitch, I'm way up here
You a tattoo to a statue
Run Michelangelo draw too
While I turn this bitch into Saw II (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm way up here
And you down there on that totem pole
I'm on the road and I'll fuck your girl
And I'll put this dick all in a whirl (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm way up here (Style)
And you down there like a little nigga
I'll buy you up on that rent card
You still around? You better thank God
Bitch, I'm way up here (Style)
I ain't worried what's down there (There)
I'll take a step, look on my shoe and you'll be splattered everywhere
Bitch, I'm way up here (Yeah)
Can't hear what none of y'all talking 'bout
I'm on top of my mountain and y'all just started climbing rocks step
Bitch, I'm way up here
Can't hear what you saying (Saying)
Go on with all that hate (Hate)
So it's fuck you, pay me (Pay me)
Bitch, I'm way up here (Style)
Don't care what down there doing (Style)
'Cause up here up here, down there down there and you don't moving how I'm moving (Style)

Bitch, I'm way up here (Here)
Can't hear what you saying (Saying)
Go on with all that hate (Hate)
So it's fuck you, pay me (Yeah)
I said, bitch, I'm way up here (Style)
Can't hear what you saying (Saying)
Go on with all that hate (Hate)
So it's fuck you, pay me (Uh)
Bitch, I'm way up here

Yeah, come on, girl, is you down?
You with it? I'm with it (I'm with it), go on 'head, go down, uh
Bitch, I'm way up here
Puffing pot on a mountain top
Dipping in that bag, white girl on my countertop (Soulo)
Bitch, I'm way up here
Yeah, drop it like it's hot, ho
I ain't move no birds, but she in love with my cock though
Bitch, I'm way up here
Looking down on you lil' niggas
Got a sixteen with a seal on it, shot glass with a pill in it (Soulo)
Bitch, I'm way up here (Yeah)
Y'all all under my telescope
So much that I'm squinting, you ain't snitching, but you can tell I'm dope
Bitch, I'm way up here (Ha)
Can't hear what you saying
Smoking on that strong, strong like a Super Saiyan, Saiyan
Bitch, I'm way up here (Soulo)
Yeah, HiiiPower, Top Dawg
All dogs go to heaven, not y'all
Bitch, I'm way up here (Soul)
Bitch, I'm way up here3Embed
