3 ContributorsHit Rocks Lyrics
Cuz were all a little strong
In the beach where the paper's long
But as for me my only G is when I'm buss'n rocks
Now when I wake up in the morining
And I get up out my bed
I fell good, oh yes I do
Cause I still can give it up for you {What up cuz}

Cuz where all a little strong
In the beach where the papers long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks {Dogg Pound}
Cuz were all a little strong
In the beach where the papers long
But as for me I only G when I'm Buss'n rocks {So take that}

You know you gotta have heart
I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my muthafucking game tight
Cuz ever since elementary or was it pre school cool
I was a muthafuckin fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas , shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth
And it'll catch on
Cuz if it don't it's on
And cuz I ain't even slippin when I'm all alone
Sittin back laughin' in the chronic zone
Clown me, you're wrong
Surround me, you're gone
And it's the same old song
Nigga paper so long
They call him Snoop Capone
So if you want me, get him, got him
Shoot him, shot him
But now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all I LBC betta yet
That's all I DPGC

Yea Eastside
Yea Westside
Yea Eastside, for life

I'm slappin bones
Tryin to get some bones
With some dogg pound gangstas in front of my home
Bigg 6, bigg 5 3's with ya bitches
My girls in the kitchen cookin up some fish
I'm blastin at this nigga that was trippin
Knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin
But I wasn't slippin I was on deck
I blast his ass, peck peck know his shirts wet
Dead gone lights out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
I'm laughin at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin with the dogg I take your life and your money
And now I dip too my spot
And set up shop with yo rocks
And bet nobody speak on the 8-7
Cuz still all doggs go to heaven
From my hood to your hood
Game reconize it's all to the good
So here's a toast to the indo
Doing it like it's the thang to do
I thought you knew
[Chorus: 2X
Hook  w/ chorus]
Eastside, westside
Yea
Eastside for life


Freestylin, C-stylin
Snoop and Pooh comin through fixin to take you to the island
Where the bitches and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D-O double G
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People be lovin me because I drop cuts
That makes sense and make big money
Snoop is that nigga who don't half to play funny
But I got your honey up under my wing
Cuz she like that song that the bow wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on a hoe stroller, make me some green
And even if she never even saw me before
There's just no way that she can tell me no
'Cause my game's unbelievable baby
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me
**Snoop talking**
You know what I'm sayin
Is this the question that you have to ask?
Only the strong survive
But you gotta ask the questions:
Who are the survivors? Eastsidaz yea
[Chorus:4X
Hook 2X w chorus]
Yea Eastside Westside
Yea
Eastside for life
