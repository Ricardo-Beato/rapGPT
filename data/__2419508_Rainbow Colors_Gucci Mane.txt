8 ContributorsRainbow Colors Lyrics
See I'm a lean drinker
I'm a mean drinker
I don't ever drink no cause I'm a clean drinker
I spill some lean on my hand, I got sticky fingers
I got some sweet  in L.A like I'm a gang banger
I raid your refrigerator clean, fill everything up with lean
And my black cup filled with lean
Chevy drop top, paint it lean
Niggas so slick, they'll cut you lean
Mix that Qualitest with clean
Drop in a lake full of lean
 dream, huh

Rainbow colors in my cup, in my cup (In it)
Rainbow colors in my cup, in my cup (Leanin')
Rainbow colors in my cup, in my cup
Jolly Ranchers mane, that shit be good as fuck
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed (That's that syrup, syrup)
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed (Bricksquad, big money talk)
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed (Talk to em dog)

Got residue on my shirt and my cup dirty
Moving slow, I'm on the E-Way doing about 30
This make a (This a, this a trappy business)
I been drinking and driving, ain't no way I can't have it
It got me swerving all over the road
I'm so high, I wanna walk but my eyes closed
In my own school with my yellow bruh
Smoking purple, pouring up purple, sipping yellow dog

That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed (Leanin')
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed

That's that syrup, syrup
