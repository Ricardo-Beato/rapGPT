Southside on the track, yeah
Hah

Gucci Mane Soprano, my plug call me Carlo (Carlo)
Act so , I should order some cargo
European auto, Instagram model
Drankin' out the bottle, heard she like to swallow
Gucci Mane a model, snakes all on my collar
Brand new Winnebago, lay low with the yayo
Yellow bone chicano, her brother call me Gato
These kicks ain't one day old, one rock then they retro
On your marks, get set, go, I'm racin' with a peso
Rainbow with the crayons, they red, blue, green and yellow
If you hang out with narcos, then I can be your partner
I live by the G-code, my paper work proper

Gato, Gato, Gato
Who is, Gato, Coat, Gato
Coat, Gato
Hundreds, Gato, Coat, Gato
Murder, Gato, work, Gato
Been, chase, gato, feeling, gun, ass, kill, skkrt, bass

I just got a truck-load, I'm dancin' like I'm Diddy (Diddy)
I deliver bundles, I'll take over your city (Guwop)
Chopper fully-auto, I'll smoke you like some midgie
Bullets big as potholes, they'll merk you while I'm pissin'
CEO, I'm honcho, got twenty-five assistants
My bricks came with a barcode, but I don't sign to get it
Don't fuck no more you broke ho, give her to my assistance
That wig she got on so old, gave her two stacks to fix it
I'm a desperado, free all the desperados
Twenty years been back home, he still got his bravado
My homeboy from Michoacán, tequilla out the bottle
You ain't on what Gucci on, a hundred million dollars

Gato, Gato, Gato
Wrist, Gato, Who is, Gato
Coat, Gato
Hundreds, Gato, Coat, Gato
Murder, Gato, work, Gato
Been, chase, gato, feeling, gun, ass, kill, skkrt, bass1Embed
