Rain, rain, rain, rain
I catch a groove like, uh-uh

Dua Lipa, I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature (Do it)
I checked the web, they out here chewin' me up, fuck it
Fadeaway, I lift that Luka knee up, bucket
I heard from someone you said you could be us, nothing

You know my city like the new Korea, bustin'
All these discussions over who could see us, hush it
I sold them basements out, let's do arenas, crushin'
She looking, I'm blushing, I'm lying, I'm touching

Rain, rain, rain, rain
I need this shit to be tooken up, I got accustomed to it
Fuck a leap of faith, I took a jump just like it's nothing to it
Girl, them Russian twists is working, now just put your butt into it
All that talk, I'm cutting through it
I ain't no connoisseur, but I like this kind of storе
I got nothing to do with who the fuck they think I'm screwing
Uh, ninе times out of ten I had 'em, then I blew it, but I need some
You might also like
Dua Lipa, I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature (Do it)
I checked the web, they out here chewin' me up, fuck it
Fadeaway, I lift that Luka knee up, bucket
I heard from someone you said you could be us, nothing

You know my city like the new Korea, bustin'
All these discussions over who could see us, hush it
I sold them basements out, let's do arenas, crushin'
She looking, I'm blushing, I'm lying, I'm touching

So why you being extra, huh? Being extra
She's a European and she know I'm seeing extra
Got a main character, but you could be an extra
Yes, sir, we the hottest out, used to be next up
Now I'm on some Ariana (Ooh), thank you, next, bruh
Shorty came from Lexin', she flexed up
EJ turnt these motherfuckin' pecs up
Need somethin', I hit my connects up
I get like three somethin' every time I dress up
I told Yeezus that I got a confession
We 'bout to be somethin', they gon' have to catch up
So what's up?
Dua Lipa, I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature (Do it)
I checked the web, they out here chewin' me up, fuck it
Fadeaway, I lift that Luka knee up, bucket
I heard from someone you said you could be us, nothing11Embed
