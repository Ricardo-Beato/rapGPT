Hah, hah
Talkin' real slick, you know it
Thugger, Thugger, brr
Re, re, re, remix
It's Guwop
That boy Cassius
Hey

Re, re, re, remix
I know a rich nigga with them bricks in Zone 6 (Guwop)
Ain't no way in hell they gon' catch up for my whole clique (YSL)
I buy all the birds, I bust 'em down and I remix
Thugger, Thugger, make a nigga bitch say it (What?)

Down on that, down on that, (Get down, get down)
Down on that (What?), down on that (Get down, bae)
Down on that (Down), get down on that (Get down on that)
Down on that (Down on that), down on that (Haha)

I could sell to plugs or junkies (Sheesh, sheesh)
I don't mean to brag but I can purchase Kremlin (Damn)
Bitch, I got a Tommy, not my fuckin' stomach (Grracha)
Bitch, I drink that lean until I fuckin' vomit (Burr, cha)
I-I-I-I got a closet full of that Armani (Armani)
I just copped a foreign ho, I think she from London (Sheesh, you want)
You know I'm gon' eat it, yeah, she my fuckin' lunchies (Um)
I'm on Molly and lean, I'ma have lil' momma runnin' (Runnin')
I'ma catch it and beat it, now she leanin' on me
I'm super cray if I catch a bitch cheatin' on me

Too many racks spent for you to be bleachin' shit (Yeah, hey)

I got the money in the bed with me (Bed with me)
A money counter on the dresser
I thank God money there for me (Thank you)
I hope we always be together (Together)
A nigga told me he was scared for me (Fuck you scared for me, nigga?)
I told him, "Get your shit together" (Get your best five, fuck nigga)
I walk around with big heads on me (Faces)
I went-I went to sleep with the bread on me (Ahaha, strong, nigga)
I get money every day of the week
You know it's dawg on dawg, these niggas'll kill they dawg to eat (Fuck)
I got that .44 bulldog on me and I blast for free (Blast for free)
I got them young niggas who'll kill you for an ounce of weed
