It's not funny when you buy a TV off the street
You take it home, plug it in, BAM, you got beat
It's not funny when you buy a house with all you got
And the day you go to see it it's a vacant lot
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's not funny when you come to work late
You have the key to the office and the boss had to wait
It's not funny makin money on a regular basis
And losing every dime betting on the race
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's not funny when you have a show and thousands come
And your drummer brings the sticks but forgets his drums
It's not funny when you see three cars you like
And your pocket can only buy a three-speed bike
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's not funny when we got on the wrong plane
We wanted to go to L.A., but we were headed for Spain
It's not funny when you pull off an incredible caper
You thought you got over, next day you're in the paper
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
You might also likeIt's not funny when you leave your house without an umbrella
Then it rains (hahahahaha) you're an unhappy fella
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's not funny! Haha...
It's not funny when you lie and said that you prayed
When the truth was revealed, you went to Hell anyway
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's...
It's not funny!
It's not funny!
It's...
It's not funny!Embed
