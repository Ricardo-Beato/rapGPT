14 ContributorsUnify Lyrics
I falls off into a party in the NYC
Niggas lookin' at me strange but they lovin' my chain
Bang bang, same thang, game came when I left 'em
I do it by my lonely, now, I'm the Big Homie

But I'm his Royal Slickness, ghetto weakness, 'cause  Rick is
The one who expose cornball rappers with the quickness
(Uhh) Who bum from and who balls you hung from
Wouldn't give a fuck what part of the country you come from

I'm Snoop Dogg, I'm smooth and imperial
I wake up every mornin' to my Lucky Charms cereal
Times get drastic, yeah, I'm a classic
Dogg Pound Gangsta chokin' off that Boombastic

Now, put my verse on the first one, peep the herds come
So be careful 'cause my rap will make you eat your words, son
(Word to God) Scratch I? Who the hardest to match? (I)
Bite, rewrite, you're still garbage to Patch Eye

Haven't you heard? I'm loose, shook the Feds like The Juice
Snoop Dogg is 121st proof
Fool, you's a deuce-deuce of some Genuine Draft
I'm genuine like vintage wine, and all about cash
Cash, cash, so indeed I got the weed
And keep the lighter for the hash
Has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
And the only way to get it was to go and do a crime?
You might also like
Many underclothes hangin' on the hoes
Since (Snoop, Slick Rick) crushed anyone opposed
(Lot of ladies) pop Cristal, toast to all those
Like (Kid Capri) helpin' to Unify both coasts

I'm shreddin' ya temper, none 'head of the emperor
Washed up gang member â€” better remember!
I wipe my feet upon a rapper like a doormat
I hit 'em where they sit around actin' hardcore at
Thank God for the guardians, in light of this
Rappers always beg for me to show them who The Mighty is
Gats gonna limp, snaps on a king
And always wanna start rap war they're not gonna win
And wanna dash at lethal or evil
Could a king bring style and class to black people?
Stick a whole log in and he buggin'
'Cause I represent self, with my man Snoop Dogg and 'em
I drop a pile of semen on 'em
Even in a Yugo, I could take they woman from 'em
I make the hardest chew they kewl to this
Kid Capri (Yeah?), notify the peasant who The Ruler is

I'm 26, still in the mix
My hair gettin' longer, my game gettin' stronger
A nigga been on one, I thank God
'Cause life in the city of stars is gettin' hard
And it's odd, for a G to get a job
So I'd rather steal and rob and mob with my squad
My homie used to bang, now he follow Farrakhan
Used to read The Source, now all he reads is the Holy Qu'ran
Time brings change and change brings time
Listen to me hit ya with this gangbang rhyme
Nigga, whattup?! Who up? YOU up!
Doggy Dogg is on the mic, I'm here to fuck it izzzup
I give it to y'all, like you really gotta have it
Dogg Pound Gangstaz, boy, this shit is gettin' tragic
But I'mma make me a grip and dip quick
And fuck with my nigga Kid Capri on this G shit
Dial tail and bail with my nigga Slick Ricky
And all you niggas talkin' bullshit can just miss me
Can't twist me, you fuckin' paper haters
I'm dippin' in my '98 gold Navigator
I'm dippin' like a lo-lo
Bouncin', smokin ounces', fo' sho', tho
