Had to gamble my life, rollin' the dice
My name got a price, but talk to me nice
I got my money right
You know they criticize
But it's alright, I won't be victimized
Judge and the police takin' my people lives
I'm just signin' checks and doin' what's best for mine
And I ain't gotta do too much 'cause real gon' recognize (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's written on your face, think you better than me
I can't get caught up with you bitches, I'm keeping it P
I gotta keep it P
My millennium is the last dying breed (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Louis on me
I'm Armstrong and you too skinny and scrawny
You don't tell no lies and I can't fuck with you only
I turn you up and you gon' never be lonely (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want a Rolls Royce, I want a Maybach
I want a Hellcat, cost a hundred racks
You sold a lot of cap, they want they money back
On tour, I crossed 'em out, thank God I made it back
I never asked for help, nobody gave me that
We 'bout to ban all that cap, we only stating facts
I'ma let 'em know how I feel, check out my latest track
And I always stay on track (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm killin' 'bout my brother and I know that you see
My new house didn't come with a key, you gotta type it and see
Fuck your whole gang, we smoked the boss, we ain't smokin' no leaf
We shop online at vintage store, got thousand-dollar tees
We pass the bitch right when we done
She ain't my wife, how could I see her with my son?
Rockin' Rick Owens, got the ones that say, "Cunt"
All I do is sit and count racks up by the bunch
Took her out and paid for lunch
Rich off of Pyrex
You could twirl your arm right to left and get a Corvette
Five or six M, double R, Ferrari, I don't know where to start at
I told my teacher I'ma buy more watches 'cause I was tardy
I started screamin' out the answers before it started
Added that bitch to my ransom, then went the hardest
My homie died, I want answers, so we gon' spark it
We takin' over like cancer and goin' the hardest

Had to gamble my life, rollin' the dice
My name got a price, so talk to me nice
I got my money right
You know they criticize
But it's alright, I won't be victimized
Judge and the police takin' my people lives
I'm just signin' checks and doin' what's best for mine
And I ain't gotta do too much 'cause real gon' recognize (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah5Embed
