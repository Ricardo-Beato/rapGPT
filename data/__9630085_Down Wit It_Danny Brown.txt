What the fuck I'm 'posed to do now?
All alone, now I'm feeling like a clown
Should've listen to my homie when he told me "slow down"
Caught up in the moment, head was stuck in the clouds
Lifestyle of this music shit
Had me on some stupid shit
Never would've thought I'd fuck up who I'm closest with
All my fault, for most of it
Thought I knew everything, but don't know shit
That's why I'm so sick
Lost in my emotions, the path that I chosen
Left a nigga broken, can't stay focused
Hard for me to think
Tryna kill my pain, so I drink
Whoever would've thought it would end this way?
Caught a couple times, but I thought we was straight
Got caught a couple times, but I thought we was straight
I had a woman down with mе, but to me, she was down to get mе
Helped me out in this shit, now I'm realizing that I love her
I had a woman down with me, but to me, she was down to get me
Helped me out in this shit, now I'm realizing that I love her

Thought that everything was sweet
Now I belong to the streets
Thought that I was on the creep
Now I feel like a creep
World fell apart ever since you left
Fucked up bad, now I blame myself
Lost the only one that love me, these hoes don't care
Got too confident, thought you wouldn't go nowhere
Now it's all over, can't stay sober
Deep in my depression, hoping I can get over
You might also like
I had a woman down with me, but to me, she was down to get me
Helped me out in this shit, now I'm realizing that I love her
I had a woman down with me, but to me, she was down to get me
Helped me out in this shit, now I'm realizing that I love her

Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm realizing that I love her1Embed
