11 ContributorsResurrection (The Queen) Lyrics
I don't give a fuck, yeah yeah yeah
As we proceed to give you what you need
Queen Bee, muthafuckas, B.I.G, muthafuckas
Junior M.A.F.I.A. muthafuckas, Bad Boy, muthafuckas
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Bitches wanna front on me
But know not to come to me
I keep ten Glocks, ten Rotts up in front of me
Like they sprayin' somethin', like they sayin' somethin'
I gets my bark on like I'm DMX or somethin' (what?!)
My reach is like Lewis, stiff 84
Yours is like Evander, seventy-seven slow
Thanks to Tae Bo, I'm 32 and "O"
When I catch a knock out, bitches bring the cops out
Two for five spots, I tear the rocks out
Pop the tops out, then clear the spot out
Nigga or bitch, you don't want no problems
My revolver is a quick problem solver
Don't ever think I'm slippin'
Bitch I ain't dumb
I carry a stun gun inside of my hair bun
Hatin' ass niggas, I treat you like a bitch
Strap on a fake dick, and stick you where you shit (ha ha)
You might also like
Come my people, come all hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing
Come my people, come all hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing

Took three years off to map my shit out
Switch up my game plan and get closer to God
Give me an inch, I take a yard
Oh lighten up, y'all knew I was comin' back real hard
By the power that's in vested in me
Faith rested in me
I can't quit now, too much money's invested in me
To my nigga B-I, this ones for you baby!
All these niggas wanna be Kings, but fuck, is these niggas crazy?
I'ma hold the spot for ya (yeah!)
Keep it locked for ya (yeah!)
Rock for you, Pop, ain't a nigga I won't drop for you
Bitches want my title, there ain't a slot for you
It's a cold, cold world, I keep it hot for you
(What?!) Ya'll cats know who I am
(What?!) I love those who love Lil' Kim
(What?!) I'm back again, the mic' eater
The dick beater, the pussy skeeter
But I...
Come my people (Queen Bee), come all hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing (Represent for my niggas)
Come my people, come all hail the Queen
(Ayo Puff I don't think they understand)
Everybody let me hear you sing
(I don't think the understand Puff, Cease-a-Leo what)

Put five carats on the "Fuck you" finger
Any haters in the crowd, give them the "Fuck you" finger
If you think you can ball with the Queen
Handle repercussions
Our guns bust in English and in Russian
На здоровье королева мы говорим по русский до свидания
Niggas stand in line, pay a fee for me to kiss 'em
Twenty-one's the lucky number, once the "E" is in the system
One night with the Q.B., and niggas need paternity
Keep my pussy tight like the President's security
I'm some-timey, that's right, I change like the year
Win chips from a Casino, then throw them in the air
I'm the Queen!
I've got special privileges
We ain't equivalent, how dare you insult my intelligence
Now I would like you all to recite the words to this song
Cause you thought I was gone
But the Queen lives on!
Come my people, come all hail the Queen
(All my niggas, all my niggas wild the fuck out)
Everybody let me hear you sing
(All my bitches, all my bitches wild the fuck out)
Come my people, come all hail the Queen
(Yeah everybody, everybody wild the fuck out)
Everybody let me hear you sing
(The Queen is back baby, representing my nigga the Notorious B.I.G.)

The Queen, you're never gonna win
How you gonna win with the Queen?
The Queen, you're never gonna win
How you gonna win with the Queen?
The Queen, you're never gonna win
How you gonna win with the Queen?
The Queen, you're never gonna win
How you gonna win with the Queen?
The Queen, you're never gonna win
How you gonna win with the Queen?
The Queen, you're never gonna win
How you gonna win with the Queen?
The Queen, you're never gonna win
How you gonna win with the Queen?
The Queen, you're never gonna win

Come my people, come all hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing
Come my people, come all hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you singEmbed
