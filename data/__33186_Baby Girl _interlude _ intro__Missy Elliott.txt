4 ContributorsBaby Girl (interlude / intro) Lyrics
Ayo, Mary, I need you to vibe with me on this one
Uh
Uh
Check it

As I grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within
Oh God, my eyes, they water like a preacher who sin
I'm only human, but
The world has put me on a platform
Since the day I was born to only wait for my downfall
But like a brick wall, I'm too hard to break
Okay, I do make mistakes, but I'm the realest from the fake
That's why I'm the hardest to hate
Aaliyah, baby girl, I've learned to love those while they're still awake
Sleep, sleep and prepare a place for those who are good
In the projects and hood, gifted or misunderstood
I know Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still number one
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader, a teacher, a guider
Like a single parent provider
Putting back those hip-hop dividers
Like a priest with a back slider
I've sinned, but I win
And anyone we've lost in life from 9/11
We'll be sure to see again
You might also like
What you hear is not a test (Ooh)
I'm rocking to the beat (I'm rocking to the beat)
See, me and my crew and my friends (Yeah)
We're gonna try to move your feet (Move around, move around)
See, I am Mary Blige (Yes, I am)
And I'd like to say hello (Thank you for inviting me)
To the Black to the white, the red and the brown
The purple and yellow (Everybody)
But first you gotta
But first you gotta

Yo, I don't wait for the DJs to drop bombs on my records
I drop 'em on my own shitEmbed
