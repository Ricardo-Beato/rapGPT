16 ContributorsFlip Flop Lyrics
And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it

Behind this smile, I'm fightin' these tears
'Cause a bitch be sad as fuck (Yeah)
Ever since my mama died, 2019
I don't really know who I can trust
I was lookin' for anything, anybody
Lookin' for somethin' to feel like somethin'
I was hangin' with bitches I thought really loved me
Whole time they was jealous and judgin' (Ooh)
They be askin' why me and not them, shit
And I be askin' the same (Same)
If your mama and daddy still walkin' this Earth
Then you probably ain't feelin' my pain (My pain)
I don't know why they want me to fail (Yeah)
I don't know why they hate me so much (Why?)
I keep rackin' up all of thеse wins and awards
And feel like I ain't doin' enough (Likе I ain't doin' enough)

Tick-tock, but it don't stop
Your people ain't your people, they want what you got
Flip-flop, lonely at the top
Everybody wasn't meant to get off at your stop
Tick-tock, but it don't stop
Your people ain't your people, they want what you got
Flip-flop, lonely at the top
Everybody wasn't meant to get off at your stop (Ayy)

Man, I came out wreckin' these hoes
Been the type of bitch another bitch wanna be
Let's be real, y'all hoes wasn't talkin' that pimp shit
'Til y'all start listenin' to me
Since you in my business, this my trick
Find me a sucka, I hit me a lick
That's your business if you wanna go fuck these niggas
And still be broke than a bitch
I can't relate to these bitches (Nope)
And I'm realer than most of these niggas (Ha)
The shit I be doin', the way I be livin'
They use for aesthetics and pictures (Fake-ass hoes)
The loudest is never the realest
And the realest ain't speakin' on nothin'
All them quotes you post be about you, bitch
I don't know who you think you be subbin', yeah

Tick-tock, but it don't stop
Your people ain't your people, they want what you got
Flip-flop, lonely at the top
Everybody wasn't meant to get off at your stop
Tick-tock, but it don't stop
Your people ain't your people, they want what you got
Flip-flop, lonely at the top
Everybody wasn't meant to get off at your stopEmbed
