Sex symbol, the Black Seminole
A sex symbol, the Black Seminole
African Rambo with more ammo
Can't be escaped, I'm on every channel

What's wrong? What's wrong, Mr. Man?
Your eyes are low
And you're walking with both hands on your head
His response, he's on a clean, clean high
Both feet up on the ground
But his head's way, way, way in the sky

The Black Seminole, a head general
Distant connections, a large interval
A black man with mouths to feed
Embracing equality throughout greed

No time to joke around, the kid is now a man
And the silence is filled with remarkable sounds
This part I've seen in my dreams
Love is not a lie, it just feels like a Tarantino movie scene

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Mm-mm-mmm, ooh
Ah-ha, aaah, yeah-hey, yeah7Embed
