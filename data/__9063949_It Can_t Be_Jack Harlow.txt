34 ContributorsIt Canâ€™t Be Lyrics
Huh, huh, huh, huh, what's that?
Huh, huh, what's that?
Huh, huh, what's that?

It must be my skin, I can't think of any other reason I win (Ooh)
I can't think of an explanation, it can't be the years of work I put in
It can't be the way that I stuck with the same friends
It can't be the swag I got when I walk in, it can't be

It can't be the way I treat people or how I make time to see people
Or make sure that they feel like we equals
It can't be the smile, it can't be the eye contact with these crowds
It can't be my pen, it can't be these verses
That make people feel like I'm talkin' to them
It can't be the homage I've paid
Nights when I could've left the studio early, but I stayed
It can't be the tone of my voice
It can't be the thought I put into every choice
It can't be the Jeep instead of the Rolls-Royce
It can't be the downtime with my boys
It can't be the Tribe and the Biggie and the Nas
The Outkast and the Missy in my iPod
It can't be the absence of any facade
It can't be the worldwide hometown pride
So I guess (So I guess)
It must be my skin, I can't think of any other reason I win
I can't think of an explanation, it can't be the years of work I put in
It can't be the way that I stuck with the same friends
It can't be the swag I got when I walk in, it can't be

It can't be some understanding or branding
Or maybe that I'm outstanding
Or all the South American fans that meet me at the airport upon landing
It can't be my aunties and grannies
And every other woman in my family that raised me to be upstanding
It can't be that I simply make ear candy
Especially when the industry could just plant me
Especially when I didn't grow up on Brandy
Especially when I'm havin' dinner in Frankfort with Andy
It can't be a bit of good karma
It can't be the way they all said that he's a charmer
It can't be the lack of chinks in my armor
It can't be the poise when them boys try to harm us
It can't be that we built somethin' to be a part of
It can't be the way that every beat gets barred up
So I guess

It must be my skin, I can't think of any other reason I win
I can't think of an explanation, it can't be the years of work I put in
It can't be the way that I stuck with the same friends
It can't be the swag I got when I walk in, it can't beYou might also like3Embed
