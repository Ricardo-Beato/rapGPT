6 ContributorsOn Tha Blocc Lyrics
Uh

I'm finna treat this rap just like packs and move it
Make true music, think I won’t recoup then you stupid
I been a hustler so I felt the movement
When it's time to switch rhymes, pull the blinds and blueprint
Had to open my eyes, see the signs and used 'em
How most of my niggas died or locked down, secluded
When devoted to the block, this is all you’re used to
Pledge allegiance to the present, fuck the past and future
We was brought up quick, would sit off Slauson and pitch
Start with the sack, we could all get rich
I was involved in shit, I can't hardly spit
I went hard for the chips 'cause the odds against us
Never listened to them old heads
On the block with two 11s 'til 11 at night
When told it's more to life than is evident sight
A dope head's on ten-speed bikes with more feds patrollin'

On the block
That's where the blammers explode
And young niggas turn pro from their amateur roles
On the block
That’s where the smokers is at
They know the spot for crack, 12 noon to jet black
On the block
Look at the Johnnys, they thirsty
Willin’ to harm me and hurt me
Had me in county's infirmary
On the block
And all the flippers is watchin’ us, flipping them rockers
They on it 'cause we gettin' it proper
On the block
You might also like
I been know to keep the Glock cocked
Stayin' fully prepared, watchin’ for pop shots
(On the block)
And it's death for he, who test them three
One of the top five best with heat
Ain't no changin' me
I'll be the same 'til these lames blow brains for me
Yeah, staredowns and pounds
Keys and fleas and hoes that'll hold you down
Mishaps and craps
Crenshaw traps, lowkey homies on crack
We got sacks and MACs
Niggas who don't do daps and roll Fleetwood Cadillacs
And then there's that squad of us, that's hard to touch
We be so marvelous, no starvin' us
In the Porsche C2 hard on clutch
With your broad, givin' balls to her
And the porch seet to hard, don't clutch
With your pork, givin' balls to her
Come on

On the block
That's where the blammers explode
And young niggas turn pro from their amateur roles
On the block
That's where the smokers is at
They know the spot for crack, 12 noon to jet black
On the block
Look at the Johnnys, they thirsty
Willin' to harm me and hurt me
Had me in county's infirmary
On the block
And all the flippers is watchin' us, flipping them rockers
They on it 'cause we gettin' it proper
On the block
I'm known for bein' young and rebellious
So you can die with one flex of the pelvis
Been had the Glock 'fore Young Slauson was popular
Slauson'll pop ya frequently, families is singin' operas
Amazing grace, shoot accurate, no need for a doctor
Promise you'll leave Earth at the scene where they spot your dome
Fuck with cops, so I vacate in the Bens with a diva that's proper
Fuck colds backseats with a copper, feel me?
I been there, done that in the Franco Harris
Stayin' away from the sheriffs, pushin' the sack
On the block
The baby boy hustled from dusk to dawn
Don't be the one to think I'm wrong
And catch it with a heat bigger than Dustin Hoff's
Cut your circulation, tape your section off
Hit you, and it ain't even for respect at all
'Cause niggas already know that the 'Vette is hard

On the block
That's where the blammers explode
And young niggas turn pro from their amateur roles
On the block
That's where the smokers is at
They know the spot for crack, 12 noon to jet black
On the block
Look at the Johnnys, they thirsty
Willin' to harm me and hurt me
Had me in county's infirmary
On the block
And all the flippers is watchin' us, flipping them rockers
They on it 'cause we gettin' it properEmbed
