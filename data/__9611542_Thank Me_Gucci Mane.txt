6 ContributorsThank Me Lyrics
(Okay, Kori says, "Rollin'")
Mwah
If you smokin' good in here, make some motherfuckin' noise (Yeah)
It's Gucci
Uh-huh

In the strip club, throwin' up these fives
When I walk in, them bitches, they get live (They get live)
Say she fucked me, she a motherfuckin' liar (Bitch)
She just gave me some good head while I drive, yeah (Skrrt)
Looked her in her eye and told her, "You should thank me" (You should thank me)
Just 'cause you eatin' it up don't mean that you could drink me (Uh-uh)
I made her stop and roll me up a blunt of stanky (Ayy, roll that)
She got a nigga at home she love, but he ain't me (Damn)
I turned a quiet fine bitch into my little porno-star
Got a pocket full of trap money, so I just bought the bar
Sprayin' champagne on these bitches and I'm pourin' up that raw
Ayy, if I want it, I go get it, I don't care what it cost, nah
Told her bring a friend with her, girl, let's go have some fun (Let's do it)
What's that on my backseat? That's a hundred-round drum (A hundred)
I'm something like a pimp, walked in with five hoes on my arm (Woo)
I smashed her, then I told her, "Bitch, that pussy bomb," hey

I got a pocket full of blue cheese, blue cheese (Haha)
So many hundreds that it's bustin' out my blue jeans
I got that blue cheese, I got that new cheese
Who wanna come get some of this motherfuckin' money?
Yes, you should thank, should thank, th-th-th-thank me (Uh-huh)
And you should thank, th-thank, yeah, you should thank me (You should thank me)
And you should thank me, you should thank me (It's Gucci, huh)
And you should thank, th-thank, man, you should thank me, huh

She wanna date me, she wanna rape me
I'm Gucci Mane and I know these niggas hate me (Yeah)
Sucker so hateful, ho so ungrateful
But, I keep throwin' up that money, that's what it's made for (Go)
Plus all this jewelry on my neck, it disrespect a nigga
All this blue cheese in my pocket, it protect a nigga (Burr)
I got my chest poked out so far 'cause I'm successful, nigga
Got too much money on me, man, I need an extra nigga (Well, damn)
I'm money crazy, somebody help me (Help)
When I went broke, I swear to God, them niggas left me
I moved to South Beach, who wanna jet-ski? (Wow)
These bitches lyin' on they pussy, they never met me (Wop)

I got a pocket full of blue cheese, blue cheese (Haha)
So many hundreds that it's bustin' out my blue jeans
I got that blue cheese, I got that new cheese
Who wanna come get some of this motherfuckin' money?
Yes, you should thank, should thank, th-th-th-thank me (Uh-huh)
And you should thank, th-thank, yeah, you should thank me (You should thank me)
And you should thank me, you should thank me
And you should thank, th-thank, man, you should thank me, huhEmbed
