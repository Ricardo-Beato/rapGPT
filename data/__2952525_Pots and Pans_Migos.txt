5 ContributorsPots and Pans Lyrics
Tell em bout the pots and pans mans
Skrt skrt

I'm on the block everyday with the pots and pans
Off the pots and pans
Nigga snitchin', feds watchin', pots and pans
Trap bunkin' real hard off the pots and pans
I'm on the block everyday with the pots and pans
Off the pots and pans
Nigga snitchin', feds watchin', pots and pans
Trap bunkin' real hard off the pots and pans

Trap bunkin' real hard off the god damn pans
Horse shoes on my fuckin' god damn
When I go to the club I throw a hundred million bands
Migo gang we deep and we strapped like  army
You pussy nigga don't harm me, that AK is alarming
I'm on the block like what you need
I am a pharmacy
Ballin' on these niggas but do not call me Stojakovic
Yo bitch ison my dick jumpin' like a pogo stick
Like a fuckin' mountain
Call my accountant cause I'm so tired of counting
Money going good yeah its flowing like a fountain
Pockets lookin' well junkies knockin' at my door
No gazelle I can not front you a bale
Me and my migos got a lot  for sale
Me and my migos got clientele
You might also like
I'm on the block everyday with the pots and pans
Put a hard  50 on the pots and pans
Nigga snitchin', feds watchin', pots and pans
Trap bunkin' real hard off the pots and pans
I'm on the block everyday with the pots and pans
Off the pots and pans
Nigga snitchin', feds watchin', pots and pans
Trap bunkin' real hard off the pots and pans

Hard nose 50 off the pots and pans
Make a hundred off the damn gram
Pull that shit off with a fuckin' fan
I want your fuckin' work like uncle sam
We on the block everyday 
On the block everyday with them sacks
On the block everyday pushin' hella zones
Push it til its gone
Fuck 12, we baling out
We want that work, cause we cashin' out
Who the hell are you, watchu talkin' bout
You ain't got big bankrolls, pussy nigga close your mouth
You don't know nothin' bout that white girl, that Britney Spears
You don't know nothin' bout that
Onion pack brung me the tears
You don't know nothin' bout that goons got 15 years
I ain't talking whips, in the kitchen shifting gears
I'm on the block everyday with the pots and pans
Put a hard  50 on the pots and pans
Nigga snitchin', feds watchin', pots and pans
Trap bunkin' real hard off the pots and pans
I'm on the block everyday with the pots and pans
Off the pots and pans
Nigga snitchin', feds watchin', pots and pans
Trap bunkin' real hard off the pots and pansEmbed
