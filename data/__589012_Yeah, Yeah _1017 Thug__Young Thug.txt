Young Thug!
(Nard & B)
My nigga, you know we both came from nothing (Trenchwerx)
We fed the streets three years straight (Nard & B)
It's about that time (Trenchwerx)
DJ Scream, DJ Swamp Izzo (Nard & B)
(Swamp—Swamp—Izzo—Izzo!)
1017 Thug!
(DJ Scream heavy in the streets!)
Ahh! Go

I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, ya'll nigga fools (Yeah)
Hundred K on her, hundred K on me (Woo)
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels (Woo, woo, woo)
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues (Woo)
They at you, and they next, too
They'll press you, they'll press you
They'll cock back, they depressed, too

Michael Vick (What), all my dogs, yeah, they with the shit
Catch a point, shake him up like a hit stick (Woo)
Your bitch is on my dogs like a fucking tick (Woo, skrrt, skrrt)
Straight up out that bowl with my fucking wrist (Woo, woo)
I ain't going to jail, so I gotta hit (Fire, fire, fire)
Ain't shoot him in his ass, but I'mma bust his shit (Rah, rah)
I ain't 3hunna, but I'm Sosa, bitch (Bossman)
My partner got the plug, he servin' everyday
Real ice inside my wrist, you can just skate away (Skate away)
Stay hot, you think I live outside the equator, bae (I stay hot)
Don't play because them sticks sound like these 808s (Rah)

I'm flamed up, my block hot (Woo)
Hundred bands in a shoebox
Still no gang, keep a Glock cocked (Oh)
Spit more fire than a matchbox
Full cup of that Actavis
Ye—Yellow diamond like I'm dripping piss (Yeah)
Call me H-boogie, you know I move bricks
Thug right beside me, call him Money Mitch
I'm a Memphis nigga, hard on a bitch (Holla)
All my life I been breaking tricks (Holla)
With the mob squad I might spaz out
See too much cash I might crash out (Yeah)
Walk in the club, iced out (Woo)
Neck and wrist, lighthouse (Yeah)
Y'all know my life 'bout
Rich nigga, walking stash house
Ba—Balling like Jerry Stackhouse (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Bad bitch with me, hit the room and knock her back out (Back out)
Crusing through the city (City), me and Double D (Double D)
Just made a hundred thousand selling pints of G (OG)

I got a half bird in my M2
Ya'll nigga flexing, y'all nigga fools (Yeah)
Hundred K on her, hundred K on me (Woo)
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels (Woo, woo, woo)

He run the mob, bitch, BMG, we taking off (We taking off)
Salute to real niggas who done made theyself a boss (Made theyself a boss)
He say his main bitch—I just had her at the loft
We both was on that molly, she was licking like a dog (Woo)
Ayy, that there irrelevant (Relevant)
I'm a paper chaser, motherfuck a bitch (Fuck a bitch)
I'm cooling with my youngins on some hood shit (Hood shit)
I'm so fuckin' hood, I need a hood bitch (Rah)

I got a half bird in my M2
