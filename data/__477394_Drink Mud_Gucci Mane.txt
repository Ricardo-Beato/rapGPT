7 ContributorsDrink Mud Lyrics
All my get money bitches stand up
All my trap niggas put your hands up
Gucci man I'm so rubber band up
And my car so clean it get a A+
Black Maybach with the red guts
I'm a get money bitches stand up
All my trap niggas put your hands up
Gucci man I'm so rubber band up
And my car so clean it get a A+
Black Maybach with the red guts
Yellow diamonds for you pretty red sluts
Tell the weed man to bring some more bud
I'm a mud drinker bitch I drank mud

Man I'm whippin and flippin and zippin that kushy
Calling your girl like bring me the pussy
I enter the kitchen to cook up a cookie
You're boyfriends so broke I swear he a pussy
I fuck her on your bed I don't care who be looking
Stand on your porch and dare you to push me
Choppers are dusty, he know not to touch me
I'm the boss and the boss gets all the glory
Changing the game I'm remaining the same
Buy new car I'm changing the paint
Changing the motor and changing the guts
Changing the dranks, I'm poppin' the pint
A K A I'm cracking the seal those don't know
I'm dranking the drank
Thinking about money we thinking the same
Fly's a bird and high's a plane
Might hit the club in a black tuxedo
Hood hoes coming Gucci Mane got gambino
Big fat swishers look like torpedos
0-12 Nino, smoking on guido
Might have a man but he not like me tho
We can ball out two weeks in Rio
On a boat way cocaine look creole
He might get money but not like me no
You might also like
All my get money bitches stand up
All my trap niggas put your hands up
Gucci Mane I'm so rubber band up
And my car so clean it get a A+
Black Maybach with the red guts
Yellow diamonds for these pretty red sluts
Tell the weed man to bring some more bud
I'm a mud drinker bitch I drank mud

Positiong myself and cusion my wealth
Hating on me that's bad for your health
F on my rims and F on my shoes
FNH on me and F on my belt
Niggas they envy, Gangstas pretend to be
Glasses are Fendi and bitches are friendly
Asses are sexy and titties are pretty
Niggas are ho type and bitches are silly
Watches are quarter my chain is a milly
I can't lie all my hoes are so deadly
So I'm up on occasion than you think I was Diddi
Cases and cases and cases of blunts
Smoke like a hippie, drink like Britney
Walking in the club ten hoes with me
Harder they try they can't get rid me
Looking like I'm dreaming someone pinch me
Two shooters right by, they're my henchmen
Gucci then came all same songs keep them
Flash back heard my beeper vibrating
And the pay phone in the hood keep on ringing
That lil chick that I met last weekend
Laughing and leaving I'm walking in Neimus
Swag so sick I could check on the season
Freshen' the club making bitch stop breathing
All my get money bitches stand up
All my trap niggas put your hands up
Gucci Mane I'm so rubber band up
And my car so clean it get a A+
Black Maybach with the red guts
Yellow diamonds for these pretty red sluts
Tell the weed man to bring some more bud
I'm a mud drinker bitch I drank mudEmbed
