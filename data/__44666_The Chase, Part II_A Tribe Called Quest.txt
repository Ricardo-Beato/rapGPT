I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out

Dem can't touch we, no, dem can't touch we
Dem can't hold we, no, dem can't hold we
Dem can't touch we, no, dem can't touch we
Dem can't hold we, no, dem can't hold we (Turn the party out)

(Damn Phife, you got fat!) Yeah, I know it looks pathetic
Ali Shaheed Muhammad got me doin' calisthenics (Uh)
Needless to say, boy, I'm bad to the bone
Makin' love to my mic like Jarobi on the phone
But um, no time for jokes (What?), there's bills to be paid (What?)
Hoes to be laid (What?), punks to be sprayed (What?)
Chumps to attack, so my man, watch your back
'93 means skills are a must, so never lack (Uh)
Sit back and learn, come now, watch the birdie
Your styles are incomplete, same as Vinny Testaverde
Battlin'? Whenever, hot damn
Gimme the microphone, boy, one time, bam!
You might also like
Keep it on the cooler 'cause here come the heat
Lyrically in space, the jazz will pace the beat
As we proceed to elevate you, we in 4/4
Run and tell your dad the Abstract's the bag
As we proceed to move your hind parts we know as ass
Poets got the gimmicks, but they lack the sassafras
To make the average hard rocker cock the Glock
And roam the city streets on the jury, they hot
I be ingredients, like sugar in candy
If your life is broke, girl, I'll be the handy-dandy
That can mend you, my fee is a shower
For you, I'll scrub your back and I'll floss the butt crack
Make you shiny, spiffy in a jiff'
Fuckin' with the Ab', you got the greatest of gifts
Ayo, my mic is soundin' bugged, Bob Power, you there? (Yeah)
Adjust the bass and treble, make my shit sound clear (Clear, clear, clear, clear)

I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out (Make you shiny)
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out (Spiffy in a jiff')
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out (Fuckin' with the Ab', you got the greatest of gifts)
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out (Ayo, my mic is soundin' bugged, Bob Power, you there?)
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out (Adjust the bass and treble and make my— okay, take it from the Tip)
Move back yourself, man, come watch me drop it
For sure, me, I'll go do it, for sure, me, I'll go rock it
Me not deal with no changaram, bangaram business
I got soul on the end like Jehovah's got the Witness
Musically, the three, poetically we be
The enchantment on the airwaves, kids just fade
Obey the MCs 'cause the MCs save
We flippin' on niggas like we Super Dave
But noticin' my stature, y'all niggas know we gotcha
Movin' to the rapture, listen how we catch ya
Movin' with the bass, here we go, let's begin
Makin' people jump out they goddamn skin
Lyrically, we bite like we Rin Tin Tin
Peace to Grand Pu' and his many, many skins
Don't mark us for the L 'cause you know we get the wins
It's the Ab', Shaheed and the Dawg for the blend

Bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
And I wanna say peace to my man Bob P, my man Jerod
And Skeff Anslem on the help out, and we out like Shout
Nine-trey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna say nine-trey
'Cause my man Extra P said don't say the years
So it's for eternity, know what I'm sayin'? Rock, rock on
Everybody in Queens, rock, rock on
Everybody in Brooklyn, rock, rock on
Money Earnin' Mt. Vernon, rock, rock on
Everybody in Jersey, rock, rock on
Everybody in Philly, rock, rock on
Everybody in Houston, rock, rock on
Everybody, LA, rock, rock on
Everybody in The Sand, rock, rock on
Everybody in Egypt, rock, rock on
Everybody, Nigeria, rock, rock on
Everybody in London, rock, rock on
Everybody in Sweden, rock, rock on
Everybody everywhere, rock, rock on
To the niggas on the famous, rock, rock on
Everybody no name, rock, rock on
To the kids at Nu-Clear, rock, rock on
To the— The Cave rock, rock on
To McDonald's, rock, rock on
This concludes Midnight Marauder program
