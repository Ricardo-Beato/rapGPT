DJ, please pick up your phone, I'm on the request line
This is a Missy Elliott one-time exclusive (C'mon)

Is it worth it? Let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
​ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tuP
​ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tuP
If you got a big— let me search ya
And find out how hard I gotta work ya
​ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tuP
​ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tuP (C'mon)

I'd like to get to know ya so I could show ya
Put the pussy on ya like I told ya
Give me all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank, then call me over
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my chocha
You do or you don't or you will or won't ya?
Go downtown and eat it like a vulture
See my hips and my tips, don't ya?
See my ass and my lips, don't ya?
Lost a few pounds and my waist for ya
This the kind of beat that go ra-ta-ta
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah
Work it, I need a glass of water
Boy, oh boy, it's good to know ya (C'mon)

If you a fly gal, get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy, lift it up, let's make a toast-a
Let's get drunk, that's gonna bring us closer (Okay)
Don't I look like a Halle Berry poster?
See the Belvedere playing tricks on ya (Ah)
Girlfriend wanna be like me, never
You won't find a bitch that's even better (Ah)
I make you hot as Las Vegas weather
Listen up close while I take it backwards
​sdrawkcab ti ekat ot ekil yssiM yaw eht hctaW
I'm not a prostitute, but I could give you what you want
I love your braids and your mouth full of fronts
Love the way my ass go ba-bum-bum-bum-bum (Huh)
Keep your eyes on my ba-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum (Okay)
You think you can handle this? Ga-dunk-a-dunk-dunk (Woo)
Take my thong off and my ass go boom (Ugh)
Cut the lights on so you see what I could do (C'mon)
Is it worth it? Let me work it

Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, white, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys (C'mon)
Why-thai, thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai

Girls, girls, get that cash
If it's nine to five or shaking your ass (Aha)
Ain't no shame, ladies do your thing (C'mon)
Just make sure you ahead of the game

Just 'cause I got a lot of fame super
Prince couldn't get me change my name, papa
Kunta Kinte a slave again, no sir
Picture Blacks saying, “Oh yes-a, massa”
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute man, Big Red could outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask ya
When I come out, you won't even matter (Ugh)
Why you act dumb like, yeah, duh?
So you act dumb like, uh, duh
As the drummer boy go ba-rom-pop-pom-pom (Ooh)
Give you some-some-some of this cinna-bun (C'mon)
Is it worth it? Let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
​ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tuP

To my ladies (Woo)
You sure know how to work that (Good God)42Embed
