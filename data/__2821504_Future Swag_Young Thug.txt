Yeah, that's that cash talk
You know what I'm saying
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, woo
I fuck on your baby mama (Dig)
I fuck on your baby mama (Bitch)
Let's fuck on your baby mama
'Cause I wanna fuck on your baby mama (Get in your swag)
Some head from your baby mama (Gettin' some swag)
I need some brain from your baby mama (Where is your swag?)
The head from your baby mama
I need me some brain from your baby mama (Woo, woo)

Lil' mama, she wet like a boat, the boat (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lil' mama, she wet like a boat
Lil' mama, she wet like a boat, a boat (Skrrt)

Lil mama, she ready for war
She ready for dick in her ass and her throat
Lil' mama, she wet for the faculty
Lil' mama, she ready, she after me (Thugger)

Hit the motor like a play back (Skrrt)
