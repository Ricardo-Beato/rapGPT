15 ContributorsStep Out Lyrics
Zaytoven
Ho, ho, yeah
When I'm flexin' on all this money, you can't rubberband me
When I step out, you know I got these diamonds dancin' (Pluto)
Know I got these diamonds dancin' (Yeah, yeah)

I jump in a party, bitch, you know I'm flyer than Michael Jordan
VVSs diamonds lightin' up, these bitches goin' retarded
I don't post none of my dawgs on IG 'cause they play with murders, yeah (Murders)
I turned up my sidepiece and I'm fuckin' her with my main bitch (Yeah)
Money and fame ain't never changed me, still posted with gangsters
They done caught that boy sittin' at the light, they wet him up and spanked him
Every single day we roll a blunt and smoke an opp up
The way they gunnin' spinnin' through, niggas might just call the cops up (Zaytoven)
Bringin' .223 inside the party like a shotta
I been drankin' syrup and I got herb like a rasta (Pluto)
Poppin' dirty molly, call me up when you want that geek dick (Yeah)
She was such a good girl, I turned her to a freak bitch (Hold up)

When I step out, you know I got these diamonds dancin'
Yeah, I'm flexin' on all this money, you can't rubberband me
He get stretched out tryna reach my nigga, you can't have me
I was left out, now I step out, diamonds hit like taxis
You might also like
My Richard Millie cost two milli', just blinded somebody
I really keep a milli' just in case I shot somebody
I took the whole Gucci store and put it in my closet
Like a walkin' water fountain, it's like I broke the faucet
Gucci Mane and ain't nobody got more ice than me (Than me)
The step out nigga 'cause my items cost a mil' at least (Least)
I rep hard 'cause I know nobody can't take shit from me (From me)
Get stretched out, reachin' for my piece and now you rest in peace (In peace)

When I step out, you know I got these diamonds dancin'
Yeah, I'm flexin' on all this money, you can't rubberband me
He get stretched out tryna reach, my nigga, you can't have me
I was left out, now I step out, diamonds hit like taxis

Step out, I got all the diamonds dancin' just like Jabbawockeez (They dancin')
Gettin' tired of hatin', yeah, a nigga should be exhausted (Ho, who?)
Yeah, I'm ridin' through the hood dead fresh like a coffin
Bitch, I need a pool, diamonds wet as hell like a dolphin (Splash)
When I step out, all them bitches know that it's the mil' (It's the mil')
Backwood full of Zaza, I only smoke the greatest (Zaza)
And I keep a tool every day, not only on occasions
Drippin' in designer, nigga, yeah, I only wear the latest (Drip, drip)
I was down bad at the bottom, now I'm on top (At the top)
If a nigga disrespect the mob, we gon' pop your top (We gon' pop your top)
Rob the plug, gettin' it jumpin', then set up shop (Then set up shop)
I was broke as hell, now I'm steppin' out with a knot
When I step out, you know I got these diamonds dancin'
Yeah, I'm flexin' on all this money, you can't rubberband me
He get stretched out tryna reach my nigga, you can't have me
I was left out, now I step out, diamonds hit like taxis1Embed
