7 ContributorsGet Yo Bread Up Lyrics
(The Mekanix)

Niggas don't want you to keep your head up
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, nigga, get your bread up
La-da-da, da, da-da-da, da

Shined up my shoes and jumped in my ride
Feelin' like a pimp, doin' fifty-five
In a five-seven, clean as a reverend
LS3, so G, keep my engine revvin'
Hella Heaven, you can't tell a legend (What?)
See, what you don't know and won't know, enjoy your beverage
Separate with severance, I'm Rich Paul and Maverick
Libra gang, so you know that I'm leveraged
I keep that black book and the black heat and seldom seen
Like I own a hundred thousand Krispy Kreme's
I'm doin' doughnuts, the homies go nuts
See when Dogg in the town, nigga, we turn up
Off that mothafuckin' E-4-O mango-scotto (Yes sir)
Nigga, we sip it out the bottle (Ooh)
I'm in the bay for a day, let me bubble this play
And show you niggas how I parlay
You might also like
Niggas don't want you to keep your head up
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, nigga, get your bread up
La-da-da, da, da-da-da, da

I'm double R from the O, I mean a long time ago
He took me from the 9-8 block to the indo store
So I can make a quick purchase and run it back
I'm on my Silicon shit, spent ten, made back a hundred stacks
It's amazing how I hustle in so many ways
Count revenue streams in so many ways
We never watch the clock, so we don't know how many days
I'm the quarterback 'cause I got so many plays
Digitally bit, physically fit (Yeah)
Snoop Dogg and The Mekanix, nigga, this that shit
Bang that, bang that, bang that, slap
Make a nigga say, "Bring that back" (Bring that back)
Now, do I like her or do I love her?
I put my shit in gear and burn rubber
Spice One and Short Dogg on the zap mayne
You wouldn’t know about it, nigga, its a Bay thang
Dope era, beast mode
Candy paint, Zenus and Vogues (Yes sir)
More deals to close, more bills to fold (Uh)
Get you bread, homie, and stack that shit by the loads
Niggas don't want you to keep your head up
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, nigga, get your bread up (Get your mothafuckin' money, man)
La-da-da, da, da-da-da, da (Come on)
Niggas don't want you to keep your head up (These niggas always want you to keep your head down)
(Man, fuck that, keep pushin', yeah)
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, nigga, get your bread up (Ayy Snoop, what's happenin'?)
La-da-da, da, da-da-da, da (Haha, nah, but nigga...)

G bands and chops, orange juice and yachts
Prescription bottles, filled to the top (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Filled with the rocks, the dope game (Crack, nigga)
VIPs for sale, we was blowing shade (Everything)
Now I'm on top bigger thangs, I like real estate (Keep goin', Larry)
I like platinum on my wrist, I did that today (Yeah, shit, swear to God)
I’m a smooth ass nigga with a pocket full of cake (Cake)
"Larry, where you from?" Bitch, I'm from the bay (Yeah, Frisco)
Dippin' and drippin' I keep it on me I'm trippin'
Whole lot of women, they all say that I’m different (Yeah, damn)
Fitted to my toes, I like bank rolls
Bitch you need speed it up, you know the bank finna close (Numbers)
A kick in the freezer, a 40 in the stove
I cried in the trap when I lost Quinn Coleman
You don't wanna see me win, I keep my head up
I'm goin' hard everyday and never lettin' up
What's happenin'?
Niggas don't want you to keep your head up (Yeah, uh, damn)
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, nigga, get your bread up (Yeah)
La-da-da, da, da-da-da, da
Niggas don't want you to keep your head up (Keep goin', my nigga)
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, nigga, get your bread up (Yeah, haha)
La-da-da, da, da-da-da, da (The Mekanix)

Money, money, money
Say, man (Yee)
What you sittin' on? (Money)
Oh, that money too?
Oh, for sheezy?
Say man, I'm in the Bay for a day, man
Money, money
You know how we get it, man
Burn rubber (Rubber)
YeahEmbed
