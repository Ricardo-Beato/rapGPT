27 ContributorsTruth Gonna Hurt You Lyrics
Future Hendrix
My experience
Feel my music, feel my music
It’s a cold-cold-cold world baby
Put on your coat
Preferably, chinchilla mink, know what I mean?

I didn't wanna lie to you
But it sound more fly to you
I didn't wanna lie to you
I swear it sound way fly to you
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth’s gonna hurt you
Truth gon' hurt you

I live a cowabunga lifestyle
All these girls around me go wild
And I’m so caught up in my own style
I can’t see you niggas in the crowd
I’m so far, ain’t gonna never come down
You can ask around, I run the town
Every day for me a fashion show
I’m Future Hendrix and I run Pluto
I’m a rockstar forever, I need to get my act together
We’re changin’ up the weather, it’s so hard to be subtle
Since we first got together things changed for the better
I got die hard fans and dey treat me very special
Heard about forty bitches in the lobby
Ask me about it, hold nobody
You might also like
I didn't wanna lie to you
But it sound more fly to you
I didn't wanna lie to you
I swear it sound way fly to you
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth’s gonna hurt you
Truth gon' hurt you

I'm on a the first class flight
Ain't pack a bag overnight
Cause I'ma shop when I land
Yeah, I'ma shop when I land
When you playin’ with them bandz
5 Suite hotel, that's all where we staying
Don’t frustrate and I been up late
(Just thinkin’ of shit, know what I mean?) Goin’ over my plans
Feel like sinkin', I'm in sand
Some things you wouldn’t understand
I live the high life, sexing, syrup and money
Everything we do we do it always to the morning
I got a trio, tryna suck me up like Tito
Ain’t fallin’ in lust, you need to trust when I tell you
I didn't wanna lie to you
But it sound more fly to you
I didn't wanna lie to you
I swear it sound way fly to you
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth’s gonna hurt you
Truth gon' hurt you5Embed
