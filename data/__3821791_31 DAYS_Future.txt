(Zaytoven)
(Pluto)
Every now and then, you know what I'm sayin'?
Most of the majority of the time, you dig?
We in that mode
Yeah (For real)
Yeah

This is a moment of clarity
Everything VVs, I'm gone to the maximum (For real)
Young nigga flood out a 'axima
Flawless the face then run through a pack of them (Hold up)
Everything classical, everything magical
When they was checking my catalogue
Eating on caviar, smash on a stallion
Draped in medallions, yeah (Yeah)
Depending on the caliber, put on the passenger (Yeah)
Whatever time, wherever I was at (Yeah)
Look on the calendar, yeah, we compatible
I have her flying wherever I'm at (Let's go)
You astronomical, way too phenomenal
I have her naked where I land (Pluto)
I got a second option and a fourth
And fifth one wherever a nigga staying
I had them falling right out of my pocket
When I was just smashing her, she seen the bands
Her body Coca-Cola and she seen a can
The Glock was still on me while we was romancin' (Woo)
Think I fell in love with this girl, came from France (Woo)
She caramel without getting a tan (Hold on)
I need to pay her when I get a chance (Yeah)
Gave her some drip, gave her a whole lot of splash (Splash)
Talkin' that shit, he get smoked like a blunt
Took a few Pakistani-ans to lunch
Got some little slim shit in Milan
These niggas be hatin', putting on a front
You might also like
Money get made (Made)
These bitches don't ever get saved (Never get saved)
Saint Laurent shades (Shades)
Cookin' up dope, gettin' paid (Cookin' up dope)

Shawty gettin' laid (Yeah)
She been with me 31 days (31 days)
She like bitches anyways (Ayy)
So we been on the same damn page (Same damn page)

I took a little E (Took a little E)
Got red bottoms sittin' on my feet (Slatt)
I ran it up, beep (Yeah)
I got your baby mama knee-deep (Woo)
She ain't got no teeth (Ayy)
She know a young nigga eat beef (Future)
She want me to leave
She know I'm not a rat, I got cheese (Got cheese)
I was quieter than a mouse (Woo)
When I got it in her mouth she couldn't breathe (Shh)
I was thinking like, "Jeez"
She done got a little slob on my tee
I done took a little E
I fucked her and made her pee
Made her part of my team
Then she asked me for a ring
I was already red bottom
Came on the scene
It's hard to trust you
When I'm paintin' this carpet green
Money get made (Woo, woo)
These bitches don't ever get saved (Never get saved)
Saint Laurent shades (Saint Laurent shades)
Cookin' up dope, gettin' paid (Cookin' up dope, gettin' paid)

Shawty gettin' laid (Shawty gettin' laid)
She been with me 31 days (31 days)
She like bitches anyways
So we been on the same damn page

Doin' it on a chinchilla, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
You fuckin' a couple of strippers together, yeah (Oh yeah)
Shawty my rider, she down for whatever (Yeah)
Y'all give her capital murder, her swagger killer (Capital murder her swag)
Shawty got more bags than a drug dealer, wait (Shawty got, shawty got more bags)
I put her in a Patek, I put her in the Cs
I'm on a whole 'nother level with her
Had to get a penthouse just for the freaks
So they can all come sleep with us
We don't do nothing that's normal
Everything we do is super gigantic (Pluto)
We don't put on fugazi
Everything we wear is super titanic (Pluto)
I just caught me a wave (Wave)
Feel like a nigga done jumped in Atlantic (I did it)
One hell of a car collection (Collection)
Pulling it up, it's panoramic (Skrrt-skrrt)
Picked her up in a Cayenne
Soon as she got in she ain't have nothing on (Skrrt-skrrt)
Shawty gettin' laid (Made)
She been with me 31 days (Never get saved)
She like bitches anyways (Shades)
So we been on the same damn page (Cookin' up dope)

I took a little E (Yeah)
Got red bottoms sittin' on my feet (31 days)
I ran it up, beep (Ayy)
I got your baby mama knee-deep (Same damn page)
She ain't got no teeth (Took a little E)
She know a young nigga eat beef (Slatt)
She want me to leave (Yeah)
She know I'm not a rat, I got cheese (Woo)
