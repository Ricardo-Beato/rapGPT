5 ContributorsBrick Squad Boyz Lyrics
Consider your girlfriend borrowed
Holla at her tomorrow
She say that I go harder
Good-good brain, the girl way smarter
No disrespect, that's someone's daughter
So happy that I caught her
Got a room at the Ramata
And I heard that homegirl swallow (Break bread)
Old school like the 
Imma fuck all her partners
All her homegirls' slaughter
But you spoil her like a father
It's Gucci 2 times, I can pull 2 dimes at the same time, take her to the same place
Get married and divorced in the same day
Make her hate me in the worst way
(Gucci!)

Brick Squad boys go harder
Brick Squad boys go harder
Ain't no need to call her
She don't wanna be bothered
Brick Squad boys go harder
Brick Squad boys go harder
Baby girl got that good brain, but can't lie, her girlfriend smarter
Brick Squad boys go harder
Brick Squad boys go harder
Ain't no need to call her
She don't wanna be bothered
Brick Squad boys go harder
Brick Squad boys go harder
Baby girl got that good brain, but can't lie, her girlfriend smarter
You might also like
She wanna be my GF, she want me to be her man
I can't trust nobody, so I treat them all the same
Brick Squad boys go harder, you can ask your BM
Visine glasses, and I still couldn't see them
Waka Flocka Gucci, Wooh Da King I'm next
I feel like a bodybuilder, all I do is flex
I been down since day one, still the same from day one
Gotta change hoes like a nigga change clothes, I can't fuck the same ones
I put that on , R.I.P. to Slim D
Never let your soul die, you can live it through me
BSM the gang, screaming niggas know
Disrespect, I'll leave your face like a sniff of blow

Brick Squad boys go harder
Brick Squad boys go harder
Ain't no need to call her
She don't wanna be bothered
Brick Squad boys go harder
Brick Squad boys go harder
Baby girl got that good brain, but can't lie, her girlfriend smarter
Brick Squad boys go harder
Brick Squad boys go harder
Ain't no need to call her
She don't wanna be bothered
Brick Squad boys go harder
Brick Squad boys go harder
Baby girl got that good brain, but can't lie, her girlfriend smarter
Louis belt, Louis scarf, Louis hat, smoking on some Louis drank, and on some Louis-Louis V diamonds
What you sippin? What you drinking on?
Bad bitches say I turn them on
New  turn the lights on
 to the right, I can never be wrong
Ain't for my skin tone, wish a nigga get wrong
If you fuck with me, put my single on your ring tone
Fuck a hater, I give three fucks
Double shots, next round on me put up your cup
You give a damn, shawty, I give a fuck
You gon what
We go harder, nigga this the squad
Waka Flocka!
