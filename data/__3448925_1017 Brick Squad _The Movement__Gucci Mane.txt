4 Contributors1017 Brick Squad (The Movement) Lyrics
My house so big, we playing Where's Waldo
Me and your bitch playing hide and go dick
 she my ride or die bitch
If a nigga catch , he gon die right quick
If them cops go past, hit the gass, and I'm outta here
M6 Beamer like a jet without the landing gear
 like a jewlery store, it's Gucci
 buying new shit
I act stupid, so bitch go get me a tooter
Your daughter is a snotter, so I give the throat game to her
I'm a monster eating lobster and pasta, cause I'm a G
She a model, she like to swallo, cause she a freak

They say Frenchie flexin, yes
It get hotter when I fire, Brick Squad bring the pain
Come at us, why bother, nigga?
Step up, come harder, nigga
, I'm your father, nigga
We do this all day, 
We coming like butter on cornbread
 get her home
 blowing like a sacksaphone
My shirt I take off
I'm on my grind, like Tony Hawk on a skateboard
Pussy never pay for, pussy pay me
Why you got them dice for? Pussy nigga pay me
Frenchie!

I'm so iced up when I give 'm hell
Quarter brick, 20 benzos, what a nigga 
Green chicken team, call it 1017
Mix the soda with the coca, I be on the Lean
I can fit 80,000 in these 7 jeans
All the shooters, they shoot ya 
Waka always running things, 
Mama calling, but I'm working, and them feds lerking
1 2, beat a nigga flat too
You poison, rat food, strip his ass nude
For 1 reason, Flocka Flocka Flocka
Eat a nigga like , light his ass up with the K
Flocka!

Wooh Da Kid my name, 
Supersized strap, for all you small fries
First the crack shit, you niggas stand by
Niggas can't see like a nigga with a glass eye
I pull over for my niggas on lockdown
Fill your  make it out, here's a black round
You don't want no pistol play
So Icey Jack Boys, it's a holliday
Hood bitch told me where a nigga stash
Come and  touch my pack, I just get right back
Better watch what you're saying to a freak bitch
Swerving all around your house, like I'm seasickEmbed
