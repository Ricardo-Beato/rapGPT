10 ContributorsFredo Checks In (Interlude) Lyrics
"We Glory Boyz, Lamron, shawty, all the bitches want we"
Chief Keef, what it do brogod
You know we on top man
Fuck these fuckboys man
Never lack, keep the strap, keep the gat, you know?
Reese Money what it do brogod?
We in this bitch, 300 Glory Boys, you know?
Kenn AON, all or nothing man
We on top, let's get it!
And I’m Fredo Santana by the way...​You might also likeEmbed
