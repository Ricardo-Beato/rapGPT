50 ContributorsFingers Hurting Lyrics
She live in Fort Lauderdale
And I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over
She said "OK, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife
And keep my house clean
I say "Shut the fuck up
Put this dick back in your mouth please"
I don’t see nothing wrong with
Some mouth and lip service
Tunechi in this bitch
I'm tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch
I didn't answer my phone
I said I couldn't get service
My new Nina just told me
That she sick of being a virgin

Bagging up the work
For a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help
Before they leave I check their purses
Sorry for the wait
The confusion, the disturbance
Got me movin' weight
Prostitution, and these verses
Whippin' in the kitchen
In the trap house with my shirt off
I'ma get these millions
And I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin'
Talkin' bout the third ward
The D.A. was a dick
And the Judge was a jerkoff
Got a bad bitch
Body curvy like a curveball
Let her drink too much
Now her pussy taste like Smirnoff
Sleepin' on chinchilla
Boy I'm cozy like a furball
Fuck the other side
Nigga we could have a turf war
Sorry for the wait
Had to drop this part two and shit
Just to let you know
That a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave
On my Roots Part Two shit
Got to let 'em know
That Lil Tunechi still Tunechi, bitch
Bop-bop-bop!
Fuck with me wrong get that hammer
Thank God I'm home from the slammer
Was gone for that hammer
Stompin' the yard like a gamma
Niggas was goin' bananas
I'm calm like a camel
I'm smokin' that strong like a Camel
I bet my life when we gamble
Y'all shippin' keys, we shippin' grand pianos
I'm in that Lam Diablo
Pew, like ammo
I'm gone
Two fingers up, bitch, I'm gone
Rich forever – Jerry Jones
I gotta hustle, keepin' my destiny goin'
Like the House of Deréon
This plane that I'm on
Is private, my very own
So no checkin' my carry-ons
She sent a picture naked, I said "It's on"
You might also like
But she live in Fort Lauderdale
And I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over
She said "OK, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife
And keep my house clean
I say shut the fuck up
Put this dick back in your mouth please
I don’t see nothing wrong with
Some mouth and lip service
Tunechi motherfucker
Tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch
I didn't answer my phone
Said I couldn't get service
My new Nina just told me
That she sick of being a virgin

Now I don't get excited
Nigga, I just get exotic
I don't get invited
To these bitches pity parties
I don't do narcotic
Even though a nigga got it
Countin' all this money
I feel like I got arthritis
Baggin' up the work
For a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help
Before they leave I check their purses
Sorry for the wait
The confusion, the disturbance
Boy we movin' weight
Prostitution, and these verses
Whippin' in the kitchen
In the trap house with my shirt off
I'm gon' get these millions
And I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin'
Talking 'bout the third ward
The DA was a dick
And the Judge was a jerk off
We yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Yeah, you hear us yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Blood gang, nigga
And it's that Sorry 4 the Wait 2, woo
And I'm so sorry for the wait too, yea
Sorry for the wait
Had to drop that part two and shit
Just to let you know
That a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave
Talking Roots part two and shit
Sorry for the wait
Lil Tunechi still Tunechi bitch85Embed
