7 ContributorsSade Lyrics
Girl, huh, you should see the way I play
Ain't even gotta stay
Play some Sade
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

You know I grind hard, you should see
The way I play
You know you run with me, this ain't no
Ordinary day
Just pull up, catch a vibe, baby, you ain't
Gotta stay
We gon' sip this Opus One, we gon' play
Some Sade
I rather be with you than fuckin' off in
The club
Hand on her thigh got her wetter than a
Tub
Pull up, catch a vibe, baby, you ain't
Gotta stay
We gon' smoke a lil' za, we gon' play
Some Sade

You ever made love a kitchen stove?
Gotta shut the spot down, yeah, the
Kitchen closed
Photographic memory, gon' strike a
Pose
I just wanna stand behind you while you
Touch your toes
What started on the counter, ended on
The floor
Said she 'bout to cum again, shit,  I
Counted four
Just tell me how you want it, you gon'
Get that
I'm on the road this week, I'm gon' miss
That
I bet the neighbors know my whole
Name
Yeah, Mr. Knock-The-Bed-Out-The-
Whole-Frame
Smoke a lil' za, make the sex better
Ocean versus the pool, I make her wet
Wetter
Deep conversation, we talk that real shit
We just a vibe when we together, yeah
That chill shit
Put her up on business, and she do the
Same
Fuck a watch, I gave her million dollars'
Worth of game
You might also like
You know I grind hard, you should see
The way I play
You know you run with me, this ain't no
Ordinary day
Just pull up, catch a vibe, baby, you ain't
Gotta stay
We gon' sip this Opus One, we gon' play
Some Sade
I rather be with you than fuckin' off in
The club
Hand on her thigh got her wetter than a
Tub
Pull up, catch a vibe, baby, you ain't
Gotta stay
We gon' smoke a lil' za, we gon' play
Some Sade

She say she like my grind set
I said what about my mindset?
Intellectual conversation, yeah, that
Mind flex
Can't see the vision, you ain't mind yet
Wanna see you live your dreams, I ain't
Tryna stress you
Just follow my lead, baby, let me bless
Ya
Anything you want, everything you need
Kiss you, slap you on your ass every
Time you leave
Talkin' dirty on the phone, late-night
Calls
Took her shoppin' in Capri, we don't do
Malls
Visionary, damn right, I got a real plan
You in a different league, you fuckin'
With a real man
You wanna help me run the world, be my
First lady?
Fuckin' in the White House, now
Wouldn't that be crazy?
Anything you want, everything you need
You babysittin', baby girl, go and pass
The weed
You know I grind hard, you should see
The way I play
You know you run with me, this ain't no
Ordinary day
Just pull up, catch a vibe, baby, you ain't
Gotta stay
We gon' sip this Opus One, we gon' play
Some Sade
I rather be with you than fuckin' off in
The club
Hand on her thigh got her wetter than a
Tub
Pull up, catch a vibe, baby, you ain't
Gotta stay
We gon' smoke a lil' za, we gon' play
Some SadeEmbed
