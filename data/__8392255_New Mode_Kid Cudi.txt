Oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Finally got my head right, it's a new me
It's like I got heaven in my sights now, beauty I see
When it seems it's all too much
And your soul, it can't be rushed, no, no (Yeah, yo)
When the going's gettin' tough
And you know you can't give up, no way (Yeah, ooh-woah)

And I'm in a new mode (Been searchin' for so long now lately)
Another level (I found some peace within)
And I'm in a new mode (I pray for so, so long now lately)
Another level (Oh, let's begin)

Ain't the same as when you met me
I looked inside, I never let me down
Ain't the same as when you left me
Things have changed, you won't forget me now
Ain't the same as when you met me
I looked inside, I never let me down
Ain't the same as when you left me
Things have changed, you won't forget me now
You might also like
These thoughts, they take me over (Yeah, they do, they do)
I sit with thoughts so sober (I do)
Just another night alone, I decide (I decide)
Finally acceptin' me, lovin' who I am inside

And I'm in a new mode (Been searchin' for so long lately)
Another level (I found some peace within)
And I'm in a new mode (And I pray for so, so long now lately)
Another level (New day begins)

Ain't the same as when you met me
I looked inside, I never let me down
Ain't the same as when you left me
Things have changed, you won't forget me now
Ain't the same as when you met me
I looked inside, I never let me down
Ain't the same as when you left me
Things have changed, you won't forget me now

I'ma be alright, hmm
I'ma be alright, hmm
I'ma be alright, hmm
I'ma be alright, hmm
So much more than you know3Embed
