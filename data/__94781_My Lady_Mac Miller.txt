True love is hard to find, so I thought I'd start this rhyme
With a couple bars and lines of leavin' it all behind
I've had all the dimes and all are fine
But now I need the one to call her mine
You know that girl that everybody wants?
But can't have fat ass, nice eyes, high class
I get the last laugh now 'cause she under my arm
Lay down, hittin' Ls, lookin' up at the stars
I tell her, "Listen, I ain't gon' do you wrong
Forget what you hear in all my songs
My old ways is gone, I'ma be real wit'cha
Recently I been lookin' at the big picture
Perfectly framed, see the way I'm workin' the game
Take my name, I'ma share all of my fortune and fame
Beauty or brains, girl, you all the above
True player for real, but now I'm fallin' love

I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
My lady, my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
My lady, my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady

You used to the bullshit, the dudes put you through it
Cupid, never shot up nuisance
See with me my love is with the music
But, baby, you can be the next to it (Yup)
My boys say I'm stupid, I need to move along
And when we fight I hope you use this song to get it right
My moms is gettin' jealous how I feel about her
And the fellas say I could deal without her
See, baby, I ain't playin' around
I don't need cupid dude could have aimed at the ground
'Cause that's real, real
Just had to tell you how I feel
And the party tonights goin' crazy
But I'm just here with my baby
I love the way that she makes me
I'ma just kick wit' her and break trees, 'cause

I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
My lady, my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
My lady, my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady1Embed
