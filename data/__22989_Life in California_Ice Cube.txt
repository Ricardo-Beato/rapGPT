16 ContributorsLife in California Lyrics{*ten seconds of instrumental to open*}
 + (Ice Cube)
Nigga just another day, and I like the way
L.A. to the Bay, livin life in California
Dough... we get that dough
Ohhhh... we gotta get mo'
Nigga just another day (just another day)
AK gunplay (AK gunplay)
L.A. to the Bay (L.A. to the Bay)
Livin life in Killafornia

If Jay-Z can rap about, the NYC
Why can't I talk about the shit I see?
Without Alicia Keys, without going R&B
This ain't Motown, this is R-A-P, nigga
(It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood) Yeah
(Niggas cain't stand if his name ain't good)
(All the way from the Bay to L.A., Inglewood) What?
(This is how it is when you're livin in California)
California swagger, fuck record sales
Industry outlaw like Josie Wales
California, off the corner, I'mma warn ya
I'm the only West coast King, Idi Amin
Get you in the ring I'm shady as Don King
I'm takin all the money, befo' the bell ring (ding)
Before I grab the mic, the fat bitch sing (sing)
It's already over, supernova
I'm Kobe, you the nigga, I'm hoopin over
Know me, big homey, the one and only
Ice Cube don't get airplay
Cause I'm from L.A. and rep where I stay
You might also like(It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood) Beautiful
(Niggas get sprayed, AK'd in this hood) Niggas know
(Bitches don't play certain niggas so good)
(It's real in the field when you fuckin with California)

See it's just another day in my neighborhood
First thing off in the mornin and I'm lookin for that good (yeah)
Stickin to my fingertips, sittin on the hill
And I'm overlookin the city, man this shit is for real
Plenty 'gnac in my cup and the 'llac all fizzy bruh
It'll be a long night, that's what we got these bitches for (Jayo)
Yuh, bounce like it's a earthquake, Nitty shake
Let's see how much noise it make the city make
You see it's just another day in my neighborhood
And the police ain't fuckin with me, knock on wood
For my shoes, cause she just blew my socks so good
Double shot, never knew I'd shoot my Glock so good (pow!)
I rock like coke when they hit
And they just cain't do it but they all wanna spit
Put my Padre head on, but see I tried to warn him
Fuck around boy you know it goes down (in California)

Dough... we get that dough (we get it, get it)
Ohhhh... we gotta get mo'
Livin just another day (just another day)
AK gunplay (AK gunplay)
L.A. to the Bay (L.A. to the Bay)
Livin life in Killafornia
{*car bounces on hydraulics for about 12 seconds*}

Ba-block, ba-block, deep in the slums
Here they come come with the new Chucks on
Click-click, ba-block, ba-block, green in my lungs
Straight from Killa Cali got the one one one
With a tall stack in all black
With that Louis trimmin on our golf cap
Known to make 'em all fall back
It's that - Mr. Fuck Everybody I Can't Stand
And bust random
C-Walkin on another anthem
Tryin to teach these new rappers some manners
Chasin niggas out of the mic booth with a camera
Back at it, loc, it's Da Lench Mob animal, deader than a cannibal
Than a can of blow, bust ya head open like cantaloupe
You niggas is pussy pretend to be, we run the vicinity
Walk in the +Circle+ and lose your virginity
Put these khakis on and get out them speedos
And bow down, cause without us, there wouldn't be no
(California)

We get that dough
Ohhhh... we gotta get mo'
Livin just another day, AK gunplay
L.A. to the Bay, Livin life in Killafornia
Yo, we get that dough
Ohhhh... we gotta get mo'1Embed
