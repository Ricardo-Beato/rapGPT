No airports and no flights, that's how I wanna live my life
Is that aight?
Ten girlfriends and no wife, that's how I wanna live my life
Is that aight?
No sport cars and no ice
Okay, maybe a little ice, we all got a lil' vice
No selfies, just say, "Hi"
I'm so healthy and alive
4L, we them same guys

Equity for my dogs, only time you see gang signs
I'm looking to change lives, I already changed mine
Our ambition just ain't the same size
You pint-sized motherfuckers watching my paint dry in real time
Telling yourself it just takes time
The time's now, stop waiting for the inspiration
They say it's a flaw being impatient but

No airports and no flights, that's how I wanna live my life
Is that aight?
No retweets and no likes, that's how I wanna live my life
Is that aight?
No breakups and no fights
Okay, maybe a few fights, we all gotta choose sides
No selfies, just say, "Hi"
I'm so healthy and alive
4L, we them same guys

I just want peace, I don't want no smoke
And I don't wanna go to 1 OAK, I just wanna go home
And I don't want no free jewelry, I don't want promo
I've been on the road since I turned one-ocho
A hundred people on set, used to be one GoPro
My dad knows a lot of things that his son don't know
But he ain't been to all the places that his son gon' go (Because)

No airports and no flights, that's how I wanna live my life
Is that aight?
Wake up while the sun's still bright, that's how I wanna live my life
Is that aight?
No time spent on timelines
I got me a good book, I told Angel, "Good looks"
No selfies, just say, "Hi"
I'm so healthy and alive
