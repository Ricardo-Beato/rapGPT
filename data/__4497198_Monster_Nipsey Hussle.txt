2 ContributorsMonster Lyrics
As we continue on
The muthafuckin' marathon continues
Every thousand followers on Twitter, got a leak for you niggas
It’s 'cause I do this
Hussle

Gossip, gossip, all I hear is gossip
But everybody know that I'm from Crenshaw and Slauson
In this marathon since my mixtape dropped in
This is for them niggas wondering if I can top it
Uh, I’m I'll as shit, fo' sho' tho'
My Benz coupe stupid, dodo
Showboat, give me cash fo' sho'
If it ain't, my nigga, no go
Fresh back from the fuckin’ UK
I stayed for one week and got paid each day
Shopping in Harrods heard the white boys say
"That, that’s Nipsey Hussle he's massive in the States"
Check out the odds and the obstacles I’ve conquered
Therefore my progress makes me a monster
First one to make a name without the Doctor's co-sign
I'm fine, the streets is my sponsor
And they hold me down quite well
Can't ya tell, pound sign fell
Follow me, holla my name at the show
This is dedicated to the girls front row
When I’m rocking stages and my pants sag low
I ain't mad, go and grab, and go for what you know
Bright lights, different cities every night
Livin' that type of life all the pretty girls like
Fuck but don't wife 'cause they just not right
The type to sell their soul to stand in the spotlight
Long flights got me thinking 'bout the type
Of thoughts through the heads of my niggas that caught life
We all got balls, they caught strikes
And we don't got swag, we got stripes
I took my turf to new heights
And I'm so Slauson Ave. I got it tattooed twice
You might also like
Nigga, huh, the, the marathon continues
Oh, the marathon continues
Oh, the marathon continues
So act like you know, bitch
Bitches, niggas, hoes
Crips and Bloods
Fake Crips and Bloods
Rappers, singers
All you niggas get on this marathon
Road to the riches, you know, huh, huh
Hussle hussle
Gossip, gossip, all I hear is gossip
But all you niggas know that I'm from Crenshaw and Slauson
It's the leak, nigga
See you niggas at 55,000Embed
