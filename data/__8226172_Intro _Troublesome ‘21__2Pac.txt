4 ContributorsIntro (Troublesome â€˜21) Lyrics
In Oakland today, a black musician filed a 10 million dollar claim against two white police officers. Saying, "they assaulted him physically and verbally after arresting him from jaywalking"
I think they used a little bit too much force; because I mean he was already handcuffed and they were still hitting him
It's not the first time these officers have been accused of misconduct. Officer Kevin Rogers, one of those named in the lawsuit did not want to comment on the incident. The other officer Alexander Boyevich, is hospitalized with serious injuries
Hahahahahaha I told you muthafuckas I'd be back hahahahahahaYou might also likeEmbed
