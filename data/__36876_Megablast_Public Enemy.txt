12 ContributorsMegablast Lyrics
Time is gettin' crazy, people clockin' out
They're robbin' all the cribs on a death wish route
Breakin' into cars trying to steal their system
20 pounds on the bar, betcha can't lift 'em
Ya throw two punches, now you got no wind
Hittin' mega pipes, gettin' super stupid thin
Smokin' all the squares, crying all the tears
Cause you're workin' for ya boy, ya came short and full of swears
Ya couldn't make the money 'cause ya smoked up the product
Walkin' round the town, skeptalepsy illaroduct
Can't be trusted cause you're living in the past
Ya should have kept yo ass away from that blast

Oh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit (Megablast)
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit
(Megablast)
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit (Megablast)
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit
(Megablast)
Oh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit

I got a homeboy who is out on the block
He sells more crack than they sell fish at the dock
He runs to every car, thinkin' he's a star
He gets his product snatched by some people in a car
The car pulls off, as he hangs onto the side
Of the car that is in motion, guess his product took a ride
He tried to sell a dime for a thirty dollar bill
Fake gold plate on the back, no frill
Fake Hawaiian suit (and he got) scratched up knees
In his 'fridgerator, bread, water, cheese
An antique fork, how long will it last?
We'll see in twelve minutes when he wants that blast
