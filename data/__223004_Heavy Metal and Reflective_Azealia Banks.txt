Fridgy Froze Kept
It's that fresh bitch
I be in that prissy stone set
With that wet wrist
Flighty bitch that prissy bow
With that necklace
I be "very freaky tickled cherry"
It's that best bitch
I be in that 750 head up
With that hex witch
I could spit that prissy poem
Sex with her breakfast
I could break ya nigga bone!
Wanna bet bitch?
I be V.I.P
I been knew cheddar
You be guest list
I be PYT
You Billie Jean
You been that ex bitch!
Icy with that cicle WHOA!
It's that next shit
You might also likeI be getting several, you be zero
Bet you pressed bitch,
I be looking very heavy metal and reflective
I could get that!

(That's the loveliest thing I've ever heard...)
I be cherry deeky
When I swell up
-Get that best dick

Get that heaven head
Now bless this!

To that Head Bitch
Find me in the borough
If you thorough and that bread flip
I be looking very heavy metal and reflective
I could get that

It's some sex shit

With that bubble and them breasts'
I be looking very
Jiggle Jello in them dresses
I be with the pedi in the puddle reminiscing
I be with that!

Ayo, know you know well

To that Head Bitch
Find me in the borough
If you thorough
And that bread flip
I be very linky
Heavy Metal and Reflective
I could get that
Finally the angels fell
Deep thunder rolled around the shores
Burning with the fires of Orc

I be Cherry Deeky
When I swell up
Get that best dick
I be in Osaka
With that papa
Took that best trip
Buy me Tamagotchi
Sipping Sake and MoÃ«tses
I could get that

Ayo, you know well
I'm with that
Get Rich
I'm in every city
They say Hello
To that Head Bitch
Find me in the borough
If you thorough
If that bread flip
I be very Linky
Heavy metal and reflective
- I COULD GET THAT
(That's the loveliest thing I've ever heard...)48Embed
