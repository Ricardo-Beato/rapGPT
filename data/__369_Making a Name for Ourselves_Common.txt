50 ContributorsMaking a Name for Ourselves Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, me and my man Com' Sense
Rallyin' troops like Joseph Stalin
Where you at, yo?

I'm 'bout to make the name Common Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And I'ma make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"

Yo, yo
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect the rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him

I'm creatin' the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Puttin' together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testin' me
Because you know you can't "F" with me
Steppin' to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposin' yourself to the verbal radiations
Sayin' you can defeat me is nothin' but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be diggin' my styles like fossils of pterodactyls
Who wanna battle?! I'm bad to the bone marrow
The earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MC's who compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch!
What?!

"Steppin' to me is like goin' to the county bein' a neutron"
"I ain't scared of no nigga"

I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunkin' like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles! Rhymin' big words and not sayin' shit
The clique that you came in with, accents you flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced
Than a rapper whose career you could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble, it's mistaken as a weakness
When poetry's in motion, like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard-workin' teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my livin' off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions
"Fuckin' with Canibus"
"Fuckin' with Canibus"
"Fuckin' with Canibus"
"Fuckin' with Canibus"
"Yo, sick with it"

Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Comin' to damage you, spittin' understandable slang at you
I be the all-seein' lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred-sixty degree visual
When the signal is given, MC's get bitten
With venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wicked as Satan worshipers goin' to Catholic church services
You heard of this new lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snaps, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear, black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into 'The Artist Formerly Known As'
You gay-ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, takin' pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now, I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source, chillin' on page forty
Put this in your CD-ROM: www-dot-Canibus-dot-com
You can find me on the internet talkin' to chicks
That was sweatin' me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talkin' mad trash, tryin' to get 'em to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
A Beast from the East Pt. II comin' to see you!
It's time I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Now, that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"
Since I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear
Stay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"2Embed
