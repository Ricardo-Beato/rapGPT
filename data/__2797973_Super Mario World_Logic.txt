Lemme shout out Bobby, 'cause 6ix in there like
"Oh my goodness"
Nah, I just did that for the adlib—keep that (Squad!)
Yeah, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my God!
Yeah, keep all that shit, and this...
I'm like, oh my goodness, oh my—
And this, here we go, here we GO!
Yeah, yeah!

I'm like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my God, I'm coming with the goodness
Acting like I ain't been in it
Like I ain't been pushing my limit
Hold up, wait up, get your weight up!
P-L-P but fuck around get the fade up
They shit is made up, straight up!

Call me Bobby Tarantino living on the level
And I'm prophesizing everything we know
Because of the internet, I made a million and another million
That's word to Gambino
He one of the realest, I swear he the realest
But anyway, back to the subject at hand
I just performed for an hour, performed for an hour
And made myself a hundred grand like...
You might also like
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my God
Wooh! That's lit, that's lit
That's gonna be the hook right there!
Yeah! I'm like, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my God
I'm like, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my God
I just beat that Uncharted 4, lit
Bitch, I been at it, RattPack if you live it
You die by that shit—get it tatted
I think I done had it now, hold up, wait up, leave 'em laid up
This for every single night that I stayed up
Real all the time, nah, this shit never made up
No, it's never made up, no, it's, no, it's straight up!
Straight up, bitch!

I'm like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my God, I'm coming with the goodness
Acting like I ain't been in it
Like I ain't been pushing my limit
Hold up, wait up, get your weight up!
P-L-P but fuck around get the fade up
They shit is made up, straight up!
Yeah, it's that Flexicution, I want retribution
Y'all gone fuck around and make me wake up Lucian
And I don't think y'all ready for the revolution
Boy your shit is pollution, Logic got the solution
Motherfuckers used to hate us, now they sayin' that they made us
Everyone know I'm the greatest
Tell 'em, "Title your album, A Fish Outta Water"
Cause that shit be floppin'—You fuckin' suck...
Number 1 my shit droppin', love it or hate it, they know the name
They know the name cause it's poppin'
Dropped 2 million on my new crib
Now nobody but God can stop us!

Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my God
I'm like, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my God
I'm like, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my God
Fuck, Jurassic Park... lit29Embed
