10 ContributorsHow Hood Is This Lyrics
Burn One, Burn One
Ayee Boy
Ayee
Gucci Mane
How hood is this?
Yea, how hood is this?
Gucci Mane I do this shit
Gucci Mane I do this shit

Gucci Mane, I do this shit
Yo re-up on my wrist and shit
Dont talk about no necklace, cause can no man compare to this
Blue, yellow and white on shit
Aqua water, yellow piss
Visually enhancing diamonds, Flat screen TV's on my fist
Breakfast; lobster tail & grits
Lunch; shrimp scampi, kush & crys
Half a million dollars worth of Jewelry, I'ma walking lick..
Cocaine shawty, churches chicken, I'ma talking brick..
Say you want a artist from the gutter, bitch how hood is this
I'm geeked up, jumping out a Leer, asking what hood is this?
Pittsburgh, it's all good they try me I'ma blitz the bitch!
Took the money, left the Bentley, doubled back & got the Bricks
Say you wanna hear some gangsta shit, well bitch how hood is this? (how hood is this?)
You might also like
Asphalt color Aston Martin on Asantis
Took it to the projects, got it washed by a junkies (how hood is this?)
Light green Davins same color as my money
10 thousand mids coming in, next Sunday (how hood is this?)
Gucci Mane and Gotti, man you know how we kicking
Gucci Mane and Gotti, thats a whole lot of chicken
Gucci Mane and Gotti, thats a whole lot of kushy
Gucci Mane and Gotti, turning coca to cook it

I'm trapping, rapping killing it
I'm packing vacuum sealing it
I'm concealing it and stashing it
Trap house is filled with acid bitch
Gators from lake placid baby
Crazy colored carrot Jakey
Matrix reloaded the bracelet
Damn I'm hurting these niggas faces
My mama call me Gucci
But you (?) Radric Davis
Radric Davis, write it down, I still probably wouldn’t claim yo baby
Hood like a hot wing
Hood like box ring
Hood like a charger on 4’s painted lime green
Half a million on me, not counting jewelry
If I add my jewelry, it would be 1.3
Six feet on beamer drop-top and its nasty
Two junkies washing it for free, man thats priceless
Never met a nigga in a world so shiesty
The fuck boys hate him but dope boys like him
Never met a nigga in a world so shiesty
The fuck boys hate him but dope boys like him
Asphalt color Aston Martin on Asantis
Took it to the projects, got it washed by a junkies (how hood is this?)
Light green Davins same color as my money
10 thousand mids coming in, next Sunday (how hood is this?)
Gucci Mane and Gotti, man you know how we kicking
Gucci Mane and Gotti, thats a whole lot of chicken
Gucci Mane and Gotti, thats a whole lot of kushy
Gucci Mane and Gotti, turning coca to cook it

Gucci Mane La Flare, Yo Gotti the king
Drumma on the beat and them dope boys on the scene
4 deep in the Chevy and they loading them Ks
And Im counting that money, thats a normal day
What the fuck you know about, niggas serving in a trap
Not shit, bitch. you ain't sold a 20 out your mama house
Im with the Gucci Mane, we moving chickens mane
16 for half a pound, fucking call me the Louie mane
Louie (?), trap stacks on that
Got them lemonade diamonds round my motherfucking neck
I ain't never got no chick from no motherfucking labels
I got it outta kitchen, broke it down on a table

Asphalt color Aston Martin on Asantis
Took it to the projects, got it washed by a junkies (how hood is this?)
Light green Davins same color as my money
10 thousand mids coming in, next Sunday (how hood is this?)
Gucci Mane and Gotti, man you know how we kicking
Gucci Mane and Gotti, thats a whole lot of chicken
Gucci Mane and Gotti, thats a whole lot of kushy
Gucci Mane and Gotti, turning coca to cook itEmbed
