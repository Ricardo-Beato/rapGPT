Ear Drummers
(Wop)
Mike WiLL Made-It

If you play, you lay for playin' with me and that's just how I see it (True)
This F&N gon' watch my back for me, that's how I see it (Damn)
If she wink, then she'll fuck and that's exactly how I see it (Ho)
With me, that bitch'll slip, and when she wit' you, she conceited (Woah)
She think she work for Birkin, that's just not the way I see it (Nah)
They trade pussy for purses, that's exactly how I see it (Wow)
It ain't trickin' if you got it, fuck it, that's just how I see it
You can't take it to the grave with you, that's just how I see it (Stop)
My house big as a castle, like a king, I should be greeted (It's Gucci)
A snitch gon' be a snitch, and like a rat, they should be treated (Rule)
We, like, ninety-nine and O, it's likе my squad can't be defeatеd (Well damn)
My young niggas, they super rich, a blind man can see that (Burr)
That ho said she don't fuck with me, but that's not how I see it
Diamonds dance like Michael Jackson, told that ho to beat it
A island, dressed up fresh, no stylin', money keep on pilin' (Wop)
On the charts, I keep on climbin', on TV, you see me shinin' (Damn)
Big ol' diamonds blindin', hard to find me how I'm eatin' (Eatin')
Court-side where I'm seated, VIP, that's how I'm treated (Treated)
When you get the type of chips I get, they love to call you greedy (Greedy)
But the more I get, the more I give and that's just how I see it (Well damn)
Say I'm hidin' behind these Gucci shades, but that's not how I see it (Huh?)
I'm hidin' behind these Cartiers, but I can't let 'em peep it (Nah)
Limo tint, can't let them see me, that's just how I see it (I see it)
Keep some snakes, can't let them sneak me, got a section full of demons (Demons)
Preachers, post-reverends, deacons, doctors tryna treat 'em (Treat 'em)
He DOA for playin' with me, but that's just how I leave him
That just how I see it (See it), that's just how I see it (See it)
If you play, you lay for playin' with me and that's just how I see it (Well damn)
That's just how I see it (Huh?), that's just how I see it
He DOA for playin' with me and that's just how I see it (It's Gucci)You might also likeEmbed
