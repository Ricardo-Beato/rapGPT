4 ContributorsJ and G Lyrics
(Zaytoven)
And I do nothin' but wife it
Tap it two times if I like it (Huh)
Yeah, on the waterbed, legs behind her head, yeah
So she doin' yoga, girl, get it, yeah, yeah

I can't stand your baby, tell me, can you?
Ride shotgun, just call me Rambo
Doggy style, my Cocker Spaniel (Rrr)
Big Guwop, I'm hard to handle (Gucci)
And I'll fuck you on the interstate, no bras on our dinner date (No)
Can you curl my toes and suck my soul out 'til I hyperventilate?
Can I ride you 'round through East Atlanta?
Orange Ferrari, Tropicana
Beat it up like I'm Evander
Black tinted windows, cherry Phantom (Damn)
A scaredy-cat, she scared of that
'Wop turned down, can't tell me that
She sexy and I give her that, I catch her, won't give her back (Mwah)
Crazy sex, exotic places
Brazilian wax, she shavin' that
Ménage à trois with different races
Exclusive beach, we chill in that (Yeah)
I let her shop until she drop and I know that she feelin' that (It's Gucci)
Just toot it up and keep it steady while your nigga drillin' that (Haha)

Got ass like your mama, huh (Got ass like your mama)
She asked if I wanna cum (She asked if I wanna cum)
She ass shakin' for the comma, comma, comma
She nasty, I know she wanna
Rollie, Rollie, mama, that hoochie, huh
She knew what she wanna do
Don't know what to do with me

Yeah, he just want J and Gucci, ha
I bought her Js and Gucci
She know it's all about the Benjis, Bentleys, Rollies
We make a scene, actin' up, throw it back, no one hit better
She want me hit it while she handstandin'
I'm standin' up, mannin' up
Stackin' hundreds, yeah, yeah, I river dam it, wet-wet
She ask me why it's so cold, put my Gucci on, brr, yeah, yeah
All I know, that ass fat
She wanna fuck and that's that
Popped her off of SnapChat (Yeah)
She know she the one, my niggas threw a cloud of ones
With your dirty mind, get it dirty done
I rock Gucci shades
I fuck her in my Js, though
I just give her game
She just wanna play somethin'
Got ass like your mama, huh
She asked if I wanna cum (Cum)
She ass shakin' for the comma, comma, comma
She nasty, I know she wanna (Wanna)
Rollie, Rollie, mama, that hoochie, huh
She knew what she wanna do
Don't know what to do with meEmbed
