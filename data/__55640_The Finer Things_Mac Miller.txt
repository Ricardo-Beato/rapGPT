24 ContributorsThe Finer Things Lyrics
Yeah, Mac Miller, ayy (Uh)
You know the finer things in life, you know (They know, they know)
Sometimes you gotta kick back and enjoy that shit
Look, just relax (Roll that  up) (It's summertime, bitch, haha)

I like sittin' in shotgun, deuce on a L (Deuce on a L)
Parents not carin' 'cause they used to the smell
Classy-ass women, fresh-ass linen (Yeah)
Hot summer days with a pool I can swim in (Cheah)
A good spot to kick it (What?), a case of 40's
Them homies always havin' good stories (Yep)
The beer bottles with the twist-off caps (Uh-huh)
When old people tell you that they listen to rap
I love days I can sleep in (Sleep in), four day weekends (Weekends)
Hoes puttin' they clothes back on, you peekin' (I see you, haha)
Blunt rides, with a mixtape bumpin' (Uh-huh)
I love makin' love in public
And when the hip-hop legend tour comin' to your town (Comin' to your town)
Findin' a crispy-ass twenty on the ground (Yep)
Walkin' when the sun out, watchin' Run's House (That was a good show, haha)
Or action movies when the villain pull his gun out

The best things in life is the free ones
The little things, everybody need some (Haha)
The finer things make you feel better (Yeah, better)
But no one ever seem to remember (Yeah)
The best things in life is the free ones (Uh-huh)
The little things, everybody need some (Ha-ha)
The finer things make you feel better
But no one ever seem to remember (What else, uh)
You might also like
I like sleepin' in class and cheatin' to pass (Uh-huh)
Hoes walkin' in the halls and you reach for they ass (Sup?)
Fast food lines when they movin' so quickly (What? So quickly)
When your weed man hit you with some sticky
Street performers, warmin' up the corners
Sellin' by the ounce, then pinchin' by the quarter (Gimme that)
When some kicks on sale (Uh-huh)
Wakin' up in the mornin' with a shitload of mail
The wake up, the bake up, chillin' while you face blunts
Goin' in blowed for your shape-up like, "Say what?" (Say what?)
Blog put your tape up, get a good review
When dumbass people tell you what you shouldn't do (Fuck y'all)
When she rub my head while I'm between her knees, haha
Gettin' love from the people overseas (Ciao)
Haters tryna hate, but they got nothin' to say (Yeah)
It's just the little things that get me through the day (What?)

The best things in life is the free ones (The free ones)
The little things, everybody need some (Everybody need some)
The finer things make you feel better (Make you feel better)
But no one ever seem to remember
The best things in life is the free ones (The free ones)
The little things, everybody need some (Everybody need some)
The finer things make you feel better (What?)
But no one ever seem to remember
Like I said before, it's your boy, Mac Miller
They tryna tell me I couldn't do this beat
You know what I said? I ain't say nothin'
I just went in the booth and did it
Somebody tell Will to get some malt liquor next time (Haha)1Embed
