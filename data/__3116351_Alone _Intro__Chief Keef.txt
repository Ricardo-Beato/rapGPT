20 ContributorsAlone (Intro) Lyrics
You like to fuck, yeah yeah
Smoked dope 'til you couldn't, yeah yeah
Bang bang
Bang bang
Let's get it
Catch up
Ohh yeah yeah yeah
Ohh yeah yeah yeah

You should wanna go and want to live your life
I am not trying to read you your rights
You feeling like Chief Turbo did you wrong
You thought that you had Turbo in your palm
If I got you baby girl, it's for the night
You should want to go and live your life
You know that my bitches come in eighths
I am not trying to read you your rights
You crying, baby what is going on?
You feeling like Chief Turbo did you wrong
You thought that you had Turbo in your palm
You got trust issues, girl you are not alone

You feeling like Chief Turbo did you wrong
You thought that you had Turbo in your palmYou might also like3Embed
