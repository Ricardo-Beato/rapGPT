I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm onto Indiana
I heard it in the radio now
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas, they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I parked my Range Rover
Slightly scratched your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch, you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner"
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that, he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
"When it's over, it's over"
And, bitch, I'm back out my coma
You might also like
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I wanna phone home
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas, they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

I heard you need a new fad (A new girl, a new girl)
I heard you need a new stack (A new girl, a new girl)
I heard you need a new phone (A new girl, a new girl)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (A new girl, a new girl)

Callin' up your uncle's place (A new girl, a new girl)
Shit's all over the place (A new girl, a new girl)
I don't hear your phone (A new girl, a new girl)
Oh, I wanna phone home (A new girl, a new girl)227Embed
