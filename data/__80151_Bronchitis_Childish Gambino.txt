44 ContributorsBronchitis Lyrics
Fiji water and a box of old Raisinets
I got a real taste for dyin' but I ain't do it yet
I tried to watch The Artist with my girlfriend
But instead, I lost the battle with some Nyquil
Playing Double Dribble with my older cousin
Now I'm ballin' every day so dude that's gotta stand for something
But it doesn't change the subject
Man, I'm hustlin', sandals cuttin' up
My ankles, please and thank you
Demons hate you when you angel
Never been to prison, but I serve a sentence
Grind—grind, when you—
I'm sharin' experiments with Seventh Day Adventists
And on the seventh day, I'mma show y'all what the event is
Dollar signs, bottom line
Speak the truth and everybody gon' hate you
Unless it's funny
That's how I used to make money
I don't roll with the old, yeah they want something from me
Why the flow so dummy, why do hoes still love me?
I don't know, don't bug me
On patron or bubbly or power, old culture
Ain't nobody sober
My mama don't drink but she kill me over soda
Damn homie, man you famous like Kony
My cousin bang Camp man (my cousin bang Camp man)
ATLienated myself about a month
Just enough to get, to get my rows in a duck
Just enough to make a faithful man wanna fuck
Girls be tweetin' me their pictures, man I gotta look
And most of 'em couldn't handle the panels in my comic's book
This rapper's book, this writer's book
They kinda shook, it's not a hook
They kinda shook, it's not a hook

There's an edge to the wind
Cutting into my skin
And the air's like an icicle
As the night starts to fall

Uh, no excuses or apologies
Ain’t no way in hell they ain’t gon' say that I ain't body this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
Ain’t no way in hell they ain’t gon' say that I ain't body this
Let ‘em know
Uh, no excuses or apologies
Ain’t no way in hell they ain’t gon' say that I ain't body this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
Let 'em know17Embed
