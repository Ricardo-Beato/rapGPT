4 ContributorsIntro Lyrics
Lots of Lil' Kim see you comin'
She wanted to do her thing..
She writes..

She was like ''Yo i was rolling with a bunch of little dudes,you know'' around the way or the corners or whatever and i was like ''Yo wanna suck it on and get my foot right where  Imma leave the door open put y'all on and it's all about your rap bums you know what i'm saying,you handle it how you wanna handle it.''
If i can't make the write rhymes i can't make 'em want it, you know what am saying, if it's given to you on a silver platter, you can't always expecting to be given to you, i took the hard way members, i took Lil' Kim she wanted to do her thing, she writes,she was like ''Yo i need to get my joint out, you feelin' me?''

Lots of Lil' Kim see you comin'
She wanted to do her thing..
She writes..

''This album is dedicated to all my peoples in the struggles you know what am sayin'?''
