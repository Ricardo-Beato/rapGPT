Mike Willy with me, nigga
Big Guwop home (Ayy)
We no longer miss you, ayy, yeah (Skrrt)
I know Guwop home (We home, baby)
We all no longer miss you, yeah
(Mike WiLL Made-It)
I can't wait (Ooh)
(Zaytoven)

Dream, it's a young nigga dream, yeah (Oh)
Money talk like I'm Charlie Sheen, yeah (Wop, woo)
I'm a blood but I got on blue jeans (It's Wizzop, woo)
Nigga act so tough, it's startin' the scene, ooh (Uh-uh, uh, brrt)
In blue flame, yeah, the Trap God throwin' green rain
Nice guy, mean chain, pull up in a cream Range
Orange seats, orange feet, what do all that orange mean?
Old rich-ass nigga, I got everything (It's Gucci)

Rose gold watch, but my bottle pink gold (Burr)
Three red hoes walkin' 'round in red robes
Can't, can't, can't stay the night, I'm not the type to be on Skype, ho
Wrote me off, said that I was gone, that was a typo
Take a white girl out a trailer, make her Iggy (Iggy)
Take, take, take a black bitch outta Magic, make her Nicki (Nicki)
Pissy yellow Rollie, baby, pissy in her feelings (Pissin')
My young bitches show respect, they call me Mr. Millions (Woah)
Brown skin chick and she love to wear purple (Purp')
Her nails purple, lips purple, pussy hair purple (Man)
Big titty Amazon in my black Benz (No job)
I'm a rich black man, got a couple white friends (Wizzop)

Old rich-ass nigga, I got everything (It's Gucci)

My teeth white like a toilet tissue (Ayy)
Stop the cappin', boy, you know you miss her (Ayy)
We hit the lobby, then we saw you kiss her (Ayy)
Lil' mama crazy, she gon' try to kill you (Ayy)
I got the weed, bring the molly with you (Oh)

You talk to 12, we gon' off your body (Uh)
You trippin', boy, you need some knowledge in you (Uh)

Livin' good, everyday my birthday (Slatt)
Pockets full of money, Master P, ayy (Woo, huh)

Call the dentist day, pull up to the public, come and see the bae (Ah)
Run it up to the top, get out and ran it back to the top (Yeah)
