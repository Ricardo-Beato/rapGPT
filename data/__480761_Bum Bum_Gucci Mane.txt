10 ContributorsBum Bum Lyrics
Uh
It's Gucci
Livin' Legend
I'm a legend

I'm glad that this game so easy to me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
God thanks for sending this dope to me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Got his F&N in his car with me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
God thank you for sending this bomb to me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum

I'm rollin' and I'm gone off ecstasy
Hoes keep saying I'm sexy man
I don't believe nothin' I see or hear
Cause half of that shit ain't real to me
I got a nigga rollin' with me he'll kill for me
I got another nigga like to do deals for me
My daddy was a hustler apple don't fall far from the tree
And I'm Gucci Mane my son is gone be a G
(Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum)
Got that gun with me
Got two hundred round drums in the car with me
I'm bustin blunts got ten cigars with me
I'm gettin' head got a Porno star in car with me
You might also like
I'm glad that this game so easy to me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
God thanks for sending this dope to me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Got his F&N in his car with me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
God thank you for sending this bomb to me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum

Like MJ in Thriller man I dance with monsters
Even right now it's a thief amongst us
Sometimes I know that it's a snitch amongst us
And they gone come out and then my goons gone hunt ya
I got straps like Super Contra
White couch, headshot, decorate your fun-ture
Oops I meant furniture but damn I fronted ya
He ran off with the pack so I had to punish him
Torture two days and I need some answers
Chain so sick probably got breast cancer
Yellow diamond Rollie time piece bananza
I'm balling hard R. Kelly party fiesta
R. Kelly numbers, man ask my investors
Sixteen year old white girls to stretch ya
And you can't comprehend cause I'm too over your head bruh
Seven days a week I'm gone pull up in a red car
I'm super duper high and I'm super successful
Hundred pounds I break it down five pounds the extra
Bullets go through ya head 
I'm talking to ya now but I dont like to lecture
I'm glad that this game so easy to me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
God thanks for sending this dope to me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Got his F&N in his car with me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
God thank you for sending this bomb to me
