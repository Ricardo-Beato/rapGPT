(Again and again and again and again)
Ol' ratchet-ass bitch (Do it again, do it again)
(Fuck me) I see you out there
(Fuck me) Tryna get your hustle on
(Fuck me) Ain't no nigga gonna pay your muthafuckin' bills, bitch
(Fuck me) Pay your own shit, I don't give a fuck, ho
(Baise-moi) (Do it again, do it again)
Mac Miller, tell these hoes what's up, man (Fuck)

She sayin', "Fuck me, fuck me"
She like it rough and that's rugby
I'm partyin' where there's drugs free
This life I live, it don't come cheap
Leave a handprint on her buttcheek
She give me head while I puff trees
I'm on drugs, she on drugs, her nose just got bloody (Woo)
Sniffin' coke lines off my dick, she ridin' on that train (Train)
She crushin' down that powder, I'm puffin' on this sour
Been fuckin' her for hours and I still ain't got my nut (Nut)
You fuckin' with that molly
She ain't gon' let you bust, ugh (Blaow)
Give me some while I hit the blunt
I'm in your spirit, let me lift it up
If Daddy come, get my shit and run
He gon' see my ass, go get his gun
You a devil, bitch, let me tell you that
Feel like I been to hell and back
You textin' me, addicted, you need me, you miss it
She crazy, she nasty, every day she harass me
I'm fuckin' her to sleep and then she pay for my taxi
Goddamn, the Sun is comin' up
That's the last time that I'm gon' be fuckin' with them drugs, yup
