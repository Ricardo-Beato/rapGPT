2 ContributorsGet Your Shit Together LyricsNew York City. The bells you hear are ringing to warn the people to evacuate the city as enemies approach
Awwwwwwww yeah yeah yeah!
Flavor flav back in your face with the hot track boy
Get it, get it, uh, what?
What’s goin’ on?
I don’t know
What’s really goin’ down?
Y’all don’t know
Between the east and the feds
Heads don’t know
But you can bet some of these heads be the first to go
Between 18 and 30 pray it don’t get dirty
Now I got some new cats hearin’ me
That never heard me
11:30 do the math
Damn, here come the draft
But I’m at the age where my fightin’ is half assed
Shit, my flags always at half mast
Need you ask?
While some of y’all laugh
But I see war lining these young cats up for bodybags
And these so called thugs masquerading in drag
Cause now the feds checkin’ all them headrags
Hopin’ this gung ho thing last, uh
Cold and dark is the weather, peoples
Get your shit together

We gotta fix ourselves up, fix ourselves up according to the way things are now... now- now- now
Cold and dark go the weather
I never fix my mouth to say chickens
Told y’all in terrordome the clocks tickin’
From all sides come the wicked
Governments, fundamentalists
But how you gonna kill the innocent?
Between terrorists and CIA hit lists
Like my man Uno says, beware the false prophets
Gotta be smarter than this
They say war is a profit
With loved ones missed
But death is a debt
None of us ain’t seen war yet
Be careful what y’all ask for
War is hell and hell is war
All them bling bling things, throw ‘em in the river
All that thugged out shit y’all can’t deliver
Seen four planes kill everyday folks
I guess 911 ain’t no joke
Wall street cryin’ broke
Was it God or the devil who spoke?
Old vampires hit the new empire
Had the sky cookin’
Brooklyn had no other choice but to stare and keep lookin’
City smile missin’ two front teeth
While some of y’all still talkin’ about beefs
Over who? What? Soundscan
This month y’all sound scared
Guessin’ where the party at
While downtowns wonderin’ where them bodies at
Cold and dark is the weather, peoples
Get your shit together
We’re not gonna be exterminated
(On)
Come on
Ladies and gentlemen we got Johnny Juice on the ones and twos (On)
The drummer go
The drummer go (On)
The bass go
The drummer go (On)
Now how you sell soul to a soulless people who sold their soul?
Keep the people from bein’ sheeple
Followin’ hollow voices to tomorrow's sorrow
Women have nurtured and birthed the earth, uh
Man has killed many for land and worse
Women got a cycle that’s spoken for, uh
Man got a period, it’s called war
May the power go to everyday people
May war have no sequel, live
Reverse the word you get evil
Cause people wanna live against evil
Avoid the third world war
Biological bombs hundred times worse than vietnam
So what you gonna do?
So what you gonna do?
If you was on that plane
Both sides would’ve killed your ass too
To my peoples
Stay on your P's and Q's
Get your shit together
Where’s your head at?
Cold and dark go the weather
Get your shit together
Get your shit together
Where’s your head at?
Cold and dark go the weather
Get your shit togetherEmbed
