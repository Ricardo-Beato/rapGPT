16 ContributorsPretty Young Girl Lyrics
The levee busted
New Orleans, a catastrophe
America, how long we got?
'Cause I'm tryna find her
(There was a pretty young girl) Is that you?
(There was a pretty young girl) Ayo, anyway
(There was a pretty young girl) With no longer delay
That boy Nasir and Chauncey

Long braids, brown eyes (There was a pretty young girl)
Weight 135, she like 5'5 (There was a pretty young girl)
I see them thighs on her (There was a pretty young girl)
Make me wanna multiply
She's a queen, her dad a G, I know hе rock to Nas

And I, uh, she was so fly
Like she comе from Queens, or maybe L.I
I tried to find that woman, no later than tomorrow
Her body shaped like a Jean Paul Gaultier perfume bottle
When I find her, I'ma roll through, smooth in the Ghost coupe
Make shorty hop in, listen to BIG's vocals
See if I get a sign of intellectual
See if she rude, if she wild, if she sexual
If we caught a vibe, that'd be incredible
We probably break box springs, near hot springs like we on edibles
I would fit her in my schedule
If she is for real solid, nothin' else is acceptable
Slide up to Malibu, paddleboats in Pacific Coast
Havin' her swim in Atlantic water, it's less cold
I make her listen to poetry, hit a jazz club
Asked her would she leave if I was down to my last dub
I gotta find that girl, what block she be on?
Heard she was last seen in Rome, plane hoppin' in Florence
(There was a pretty young girl)
I think she right for me and I don't even know her
I mean the one time I seen her, she was naturally glowin'
That's why I made this song, told the label promote it
So she can hear it, 'cause even if she don't like rap
This still gon' find her right where she's at
The one with

Long braids, brown eyes (There was a pretty young girl)
Weight 135, she like 5'5 (There was a pretty young girl)
I see them thighs on her (There was a pretty young girl)
Make me wanna multiply
She's a queen, her dad a G, I know he rock to Nas

And if you're listenin' right now (There was a pretty young girl)
You know what to do (There was a pretty young girl)
Post this up right now (There was a pretty young girl)
@ me, hahaha
There was a pretty young girl
There was a pretty young girl
There was a pretty young girlEmbed
