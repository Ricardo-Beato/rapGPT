20 ContributorsDirty Mack Lyrics
Dirty Mack!

There's a new girl on my street
And I'ma introduce her to my meat
Told my homeboy I was scoping, hoping
To crack them legs wide open
Ready to break that thang in half
Hit it with the shaft
Take a bath and I'm out, yeah
Better keep the Trojan
And if the sex was good, still be the hoe's friend
Fucked around and told my plan to the man
Sitting next to the goddamn man
How was I to know son
That the negro would run and tell the 4-1-1
With a big fat grin
Talking 'bout all the hoes that I ran up in, huh
Broke a nigga' plan like dishes
'Cause now the bitch is getting suspicious
She know I fuck hoes outa habit
Who framed Cube? Mothafuck Roger Rabbit
'Cause I couldn't have and got stabbed in the back
By a black ass dirty mack...
You might also like
And if you didn't know it's like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
Yeah nigga you didn't you know it was like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack...

There goes the Billboard, pull it
And see if I'm still #1 with a bullet
What the fuck do I see?
It looks like the Predator
Is gettin' dissed by the editor
Look, the vanilla wafer caper
Is to lynch a nigga on paper
But I'm much too black for the god damn cracker
Huh! Dirty Macker
Even the Guardian Angels got mental
But never seen their ass walking through South Central
Little superhero don't let me catch ya
I fuck around and wetcha
Try to dirty mack me out
Try to take food out my kid's mouth
You're lucky that my people are stronger than your evil
Or your ass woulda got the heave, hoe
Out the do, the 187 tag's still on your toe
So act like you know
That nigga that's known to jack
Devils in little red hats
Motherfuckin dirty macks
And if you didn't know it's like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
Yeah nigga you didn't you know it was like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack...

Don't come the O.G. way with that 'he say she say'
Bitch, hit the freeway, dirty macks get tossed
'Cause I'll fuck around, and jump your ass like Kris Kross
Just might blast, snake in the grass
Get a shank up the ass
Found in a trunk of funk
Pale and stiff as a philly blunt
What more do you want you done fucked up the plot
And deserve just what you got
'Cause I'm hotter than Tobasco
You little ass hoe
Now I gotta do you like Glass Joe
TKO now you see they fall on canvas
'Cause you scandalous
Don't know who the man is
Ice Cube-a jack
The wack ass Dirt Mack

And if you didn't know it's like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
Yo Savage didn't you know it was like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
I suppose you don't know it's like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack...3Embed
