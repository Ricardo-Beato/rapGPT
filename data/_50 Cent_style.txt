Damn, you gotta go get somethin' to eat, man
I'm hungrier than a motherfucker, man
Ayo, man
Damn, what's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm down, man, he coming
Ah! (Oh, what the fuck?)
Ah, son, pull off, pull off!

Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles, I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say "only God can judge me," 'cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie? (Homie)

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
Hommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me133Embed

Then he was thinking I was scared, nah nigga not me
They don’t understand I was raised by the vultures
Kids laughing like hyenas in a crib full of roaches
Call grandmami "mommy" cause mommy already dead
Daddy been missing since I was a little kid
Now who dared go there playing games with the orphan
They know my pedigree, test me I’mma off ‘em

Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying

I split a nigga head, I'm a grease monkey with it
My momma told me "Baby Boy, the Lord going to bless us"
The dope bought us shit the food stamps couldn't get us
Man, they don't understand, we were just trying to make it
But where I'm from, when you want shit, you got to take it
I'm a Trojan of War, I get it done like Achilles
My Tre Pound will cut a nigga down on the str-id-eets (streets)

A few shooters with me, down to go for the fall
I say "Get'em!" they get to killing like I'm running the court
Then get down with these around. The hulks in your throat

Money buys guns, paranoia comes

Friends turned foes, Daddy girl's turn hoes
In the penitentiary hearts turn cold
Some turn snitch for State's evidence

I miss my Fendi chick - used to be a Wendy's bitch
I had to supersize her; now she lookin' proper
The price of good pussy ain't always worth it
It can make you insane or get you murdered
And shorty layin' on her back while your blowin' trial
So don't trust a big butt and a smile (Naaah!)

And this is e'ryday - won't stop till I'm old and grey
I drop in the M.I.A.; pop when I'm on my stay
Shop, then I'm on my way; first class to the A
I got a show later today; a small paper to play
I'm too grown for rookie shit, too covered to get pussy whipped

I bet that dope go before that crack, I bet my money stack
I bet yo bitch wanna roll with 50
I bet if I said I'm going to the hotel she'd go with me
I bet you really love her man you think she wouldn't come
She got your pussy wooped, her head game, it got you sprung
I'm taking all bets, through all sets I be a bookie
That have to be ten percent off the top, fucking rookies

They don't know the formula, they ain't on the hot 500
They like me!
