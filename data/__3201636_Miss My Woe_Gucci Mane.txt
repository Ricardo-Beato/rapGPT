36 ContributorsMiss My Woe Lyrics
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
It's Gucci

Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
Always stay on 10 like the 6 and the 4
I still can't believe you won't be hitting my phone
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
And I said one time, one time for the real ones (for the real ones)
Why they always die so soon? (so soon)
Why they gotta go so fast?
They don't make enough like you
So I took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe, huh
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe
Got money for bail, got money for bail
I won't stay in jail, I won't stay in jail
They want me to lose but they won't prevail
Damn I miss my dog man he should be here

Fresh outta jail, made bail for the tenth time
Shoulda been said something cause it's been time
You see me smiling but I'm crying on the inside
Thinking bout my homies locked down on the inside
I've been spared so many times, could've been died
Coulda lost my sanity, my brain been fried
It's so hard to understand when it's God's plan
And it's not in my hands but in God's hands
Free my nigga Putang and free Papa Joe
And every soldier ten toes who ain't never told
And free my nigga Slick Ralph and my Uncle Grant
Lord knows I'm asking for a lot but bring my niggas back
You might also like
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
Always stay on 10 like the 6 and the 4
I still can't believe you won't be hitting my phone
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
And I said one time, one time for the real ones (for the real ones)
Why they always die so soon? (so soon)
Why they gotta go so fast?
They don't make enough like you
So I took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe, huh
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe
Got money for bail, got money for bail
I won't stay in jail, I won't stay in jail
They want me to lose but they won't prevail
Damn I miss my dawg, man he should be here

Nobody ever kept it real with me like Shawty Lo
In ATL, your memory will never let it go
I'm holding on to them late nights in the studio
And every call, every show, and every video
R.I.P. to Slim Dunk, we miss you, Mario
We tryna move on but it still hurt though
We try to come together but it won't work though
'Cause you's the most important piece to the puzzle
I was in my cell, when I heard the news 'bout Bankroll
Now everybody tryna be like Bankroll
But they broke the mold, when they made my nigga Bankroll
I know I look like I'm all good but I ain't though
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe
Always stay on 10 like the 6 and the 4
I still can't believe you won't be hitting my phone
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
And I said one time, one time for the real ones (for the real ones)
Why they always die so soon? (so soon)
Why they gotta go so fast?
They don't make enough like you
So I took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe, huh
Took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe
Missing my woe, huh, missing my woe
Got money for bail, got money for bail
I won't stay in jail, I won't stay in jail
They want me to lose but they won't prevail
Damn I miss my dawg, man he should be here3Embed
