14 ContributorsBeethoven Lyrics
This pistol sing like Beethoven, Beethoven
This pistol beat like Zaytoven, Zaytoven
These pistols sing like Beethoven, Beethoven
This pistol beat like Zaytoven, Zaytoven
What's up in my bank roll? Rainbows
Like Wop and Flash I hate hoes, I hate hoes
$2000 for my rain coat, my rain coat
I'm down for life like Fabo, like Fabo

They always gossiping, I hate hoes, I hate hoes
I'm smoking on the lime green out the rainbows
Pour 6 in my cotton candy Faygo
I swear this shit darker than my uncle  Lano
And I swear my uncle  Lano is a black motherfucker
They see Chief So, they like there go that fat motherfucker
What is it you spin, bitch it's crack motherfucker
I ain't talkin' to vis I got that act motherfucker
And this Mac motherfucker

This pistol sing like Beethoven, Beethoven
This pistol beat like Zaytoven, Zaytoven
These pistols sing like Beethoven, Beethoven
This pistol beat like Zaytoven, Zaytoven
What's up in my bank roll? Rainbows
Like Wop and Flash I hate hoes, I hate hoes
$2000 for my rain coat, my rain coat
I'm down for life like Fabo, like Fabo

Who that at my door, that's Tadoe
Them folks ain't bring the pesos? My day blows
How I turn shit up, yeah the speakers, they blow
Sosa turn shit up, they say he tweaking, they know
Only time I chase is at the bank, ain't got time to chase hoes
NDC I need some poles, meet me at the Fuego's
I take 'em and box 'em up, these hoes I crate those
Ever since my niggas died I'm flexin you know I can't go
Poured up stuntin' I'm gon show out
I took your money it was a no show, ouch
You got the right money, I come through standing on the couch
For these other niggas, no I cannot vouch
All this money, I'm a kangaroo, it's in my pouch
Bitches in my house, tell 'em hoes get out
Hop out, bow down, boy respect me now
You would think that I was Wop, how my wrists bling blaw

This pistol sing like Beethoven, Beethoven
This pistol beat like Zaytoven, Zaytoven
These pistols sing like Beethoven, Beethoven
This pistol beat like Zaytoven, Zaytoven
What's up in my bank roll? Rainbows
Like Wop and Flash I hate hoes, I hate hoes
$2000 for my rain coat, my rain coat
I'm down for life like Fabo, like FaboEmbed
