Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Money earned in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, baby girl, gold chains

I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I ain't never did a thing
Getting money, rocking chains
You'll never feel the same
We the thugs in the game
I don't never feel pain

Eighteen-wheeler gorillas
Black with gold chains, pitch bird like Steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money, screaming, "Encore"
Spending nights with a prime whore
But that's the bitch that you're blind for
Celebrating on a whim, nigga
Pain is Pac, Above the Rim, nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas
'Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga
She wasn't fucking none of them niggas
So now we even like a hem, nigga
Put your freedom over failure
Tryna find my Griselda (La Madrina)
Might as well, they gon' nail you
Mama screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor
As the feds knock at your door
You might also like
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a bunch of gold chains
And I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring

Pain is joy when it cries
It's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story chilling
Spare the women and the children
Hear the scribbles of the villain
Yuugh, this is drug dealer brilliance


Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
But my tribe don't quest like love
Came in this bitch with a mask and a glove
And a team of lawyers to run the train on a judge
It's no risk without gain
It's no trust without shame
It's no us without 'caine
Push, my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Trey-eight on, could've been Trayvon
But instead, I chose Avon
Powder-face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup
Woo, it's a match made in heaven
All that's missing is the reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a bunch of gold chains
And I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring31Embed
