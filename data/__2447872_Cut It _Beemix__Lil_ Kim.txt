6 ContributorsCut It (Beemix) Lyrics
I'm solid gold, they gold plated
These basic bitches so overrated
And They whole life be fabricated
Please cut it
Amputate it
This year that fuck shit will not be tolerated
G's move in silence so my moves can't be calculated
Run up the check like I'm Nike
These bitches don't like me
But they nigga wanna take me shopping
Ferrari, Lamborghini, Audi R8
Take a guess at which one I'm copping
Ran off on the plug so many times
I swear that he won't stop calling
Foreign horses in the driveway
Use a chauffeur for the highway
Got a .50 Cal in his Birkin bag
And I'll sick em on you like Cujo
We are not cut from the same cloth
Bitch I'm from Mars like Bruno
Got a main nigga, side nigga
Sugar daddy give me everything
That cash money, that dope money, That Amex swiping everything
(Like Swaaa) I just burned down Loubiton
(Swaa) I burned down the Chanel
(Swaa) a hundred bodies in Versace
(Swaa) head shots in Givenchy
Whipping the foreign like Ricky Bobby
Like residing in a Maserati
Serving the block like Cal Bungie
I got the wave like California
You might also like
I got the...
I got the wave
I got the...
I got the wave like CaliforniaEmbed
