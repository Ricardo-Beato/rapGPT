High as light
Tell my baby I'm back in town
High, high, my light
Tell everybody I'm back in town
High, highlight
Tell my baby I'm back in town, town
Highlight
We only makin' the highlights
Tell lil' mama, tell lil' mama
That I only want my whole life to only be highlights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell lil' mama, tell lil' mama
That I only want my whole life to only be highlights
Can we play that back one time? (Highlight)
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, oh no (Highlight)
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro (Highlight, highlight)
So I could play that shit back in slow mo (Slow motion)
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro, go
We only makin' the highlights
(Slow motion, slow motion, slow motion)
Dying in the sunlight
We only makin' the highlights
Tell lil' mama, tell lil' mama
That I only want my whole life to only be highlights
Yeah, just in
You might also like
One life, one night
Uh
Highlights
Sound like me
Livin' the life 'til I die

I bet me and Ray J would be friends
If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich (I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich)
(Highlights)
Uh, 21 Grammys, superstar family
We the new Jacksons, I'm all about that action
(We only making the highlights)
I'm about that Farrakhan, life is a marathon
I'ma shift the paradigm, I'ma turn up every time
I'ma bust a coach's head open on some Diddy shit
If he ever talk to my son like an idiot
(I know my life gon' be highlights)
One time for a nigga really gettin' it
Two times 'cause we got the whole city lit
Advice to all my niggas: impregnate Bridget
(Oh, no, gotta play that shit back!)
So if she have a baby she gon' make another nigga
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches, hah?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian, hah?
She spent her whole check on some Christians
And that girl ain't even religious
Walkin', livin', breathin' god, you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Blac Chyna fuckin' Rob helped him with the weight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back, heh?
What you want?
You want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack, heh, huh?
Uh, I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know right now if you a freak or not
Oh lord (Ohh, nah-nah-nah-nah), oh lord (Ohh, nah-nah-nah-nah, nah)
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know if you a freak or not
Bad bitch up in Equinox
I wanna know if you a freak or not
Oh lord, oh my lord (Oh nah nah nah nah)83Embed
