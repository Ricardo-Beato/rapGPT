12 ContributorsLeft Hand Lyrics
Yeah

It's Gucci Mane La Flare, and I'm a nigga got weight
A begging ass bitch is really something I hate
Hold on, hold on hoe, baby pump yo brakes
When I took you on a date that was my first mistake
On yo body was the bomb it blew up right in my face
I don't chase these monkey bitches, I'm the one that's getting chased
Yeah, I'm eatin' real good, I gotta say my grace
I might fly a bitch to Paris cause that's just how I play
I might spend a hundred grand, spend it all in one day
And you can come to my place, but damn bitch you can't stay
I'm a social outcast, but my name ain't Andre
I'm smoking California kush, but I'm from Sun Valley

I wouldn't give a damn if you got grams
I'm in my drop top lamb and I got bands
You the type I give five with my left hand
She left you and then went on to the next man
So put a check, with a check, with a check, fam
You let yo bitch wear the pants so call her yes ma'am
I'm from the crest so I can't hang with no yes man
Steal from the squad and I might have to cut off yo right hand
(Gucci!)
You might also like
I work out at Walter's
I trap a lil harder
I think a lil smarter
I don't wanna be bothered
It's Gucci, imposters
It's Gucci Sinatras
Yo girlfriend just quit ya, wanna get on my roster
I'm draped in La Casta
I'm sippin' on Vodka
I canceled that bitch, and sent that bitch to my partner
You braggin' about her
You say that she slobbed ya'
She set yo ass up and let sum niggas come rob ya
I'm running Sun Valley like Nino did with the Carter
I'm giving you game nigga, don't cost you a quarter
I load my revolver
Go jump in my charger
I pull up on yo ass and turn yo ass to a martyr

I wouldn't give a damn if you got grams
I'm in my drop top lamb and I got bands
You the type I give five with my left hand
She left you and then went on to the next man
So put a check, with a check, with a check, fam
You let yo bitch wear the pants so call her yes ma'am
I'm from the crest so I can't hang with no yes man
Steal from the squad and I might have to cut off yo right hand
(Gucci!)Embed
