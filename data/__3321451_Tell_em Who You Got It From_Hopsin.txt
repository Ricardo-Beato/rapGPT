19 ContributorsTell’em Who You Got It From Lyrics
Hey, Marcus, how you doin'?
This is your father's callin'
Uh just touching basis with you
I want to know if everything okay with you
Because I been getting from family members callin' me
And wonderin' what's goin' on with you and stuff
And I ain't heard nothin'
And I know this can't be over this baby
You know, and I don't know why you mad and angry when it about somethin' you did yourself
You gotta stop foolin' with these old gals and shit
You know they out for money and stuff
And all these women are

Girl, you trippin' and you know it
You think these issues that you got goin' unnoticed
I smell some bullshit tonight, you the culprit
Bitch, I can read your motherfuckin' mind like I wrote it
You swear you the baddest bitch alive (yeah, yeah)
I can see the madness in your eyes (yeah, yeah)
All your pain is packaged in disguise (yeah, yeah)
To your friends you yappin' with the lies, I don't mind
Feels like I don't even know you
Girl, you ain't got no clue what I'd go through for you
There ain't much in this crazy world that I won't do for you
But I don't get the same love in return
It's just a lesson learned, I'll just let it burn, 'cause—
You might also like
I know
I don't need you but you do need me, it shows
And bitch, I know
You just think I'm full of myself and broke
And bitch, I know
Go 'head, just act like I'm dead and you don't know me no mo'
It's okay (okay)
'Cause I know, I know, I know, I know

I see you got some pain
Tell 'em who you got it from
I see you got a name
Tell 'em who you got it from
Show niggas your broken heart and
Tell 'em who you got it from
Tell everyone I did all this
Tell 'em all I'm the one you shouldn't get involved with
I see you got some pain
Tell 'em who you got it from
I see you got a name
Tell 'em who you got it from
Show niggas your broken heart and
Tell 'em who you got it from
Tell everyone I did all this
Tell 'em all I'm the one you shouldn't get involved with
I recall when we first met up
You had convinced me that you had your shit together
Back then all my homies said that you was just a set-up
My mind musta been gone
Damn, my momma taught me better
I just wanted you, baby
I don't know what to do lately
It's like I hate you and you hate me
And all this shit is too crazy for me
You got enough pride for the both of us
You can't apologize, you don't open up
I thought you would bride, would be close enough
I guess inside your mind you weren't old enough
I look at you and think—

I know
I don't need you but you do need me, it shows
And bitch, I know
You just think I'm full of myself and broke
And bitch, I know
Go 'head, just act like I'm dead and you don't know me no mo'
It's okay (okay)
'Cause I know, I know, I know, I know
I see you got some pain
Tell 'em who you got it from
I see you got a name
Tell 'em who you got it from
Show niggas your broken heart and
Tell 'em who you got it from
Tell everyone I did all this
Tell 'em all I'm the one you shouldn't get involved with
I see you got some pain
Tell 'em who you got it from
I see you got a name
Tell 'em who you got it from
Show niggas your broken heart and
Tell 'em who you got it from
Tell everyone I did all this
Tell 'em all I'm the one you shouldn't get involved with2Embed
