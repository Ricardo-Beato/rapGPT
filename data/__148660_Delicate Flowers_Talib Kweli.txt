15 ContributorsDelicate Flowers LyricsThese times it's hard being a man. I try to explain that to my lady overtime

My girl is a delicate flower, a super-hero
Being a single mom helped develop her powers
We stay up to a elegant hour talking inhaling the sour
Reaching out to God cause the Devil a coward
But he still sits on my shoulder and whispers
It feels like my shoulder gets colder the more that I listen
And now it seems like she ready to leave
We stay to beef the main reason my desire to spreading my seed
I try to tell her I'm just a man
She said "no, you're wrong
Cause you're way more than that
You need to cut the scam
You're not fooling me, this lunacy
Them excuses might be new to the birds
But they ain't new to me."
Yo, I hate when the fit is thrown
It's like everytime I pick up the phone you bitch and moan, whoa
I'm like why you stressing for?
I'm pressing ignore, make me wanna never get involved

I need to reap these benefits
Ooh, you so sensitive
I say serve this royalty
She say I deserve your loyalty
Girls have feelings

Men lie out of fear but we front like we're not afraid
Whether arguing or not, the bills gotta get paid
We are not in 6th grade, we're fighting and people watching
On Twitter she emo-blogging, I'm boiling her hemoglobin
It lead to sobbing the arguments never move me
Cause we acting out the stereotypes like Tyler Perry movies
My indiscretion is reeking in deep betrayal
Libidos are like horses, it's hard to keep em stable
She believed me the way Mike believed in Fredo
But I need her, she the proof in my soul, my sweet potato
Before I let her go I know she'll be forever gone
I can't leave when the weather wrong I weather storms
She like Katrina got me looking for FEMA
Coveting my neighbor's lawn the grass is looking greener
But in reality it never is
I'm sure there's others, but I'll never find a better fish
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
They surely, surely do1Embed
