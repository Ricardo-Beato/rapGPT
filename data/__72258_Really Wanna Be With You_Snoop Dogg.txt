7 ContributorsReally Wanna Be With You Lyrics
Yeah they got me back in the studio my nigga
Hehe, got my niggas up in here right now
I'm ego trippin', real spit
That's what it do
Yeah, tell y'all how I feel right now

I went to my closet
Then I put my robe on
Slip into the living room
Then I turnt the stove on
I'm half-naked, so I put my clothes on
Stash-spot, but I get my roll on
Gettin' my matches, then gettin' my toke on
Yes indeed, now I'm ridin', get my loc on
Soda poppin', it don't quit
Here we go again, another hit
Fifteen-hunnit, I've got you stunnit
I'm blunnit, I'm like Stevie Wonder (hehe)
Yeah indeed, it's the S
The one and only, the king of the West
With nuthin' but the purple in my chest
This one's for my niggas and their guests
Ya dig it?
You niggas bite me
I do this off the dome, ain't no need for me to write it
See, I'm the tightest
I'm like the, nigga inside the encyclopedia, colitis
Listen to me, you know I spark it up
It's Snoop D-O-double-G, now gon' and chalk it up
Ego trippin', 40 oz, seven
Got the bitches dippin' (hehe)
You know it's crackin'
I'm back in action
Have a smoke
Let's roll loc
You might also like
On my grind, takin' my time
But if I could unwind (keep your profit)
Girl I can't, I'm chasin' bank
Goin' hard in the paint (keep your profit)
Give a little dough
Girl you gotta know, what niggas on the go
Understand your mane
But I'm in the game
But I really wanna be with you

What it was, what you smokin'
What up loc
I'm on the block, with my nephews
Paying dues, new tennis shoes
Brand new car, feelin' good
How you livin' Dogg?
I'm still in the hood
Pigs want me, so do these hoes
So I gotsta skip town and do these shows
I got money, but I need more
Everyday I don't which way I'mma go
But I'mma run, instead of walkin'
Still gangsta, still crip-walkin'
Still talkin' shit, still doin' me
Snoop D-O-double-G (haha)
Ya see me
I'm the mellow-mellow baby in that yellow pair of C's
Woke up early in the mornin'
Six o'clock on the dot
Ain't paid my gas bill
My shower water ain't hot
I've been thinkin' about way
To get up outta this spot
I've been thinkin', about goin', to the East Side
To the East Side, (one more baby) To the East Side
But I really wanna be with you

If I was you, and you was me (hehe)
Nigga you's a flea
You could never be, D-O-double-G
That's what they tellin' me
What they sellin' me?
It ain't nuttin'
So erryday, it's how we move
Nigga watch the tray sway
Watch the beat knock, watch the beat bang
Watch Snoopy D-O-double-G do his thang
Sang this song, go ahead dogg
Make it sound good, try to holla at all them broads
Baby cute, but her friend is finer
Talk to a nigga, let's go to Mel's Diner
Me and you baby, over breakfast and brunch
Have a dick in ya mouth, haha that's lunch
Gangsta shit, from a gangsta crip
Let's roll out my nigga, I think it's time to dip
On my grind, takin' my time
But if I could unwind (keep your profit)
Girl I can't, I'm chasin' bank
Goin' hard in the paint (keep your profit)
Give a little dough
Girl you gotta know, what niggas on the go
Understand your mane
But I'm in the game
And I really wanna be with you

Woke up early in the mornin'
Six o'clock on the dot
Ain't paid my gas bill
My shower water ain't hot
I've been thinkin' about way
To get up outta this spot
I've been thinkin', about goin', to the East Side
To the East Side, (one more baby) to the East Side
But I really wanna be with you

That's so gangsta
Yeah, that's so gangsta
Fifteen-hunnit hahaha
Your bitch ran up to me the other day in the club talkin' bout
"I know um... Lorenz from Fifteen-hunnit"
I said: "Bitch, you betta get out my face unless you got Fifteen-hunnit in cash up on ya, ya know what I'm talkin' about"
Really wanna be witchu1Embed
