Uh, yeah bitch
Digital Nas
Yeah, bitch
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm in the hood like Mrs. Winners, uh
Basketball seats in a Beamer, uh
Pull up with sticks, pull up with clips, all on the hip, yeah, yeah
I turn a two to a six, yeah (Uh)
Servin' these stripper hoes dick, yeah
You sick of me, yeah, and I know it, huh (Yeah)
All of this money, I blow it, huh (Skrr)
All of these hoes, yeah they goin', huh (Uh)
All of my shooters they blowin' (Noom!)
Anyway, why you come over? You ain't goin', huh
You a whole thot, and I know this, huh (Yeah)
Beat him in the pot with the elbow, huh
Skrt out the lane with the new whip (Skrt)
Diamonds in the ear like a Q-tip, huh
Bitch give me top with them duck lips, uh (Yeah)
Your boyfriend, he scared of me (Yeah)
I'm geeked up off that amphetamine (Yeah)
Hairy pussy give me allergies (Yeah)
Bitch I don't shop at no Malleries (No)
I get my diamonds from Icebox, huh (Yeah)
Big Gucci link with the white rocks (Woo)
Just left Chicago like White Sox (Yeah), tryna get a bitch with some dreadlocks
I got a bitch sippin' Redrum (Damn), I don't even know where she came from (Nah)
I walk around with a AK (Damn), that lil' shit sound like a snare drum (Yeah)
