Huh huh, Smoke some of that Gucci Gas, huh
Gucci!

My diamond wrist, and diamond neck, kick like Jackie Chan wrist (Whoa)
Got that money, I can flex, I got Jackie Chan bitch (Turn up)
Not the rubber ban' man, but the rubber ban' clique (Brr)
I can nut all on ya bitch, call her the body paint bitch (You nasty)
Can I buy your stove today, because my stove need to be fixed (woah)
Can I borrow your safe today, because my safe don't got a cent (Skirr)
There's a stitch comin' out my 'partment, and man it smell like 40 bricks (Damn)
They used to call me 40 shawty, now they call me extra clip (Ba)
You can call me Carbon-15, when you see me let it rip (Uhh)
You a crip I'll leave your crippin', and you a blood I'll leave ya bleedin (*Thdadao*)
Drop camaro ridin Cleveland, now they call it Bleveland (Woo)
Gucci Mane's a gangster but these niggas not believing (Wha?)
Till I put that fire, make them niggas start retreatin (*Pew*)
Yo girlfriend's a komoto dragon, keep a nigga skeetin (*Ah-ah-ah*)
All my rims are stamped with dragons, man them fuckas leavin (Woo)
Yo brother was disloyal to me, man that nigga treason (Sucka)
He was insubordinate, I had to hit the heathen (Ba)
Fo-fo 2 on 24's I'm ridin through 4 season (Low)
Hard top rarri boulevard, an I don't see no pleasin

Lord, I get High-ahah, I don't know why-ay
If I don't drank to day-y I rather die-e
Lord, I get High-ahah, I don't know why-ay
If I don't drank to day-y I rather die-e (Woo)

Popo pull me over in a blue and black Bentley
Blue Forgi's thought that I was Crippin like Nipsey

If you a bad bitch then vogue pose

Gucci in the club where the phat ho? (phat ho)
All I wanna know is where the phat ho, phat ho
