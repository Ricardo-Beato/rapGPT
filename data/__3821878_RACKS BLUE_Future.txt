Zaytoven!

I got the white ice
I can't do wrong
I got the black A.P
The Patek a two-tone
I done went colorblind
I'ma get my shine on, yeah
Know how I'm feelin'
The racks blue
Uh, uh!

What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh
I shoulda gave 'em dog food and went to get neutered
I shoulda never got caught up with a cougar

Way too clever, ain't too jealous
Ain't gon' let 'em, I never settle
Life as a rebel, I'm gettin' better
Bringin' pressure, I get pleasure
Chrome Berettas, no vendetta
I know my heart belongs to the ghetto
Responsibilities without humility
Longevity, car from Italy
Fuck my enemies, get my salary
Fuck envy, end in tragedy
I'm your majesty, that's how I gotta be
Get more liberty, should be proud of me
You might also like
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh

I got the white ice
I can't do wrong
I got the black A.P
The Patek a two-tone
I done went colorblind
I'ma get my shine on
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh

Comin' from poverty, hittin' the lottery
Hottest commodity, the way that it had to be
Ain't no comparin' me, you thinkin' charity
I'm thinkin' integrity, and worryin' 'bout the legacy
That I went through, thinkin' vicariously
I'm in a spacecoupe, that's momentarily
I've been dead broke, treated unfairly
Never break me, love or hate me
She did forsake me, she wanna taste me
And she showed it, gave her the blue face
Gave her blue paper
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh

I got the white ice
I can't do wrong
I got the black A.P
The Patek a two-tone
I done went colorblind
I'ma get my shine on, yeah

What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, oohEmbed
