10 ContributorsAll My Life (Freestyle) Lyrics
Whoo... Kid!
It's what I do
Ha, Hussle
Yeah, yeah
Listen, look
Hussle

I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on the block, blue collar wasn’t me
My momma put me out when I was left up in the streets
But I ain't mad at it 'cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the Fuck tha Police
When Johnnys pick you up and drop you off down the street
They say I’m too street
I paint pictures on these beats
When all they ever seem to hear is R.S.C
We all we got, like C.M.B
Same legend, different letters, you'll be R.I.P
If you go against we, and that's on me
Stick a fruit punch nigga make him bleed, Icee
I'm something like a stunna, tell him get like me
Yellow gold chain, blue chucks, white tee
You do what you can, me — I does what I please
And fuck with Jay Rock, blue and red make green
So holla at ya boy, cause I'll be OT
I'm prolly on stage, finna light up my weed
Remember back in '03, when it was just me
Rolling on Slauson, on a chromed Alpines
Grown man, money, I was just a young teen
50 Cent and Dr. Dre on the television screen
But now look at me, your boy gettin' cheese
I deserve every blessing for the struggle I seen
