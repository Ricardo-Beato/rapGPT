9 ContributorsDope Money Lyrics
Its Guwop, Bricksquad CEO Nigga

I woke up six in the evening a bitch next to me
Last night went too hard on that ecstasy
And if I see that bitch tonight I never met the chick
Y'all know I introduced the city to that flexin' shit
23 years old I met a Mexican
And all the profit that I made I invested it
Got a crazy whip game, I'm talkin' reckless bitch
Fucked up a 9 and a 4 tryn' to perfect the shit
I'm getting real good with it I got extra bricks
I got Canary yellow stones in my necklace
And when I walk in the club exit my foes exit it
Chop make your head spend around like the exorcist

I got Dope Money, drop a bale on her
I'm turn her up and put this YSL on her
What them hoes gonna say when I put that Chanel on her
We smokin' strong expensive perfume what you smell on her
I got Dope Money, drop a bale on her
Her nigga in the feds I hope they donâ€™t tell on her
It ain't her fault that that nigga when to jail on her
And every time I pull up I be fresh as hell on her
(It's Gucci)
You might also like
I look ya dead in the eyes, I despise your side
I got this pistol in the club bitch, surprise surprise
I recognize your disguise you brought a bag of lies
I catch you on the east side bitch yo ass is mine
Say you triple OG, but you past your prime
Y'all niggas know you know me, I shoot you so many times
I used to drive an Oldie with the Dayton wires
Sun valley Apartments, I swear that shit is like The Wire
That AK hit his ass and he might survive
I'm not an umpire bitch I can't letcha slide
Came up in Zay basement and took it nation-wide
I'm in that Central Station with 50 Haitian guys

I got Dope Money, drop a bale on her
I'm turn her up and put this YSL on her
What them hoes gonna say when I put that Chanel on her
We smokin' strong expensive perfume what you smell on her
I got Dope Money, drop a bale on her
Her nigga in the feds I hope they don't tell on her
It ain't her fault that that nigga when to jail on her
And every time I pull up I be fresh as hell on her1Embed
