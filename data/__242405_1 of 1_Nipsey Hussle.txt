I came to get money, and now that I got it
They hate on a nigga, but they should just stop it
She throw me that pussy, but I never caught it
You asking why you won't, it got too much mileage
Ooh, you're looking at a 1 of 1
Ooh, I'll show you how this shit is done
Ooh, my chain look like it weigh a ton
Ooh, bitch, look at what I've become

I make a grip
Walk inside this shit, then take my pick
I take a shit
On all you fake niggas when I drop my shit
I run my shit, I own my shit, I'm on my shit
I'm on some shit, some owner shit, some MoÃ«t shit
I pay my rent, I pay my team
They make me rich, I make them rich, ain't that some shit
Now, watch this, look
More cash, more money, more fame
I'm the realest nigga in this fucking game
I came up, off the corner, all grind
Make these cracker niggas respect my mind
I run my shit, I own my shit, I'm on my shit
I'm on some shit, some owner shit, Range Rover shit
I came to slice bread off the loaf and shit
And get you niggas off that feet up on the sofa shit
Hustle
You might also like
I came to get money, and now that I got it
They hate on a nigga, but they should just stop it
She throw me that pussy, but I never caught it
You asking why you won't, it got too much mileage
Ooh, you're looking at a 1 of 1
Ooh, I'll show you how this shit is done
Ooh, my chain look like it weigh a ton
Ooh, bitch, look at what I've become

I talk that shit that's 'cause I live it, nigga
And if I don't no more, that's 'cause I did it, nigga
You get smart, you get richer, nigga
You start hating and I'll chip you, nigga
To be specific, it's a, Westside, neighborhood
Crenshaw District, Slauson Ave Crippin', anybody killa
Don't give a fuck about a bitch or a nigga
Yeah, they quote my raps like scriptures
Say I shop like hipsters
I drive cars like a rich nigga
And probably pull up with your, ho
Oh, 6-2-O's, fa sho, get dough
Pulling up at my show
Been about a bankroll, make these mills and lay low
Bust a whip and change clothes
Money, power, and hoes
I came to get money, and now that I got it
They hate on a nigga, but they should just stop it
She throw me that pussy, but I never caught it
You asking why you won't, it got too much mileage
Ooh, you're looking at a 1 of 1
Ooh, I'll show you how this shit is done
Ooh, my chain look like it weigh a ton
Ooh, bitch, look at what I've become

100 pints, that's 100 grand (That's 100 racks)
Bring your money if you want it then (If you want it, nigga)
I'm the man, don't you understand? (Come get it)
My pack loud like like a fucking band
Big choppers like the Taliban
All these racks, I'm breaking rubber bands (Count it up)
I love my haters, they my biggest fans (I love you niggas)
I'm on the field and they just in the stands
I let 'em watch me while I make these plays
Six touchdowns in they face
That's something to hate on
On the block, yeah, get this money on
OG rolled in my Swisher (Roll up)
Actavis, pour it in my Sprite (Pour up)
That little bitch know she bad
She got ass and I wanna fuck, but
I came to get money, and now that I got it
They hate on a nigga, but they should just stop it
She throw me that pussy, but I never caught it
You asking why you won't, it got too much mileage
Ooh, you're looking at a 1 of 1
Ooh, I'll show you how this shit is done
Ooh, my chain look like it weigh a ton
Ooh, bitch, look at what I've become6Embed
