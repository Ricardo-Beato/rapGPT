20 ContributorsAin’t Just Me Lyrics
12Hunna on the beat
I know doe, I know doe
Sosa, you flexin', baby girl, I know doe
It ain't just me, girl

She like, "Sosa, you flexin'", baby girl, I know doe (It ain't just me, girl)
I'm riding Forgi’s in the snow doe (It ain't just me, girl)
You know I got my pole too (It ain't just me, girl)
And I'ma let it blow too (It ain't just me, girl)
It's just me and Cobra (It ain't just me, girl)
Still slumpin' niggas over (It ain't just me, girl)
Still I'm Almighty Sosa (It ain't just me, girl)
That's the type of shit you gotta take notes of (It ain't just me, girl)

I'm still pourin' 4’s up (Lean)
I'm still smoking dope when I'm not 'ppose to (I'm not)
Put this Glock to ya brain, let it blow, now I got yo blood (Bang, bang)
Over these Balenci-oh-ga's (Over these Balenciagas)
That I just paid 6 double O fo' (Just paid 600)
I'm still a smoker 'cause I hate being sober (I hate being sober)
I ain't scared of no nigga that can bleed all over me (That can bleed)
It's about money then I’ll be all over it (Then I'll be)
Smoking weed with THC all over it (Weed with THC)
Boy, yo weed got seeds all over it (Boy, yo weed fufu)
Like Tony Montana, who I trust? Me (Tony Montana, who I trust? Me, bitch)
It ain't about money, don't talk to me (It ain't about money, don't talk to me, bitch)
They shooting for me, they walking with me (They shooting for me, they walking with me, bitch)
Come through lightin' shit up like get in a coffin please (Get in a coffin please, bitch)
