19 ContributorsPure Evil Lyrics
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
I don't believe you, I don't believe you
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
This is pure evil, this is pure evil

When I woke up this morning my only intention was
To look in my reflection with mutual respect, yeah
I know I'm more than just a badge and a weapon, but
When you see me comin' you recognize my profession
You should believe that I'ma leave an impression
Even if it means I gotta put my knee on your neck, man
Was never meant for you to pass this test
The last question on the quiz is, 'What the fuck'd you expect, man?'
A little money made him want some protection
Because the many with no money made the money feel threatened
And we accept there's gonna be some exceptions
But it's built on a connection of ownership and possessions
Baby boy, you pay attention to them lessons
If you flexin' any teeth, I'ma send you to the dentist
It all depends on how you fit into my spectrum
From lectures, to handcuffs, to beat downs, to death wish
I was told to tell a one-sided story
And that's why I had to eliminate your perspective
I was afraid for my death
I had to make an assessment
Ain't my day to be checked, I felt the weight on my chest
I was told to tell a one-sided story
So say a prayer cause this one's gone to Heaven
Innocence is a submissive position
It's a one-sided story, read it to your children

No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
I don't believe you, I don't believe you
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
This is pure evil, this is pure evil
No, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no6Embed
