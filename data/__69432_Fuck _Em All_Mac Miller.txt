31 ContributorsFuck ’Em All Lyrics
Take me
Take me—do you miss me?
Can we stop now? Melt with me—are you okay?
I'm never gonna let you go—touch me—please don't go
Where are we? Do you miss me?
Please don't go—wake up—touch me
Where are we?

I have a vision to add: the gift of subtractin' limits
If everything was gone tomorrow, who would miss it?
And if I pack my bags and moved away, who would visit?
If you knew what you should say who would listen?
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout a new religion
Somethin' to feed off, we searchin' for it like groups of pigeons
Kinda futuristic, yeah, it's cool, we different
'Cause what I do's terrific, I'm just hopin' you can feel it
Yeah, so tell me if you can
Are you numb enough? Can you listen in?
I would lose it all to show 'em I'd get rich again
But matter fact, fuck that, 'cause I don't give a damn
You see it's simple when it's only cigarillos
In the world, no one should feel you, don't expect it from a little man
Fuck empty, my glass is filled
Countin' roses, daisies, and daffodils, chill
You might also like
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow?
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
So get your money, fuck 'em all

I say my prayers, but I don't know who they to
Layin' on my back, lookin' through the roof
Just tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
Stickin' to it, super glue it, make it beautiful
Fuck, what am I missin'?
Speak to your soul, so shut up and listen
Gimme a reason to pop, gettin' me goin', ain't lettin' me stop
Head to the top, it's better they not, call me a phony, so they sendin' me shots
I, got a girl, we in love, she my money, she my drugs
This my pain, this my pleasure, last forever, keep me up
Late at night, tell me it's alright, I believe her
I don't question she who knows me best, I know you wouldn't either
Somethin' happen when I see her, it's right out of a fairy tale
Got some shit she goin' through, it's something that she handle well
Life a bitch but she my bitch
Gold rollie and it's timeless, yeah
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow?
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
So get your money, fuck 'em all

We all wanna know
What to do in this world when it seems that there's nothing left
And we dream just to dream
But we don't know exactly how to get there yet
And we all wanna know
What to do in this world when it seems that there's nothing left
And we dream just to dream
But we don't know exactly how to get there yet

Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow?
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
So get your money, fuck 'em all
