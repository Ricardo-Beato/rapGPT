Honorable Court
Huh

When I step out, it's an event (Drippin')
Lookin' like I sold my tenth brick (Wop)
Draft pick rich (Plenty), real sick, need a fingerprint (Yeah)
Bitch pretty thick, call her Janet, show your nips chick
Super Bowl game (Super), with the clique, we the rich clique
Rockstar lifestyle like Limp Bizkit (Wasted)
Shawty from the South and she Super Bowl thick (Thicky)
I'm the type of guy to fly you to the islands (Fly)
I got the type of money flood a bitch in diamonds (Bling)

With this ice (Ice)
I might let you slide (Slide)
That's right (Right)
You tell me the vibe (Vibe)
Make her go all night (Go all night)
Had to show her right (Show her right)
Give her more life (More life)
Then I throw her bank (Yeah)
With this ice (Ice)
I might let you slide (Slide)
That's right (Right)
You tell me the vibe (Vibe)
Make her go all night (Go all night)
Had to show her right (Show her right)
Give her more life (More life)
Then I throw her bank (Yeah)
You might also like
If this shit don't come back, I'ma whip it up again (Skrrt)
Kingpin, backyard full of Benjamins
Turn past 10, dam broke, it's floodin' in (Damn)
Gave my jeweler couple M's and said "Let's start a trend" (Brr)
Cut her off, I called her back then cut her off again
Sometimes I feel like Hercules, them stones just hit my hand
Lil' Jit got caught from Tampa, he look just like Lil' Zan (Uh)
Trap rappers never trap before, man, I don't have a chance

With this ice
I might let you slide

Slide (Slide)
To the trap, to the trap side (Ooh, trap)
Where we let them thangs fly (Fly)
We got the whole hood mapped out (Mapped out)
Birds fly down South (South)
Birds fly down South (South)
Get mo', get mo' bankroll (Cash)
Bankroll, bankroll, get mo' (Yeah)
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll (Trap)
Drop my top, there he go again (Skrrt, skrrt)
Look up to the sky, thankful for my wings (Yeah)
Then I put my momma in that brand new Benz (Momma)
All this good I did, don't punish me for sins (No)
No, no-no, ooh, no-no
It's a part of the trap slide
It's a part of our life
Where the wrong ones won't slide
Spendin' M's and it's on ice
Spendin' M's and it's on ice
Spendin' M's and it's on ice
Spendin' M's and it's on iceEmbed
