Yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo, woo)
Huh, huh

Last year, I made seven million
Didn't have to do a single fuckin' show
Shout out to my niggas up at Coca-Cola
For the check they cut me at the Super Bowl
All my life moments is a super woah
My nigga Dr. Dre, he got a super boat
Last night, I was textin' Jack Dorsey
That's the perks you get from being super dope

This is real life, ain't no actin' it
All these rap niggas, they be Brad Pittin' (Uh)
Every little thing I do is mad different (Yeah)
Got my lil' cousin playin' badminton (Yeah)
Gave my lil' bro a quick fifty piеce
He got the wholе motherfuckin' trap hittin'
I been stackin' up all these assets
Can't be conductin' any bad business (Nah)
Like woah, hey, I keep that drip on me
My nigga, I'm big homie (Big homie)
Huh, hey, I can't ever slip homie
My mama might flip on me (Might flip on me)
Like woah, hey, drop-top coupe in the motherfuckin' summer
I rest my case (Rest my case)
Like huh, hey, I'ma live life to the fullest
With every single breath I take, uh-huh (Every breath I take)
Let me tell you lil' niggas something real quick (Uh)
Hatin'-ass ho, you can suck my dick (Suck it)
Get cold every time that you touch my wrist
I'm the greatest, nigga, you can't fuck with this (Nah)
My niggas pull up in them Chevys and Beamers
We all young and rich, you can't check my demeanor
I just bought a Birkin for my aunt Regina
I been getting money since I was a senior, but (Woo)

Last year, I made seven million
Didn't have to do a single fuckin' show
Shout out to my niggas up at Coca-Cola
For the check they cut me at the Super Bowl
All my life moments is a super woah
My nigga Dr. Dre, he got a super boat
Last night, I was textin' Jack Dorsey
That's the perks you get from being super dope

I be feeling like it's me against the world
But I can give a fuck who my opponent is (Nah)
Niggas askin' why I dropped the YBN
I had no other choice 'cause we ain't own this shit (Real)
You know that janky shit, I'm not condoning it (Nah)
I'm with a couple niggas, I got a bone to pick (Real)
I'm on some movement shit, y'all on some moment shit (Huh)
But I'll be here forever, y'all can go and quit
We had bad bitches in a new Bentley
Just re-upped from that new stimmy
My brother countin' them blue Benjis
Only feel good when my crew with me, like woah
They tried to question my character
Young, rich, and Black, they hate me in America
We some real niggas, don't fit the criteria
Don't like your vibe, not allowed in my area
I entered this game and I came here to change it
Speak my beliefs, now they calling me dangerous
Takin' the throne and I'm gonna maintain it
I gotta go down as just one of the greatest (Huh)
So anybody got a problem with me
Can't fake kick it, fuck your politicking (Fuck)
I ain't worried 'bout it, I know God is with me (Amen)
And your piece of mind is worth a dollar fifty, but (Lord)
Last year, I made seven million
Didn't have to do a single fuckin' show
Shout out to my niggas up at Coca-Cola
For the check they cut me at the Super Bowl
All my life moments is a super woah
My nigga Dr. Dre, he got a super boat
Last night, I was textin' Jack Dorsey
That's the perks you get from being super dope

One day, one day
I can survive
I can survive
Hey, hey (I can survive)16Embed
