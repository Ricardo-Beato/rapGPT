And you say..
As we go, with the rhyme flow
Just to let you know, Darryl and Joe
Featuring DJ Jam Master Jay
All the motherfuckin way
One time, just to blow your mind
And this is how we do it, just for the people
Sucker D.J.'s are really crazy clowns
Clowns - cold clockin clowns
When will they learn that they had ? by the pounds
Pounds - cold clockin pounds
Sucker D.J.'s bite our lines up all damn day
All - all damn day
Sucker D.J.'s that's on Jam Master Jay
Uhh ahh ahh uhh ahh ahh
Jam Master.. aiyyo..
The crew is here with you, a check it out y'all
Jam Master.. ah tell me
