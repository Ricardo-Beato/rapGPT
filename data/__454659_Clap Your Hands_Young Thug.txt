Thugga
I-I-I really love my F A N S
You know what I’m saying brodee?
I appreciate those people, you know what I’m saying bro?
They want a parade, yeah

I won’t sell no yay, I won’t own saran
I won’t live my life, I won’t make no plans
Stand up on that stage, I love all my fans
Mama say hooray, everyone clap your hands
Clap your motherfucking hands
Clap your motherfucking hands
Clap your motherfucking hands
Clap your motherfucking hands

I just came straight from the bottom
Young Thugga came straight up from nothing
I know you think I owe you something
I don’t give no damns, you supposed to feel like that
I got yellow diamonds, Imma peel like that
Pull up to my show see all the peoples fall in love
Salute all the DJ, they do this shit for Thug
They know I came straight up from the floor just like a rug
They know I smell like YSL so they ready for hugs
Hundred racks in my trousers, I’m groovy like Austin Powers
You knowing just not to touch me unless a Young Thug allow it
I bless the bitch with allowance, you want packs I’m gonna file it
Ever since I heard of Future I’ve been sneaking up at Follies
Baby I want to caress you (know why?)
Every time I see you I’m gonna sex you (oh my god)
Bitch  but I molest you
I’m flash you
You might also like
I won’t sell no yay, I won’t own saran
I won’t live my life, I won’t make no plans
Stand up on that stage, I love all my fans
Mama say hooray, everyone clap your hands
Clap your motherfucking hands
Clap your motherfucking hands
Clap your motherfucking hands
Clap your motherfucking hands

It’s a great blessing whenever I hit the stage
I used to do this shit for free, but now I’m getting paid
On my way to being king, so who’s gon stop me
Thinking of a master plan, who’s on top? Me
Whatever I get Imma give back to my hood homies
And that’s love, raising me in the hood homie (big ups)
And all the clubs wall to wall, the fire marshall’s out
Nobody else did, it’s all sold out
Man, and they know I’m different, me and Thugga Thugga
On my mama, that’s my brother, we been rocking like a carpet
On the way to the top floor, I’m serious, you can see it in my face
When they shut the lights out the fans scream MPA

I won’t sell no yay, I won’t own saran
I won’t live my life, I won’t make no plans
Stand up on that stage, I love all my fans
Mama say hooray, everyone clap your hands
Clap your motherfucking hands
Clap your motherfucking hands
Clap your motherfucking hands
