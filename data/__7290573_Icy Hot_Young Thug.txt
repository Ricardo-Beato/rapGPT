(Wheezy outta here)

She say I'm high as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot" (Icy hot)
Had a show in the 504, I wore a bunch of rocks
I got her tummy tucked before she let me fuck
I keep her in a box, she wanna spend my bucks
She said I'm fire as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot"
I said, "I'm icy hot," I said, "I'm icy hot"
She wanna land a punch, my pocket on croissants
I call lil' mama a thot, she call me icy hot

First of all, I've been in the trap for a lifetime
Fuck a Dawn, I've been spinnin' black just like night-time
Above the law, I'm a motherfuckin' outlaw
Fendi scarves, Louis Vuitton on my cyclone, huh
You wanna get wet up again
You want me to get fed up again
But I don't let up again
This fool better catch up, it's time to get wet up
Now don't sweat up again
I ain't never let up again
Is you a bad bitch in a Mercedes? (Hey)
Is you a bad bitch in a Mercedes? (Hey)
They tried to burn the coupe and I'ma trade it (They tried to burn)
My niggas into swoopin', they gon' make it (They into swoopin')
They tried to kick me out, now it's disabled
I whip that Rolls-Royce like I'm a sailor (Whip that Rolls-Royce)
I count up so much, I bleed from paper
I keep the fan and glizzy by my neighbor (At all times)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Had a show in the 504, I wore a bunch of rocks
I got her tummy tucked before she let me fuck
I keep her in a box, she wanna spend my bucks
She said I'm fire as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot"
I said, "I'm icy hot," I said, "I'm icy hot"
She wanna land a punch, my pocket on croissants
I call lil' mama a thot, she call me icy hot

He give me stove top, he go hibachi-ba
He gave me boba cob, threw my Hitachi out
He lick my 'nani, ah, he call it cherry pie
He said my tiger bomb, gave him that icy hot
I run shit, I'm lieutenant, I fly you to LA
My jet look like the Jetsons, it's 2028
I feel like Abu Dhabi, I said, "Let's summer there"
He said I'm wifey type, he threw dick like bouquet
He call me Doja Rat, I chew through all his cheese
That's just the fifty carat, that's just a hundred G's
Freezer and brand new tap, no plumber for the leak
I wouldn't wish this heat on all my enemies

She say I'm high as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot" (Icy hot)
Had a show in the 504, I wore a bunch of rocks
I got her tummy tucked before she let me fuck
I keep her in a box, she wanna spend my bucks
She said I'm fire as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot"
I said, "I'm icy hot," I said, "I'm icy hot"
She wanna land a punch, my pocket on croissants
I call lil' mama a thot, she call me icy hot
High as fuck
Icy hot, oh
Mm-mm, told 'em
Let me fuck, in the box
Yeah, he fire as fuck
Icy hot, icy hot
Yeah-ee, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, icy hot4Embed
