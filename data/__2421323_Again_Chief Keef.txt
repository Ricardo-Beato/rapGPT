21 ContributorsAgain Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, bang
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Oh, I'm smoking the dope, ayy, but I'm reeking again
Yeah, I'm off the dope, yeah I'm tweakin' again
Sosa baby
Where he at, right there
That shit right there he did it again
He did it again, He did it again, he did it again
He did it again, he did it again, he did it again
He hit it again, he hit it again
That's your bitch, he hit it again
He hit it again, he hit it again

Smoking on pissy again
I'm counting up benji's again
Fucking on bitches again
Me and my niggas again
Running to the money like Sonic, lil' nigga, I ain't stumbling, I ain't fumbling
I'ma get a million out the motherfucking bank and I'm gon' tumblr it
I did it again, I hit it again
Let yo ho hit, she gon' let me feel it again
I'm sipping again, I'm killing again
Pulled up in the parking lot, killing the shit
Fresher than a bitch, she feeling the kid
Ain't no motherfucking killing the kid
Cut this on, bet they feeling this shit
Like I just came out the oven with it
I'm living again, flipping again
Get your bitch, she's tripping again
Bitch why you sleep? What you sipping again?
Meanwhile I'm in the studio ripping again
I don't need no bed, she gon' give me some head while I'm standing at the mic, speaking on shit
I was speaking on shit
When I go get the money, I leave with the shit
Money in my closet, I don't need no vault bitch
Only want the top, you can keep your walls bitch
Treat the money like my dog, I'm walking the shit
My dog ain't with the walking and shit
My dog like riding foreigns and shit
My dog like riding on boards and shit
Take a look at my wrist like I'm whipping again
In the kitchen again with the chickens again
When I pop a flat, I think I´m geeking again
Tollin' bitches again in the city again
Yo ho gon' let me hit it again cause I'm in her city again
She tell me she in my city again
I thought I told yo ass not to hit me again
I need seven beats hit up Tiggy again
Bitch wearing makeup she think she pretty again
I was in L.A., came from Hawaii and hit up Philly again
All this fucking ice, them not lights, they like I'm telling ya, man
Hop in my car, pedal stomping again
Pour up the drank, watch it bubble again
Baby, you on my dick keep coming again
Say you like short hair, bitch cut it again
You wanna be my friend, I can't condone the shit
Cause all these niggas be phony and shit
Eating on steak, macaroni and shit
Scars on my face like Tony and shit
She all on my dick, the bitch bony and shit
Bitch my house a island like Coney and shit
Check out my pockets, they bloaty and shit
Tadoe tripping off the molly again
Justo, bitch I'm falling again
Got yo bitch and she ride me like a Harley again
Don't even think bitch, top me again
She like Chief So slap me again
I think she´s digging my fabric again
I don't think these niggas wanna battle again
Hopped in my pool and I'm piling again
I'm trapping again, I'm rapping again
I'm bipolar, I'm snapping again
Pulled up on yo bitch, doors flapping again
Ass clapping again, hair up in the wind
Doing magic again, she let me hit it again
Get my hair done, told bitch clip it again
Gave her ass 800, I'm tipping again
Racks in my pocket, limping again
Money in my pocket, dripping again
All these clumsy ass hoes, I'm tripping again
Why she steady talking to me, she flipping again
Watch I get it again, spit it again
Get on the mic and spit it again
Like a blu-ray, told the bitch spin it again
I was looking like a lean nigga, I'm leaning again
I playing so woman what's some leaning again
That's Olinda again, I do my leaning again
Ring, ring on my phone that's Peter again
Got some bands again, he done did it again
Smoking big ass blunts, I feel it again
Told yo bitch I'm a doctor I'll heal her again
Told yo bitch wear gym shoes, heel it again
I'll smack yo ass for disrespecting againYou might also like1Embed
