11 ContributorsHit the Bank Lyrics
Her ass fat like Kim Stacks
DJ, run that shit back
New jewels, I cop that
New pistol, cock that
New watch, I cop that
And that top, I drop that
Pull up, where that guap at?
I took the game and locked that
Spending cash
Man, that shit is pity patter, I get it back
Niggas petty, eighteen shots, nigga out this 50 that
Got a hundred shots for niggas think they got nine lives, kitty cats
With my Chicago Bears, let us catch a opp he getting sacked

I ride X6 M, no Range Rover
This GTA, bitch, not no Saint Rows
Pull up to the crib and I change clothes
Just to go and hit the bank, hoYou might also like1Embed
