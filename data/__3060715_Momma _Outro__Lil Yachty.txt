27 ContributorsMomma (Outro) Lyrics
C'mon, baby

My best friend, queen of my world, my momma
More precious than diamonds and pearls, my momma
You sacrificed so much to raise a child
I wanna see you happy, see you smile
All you've given me, I can't repay
I will honor you today and always
My best friend, queen of my world, my momma
More precious than diamonds and pearls, my momma
You sacrificed so much to raise a child
I wanna see you happy, see you smile
All you've given me, I can't repay
I will honor you today and always

My best friend, first lady of my life my momma
Since day one made sure I was straight since pajamas
Now I gotta make sure that you good
Get you a new house with the finest wood
Cop you a new whip with the best leather
Diamond tennis bracelets with cashmere sweaters
There's no question I'm doing anything for my momma
She had one son but she treat my best friend like he come under her too
Woah damn no girl come before my momma
I take her where she can live great, she gonna eat steak off her plate
She can take pics for her Instagram like let the world know her son great
And let the world know what she ate
Rub it all in their face like ha
'Cause we up on them
She used to work hard for us
Now I break my back for her
That's my momma
That's my momma
Smartest girl I know
Pretty enough that if she forgot her wallet at a checkout counter she could pay off her tab with her looks
Thatâ€™s my momma
Where would I be without my momma?
Where would I go without my momma?
I love my momma
I need my momma
My best friend
The lady of my life
My momma

I love you more than life itself
I love you more than the air I breathe
I don't know, I mean you're my first born
The best thing that's ever happened to me
The love of my life
The best man ever
You've given me more than any man has ever given me1Embed
