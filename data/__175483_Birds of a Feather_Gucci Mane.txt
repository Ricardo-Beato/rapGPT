21 ContributorsBirds of a Feather Lyrics
Huh
Birds of a feather,it's Guwop!
Chyeah, huh
I got my nigga Rock with me, shit is epic
On 13 shit

I fuck with Rocko cuz he's a hustling motherfucker(A1)
You know I fuck with Flocka cuz he's a crazy motherfucker(BSM)
You know I fuck with Scooter, he's a robbin' motherfucker(BMG)
I used to fuck with Gotti till he turned into a buster (fuck em)
I did a song with T.I. but the nigga still a sucker
4Tre got locked up taking some bricks down to Augusta
You know I fuck with Hot but he's a shysty motherfucker
You know I fuck with Mojo, he's a hustling motherfucker
In nineteen ninety seven I was a petty motherfucker
Two thousand seven, I was trappin' heavy on Custer
I did a song with Keyshia Cole, I wish I woulda fucked her
I miss that girl Misha, she was a fine motherfucker
I used to fuck with Keyshia Dior and I still kinda love her
I wish that I could fuck her now cuz my mind in the gutter
You know I fuck with P and Buck, I'm they fucking third brother
The nigga killed Dunk get out, I'll be a locked up motherfucker

Most of these niggas, half of these hoes
A couple of my pistols, fuck all of my foes
A few more swishers, a couple more M's
I'm tryna get richer and free all of my niggas
You might also like(2x)
I need all of mine, nigga
All of my niggas
Im trying to get richer to free to free all of my nigga

Shout out that nigga Meech, he's a loyal motherfucker(BMF)
I got no respect for Jeezy, he wouldn't even buy a lawyer
Yeah I respect Big Cat but he's a dirty motherfucker
I still fuck with Coach K but he's a nerdy motherfucker
You know I signed Young Dolph, he's a juggin motherfucker
But I still say that Project Pat is my favorite rapper
Free my nigga Boosie, he's a gangsta motherfucker
Free my nigga B.G., he's a gangsta motherfucker
R.I.P. to Soulja Slim, I miss that motherfucker
R.I.P. to Pimp C, cuz I miss that motherfucker
When I lost Dunk, it's like I lost my own brother
R.I.P. my grandaddy and I lost my grandmother
Well, ever since I had my son I never fucked my baby mother
And every bitch in the industry want to be my baby mother
My nigga says he loves his girl, but I just seen her with Usher
A nigga rob me in ninety six, when he get out I'mma touch him
