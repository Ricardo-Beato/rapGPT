8 ContributorsRespect LyricsYeah, uh
Hate me nigga
Yeah, hate me nigga
Hate me nigga
Hate me nigga
Hate me nigga

I'm from a small hood, them niggas call me the connect
Get you 36 for 28, what you expect?
Still I hop straight up out that 'Rari with a TEC
And you know the shit around my wrist, it cost a check
Shit these niggas rappin' 'bout, I done did for real
Ask the real ones in ya city, I bet them niggas know the deal
Get you 36 for 28, what you expect?
If you ain't got no money, suggest you pay me in respect

Mr. Thug Motivation, yeah that's right the icon
Step up in this muthafucka, they like who cut the lights on
I can't pull my card 'cause I'm the muthafuckin dealer, boy
The ice cream man, we simply talkin' that vanilla, boy
Dropped that new Madonna, niggas love me like I'm 2Pac
Pulled up with that nina, gave it to 'em in a tubesock
You kickin' lil shit, I go tsunami on you shrimp niggas
Might just show up in some new Armani on you simp niggas
I got to get it like, Al Pacino straight up off that boat, boy
I ain't talkin' chicken curry, you niggas fuckin' with the goat, boy
Glass pot, gas stove, I can show you what it cook like
Put a real nigga, beat the odds that's what it look like
Let's go

Whole lotta dick ridin', oh I see what's goin' on
Yeah these pussy niggas mad, that I won't play along
All that boss talk, low-key you's a flunky though
Like Rico off of Belly, yeah you niggas lookin' monkey though
Grown ass man homie, I ain't wit the clown shit
You New Edition niggas, got me on my Bobby Brown shit
Grumpy ass niggas, yeah y'all howlin' at the moon, bitch
Be on that front line like Charlie Sheen in Platoon, bitch
You hear them niggas hissin' in the dark, you know the snake type
Type of nigga always preachin' real, you know the fake type
King of this shit, damn right I wear that crown, tight
Real nigga beat the odds, this exactly what it sound like

I'm from a small hood, them niggas call me the connect
Get you 36 for 28, what you expect?
Still I hop straight up out that 'Rari with a TEC
And you know the shit around my wrist, it cost a check
