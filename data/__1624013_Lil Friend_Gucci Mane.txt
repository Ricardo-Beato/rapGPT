7 ContributorsLil Friend Lyrics
OKAY!
Fuck it, I don't care
The Appeal!
When I fucking came to this fucking country
All I had was a dollar and a dream

We need more Ros, My bitches gettin' thristy
My words like New Years, Christmas came early, (BuRR!)
Got these bitches urling, my earring's perfect
My left pinkey finger rolling like George Gervin
My name ain't Ervin, but call me Magic
Abra Cadabra, top off the Phathom
458 Italia, first in the states, out of town plates, just to make it look great
I need a haircut, plus a carwash
I get out the car and they take their bra's off
See I fought the law and the fuckin law won
Came back on Appeal wanna new outcome
Overload your eardrumbs, hear it hear it come!
Income Income, go and get you sum
Say bye to the Bad guy, Wave bye to the Bad guy, Gucci Mane the bad guy
Yes, I am the Bad guy, Wave bye to the Bad guy

I came to this country with a dollar and a dream and a choppa and a team full of killas, what you mean?
Imma bad guy, bad guy from start til the end
Say hello to my little friend
I couldve been a doctor, shouldve been a lawyer
I go to court so much I couldve been my own employer
Imma die a dope boy, always been a hustla
Started off custom now I (Say hello to my little friend)

I got 60 racks laying on the floor in magic city
Like Samuel L Jackson I think it's time for killing
I touched his wife titty and the nigga start tripping
That ain't proper etiquette you see the bitch stripping
AR-15 whipped his ass into pieces
Don't get it twisted think it's all about the pieces
And all about the bracelets
I'm still fighting cases
10 thousand for the glasses
Diamonds in they faces (BuRR, BuRR)
Your own blood taste it
We stomp you till you tasteless
My t-shirt ain't tailored...
You read what is said - bitch
Brick squad bossman off with you head - bitch
Run for the exit
They shooting inside here
Parking lot gun fight bodies outside here
Police best bet come with the riot gear
Soldiers down to die here
Move to America
Dollar and a dream and a donor picture, tear it up
