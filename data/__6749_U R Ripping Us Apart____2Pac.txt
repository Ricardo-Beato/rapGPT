7 ContributorsU R Ripping Us Apart!!! Lyrics
This is Dedicated...(Dedicated) to my mama
Political prisoner, so called war on drugs (Dedicated)
Headed by this U.S. government... U my worst enemy (Dedicated)
I see you ...Uh, I'd ride for you (for pac dogg)
I'd roll for you, I'd die for you, it's all for you
(Dedicated)

The circle, can never, be broken, No-Ohoo
(I'd ride for you, I'd roll for you, I'd die for you, it's all for you)
The circle, can never, be broken, No-Ohoo
(You are ripping us apart)
(Dedicated to whaaaaat)
The circle, can never, be broken, No-Ohoo
(Shit's, dedicated to crack, I dedicate it to that)
(Dedicated to whaaaaat)
(Dedicated to whaaaaat)
The circle, can never, be broken, No-Ohoo
(Uh, Uh...before you came...Never...Never)
(Dedicated to whaaaaat)

Before you came, the triangle never broke
(the triangle never broke) Word Up
We were melded, and bonded as one (one), ONE (Dedicated)
But as the two pushed you away (But as the two pushed you away)
The one got weak and embraced you (One got weak and embraced you)
(I seen it)
And now You are ripping us apart (And now you are ripping us apart, Ripping us apart)
(Dedicated to whaaaaat)
(Dedicated to whaaaaat)
Dedicated
(Dedicated to whaaaaat)
(Dedicated to whaaaaat)
(Dedicated to whaaaaat)

The worst feeling, (The worst feeling of helplessness)
The greatest pain, has rested in my heart (Has rested in my heart)
The vision of heaven fades (The vision of heaven fades)
(Dedicated)
And the nightmare of loneliness has started (And the nightmare of loneliness has started) 
My hero has been defeated by you {My hero has been defeated by you}
And now what can I do {And now what can I do} 
Watch as you destroy us? {Watch as you destroy us} 
And our love is finally through? {And our love is finally through} 
(sang, repeated over next verse until 2:38)
The circle, can never, be broken, NoOooo

I know the worst is here {I know the worst is here}

Now you're tearing Us apart!!! {Now you're tearin Us Apart!!}
