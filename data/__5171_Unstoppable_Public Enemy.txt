4 ContributorsUnstoppable Lyrics
Aiyyo man, ya yo yo yo
I'm tryin to stay away from it but it won't stay away from me
You better ask yourself

What do you want, what do you need, what will you find
Don't be afraid, don't fall asleep, open your mind
I hope this rhyme gets you in time and space, come to a different place
Where you hear spiritual lyrical knowledge and you're face to face
Like welfare, in these rappers lyrics they need help there
Does KRS represent heaven? Hell yeah
Let me take you elsewhere, where you stand, there's a curse there
For sure, unless you're mature, grow up
If you're immature, then you're livin' sinister
You reject the words of the minister
You better get with ya Quran or Bible, you won't be livin' long
If you're livin' idle, The Teacher, that's my title
Shakin it up, wakin it up, makin it up, breakin it up
Takin it up higher, no liar, you can't deny the
Public Enemy, with the public enema
I gets way up in your buttocks, I rocks cause it's hip-hop
The long-laster, Chuck D with Blast Murderer
I know you heard of the word I be swervin and servin ya
Alertin ya, while splurtin a divine speech
Slow the party down so I can spit it
To each I teach mystic lyric, don't stop, you can get it
You better hear it
Battle? Quit it!

Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
Unstoppable, runnin' the game, Chuck and Kris
Unstoppable, bet you didn't know they had grip
Unstoppable, you don't wanna take this risk
Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
Unstoppable, you don't wanna take the risk!

Can the black headed stepchild, run the mile
Forever like a juvenile, to stay alive
Survivin' in the freestyle, yo hold it down
Walkin' on the wild side, to live or die
Damn another slow song
Yo Money, put the record back the fuck on
No respect for the Usual Suspects, mad teens
Pourin' fire on the gasoline, the beat fiends
Feelin' like fever, I'm gettin' warm
Chalk marks in the rainstorm, children of the gone
Lost and forgotten, minds rotten
The arcade shot 'em, Channel Zero on the TV got 'em
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
If you don't know yourself, then you nobody
Do your thing, no bang, in the same damn gang
I never sang, I'm back, but I transmit slang
Silence in the face of violent crews
My rhymes and news be blacker than most blues
Troublin', it all come tumblin', for the strugglin'
Occupations, daily operations, stimulations
Causin' mental violations, minds on vacation
In the middle of Revelation is a nation
Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
Unstoppable, runnin' the game, Chuck and Kris
Unstoppable, bet you didn't know they had grip
Unstoppable, you don't wanna take this risk
Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
Unstoppable, you don't wanna take the risk!1Embed
