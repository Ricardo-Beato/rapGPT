*Woman panting*

You hide your skin like ya shy or did somethin' wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So, finally, I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Up she goes, she wanna jump my bones
You want it, don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See, I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean

It's okay that you like it, babe (I like it, baby)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (This way)
To live this way, baby, baby (Ooh, baby)
Chillin' with the AC
You might also like
(The way we are) That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are
(The way we are) I'm takin' care of each and every part
I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are, the way we are

Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine, yeah; too divine
Who am I? Well; I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Ooh-He-Blew-Your-Mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make your waterfall
Girl, you my paintin', you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Jet, I've been way too high for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line, we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
Swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was, "Man, I'm broke"
And now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what's gon' be
(The way we are) That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are
(The way we are) I'm takin' care of each and every part
I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are, the way we are
