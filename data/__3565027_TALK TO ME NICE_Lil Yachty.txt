59 ContributorsTALK TO ME NICE Lyrics
(DJ Durel)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, ayy, ayy

Ayy, I bang with the main man (Man)
Had the same gang since the playpen (Pen)
Neck crystal lake, no Jason (Jason)
I see more Ms than a Maison logo (Yeah)
Got a white bitch but I call her Coco (Yeah)
Tint so dark, hiding from the photo (Skrrt)
20 years old, I'm 12 Ms in
I'm fuckin' this ho from the west end (Yeah)
Add up them numbers, they packin' (Yeah)
Check so big, make you backspin (Yeah)
30 round clip, get your butt chin (Pew, pew)
Sleep with the chopper on the nightstand (Yeah)
Seats in the coupe, gettin' suntan (Yeah)
Stay with the stick like I'm Sandman (Yeah)

Fuck with the move (Movie), gang got the shoot (Woo)
15,000 (Yeah, yeah), just for some shoes (Cash)
Put it on a Sprinter (Sprinter), put it on a Lil Boat (Lil Boat)
This is not a rental (No), I own this ho (This ho, that way)
Yeah, look at these prices (Prices)
Look at this ice and the way I rock these jewels
Talk to me nice (Nices)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through
Talk to me nice (Nice, woo)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through
Talk to me nice (Nices)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through
You might also like
(Huncho!) Niggas get shot (Shoot) at the alpha cloud (Cloud)
Pull up to the spot (Spot), kitchen flooded out (Flooded out)
Niggas love thots (Whoo), stir fry, cookin' pots (Stir fry)
More bowls than Bol Bol, huh, more bowls than a mosh (Bowl)
Fuck on a YRN logo (Smash), fuck nigga signed with the popos (12)
I could still go back to the hood (Hood), then step out and autograph photos (Photos)
Gelato, biscotti, biscotto (Biscotto)
Coupe too low, dodge potholes
That show girl on the low my ho, got eight rings on, no GEICO (GEICO)

Fuck with the move (Movie), gang got the shoot (Woo)
15,000 (Yeah, yeah), just for some shoes (Cash)
Put it on a sprinter (Sprinter), put it on a Lil Boat (Lil Boat)
This is not a rental (No), I own this ho (This ho, that way)
Yeah, look at these prices (Prices)
Look at this ice and the way I rock these jewels
Talk to me nice (Nices)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through
Talk to me nice (Nice, woo)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through
Talk to me nice (Nices)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through

(Lil Boat) On God, I stay with the fire
Runnin' round town with the F on the tire
That boy a lil' weird, check his chest for the wire
These broke-ass rappers need words for hire
It's Yachty, bitch, can you tell me who's flyer? (Flyer?)
Read 'bout me, bitch, in the Esquire
QC, the label, the empire, young rich nigga, I inspire
And I need that, never ask no one for feedback
Got a bitch to set niggas up, shawty love settin' rat traps
Shawty love eatin' Rap Snacks, at the crib with a F&N
Got a .223 and it don't kick back, make a million, then I sit back (Gang)
Fuck with the move (Movie), gang got the shoot (Whoo)
15,000 (Yeah, yeah), just for some shoes (Cash)
Put it on a sprinter (Sprinter), put it on a Lil Boat (Lil Boat)
This is not a rental (No), I own this ho (That way)
Yeah, prices6Embed
