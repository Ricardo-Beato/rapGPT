19 ContributorsGet It On The Floor Lyrics
(Haha)
Turn it up a lil' bit
Even more, I'm deaf as fuck (Haha)
Uh, ayy, the class clown coming soon
East End Empire
All day, all night
Let's go, let's get it

Y'all ain't doin' jack shit, just a bunch of has-beens
What the fuck happened? Why you stop rappin'?
Huh?
I'm the future, tryna ball like a hooper
Attack a beat like a cougar, rouga
Who the dude that wanna come and talk shit
I'm so fly, high up in my cockpit
The tapes comin' boy, wait until I drop it
It's some hot shit I know you gone cop it
It's like Tha Carter III mixed with The Chronic (classic)
Plus some Big L and Nas hits
I tell 'em "Watch this", start spitting out rockets
Light a beat up like your fiber optics
Pause, you ain't seen this yet kid
Resurrectin' this DMX diff
On tracks I be doin' them BMX flips
Sex chicks and move on up to the next bitch
Big like Texas, don't mess with the freshest
Yeah I spin electric, my set is the best
In the PA, country, continent, the world
Cryin lil' bitches, I ain't starting with you girls
It's Mac (It's Mac), it's Mac, jump back (Aha)
Dumb raps and my lungs is black
Uh yeah, it's Mac, say it again, yeah
Chest collapse when you takin' it in
I'm playing to win, spittin' it right
We just a couple of kids living the life
And I'm stayin' sharp like the end of a knife
And your girl come to me cause you ain't hittin' it right (Haha)
You might also like
Ayy that's how it go down
I don't even need a hook for this shit know what I'm sayin'?
I'm just keep on spittin' let this camera keep rollin' and shit

Lesson, if you wanna play with the kid
See don't come bullshittin' sayin' you spit
Say you, up and comin' but just buggin'
And I don't rap for the stacks, I rap cause I rap
And Mac be the cat with the haze and the dro
Games for the dough, I'm the next up to blow
Stretchin' the flows I'm that all-white, yeah
And spark mic's like a shark bite
You as bright, 'bout as bright as a car light (Haha)
And you ain't tight you just all right
I'm as nice as a calm night
Chilling with some broads, 'bout as raw as a bar fight
Cannon on me any more, the base bumpin' through the floor
Make veterans feel like they ain't did it before
I'm a black belt bitch get ya ass kicked
My weed bomb you could smell it through the plastic
Take a whiff, please all ya senses
In this rap shit they call me God's apprentice
Cause they say the kid got the hardest sentence
Feelin' like a pitch from Roger Clemens
That's how it go down
You know how it is, all day
Mac Miller, Easy Mac, The Jukebox
Play any beat motherfucker, I'ma murder it
Career criminal
Serial killerEmbed
