25 ContributorsLet Up Lyrics
Earl: I'd like to tell you about the strangest secret in the world
Thug: What's that?
Earl: Some years ago, Albert Schweitzer, the late doctor
And Nobel prize-winner was being interviewed in London
And the reporter asked him "Doctor, what's wrong with men today?"
Thug: They gay

Yah, yah, yah
It's Thugger, Thugger Thugger baby
Oh my fucking God

Fish scale? Oh yeah
They sell? I bet
Got Boy? Retail
Mexico, next to go
Whenever God give me my moment
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Hundred bands inside my coffin
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Got yo bitch inside the office
She ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
And we show out in the club
You know they lettin' us, lettin' us, lettin' us

I'm on a Harley David, I got a choppa on my seat
I got a lot of babies
They go for 34 a piece
I feel like Tom Brady
I got them nines on my feet, nigga shut up
Young Thug on a high-speed chase
I'm not gon' let up, let up, let up
Take the penitentiary chances
Tryna run up on my funds
Young Thugga pimping, bitch
Feel like fucking Don Jon
I know plug talk language, Thugger Casciano lingo
I got my Trayvon hoodie on
She still see me, she no bingo
I feel just like Birdman
Put my steering wheel in middle
D Kizzle got my spot fizzle with bizzles, can you dizzle?
Yeah, Dk got my spot filled with bitches, can you dizl?
You talk a million dollars, where your paper and yo pencil?

Fish scale? Oh, yeah
They sell? I bet
Got Boy? Retail
Mexico, next to go
Whenever God give me my moment
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Hundred bands inside my coffin
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Got yo bitch inside the office
She ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
And we show out in the club
You know they lettin' us, lettin' us, lettin' us
I feel like Tarzan
Might spot filled up with trees
I got a newer plan
Motherfuck the streets, take over the beach
And this is fuck insane
I build a kinsel and a man
Bitch ain't got no class
You know we call her truancy
All the flesh be like "B-L-A-T-T"
You know my jewelry, ice and water like the AC&T
My bitch bad but I'm the bomb, I'm like TNT
You wanna race? When they say "start" I'm at the END
She need a trophy 'cause I nut on her just like Milla Vanilla
I drink that Actavis, yo Sprite look like it got Starbursts and Skittles
I got a big mink on, I'm a walking gorilla
And we takin' all these bitches, man these niggas gon' kill us (Ha)

Fish scale? Oh, yeah
They sell? I bet
Got Boy? Retail
Mexico, next to go
Whenever God give me my moment
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Hundred bands inside my coffin
I ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
Got yo bitch inside the office
She ain't gon' let up, let up, let up
And we show out in the club
You know they lettin' us, lettin' us, lettin' us2Embed
