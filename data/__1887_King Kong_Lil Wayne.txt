If you hear me 'fore you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King Kong, King Kong (What it is!?)
If you hear 'fore you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk (Yeah)
King Kong, King Kong (Drought 3)
King Kong, King Kong (Drought 3)
King Kong, King Kong (I got 'em)
If you hear 'fore you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

I pop my trunk and everybody get to runnin'
The Fireman, bitch, like my body in the oven
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryna get a dozen
My name like honey, got a lot of bitches buzzin'
The neck of the barrel so long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunch and it munch, like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eyes on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on point like an arrow
Street nigga, baby, I'm in love with the gravel
Money gives me life, like a man with a gavel
I'm strapped at home, I'm strapped when I travel
I pop my trunk and made them bitches spread like cattle
(Moo), hah
You might also like
King Kong, Ki-King Kong (I got that)
King Kong, Ki-King Kong (Yeah, I'm talking 'bout that)
If you hear me 'fore you see me (Blum-blum, blum-blum)
I got King Kong in the trunk (That Blum-blum)
King Kong, King Kong
King Kong, King Kong
King Kong, King Kong
(Yeah, choppers with drums, choppers with drums)
King Kong, King Kong
(Choppers with drums, choppers with drums, go!)

(I got King Kong in the trunk) And I feed him banana clips
And let him sing like Gladys Knight and the Pips
I'm just sticking to the motherfuckin' manuscript
Understand, I'm tryna get the chips and the dip
Better know I hold that gun with a Panther grip
My hollow bullets got tips like a dancer bitch
Where my money? Where my money? Need to answer quick
Gotta get back up on my ransom shit
And put you (In the trunk), so you lay on top of speakers
Holes all in you like an old pair of sneakers
Before I do a day on the edge, I will leap first
Bet you any money that I will land feet-first
Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies
Riding with Bigfoot, Harry and the Hendersons
Godzilla, King Kong, and if I have to park
I will open up my trunk, and it will be Jurassic Park
King Kong, Ki-King Kong (I got that)
King Kong, Ki-King Kong (I'm talking 'bout that)
(Blum-blum, blum-blum)
That blum-blum, that blum-blum
I'm talking 'bout that
I'm talking 'bout choppers with drums
Choppers with drums, choppers with drums
