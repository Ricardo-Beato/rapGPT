(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

I got gas, it's for sale, yeah
Got a whole lot of packs in the mail, yeah
I got coke, you can sniff it off your nail, yeah
Have a seat, show you how to wrap a bale, yeah
Got a triple beam scale
I got clientèle
I got clientèle, yeah
I got clientèle
Got a triple beam scale
I got clientèle
I got clientèle, yeah
I got clientèle

You said you was trappin', I was trappin' for real
Posted on the ave, pussy-boy, don't need no deal
I got pints in, and they coming with a seal
I felt like Screech, I was saved by a bell
I skrrt, then I zoom, boy, you know I pulled off
You fronted me some work, then you know you took a loss
I'm Slaughter Gang Savage, bitch
And we got lot of sauce
I got real clientèle, bitch
My trap house is a loft

I run my money up off of a triple beam scale
I am 21, Young Savage
Try me, and you're going to hell, I don't give a fuck about a bitch
Fuck a bitch and duck a bitch
Young Savage, bitch, man, you niggas on that sucker shit
Trappin', trappin' hard, cutting cocaine with that cutlery
I don't want your bitch 'cause she ain't nothing but a nut to me

I got gas, it's for sale, yeah
Got a whole lot of packs in the mail, yeah
I got coke, you can sniff it off your nail, yeah
