2 Contributors911 Emergency Lyrics
Holiday Season, shrimps

Dial 911, send emergency
Tell the swat team to please respond with urgency
'Cause Gucci stole my girl, grand larceny
His bars too hot for just an arson
Dial 911, send emergency
Tell the swat team to please respond with urgency
'Cause Gucci stole my girl, grand larceny
His bars too hot for just an arson

I walk in and start straight ballin', ballin'
Pardon me be I just came to party, party
Shawty lookin' at me all retarted, tarted
Standin' in the very important, portant
Overseas Kush import it, port it
One hit wonders can't afford it, afford it
Camеra phone, it's time to take a portrait, portrait
Mе and you together, that's gorgeous, gorgeous
She like my swag and I'm a recordist, 'cordist
She said her ex man was too boring, boring
I'm the doctor if you got insurance, 'surance
First get to testin' your endurance, 'durance
I got a sick side effect you can't cure it, cure it
I have you thinkin' about me 24/7, 7
So if you want to take a flick use caution, caution
Cause if you legal and you single we talkin', talkin'
You might also like
Dial 911, send emergency
Tell the swat team to please respond with urgency
'Cause Gucci stole my girl, grand larceny
His bars too hot for just an arson
I'm about to steal your girl like a burglary
Yeah, I'm a convict but girls still want to fuck with me
I got that glue game, bad hoes stick to me
I'm in that new thang so I got your bitch with me
So when Gucci Mane call it ain't a mystery
She know she kidnap but she not even trippin'
So when Gucci Mane call it ain't a mystery
She know she kidnap but she not even trippin'

Her brain is super she from the suburbs
I'm from east Atlanta where we move them 30 birds
Do I know you? If I owe you, pay you on the thirty third
Got your girlfriend clueless, speechless, starin' she can't say a word
She's alert is a flirt in the club wanna jerk
In her skirt with her purse she remind of my work
Keyed my Vert, know it hurt, wanna murk
Cause I smirk, it's berserk how she jerk, passin' purp like a nerf, Gucci

Call 911, send Emergency
Tell the swat team to please respond with urgency
Cause Gucci stole my girl, grand larceny
His bars too hot for just an arson
I'm about to steal your girl like a burglary
Yeah, I'm a convict but girls still want to fuck with me

I'm in that new thang so I got your bitch with me
So when Gucci Mane call it ain't a mystery
She kno she kidnap but she not even trippin'
So when Gucci Mane call it ain't a mystery
She know she kidnap but she not even trippin'
I don't really don't come out that often, often
I got a sick sound effect, it's not coughin'
I toss racks out and I like tossin', tossin'
I got a shinin' problem, I just like flossin'
Sorry, baby, I just like gorgeous
Baby, I can pay your mortgage
I came up Boulder Crest Morland
I rock a real chain, same as Mike Jordan's

Call 911, send Emergency
Tell the swat team to please respond with urgency
Cause Gucci stole my girl, grand larceny
His bars too hot for just an arson
I'm about to steal your girl like a burglary
Yeah, I'm a convict but girls still want to fuck with me
