64 ContributorsWit My Crew X 1987 Lyrics

By the way, who're you waitin' for anyway?
I'm waitin' for Dolemite
For who?
Dolemite, motherfucker, you heard her
Sowoot, FKi

Ayy, I just got rid of my boo (Got rid of my)
I might just swerve in a coupe (I might swerve in a, what?)
I fucked your girl in my coupe (I fucked you girl in my)
Popping these pills, they be blue (Pop, pop, pop)
My chain so tight like a noose (Tight, tight, tight, tight)
Watch, I be flexin' on you (Watch, I flex, pop a)
Riding around, we go vroom (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)

Riding around with my crew (Skrrt)
Riding around with my crew (With my crew)
Riding around with my crew (Crew)
I'm riding around with my crew (My crew)
Riding around with my crew (Riding around)
I'm riding around with my crew (With my crew)
Riding around, we go vroom
Watch how we flexin' on you (Flexin' on you)

Ayy, bitch, I ain't checking on you (Ain't checkin' on you)

Ayy, counting these bills, they be blue (Countin' these hundreds, these hundreds)
Ayy, get the money, snooze you lose

Ayy, I just got rid of my boo (Got rid of my)
I might just swerve in a coupe (I might swerve in a, what?)
I fucked your girl in my coupe (I fucked you girl in my)
Popping these pills, they be blue (Pop, pop, pop)
My chain so tight like a noose (Tight, tight, tight, tight)
Watch, I be flexin' on you (Watch, I flex, pop a)
Riding around, we go vroom (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)

Oh, I am so sick like the flu (Flu)
Oh, getting money like a Jew
Spend a hundred on my jewels (Spend a hundred on my)
Feel like Santana with my Jewels (Woo, woo)
Thick white girl right on my side (Yeah)
She kinda look like, um, YesJulz (Woo)
No, you can't come to my room (To my room)
With them clothes on, that's my rule (That's my rule)
I leave you wetter than a pool (Yeah)

Yeah, I just need to find

Popping these pills, they be blue (Pop, pop, pop)
My chain so tight like a noose (Tight, tight, tight, tight)

It is not normal
It is not normal
My life is not normal
