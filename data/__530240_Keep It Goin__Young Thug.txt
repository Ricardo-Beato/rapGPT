28 ContributorsKeep It Goinâ€™ Lyrics
Show me how to keep it goin'
Tell me how to keep it goin'
Long as you show me how to keep it goin'
We got London on da Track
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma keep it goin'
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, I'ma keep it goin'
As long as you show me, I'ma keep it goin'

Uh
Showing love to these bitches
As I take off like a missile, ayy
These niggas mugging when they see us
So I clutch on all my pistols
Plus I come through smoking loud like a whistle
Looking down from the cloud in my rearview
These pussy niggas want a slice like Kimbo
And I freeze them all, Sub Zero
Dynasty, Dynasty
These bitches climb on me, climb on me
That's mine, I want the whole ninety Gs
All my niggas feasting, yes, dining please
I put on my ice and they liking this
Fuck her fast, nitrogen, nitrogen
Roar, bitch, Lion King, Lion King
I got more water than Tennessee
Then I take it off and pour it on her like a coach
Playing with my money bitch you fired, you a roach
Straight up in that vintage, it's just Chanel, no Coach
Put the little bitch in time out, no spoke
Why the fuck a nigga rolling my weed and leave it open?
And I'm cooking all white, nigga, no portions
You might also like
I cannot be worried 'bout no bitch
'Cause I know a bitch could be somewhere sucking a dick, ayy
You like "Where the hell is yo bitch?"
Meanwhile yo bitch like "Where the hell is yo clique?", hey
I can't buy you pearls, buy your shit
I got three boys, and three girls, with a bitch, hey
Diamonds yellow like corn on the Cob
I can't buy you shit unless you got a blow job
Big Homie show me how to keep it goin'
I can't be no lick like no motherfucking tongue, ayy
Big Homie tell me how to keep it goin'
Milk these lil' bitches like I'm motherfucking farming
Big Homie show me how to keep it goin'
I can't be no lick like no motherfucking tongue, ayy
Big Homie tell me how to keep it goin'
*Sips Lean*

A nigga riding with the top off (Skrt)
And now I need a new Hairdo (Where she at?)
Bitch, you know my diamonds wetter than a sink
Every time I come around them bitches faint
Baby I'ma sing to you like Tank
Baby I want you to dry me like I'm paint
Spl-spl-spl-splat on the other side
If you bout to die nigga tell me would you ride
Let a nigga play, I pull up with a whole tribe
Flood your wrist with lots of karats 'cause you're Bonnie and Clyde, woo
Hundred rounds on that motherfucker, gah, gah, gah (WOO!)
I get respect whenever I land in New York
Like Bobby Shmurda, nigga, ah, ah (Woo)
It's a shame how I yell at these niggas and don't lose my voice
And, it's a shame how my ice so cold but I leave these bitches moist (Leave her wet, what?)
I swear to God, baby, you're the people's choice
And when I get home right before I go to sleep I wake up my little boy, hey
And I tell him
I cannot be worried 'bout no bitch
'Cause I know a bitch could be somewhere sucking a dick, ayy
You like "Where the hell is yo bitch?"
Meanwhile yo bitch like "Where the hell is yo clique?", hey
I can't buy you pearls, buy your shit
I got three boys, and three girls, with a bitch, hey
Diamonds yellow like corn on the Cob
I can't buy you shit unless you got a blow job
Big Homie show me how to keep it goin'
I can't be no lick like no motherfucking tongue, ayy
Big Homie tell me how to keep it goin'
Milk these lil' bitches like I'm motherfucking farming
Big Homie show me how to keep it goin'
I can't be no lick like no motherfucking tongue, ayy
Big Homie tell me how to keep it goin'

Show me how to keep it goin'
Tell me how to keep it goin'
Long as you show me how to keep it goin'
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma keep it goin'
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, I'ma keep it goin'
As long as you show me, I'ma keep it goin'
Tell me how to keep it goin'
Long as you show me how to keep it goin'
Tell me how to keep it goin'
Long as you show me how to keep it goin'
As long as you show me, I'ma keep it goin'18Embed
