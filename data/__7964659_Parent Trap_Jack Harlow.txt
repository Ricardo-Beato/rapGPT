Looking 'round, it's hard to believe where I'm at, uh
Everywhere I look, somebody starin' back, yeah
Paranoid, even out in paradise
Terrified to see my parents pass
Red carpet and some dress shoes
And a pair of slacks
I think I might be gettin' sick of wearin' that
I need some peace and the 'burbs might be where it's at
You know like where them Karens like to they run they errands at
I'm on a journey, man, Jarrett Jack
Got my twin with me like The Parent Trap, there and back
Serenade 'em with the clarinet
I got the tea and I ain't sharin' that
Who the fairest of 'em all? Shawty's been declarin' Jack
Fellas hatin', I don't blame 'em, I mean how unfair is that?
The top is where they like to see you get embarrassed at
Especially when you charismatic and the coppas wear Hermès

All these airplanes and these checked bags
All these rumors and these unchecked facts
Old friends I forget to text back
Maybe this'll show where my heads at, my bad (You know)

Every sky can't be blue
It's hard to see when you're walkin' in the grey
So many flights, look at how the time flew
So many things that I never got to—
Good days, bad days, red lights, fast lanes
Would you never change? Would you be the same?
Just tell me one thing that's true when I ain't up
You hold me down
You might also like
You hold me down (Hold me—)
Say you'll hold me down
Hold me down
Hold me down

You know the squares hate the prom king
You know they prayin' that I say the wrong thing
Look at the disdain that these hit songs bring, huh
I mean I could've kept it niche
But I'd rather see my brothers get rich
Hit the kill switch, hit the slugger field first pitch
Seven-figure brand deals tend to feel worthless

All these airplanes and these checked bags
All these rumors and these unchecked facts
Old friends I forget to text back
Maybe this'll show where my heads at, my bad (You know)

Every sky can't be blue
It's hard to see when you're walkin' in the grey
So many flights, look at how the time flew
So many things that I never got to—
Good days, bad days, red lights, fast lanes
Would you never change? Would you be the same?
Just tell me one thing that's true when I ain't up
You hold me down (Right, right)
You hold me down (Hold me— Right? Right?)
Say you'll hold me down
Hold me down
Hold me down

La, la-la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la
Hold me down
Hold me down3Embed
