15 ContributorsStomp â€™Em Out Lyrics
The midnight murder, two cop bodies on my heat
Walk the street with a motherfuckin straight face
Little shorty flip the script, huh
On any punk-ass nigga or bitch
The little brown skin Buddha sucker, little motherfucker
I dwell in juvenile hell (Yeah, yeah)
I got the shit that make you wanna catch a body quick
Fuck 'em up, bust 'em down Queensbridge style
Street corner thug my title
Neighborhood partygoer, Noriega was my idol (Yeah)
So what you wanna do, nigga?
My knuckle game brought me fame in the project hallways
I got mad props for killing cops
Little shorty hood, a little nigga no good
My twenty-five weighs a ton, so run
I'll cock it back on your black ass, B, and it's like that

Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out
Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out
Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out
Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out

Throw on my hoodie, when niggas lit the fully
I put a fuckin' cap in the neighborhood bully
What now, coward-ass nigga? You ain't tough
Fakin' jacks, I'ma call your motherfuckin bluff
Niggas that violate get me vexed
Son got the MAC, Noyd got the TEC
I catch a body, baggin' niggas like deez
Uptown cooking keys, flippin' twenty G's
Around the way, bustin' Phils by the fuckin pack
 Yeah, kid, you know I got that
Jump in the hoopty, countin' up my looty
Throw on my vest in case niggas wanna shoot me
Niggas blazin' at my ride
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I retaliate with the bullshit two-five
It's only right that I represent
Sip on the E&J straight, fuck around and get mega bent
Me and my crew wild for days
Burn up the stage like a motherfuckin' heatwave
Learn to maintain, less stress on the brain
Niggas try to front, but they know my motherfuckin' name
Straight from the 'Bridge, yeah, you know my style kid
I have you shook like a twenty-five to life bid
You might also like
Put yuh gun inna yuh hand
Kill di pussyclot cah  like
Put di killa pon line
Four .45 and three .39
Put yuh gun inna yuh hand
Kill di pussyclot cah  like
Put di killa pon line
Four .45 and three .39

Blowin' niggas out the frame, yes, it's part of the game
If your style ain't fit, you need to flip the script
And get on it, you might think it's all about that bullshit
But shit get real with a MAC and two clips
Niggas with a hoodie, mmm, somethings' up
First I heard a scream and next I heard a buck
Bow, I kneeled down, one knee on the ground
I pull out the Glock and twin pull out the four pound
Shit is real, slingin' rocks on the block
If you wanna carry G's, you got to carry a Glock
And go all out, get down for your clown, don't fuck around
Nigga try to front, believe he get beat down
And turn around, get popped with the Glock in a sec
While your man got the TEC to his fuckin' neck
You know my style, kid, you know I'm wild, kid
Don't try to front, don't make me flip and catch a damn bid
Representin' from the 'Bridge, you know how it is
My name is Big Noyd, stomp 'em out, kid
Know what I'm sayin'? Big Noyd in the motherfuckin' house
Representin' from the Queensbridge Housing
My man Big Twin, know what I'm sayin'?
 (Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out)
Keep it goin', keep it goin', keep it flowin' (Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out)
Keep it goin', keep it flowin', keep it goin', keep it flowin' (Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out)
Keep it goin', keep it goin', keep it flowin' check it out (Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out)
(Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out)
Give a shout out to the motherfuckin' Goodfellas (Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out)
We got my man T , Rapper G, Karate Joe doin' it on (Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out)
Know what I'm sayin'?  (Stomp 'em out, kid, stomp 'em out)
Stomp 'em out, stomp 'em out, stomp 'em out1Embed
