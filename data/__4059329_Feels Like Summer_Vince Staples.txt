60 ContributorsFeels Like Summer Lyrics
Big Boy!
Man, whatever day, vibe, month it is
It just feels like summer
You know what I'm saying?
It always feels like summer in the neighborhood, man
When you get a chance to come in
You get a chance to lay back
You get a chance to laugh
You get a chance to chill
Best believe that, man
And being that it always feels like summer
Let's go ahead and make you feel like summer

Summertime in the LB wild
We gon' party 'til the sun or the guns come out
JB first one fouled out playing ball
Now the whole city love you, how?
Boy we know they wasn't down from the get go
Dirty got a dozen rounds, better get low
Lil Johnny gave his life for this shit
All he got was a plot and a bottle from the Winco
Still North Side, Parkside, Vince though
Two N's, new friends, we skip those
Try finessin' my way into Heaven
Might hit that gate, might fall from grace
Splat, on the concrete, real street runner
First month still feel like summer
Cold weather won't stop no gunner
Wrong hat, wrong day, I'll kill my brother
You might also like
Ayy, summertime in the LB
Know it ain't shit a broke nigga gon' tell me now
Drop top with the top down now
All the bad bitches gon' feel me now, ayy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Scared money don't make money, hey
White man wan' take from me, hey
White fans at the Coachella, hey
Never been touched, niggas know better, hey (Ooh yeah)
Same ways since summer school, Baby J
Either I'ma make the news or make a play
Passed Alyssa house, could've took a different route
Wouldn't be without, think about her every day
Moved on, life fast like that
Still struggle with the past, I'm strapped
Somebody gotta watch my back
Everybody wanna count my bag
Ease off me, these streets taught me
Speak softly, please don't taunt me
Knew when Vicky 'nem stayed on eighth
If they killed me, then I'd be great
Now they lookin' at me
Summertime in the LB
Know it ain't shit a broke nigga gon' tell me now
Drop top with the top down now
All the bad bitches gon' feel me now, ayy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

There it is, man
I told y'all, feels like summer no matter when it is, man
It always feels like summer in the Neighborhood
And being that it feels like summer, let's do this man
Let's go outside4Embed
