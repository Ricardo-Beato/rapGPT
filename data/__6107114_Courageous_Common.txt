16 ContributorsCourageous Lyrics
I'm right here in the flesh, you can take it or not
I'm not claiming, pretending to be what I'm not
I ain't nobody's angel
When this world try to change you
Who you are, just embrace it
Stay courageous

Unapologetic, unashamed with it
Times in life, I came with it
When the unseen became vivid
Of different flesh, same spirit
It's like a lyric by Stevie Wonder
Through inner visions, you can see the wonder
Spent time in life being the runner
Couldn't run from what I've seen this summеr
Tryna understand where wе are in time
Looking at the world, keeping God in mind
I know it's a peace, it's hard to find
I went out there found mine decide
I'm alive on arrival
My life is more than survival
You can live and be live too
That's how heaven will describe you
You might also like
If you want something real
I'm right here in the flesh, you can take it or not
I'm not claiming, pretending to be what I'm not
I ain't nobody's angel
When this world try to change you
Who you are, just embrace it
Stay courageous and be real
Yeah, I'm here in the flesh, you can take it or not
I'm not claiming, pretending to be what I'm not
I ain't nobody's angel
When this world try to change you
Who you are, just embrace it
Stay courageous

Look life in the eye, I can see clearer
A kingdom's coming, you can hear it near us
Stay close to the sincerest
Those the ones that become mirrors
Speak no hate, let love hear us
Times I'm me is when I was fearless
There's a self I gotta take care of
So with the world, I can truly share love
And be a bearer of fruit on the planet
Guided steps I don't take for granted
Time is manic we internalize
Honor that little boy or little girl inside
Pray these words arise to the ears of angels
We let go of fears that we came through
Change is beautiful as it is painful
The world is yours, don't let it change you
Don't let it change you
I'm right here in the flesh, you can take it or not
I'm not claiming, pretending to be what I'm not
I ain't nobody's angel
When this world try to change you
Who you are, just embrace it
Stay courageous and be real
Yeah, I'm here in the flesh, you can take it or not
I'm not claiming, pretending to be what I'm not
I ain't nobody's angel
When this world try to change you
Who you are, just embrace it
Stay courageous2Embed
