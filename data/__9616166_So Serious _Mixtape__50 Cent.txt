1 ContributorSo Serious (Mixtape) Lyrics
I'm so so serious
I’m oh so serious
I, I got it
I, I get it

Now I lay thee down to sleep
I pray, my Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die though before I awake
Let my niggas celebrate and split my cake

It's 50, I'm so real, you ain’t see none realer
Ex-crack dealer, I click-clack for the skrilla
I'm heartless, something like a cold-blooded killer
I'm filthy, dirty with the money, my nigga
I done ran through more cars than your Rolls Royce dealer
I put that on my Goddaughter, I love you, Jon Miller
New Bentley or not, watch the chinchilla
Sean Don spitter, Banshee four wheeler
I'm big in New York, I move like Godzilla
Gorilla, U.N.I.T Nigga
Grave digger, ask Puffy and Jigga
Made nigga, my pockets get bigger
And bigger, you got no choice but to feel a
Nigga when I spit that shit, I figure
It'll only bring more bread
You fuck around, I get down and go upside yo' head
You might also like
Now I lay thee down to sleep
I pray, my Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die though before I awake
Let my niggas celebrate and split my cake
Now I lay thee down to sleep
I pray the Lord forgive me for holding heat
If I should die though before I awake
Let my niggas celebrate and split my cake

Oh! I just got back from the UK
A lil jet-lagged from the flight
But when I'm out there, they say...
They say, "50, 50 you're my favorite
We love you, 50! You’re massive
Mash it up, there is no competition
No, no, there is no competition
You have to be kidding"
I can’t believe it, I'm drunk!
It’s 50, yeahEmbed
