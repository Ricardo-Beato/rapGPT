35 ContributorsOuter Space Bih Lyrics
Yeah, California 'Rari, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Yeah

Rocking icy watches, woah, woah, woah
California 'Rari, woah, woah, woah
Bad lil' hottie, woah woah, woah
And she know Pilates, woah, woah, woah
Rocking icy watches, woah, woah, woah
California 'Rari, woah, woah, woah
Pineapple Tropicana, outer space bitch
I bought the Presi' plain and gave it a face lift

Would have cheated at 3 p.m., smash your bitch on day shift
Gotta always keep me a ten, woah, woah, woah
Got fucked in the back of my Benz, woah, woah, woah
I was already on I-10 with a load, load, load
Got a pound on the backseat, I'ma drivin' drug store
Money stretchin', elastic
We buy them APs out the plastic
Man, they got my Sky-Dweller out the casket
Gotta make these niggas pay taxes
Spent 30K on one jacket
We send them bitches 'round the atlas
I told her throw it till she gaggin'

Rocking icy watches, woah, woah, woah
California 'Rari, woah, woah, woah
Bad lil' hottie, woah woah, woah
And she know Pilates, woah, woah, woah
Rocking icy watches, woah, woah, woah
California 'Rari, woah, woah, woah
Pineapple Tropicana, outer space bitch
I bought the Presi' plain and gave it a face lift

She was attached to me like fleas, what it do?
White diamonds, but they look light blue
I always rep my family, I respect them brothers 'cause I got juice, too
I swear to God, he didn't die, he eatin' chicken soup
I'm Shaq size in the field, how I feel
Those bitch, I leave them hoes in tears
I'm mad scientist, but the chronic getting its grip
I got like two G-Wagens in my ears
Man, I've been heavyweight, fuck, for some years
I dedicate everything, she feel it in her rear
Man, I ain't never gonna change I'm worth a hundred mill
We gone make  them niggas mad when them checks clear, yeah

Rocking icy watches, woah, woah, woah
California 'Rari, woah, woah, woah
Bad lil' hottie, woah woah, woah
And she know Pilates, woah, woah, woah
Rocking icy watches, woah, woah, woah
California 'Rari, woah, woah, woah
Pineapple Tropicana, outer space bitch
I bought the Presi' plain and gave it a face lift
Woah, woah, woah6Embed
