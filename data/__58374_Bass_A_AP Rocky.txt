3 ContributorsClientele Lyrics(Intro)
We here to save the motherfuckin streets
The streets disciples, nigga
DJ Scream, Doe B
Baby Jesus
Hood Rich, biatch
(Chorus)
I got real diamonds in my watch
Shinin like a fish scale
You must not see the check I got
New Ghost and the Panamera
Catch on the foreigner
Fuckin nigga my way
I don’t get it back I’m ballin
Cos I got stupid clientele
(Verse 1)
Stupid clientele bumpin out the charge
Out on 12, blow our cell, nigga comin sure
Old bass nah, I got straight job
Jumping out the part, movin, playin large
Only see the key, talkin recharge
I got what you need, wut you got?
Copy 2-0-3, here’s another one
Rollie AAP, both for 1-0-1
It’s like yo watch a BB gun, I’m a bad boy
Big old diamonds in my tron look like trap rocks
I trap the bad bitches, jack boys a test for ya
But the kid’s still in the trap going hard
You might also like(Chorus)
I got real diamonds in my watch
Shinin like a fish scale
You must not see the check I got
New Ghost and the Panamera
Catch on the foreigner
Fuckin nigga my way
I don’t get it back I’m ballin
Cos I got stupid clientele
(Verse 2)
I got real molly on the scale
This ain’t down south, nigga this that real deal
I’m gon serve a K, boy this shit can get real
Team full ahead, bosses no trivill
Roll the cut, bought the Xan pill
Fuck the bitch and I can’t remember night still
Louie V in my belt buckle
Nigga I won’t tussle, I’m a boy that fall in brochure
Bitch I’m from a diamond, we got swever seal
No strap for sale, nothing but grind for sale
I might just pull the trigger if you ain’t got the deal
They don’t need nada, I got stupid clientele
(Chorus)
I got real diamonds in my watch
Shinin like a fish scale
You must not see the check I got
New Ghost and the Panamera
Catch on the foreigner
Fuckin nigga my way
I don’t get it back I’m ballin
Cos I got stupid clientele
(Verse 3)
Fuck until I hold em, all we do is win win
Maserati all white like my girlfriend
Lil mama think ahead, she got swordfish
I like to throw it in the water, swim baby, swim
Going hard in the paint, all these down blazing
Call me foot long as Shawty all the damn J’s
Baby mail for me, cookin all the joy for me
A million cheap burger soul, yea I done swore one
How you think a nigga steady coppin all these bricks
Mixin weed with this strong, I ain’t lyin bout shit
And I stay fly on my shit
Guess that why she on my dick
Got yo hoe last year settlin right here on my wrist
(Chorus)
I got real diamonds in my watch
Shinin like a fish scale
You must not see the check I got
New Ghost and the Panamera
Catch on the foreigner
Fuckin nigga my way
I don’t get it back I’m ballin
Cos I got stupid clientele
Cos I got stupid clientele
Cos I got stupid clienteleEmbed
