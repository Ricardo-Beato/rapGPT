Got blue diamonds in my chain but I ain't motherfuckin' crippin'
Naw nigga, I ain't lowkey, y'all just motherfuckin' slippin'
If you caught some blue dream nigga that ain't even pimpin'
Thousand pounds of OG in and I wrap 'em like crystal
If you niggas wanna get it, cost you 35 50
You can park your Honda Civic baby, come jump in my Bentley
I rather that we go together than you try to go against me
I got a bad bitch, super bad bitch, gotta kiss that
Ass fat, pussy real good, my little nat nat
Slow your roll, gotta hold on when she throw it back
Know your roll, gotta go strong when we in the sack
And I treat that like a queen, clean when I meet that
And I freak that, trick her outta jeans, beat her from the back
Then I tease me, better please me, like you need me
And if need be, ya better bring me them 60 PT

She a bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
She a bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch

Fuckin' with little shawty cause her head strong
Gave her 10k told her buy a purse
She only wanna nigga cause the bread long
But she fuck me like a vet so we can make it work
Louie V, Dior, she be wantin' more
Take her on the road and make me fuck her on the tour
Fuck her on the tour, I said fuck her on the tour
Shawty bust for everybody like she bout to go to war
We don't do no cuffin', I let bro hit her
If he don't get no love, I bet Bo get her
But she a bad bitch makin' more figures
Than half you niggas out there and you know nigga

She a bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
She a bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch

Super bad bitch, super bad wrist
I got a queen in the Audi, she ain't average
I got a Clark, Atlanta, brown skin, nasty
I got a spare me, bad bitch, classy
I got a gangsta bitch, do whatever I say
So roll my Backwoods and keep a throw-away
I know that pussy good and that ass goin' crazy
And she gone flip for me if a nigga play it
I look back on my life, I swear to God I feel amazing
I put the pimpin' to make a bitch refrain this
White girl, white girls, you know I'm not a stranger
And all my spanish girls, hasta luego
She a bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
She a bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch
Bad bitch, super bad bitch, super bad bitch1Embed
