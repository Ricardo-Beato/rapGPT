I'm straight loco, to hell with you and your broke ho
You ain't a big dog, you more like Toto, you got no dough
I smoke dro mixed with cocoa, strong as Bolo
I pack a fo'-fo', platinum Ro'-Ro'
Anti-homo, that's a no-no, so fuck po'-po'
I push the 740 and not the Volvo
C-Town push the six-oh-oh, I'm with a bitch or I'm dolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs, I buck for heads
I even buck celebs, nigga, fuck the fedsYou might also likeEmbed
