44 ContributorsOlder Gods Lyrics

Yo, word, yo, yo

Aiyo, I roll like a Bat out of Hell
Evil acapell's fly, spittin' out of my grill
Before I hit the sky with springtime colors, juicy as a Sunkist
Certain broads double Dutch this, they carve it in they wrist
Pillsbury blazes, straightening combs left on the stove
Crumbs in my lady hair, plus yours, the look gold
God, the old chain and ball technique
Got these vegetable lasagna niggas in they whips, jumpin' out they seats
18 Bronzemen Pt. II
We like Dorothy Hamill on ice — we in your hood, we might circle
Hats down low in the Range, switch lanes
Change my tire, peel out, real loud on the stage, yo
I shitted on your hood, kid! I shitted on your hood
Got to your burner too late, I'm lookin' real good
Draped out, shinin' like a fresh 50 cent piece
"Yo, girlfriend, come here, oh shit! You my man's niece!"
The gourmet pocket twenty, bombs made of clay
Sexcapades take place, we fuckin' 48 shades
Might walk up in your studio time, slap your engineer
Lighter fluid to DAT style, hand me the matches now
You might also like
Aiyo, rainbow Rollie on the wrist, now watch this
Niggas bless this, eight and a half, Bally banana twist
E shakes, puffin' on lye, feedin' the seed's plate
Pullin' out old .38's to rob gates
Major wake up, the kid tell-tales, make a nigga head wake up
Beats break, the nigga whipped, take off his time
Honolulu status, gladdest, the rich rock cabbage
And dollar vans grands, that nigga mad savage
Stationary Hall of Justice, niggas came clumped out
Just came home, now they bunked out
Money be longer than triple life 'til the Sun burn out
That's my word, move it with the burner out
Fidel way of thinkin', roll with the Mac bent
Ac-10, most of my team — Five Percent
Check what the live said, rollin' with Guess vests pedestrians
Yo, holdin' my nuts, fuckin' thousand dollar lesbians

Yo, the Older God put me on to how to rock this
Maintain 360 Lord and live prosperous
It only takes a lesson a day, just to analyze life
One time in the respectable mind
Yo, the Older God put me on to how to rock this
Maintain 360 Lord and live prosperous
It only takes a lesson a day, just to analyze life
One time in the respectable mind
Let the shot spark soon as his pit bull barks
Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
Witness forget his original statement
Even in protection programs, there's no escapement
Gunned down, three in town, hit king from seven crowns
Spent rounds, catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge
Wounded back in the '83 summer heat
Up in 3-0-9 park, rhymin' off the drummer's beat
I stalked the city streets, demonstratin' mic wrecks
All lookin' stank, I ain't playin' with a full deck
And as they nervously stare, I know they scared
They saw the comin' of Wu in neon in Times Square
Household name, assassin, Killa Bee
Mill to the grain that posses the Wu trilogy
Quick to spot those that bite, camouflage and blend
Those that got styles, they got identical twins
Don't stress the small thing, copycats are finicky
Without skills, they master the art of mimicry
But I go line for line on the whole page
Your unspotted life on the mic is old age6Embed
