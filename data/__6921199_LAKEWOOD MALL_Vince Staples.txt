31 ContributorsLAKEWOOD MALL Lyrics
Nigga met this nigga at the McDonald's at Lakewood Mall
This nigga like, randomly, like, "Bro, I got the Blue L.A.'s for your .38 Derringer"
Mind you nigga, this a— this a— you feel me?
It's the little pearl hammer handle thing, in and out
Nigga give it to him
Later on that night, nigga get pulled over
Police thoroughly searched the car
On God, nigga would've got cracked if I would've kept it
And they never even knew I got rid of the gun
I never told 'em, so the whole time they sеarching, everybody in the car is scarеd
I forgot to tell 'em, like, "Nigga been gave that shit away"
Then niggas go to this lil' party
Whatever the case, niggas like, "Fuck it, we ain't got nothin' to do, we gon' go"
Mind you, niggas ain't had shit to do all day
Niggas be getting robbed and some more shit, it's— it's wild
Vince like, "Nah, I'm cool"
Niggas go shake, go home
Later on that night, the homies, they get booked
Two bodies. Crazy—allegedly, though. Free Ty Bud
Moral of this whole story: Nigga gotta think ahead, which a nigga always has
You gotta separate yourself from bullshit (My world filled blue)
Can't get wrapped up in it (My life is blue)
And once again, it's still "Free Pac Slimm" 'til they free Pac SlimmYou might also like1Embed
