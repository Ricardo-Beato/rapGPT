50 ContributorsGet In My Car Lyrics
Uh-huh
Yeah
Uh-huh
Yeah

I'm a straight gorilla with it, cold-hearted killer with it
Any nigga gettin' outta line can get it (Yeah)
I make it hot, motherfuckers freeze up when I come through
Mac-10, 32-shot clip in my snorkel (Uh-huh)
I might smile and say, "What's up?" but I don't fuck with you niggas
My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas (Woo)
I'm on the edge, I'm just waiting on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap—what you looking at, pussy?
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
So much chrome on my Benz, you see your face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'ma let her get in
I don't play, but I'm a playa 'til the motherfucking end

I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes (Hahaha)
And when I open that door, bitch get in my car
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes (Hahahaha)
And when I open that door, bitch get in my car
You might also like
Don't tell me you don't know that, ah—I'm the shit
Now, you better watch your girl, man, I leave with your bitch
I ain't stunting these hoes, man, I'm 'bout my paper
If your bitch really 'bout it, nigga, I'm gon' take her
Backseat of my Jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her makeup (Uh-huh)
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob (Woo)
Tell her if she like me, she should keep me icy
My game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey (Yeah)
Spent her life savings in a day, 'cause she likes me
Committment from me, uhh... nah, not likely
Went out with Vivica, I thought
I was onto something
But then the next week, nah
Man, it was nothing (Hahaha)

I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes
And when I open that door, bitch get in my car (Hahaha)
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes
And when I open that door, bitch get in my car (Hahaha)
Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie (Uh-huh)
They blood shot red, it's ganja in my system, I'm high
First it's pain when you lust for love; then, it's smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needle's in your arm (Uh-huh)
It's a cold world, baby girl, loving me is not enough
Find out when you fucking broke, love won't get you on the bus (Yeah)
Man, you should see the pretty bitches that be sexing me
They suck cock; to make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me (Woo)
Hundred percent thug, freak, too, I'll taste your love
69's the position, your mouth's full, baby, huh?
My conversation's so deep, I get in your head
Next thing you know, you yawning, turning over, and I'm in your bed

I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes (Hahaha)
And when I open that door, bitch get in my car
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes (Hahaha)
And when I open that door, bitch get in my car

Hahahaha
Quit playin', bitch get in
You know you wanna ride with a nigga
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit
