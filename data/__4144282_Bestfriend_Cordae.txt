10 ContributorsBestfriend Lyrics
Yeah, uh

I seen her walk into class, should I talk, should I pass
No, I gotta get her now, ain't no stalking her ass
The only way to go, and shit, the worst she could say is no
You looking like a movie actress, gotta play the role
Jennifer Aniston, I’m trembling, panicking
Nah nigga, I'll manage it, if you don't bag her, you’re damaging
Your own self-conscious, long hair Pocahontas
Go to her, be honest, your scared, shit, it's nonsense
And so I say, "Do I know you from somewhere
I love how your skin start to glow in the sun flares
Staring through my soul, goddamn it's unfair
Let's head to my crib, we can have fun there"
She say, "No nigga, what, you think I don't know nigga
Been around the block a couple times, youse a hoe nigga"
But fuck that I'm tryna grow witcha
And if I leave without your number, I'll be so bitter
But fuck the rumors and shit, always ruining shit
And be getting in the way, when I'm pursuing a chick
And I put it on my mama, I don’t be doing this shit
That’s ludicrous, I'm new to this, I don’t want to shoot it and miss

Cuz if I was your best friend, we could fly all the time
Yeah if I was your best friend, I would have to make you mine
If I was your best friend, it would just kill me inside
Girl, if I was your best friend, you wouldn't worry about the lies
Worry about the
You might also like
Uh, so a week later
Consistency paid a deep favor
Start to build the foundation, no cheap labor
Your ex nigga's a complete hater
I would fight but I see greater things
In the near future, Versace your outfit
Got me petrified, Medusa, your childish
So electrified, I'm buying you houses
Fast forward years, you picking out couches
Gotta take it slow, only weeks at a time
Just getting to know you girl, but feel I’m reading your mind
We just in sync or maybe it's human instincts
Your faking on a real nigga, shoulda been linked
And then she tell me 'bout her past and shit
And how her last would get mad, whip her ass and shit
I'm like damn, how the hell you go to class and sit
And pretend like it's ok, you ain't no average chick
She been through it before, was the same in her household
Dad punched her mom, and she had to keep her mouth closed
No wonder why your heart cold like the South Pole
But follow me, we can see where this all goes

Cuz if I was your best friend, we could fly all the time
Yeah if I was your best friend, I would have to make you mine
If I was your best friend, it would just kill me inside
Girl, if I was your best friend, you wouldn't worry about the lies
Worry about the
The psychological damage that done did to your brain
Plus you work and go to school, the stress getting insane
I can be your percocet, we gon' get rid of the pain
Stop bring up your ex because the nigga's a lame
Can't compare the situation cuz it isn't the same
Trying to take you out my mind, paint the picture, the frame
I'm Leonardo da Vinci, buy you Gucci and Fendi
The Prada, you saying nada, the other girls gonna envy
So don't worry bout that he say/she say shit
Cuz she's mad that he raps, he basic
So, be glad, your teeth's mad, she hates it
So please pass the weed back, we faded

Cuz if I was your best friend, we could fly all the time
Yeah if I was your best friend, I would have to make you mine
If I was your best friend, it would just kill me inside
Girl, if I was your best friend, you wouldn't worry about the lies
Wouldn't worry about the lies1Embed
