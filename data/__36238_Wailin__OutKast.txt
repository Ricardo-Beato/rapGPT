Wailin'
Wailin'

In the zone like Keyser Söze, always the Usual Suspect (Wailin')
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And Southern pride, I'd be, checkin' my fuckin' head (Wailin')
Scared, lookin' up in your face, boy, I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be (Wailin')
Enemies in the P's, freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I? (Wailin')
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eatin' chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo, flows on like Flo Jo (Wailin')
I wanted to figure out, just how low could your hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin' (Wailin')
Never bakin', rebukin' Satan, we had you waitin'
For the Second Coming, funny how time flies when you're rhymin' (Wailin')
LaFace Records, I think they got that perfect timing
To be doper than Saddam, believe the Nation of Islam (Wailin')
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffin' that dope up out your car
I think they overstep they boundaries (Wailin')
Huh, OJ, not guilty, that's how they found he

Mmm, yeah (Wailin')
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah (Wailin')
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah (Wailin')
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah (Wailin')
Mmm, mmm
You might also like
I felt the pressure like sun shining, while rainin' (Wailin')
At the same time, I kept on rhymin', not complaining
Storm brainin' cats and dogs, my catalog be the size of golf balls (Wailin')
Throw up your Daisy Dukes I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs
And Rosco P. Col' people, who caboose my locomotive (Wailin')
But enough of that, everyone can rap but let's say gift, suppose if
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I (Wailin')
Compose, won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop (Wailin')
But to each his own, my speech is born
Keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy, then I'm happy (Wailin')
Even if you just hate my fuckin' guts, go 'head and dap me
'Cause I'm gon' dap you anyway
And then go home and pray for your ass later (Wailin')
'Cause we might need you in this war, I'm wailin' on you traitors
