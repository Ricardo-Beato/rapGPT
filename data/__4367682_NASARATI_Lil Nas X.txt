I know you really like it (Yeah, yeah)
I see it, like I'm a psychic (What?)
My shit get lit, excited (Gang, gang)
I know, don't try to hide it (What? What? What? What?)
I know you really like it (You like it, don't ya?)
I see it, like I'm a psychic (A psychic, ain't it?)
My shit get lit, excited (What? What?)
I know, don't try to hide it (Let's go)

My shit slap, it get you off your feet, off your feet (Knock you off your feet)
NASARATI dropped, you got it on repeat, on repeat (Got it on repeat)
They post a shady tweet and then they hit delete, hit delete (They hit delete)
I'm who these goofy niggas really wanna be, wanna be (Who they wanna be)
See, you wanna be in front of me, these niggas, they confronting me (What? What? What?)
I'm running with the money and I'm shunning bums and wannabes (What? What? What?)
I'm flippin' dough and switchin' flows, I'm rippin' out reciprocals (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm whippin' in the kitchen with some niggas that's from Mexico
So I make a cake, sell it, buy an eighth, smell it (Huh, yeah)
Not just for this rhyme, I'm cuttin' down on the Henny (Skrrt)
You niggas ain't prevailin', tellin' all my felons (Yeah, what?)
Ashamed, but my chain ain't finna do no damn derailin' (Yeah, uh)
I'm the hottest motherfucker, on a roll like a trucker (Yeah, huh?)
Doin' shows on these suckers, I might go on and fuck your mother (What? What? What?)
Yeah, I might just fuck a cougar, I kill it, Freddy Krueger (Uh, yeah-yeah)
Go nowhere without my ruger! Him right there? Yeah, that's my shooter, uh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You might also like
I know you really like it (Yeah, yeah)
I see it, like I'm a psychic (What?)
My shit get lit, excited (Gang, gang)
I know, don't try to hide it (What? What? What? What?)
I know you really like it (You like it, don't ya?)
I see it, like I'm a psychic (A psychic, ain't it?)
My shit get lit, excited (What? What?)
I know, don't try to hide it (Let's go)2Embed
