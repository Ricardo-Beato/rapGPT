4 ContributorsOn Meeting with Donald Trump LyricsI wanted to meet with Trump today to discuss multicultural issues.
These issues included bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago.
I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change.
