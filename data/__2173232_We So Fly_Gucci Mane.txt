4 ContributorsWe So Fly Lyrics
Girl you so fucking fine
And I still want to make you mine
I still can’t get you out my mind
I think about you all the time
I recognize you on the grind
Well I still want to make you mine
I want to fuck you from behind
I want to kiss you one more time
We broke up, felt like I’m dying
I said I didn’t but I was lying
Baby remember how we shine
We never once stood in a line
We smoking kush and sipping wine
My bitch so motherfucking fly
Look, we smoking kush and sipping wine
I want to fuck you from behind
She used to be my ride or die
But fly little butterfly, fly, fly
My bitch so motherfucking fly

She used to be my ride or die
I want to look her in her eyes
And tell her fly fly fly
I know you living in the sky
But baby girl so do I
You balling hard and so do I
I think it’s time you recognize
You might also like
Hair by Versace, jump out the big body
Pomegranate Maserati, seats green, Wasabi
Tiger blood and emblems, rose gold from dentist
Massage by Liz Claiborne, collect call from Maury
Married life is boring, my house is four stories
Tell ghost stories to Coly, then on planes in France
Two months in advance, shower big enough for eight
Pour a seven in my grape Fanta, second glance, diamonds dancing
Diamonds dancing in New Hampshire

She used to be my ride or die
I want to look her in her eyes
And tell her fly fly fly
I know you living in the sky
But baby girl so do I
You balling hard and so do I
I think it’s time you recognizeEmbed
