Ah-yeah, boy

Big butt, no butt, bow legged, as long as she a
Freak, freak, freaky, freak, freak, freaky
So Icy, bossman, JL Valentine, I see you man
DJ Muthafuckin' Rail
Freak, freak, freaky, freak, freak, freaky

Shawty hella bad, with her yellow ass
She got hella ass, we got hella cash
Shawty got a tail on her, I'll tell you
I'ma spend some mail on her, I'll tell you
Big, fat, skinny, but I prefer a thick bitch
I'll take  if she want 
Real Zaytoven, Gucci, its a hit
She a very freaky girl, but I'm very, very rich
All these VVS's on my wrist
My diamond man said he gon' quit
Pretty like a diamond, my VVS chick
She heard it on the radio, said "Thats my shit!"
Trap-A-Holics

She got a sassy attitude and her tongue rack
Get it crackin' like Magic City on Monday
And she ain't afraid of a good three-way
As long as I can put it down, everything okay

And shawty like that
The way she work it on the floor, its giving heart attacks
Got all the niggas starin', how she throw it back
But once I got behind her, all you heard was "Smack, smack, smack, smack"

So fine, make a nigga wanna phone bomb

Little ghetto in the club, screamin' "That's my song!"

And shawty like that
The way she work it on the floor, its giving heart attacks
Got all the niggas starin', how she throw it back
But once I got behind her, all you heard was "Smack, smack, smack, smack"2Embed
