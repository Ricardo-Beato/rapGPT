Sowoot, FKi
Hi FKi

I'm gonna ball 'til I fall
I met that bitch at the mall
Said that she left me no choice
Said that she come from New York
Count that money, keep going
Count them hundreds, keep going
Count them hundreds, keep going
Count them hundreds, keep going
She say my voice make her moist (Ayy)
She say my voice make her moist (What?)
She say my voice make her moist (Ayy)
She say my voice make her moist (Ayy)
She say my voice make her moist (Ayy)
She say my voice make her moist (Ayy)
She said, "You left me no choice" (Ayy)
She said, "You left me no choice" (Ayy)

Money coming in every which way
Got ten bitches in every state
Count money when I meditate
Count money, make me levitate
White Rollie with the bezel face
Got better cars so I wanna race
So much money, I'mma break the safe
So much money, I'mma break the bank (Woo)
Like, fuck nigga, what do you really think? (Oh)
Don't wanna smoke it if it ain't no dank (Oh)
Don't wanna fuck her, the pussy ain't pink (Oh)
Sing to your bitch, ooh, I feel like I'm Drake (Feel like I'm Drake)
Ayy, ayy, I just be switching my flow
These niggas stealing my flow (Ayy)
These niggas stealing my clothes (Stealing my clothes)
These niggas stealing my look

Switching it up, I keep going (Yeah)
I'mma switch it and keep going (I'm gonna get it)
I'mma keep switching, keep going (Yeah)

Money coming in, getting richer, know she looking all at my pictures (Yeah)
No, I'm looking all at her pictures (I am), I'm getting money, I'mma get it
I don't know if I really like her or if it's I don't really like her nigga (That's what it is)
It don't even matter 'cause it's here, nigga fresh, really got a scissor
