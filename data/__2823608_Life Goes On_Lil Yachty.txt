Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on

I had a hard, hard life, ayy
It's been that way all my life, ayy
I had to earn my stripes, ayy
Had to pay my part, ayy
I know what you're goin' through, ayy
You just want someone to love you, ayy
Feel like there's no one on your team
Had to hit the block when I was 14, ayy
Ayy, since I was a young nigga, I knew what I wanted to be
Like Martin I had a dream, like Martin I had a dream
Watch out for 12, might have to move the trap, heard it's a sting
How could I fold? It's nothin' but solid niggas on my team
Had to weed out the rats, so I can roll up a bag
These broke niggas leeches, just wanna run up a tab
But so long, I'm so gone
Life goes on, life goes on
You might also like
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do

I remember bein' broke
Couple dollars in my pocket, I could barely cop a soda
I didn't know what to do
A college kid lost just like everybody else
Up late tryna figure out myself
Mama had no job so I got a 9 to 5
Just when I thought we lost it all
She said, "Boy be strong, God gon' keep us in our home"
Blessings come true, I swear they do
You might be down at the moment
But stay there and you'll be up soon
I know you're tired of the bus
Stack up and pull off like vroom
Stay consistent and watch how your money moves
And watch how your old friends hate on you
But fuck 'em because
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on11Embed
