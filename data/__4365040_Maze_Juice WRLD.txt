Stuck in a maze
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stuck in a maze, mmh

Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay, but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going anywhere
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mom, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows that I've been through
Story to be continued

I sip ill, pop pills, crack seals
Doing anything to numb the way that I feel, yeah
I chase thrills, you still crashin' Hot Wheels
Ride a dirt bike down the ditch, see if I live
I knock my subconscious unconscious
They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this, I took my demons into the bank of life and I made the biggest deposit
Without drugs, I'm losing my logic
These pills and my Pro Tools still got logic
I run, I run, I run
I run, I run, I run

Everything's okay, but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going anywhere
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mom, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows that I've been through
