8 ContributorsTime to Move Lyrics
Ha, Gucci trapped this thang
DY, Sizzle, Guwop

Is it really true?
Are you really you?
Are your diamonds huge?
You know they different hues
I'm so sick of you (Are you sick of me?)
New color Gucci blue, they match my Gucci shoes
Come get a load from me, I took a load from you
I'm sellin' chickens to niggas I sold verses to
Come get a P from me, I took a key from you
Shout out my lawyer Drew, shout out to Janice too
Please get away from me, don't want no verse from you
I see right through this dude, I got no love for you
Please stay away from me, I got no love for you
New Lamb' is glacier blue, it match your Birkin too

McLaren glacier blue, it got 'em hurlin' too
I bought a Wraith for boo, now I want something new
It ain't nun else to do, so I keep buying coupes
It ain't no where to park, I think it's time to move
You might also like
LaFlare in the LaF-F-Ferrari, I'm swervin'
You gunnin' 'cause I so much money, I'm splurgin'
Woke up in a new Bugatti, dropped in the punani
Call me Gucci Mane Delantic, bitch or you can call me Money
Red dawn, I'ma bring it out 'cause the sun out
Woah now, put it in it shawty 'cause you're goin' out
Jumpman, jumpin' from the free throw with my tongue out
I feel like Southside, full of cash, know my niggas ballin'
I'm from the eastside, homicide, tons of marijuana
She a parasite, suck it dry, fucked her on the corner
I took the stand, lie, said I was performin' Arizona
You know my brain fried, please, show some mercy oh your Honor
He tryna hot side, I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm a loner
I heard your man died, I wouldn't give a fuck, that boy a goner
They say it's high tide, fucked her on a beach, I got a boner
All my whips mine, house mine, Gucci Mane a owner (It's Gucci)

McLaren glacier blue, it got 'em hurlin' too
I bought a Wraith for boo, now I want something new
It ain't nun else to do, so I keep buying coupes
It ain't no where to park, I think it's time to move

I think it's time to move
I think it's time to move
I think it's time to move
I think it's time to move
I think it's time to moveEmbed
