I love you, I love y-o-o-ou
I love you, I love y-o-o-ou

No need to front, no need to flex
No need to hide it, every time I see you I get so excited
I would give it all to yo-o-ou
Just tell me we're never gon' be thro-ou-ough
Whoa-damn, I see soo much of me and you
Top floor, we lookin' at the city view
What we seem to do, always make the front news
But only three words I gotta say to you and that is-

I love you, I love y-o-o-ou
I love you, I love y-o-o-ou

I do, I really love you
So many things I'd do for you
Yeah, we fight, but you my boo
I know sometimes, I know sometimes
You think that I ain't doin' right
But trust me, I keep you in mind
Trust me, I keep you in mi-i-i-i-ind
You might also like
I love you, I love y-o-o-ou5Embed
