3 ContributorsBonita Applebum (12" Why? Edit) Lyrics
Do I love you?
Do I lust for you?
Am I a sinner because I do the two?
Can you let me know
Right now, please
Bonita Applebum

Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita

Hey Bonita, glad to meet ya
For the cunning, stunning you, miss, I must beseech ya
Hey, being with you is a top priority
Ain't no need to question the authority
Chairman of the board, the chief of affections
You got mine's to swing in your direction
Hey, you're like a hip hop song, you know?
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
You might also like
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita

38-24-37 (mmm, mmm, mmm!)
You and me, hun, we're a match made in heaven
I like to kiss ya where some brothers won't
Listen upâ€¦I like to tell ya things some brothers don't
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics
And if you need 'em, I got crazy prophylactics
So far, I hope you like rap songs
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
