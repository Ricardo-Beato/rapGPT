Gotta talk about gettin' this money, man
Got a lil' play real quick
If I was you, I'd call back ASAP, nigga
Cardo
Shoot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo
Cardo got wings

Don't you touch my register, don't you touch my bitch
Don't you touch my register, don't you touch my bitch
Don't you touch my register, don't you touch my bitch (Ayy)
Don't you touch my register, don't you touch my bitch
Don't you touch my register, don't you touch my bitch
Don't you touch my register, don't you touch my bitch
Don't you touch my register, don't you touch my bitch (Ayy)
Don't you touch my register, don't you touch my bitch

Uh, she gave me head like once, I'm tryna get it like twice (Woah)
Baby, come earn your stripes, I'm a thief in the night
Flexin' for the 'Gram like Mike, mhm, I just upped my price, uh
Pussy wet like ice, woah, pussy wet like ice
Back it up, baby, that's all I know (Yeah!), trap phone boomin', that's all I know (Woah!)
I want her friend, all I know (Yeah!), type my ventin, all I know (Woah!)
Your bitch fiendin', all I know, money go zoom, that's all I know
Take it and see how far I go, take it and see how far I go
