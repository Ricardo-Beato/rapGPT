11 ContributorsNever Runnin Out Of Money Lyrics
(30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)
I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Playing poker in the Poconos and raised it one-twenty
Hell, I don't give a damn, I ain't

Playing poker in the Poconos, he raised it one-twenty
Hell, I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Playing Texas hold 'em, nigga, that's just honey bun money
Hell, I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Nigga shank you for a hundred, keep on laughing, think it's funny
I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Like a bee come for that honey, that's that honey bun money
I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money

It look like Lenox in my closet
Change that topic, don't let me pop it (What?)
Tuckеd my chain and stopped the flossing
Not no option, how I'm rocking (Word)
All this ice on likе it's hockey (Burr)
Call me papi, bitch, suck me sloppy (Papi)
Feed me, fuck me, take me shopping (Ha)
Head so good, had to tell her, "Stop it" (Stop it)
Upgraded my class, now they can't copy
All this cash and it got me cocky (Racks)
Get all these M's, feel like I'm boxing (Boxing)
'Cause I'm running to the racks like Rocky (Go)
Cut the roof off, made 'em chop it (Cut)
We in the booth, I made her pop it (Good)
She the truth, can't even knock it
Made her slurp it up like sake (Sake)

Playing poker in the Poconos, he raised it one-twenty
Hell, I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Playing Texas hold 'em, nigga, that's just honey bun money
Hell, I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Nigga shank you for a hundred, keep on laughing, think it's funny
I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Like a bee come for that honey, that's that honey bun money (Uh)
I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money

Man, these niggas out here barking (Barking)
They ain't balling like Harden (Harden)
They ain't shooting like Steph (Steph)
Get on the stand and confess ('Fess)
Pour water on your chest (Chest)
Emerald custom baguettes (Baguettes)
Hypothermia wrist
Presidential Rolex (Rolex)
Runnin' out of money, never runnin' out of money (Money)
When you havin' money, can't be stuntin' hella clumsy (Clumsy)
Out here in the Bay, it's hella cold when it's sunny (Sunny)
Out here where we living, it's a jungle like Jumanji
It's the penitentiary or the youth authority
When you're out of town, you better move accordingly
I don't get mad when a nigga got more than me
Legend in the game and I got seniority (Bitch)
Playing poker in the Poconos, he raised it one-twenty
Hell, I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Playing Texas hold 'em, nigga, that's just honey bun money
Hell, I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Nigga shank you for a hundred, keep on laughing, think it's funny
I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money
Like a bee come for that honey, that's that honey bun money
I don't give a damn, I ain't runnin' out of money2Embed
