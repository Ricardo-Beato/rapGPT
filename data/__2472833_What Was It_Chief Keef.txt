14 ContributorsWhat Was It Lyrics
Zaytoven
Bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang bang

I come through, lights and cameras, watch got me tripping
She like, "Buy me something," no, I ain't your nigga
It tastes so good, this here what I'm sipping
What I am is what I am, naw, I ain't flipping
Got shooters in the trenches, bad bitch do the dishes
Maid do my laundry, come in here, you'll be missing
I got all these hundreds, that is how I does it
She like, "You know my name?" Naw bitch, what was it?

No tears in the bucket but it's fuck it
Think I'm from the Rucker how I'm causing ruckus
Three point shit, bitch, I'm shooting buckets
My car caught her at the light and he told her suck it
Bitches see me, they be tweaking, say they love me
Why was it? 'Cause my pants so puffy
Four thousand for this Gucci and it's fluffy
I come through clownin' like I'm Krusty
Bang, call me Sosa Balboa
I got a bad temper like Florida
She think 'cause she got a peach like Georgia
She want me to wife her, but I gotta get my lawyer
You might also like
I come through, lights and cameras, watch got me tripping
She like, "Buy me something," no, I ain't your nigga
It tastes so good, this here what I'm sipping
What I am is what I am, naw, I ain't flipping
Got shooters in the trenches, bad bitch do the dishes
Maid do my laundry, come in here, you'll be missing
I got all these hundreds, that is how I does it
She like, "You know my name?" Naw bitch, what was it?

I'm Glo'd up, put the cameras on me
Don't try, I got the hammer on me
I'ma scoop your bitch in a minute
She don't think I'm in the Lambo
But I'll see her in a minute
Gotta get me a dental
Pull on her, make her crippled
It can all be so simple
I want you to go down
You can do the cha-cha, limbo
My car be slicing, Kimbo
Margielas, fuck your Timbos
I come through I'm capping
Remember when I was little
Wind up shittin' on your Rollie, I don't want bologna
I want me some steak, I want me some money
I want me some fifties, I got me some hundreds
Just to keep it one hundred, this clip hold a hundred
What's up under my hood, you don't wanna see it, nigga
I take money, you don't wanna be it
Man, I come from the hood, now I'm rich preaching
It ain't 'bout the money, then I can't see it
I come through, lights and cameras, watch got me tripping
She like, "Buy me something," no, I ain't your nigga
It tastes so good, this here what I'm sipping
What I am is what I am, naw, I ain't flipping
Got shooters in the trenches, bad bitch do the dishes
Maid do my laundry, come in here, you'll be missing
I got all these hundreds, that is how I does it
She like, "You know my name?" Naw bitch, what was it?

Bang (Bang)
