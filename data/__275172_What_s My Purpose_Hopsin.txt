59 ContributorsWhatâ€™s My Purpose Lyrics
Planet Earth
The place that I live... we live
Who owns it?
You?
Nah, nobody owns this shit
Just a big ass piece of rock with humans on it
Do what the fuck I wanna do

A lost human born into a dark society
With one mind state, there's no variety
Movin' vibrantly, tryin' to be the best that I can be
I've tried to see the light in livin' life but it just blinded me... irony
Now I'm thinkin' violently, because I feel my country went and lied to me
It's bringin' out a whole new fuckin' side to me
Ride with me, if you feel my pain then you can cry with me
This fuckin' shady system is the rivalry
They the ones who raised us, turned us into cage nuts
They're what we're afraid of, they are why we ain't us
They the reason we constantly livin' for money and we just can't budge
It's takin' a toll on your dreams, so you gave up
And now the pain stuck, they ain't showin' nothin' but fake love
We just numbers put on a pay stub
Our purpose shouldn't be to make bucks
We all slaves and if we never make a change then we straight fucked

I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human
(I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)
The problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign
Maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'

Who set the standard for everybody to live by?
How far along in life would you be if you did try?
Who tryna help these ghetto neighborhoods where kids die?
This world has turned into a mother fuckin' pigsty
I look outside and it disgusts me, it bugs me
It's ugly, I trust no other fuckin' human but me
So what needs, to be done? Every day is a rerun
Technology's advanced, as people how far have we come?
Yeah, I can see that time's grown, but still I'm mind blown
'Cause everybody's mind is stuck inside they iPhone
They always textin' and postin' statuses hourly
But in reality, there's no sign of a personality
It's cowardly, we shielded like we scared to get some allergies
The human being is what we don't know how to be
And honestly these issues really suck to know
But I refuse to sit and let the trouble grow, so God, show me where the fuck to go
I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human
(I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)
The problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign
Maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'

How can a man with power feel there's no responsibility?
These rappers blowin' up, but through my eyes they not as real to me
They constantly conceal the beast, but never try to heal the streets
Teachin' girls to be a slut, but never make 'em feel unique
How can we feel fine this way? Open up your minds today
The matrix got you young, owin' a debt you'll spend your life to pay
Stressed out, assumin' that you'll be more happy inside your grave
Don't tell me about no fuckin' struggle then, nigga, 'cause I know pain
To the point where I felt like life was shit
Growin' up as a kid with both parents who got no funds to ever provide you with
Shit is just stuck repeatin', the world is tough to be in
Munchin' on fast food, don't even know what the fuck I'm eatin'
America, I gave it my all
Still you guys arrested me for bein' black and standin' on a sidewalk
It doesn't matter if I'm breakin' laws or bein' harmless
I'm automatically hated by cops 'cause my dark skin
God was my smartest option
My soul is mine, y'all ain't gon' bargain off it
'Cause if you do that means the darkness profits
The sky is where I got my heart adopted
Man, if we all just took the time to think I swear it won't be hard to stop this
But y'all assume that I'm just startin' nonsense
But I promise y'all the fuckin' world is gon' remember Marcus Hopson
There's consequences for enlightenment
But if I have to hide the truth to live then I'mma die just like my idols did
I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human
(I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)
The problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign
Maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'16Embed
