47 ContributorsTISK TISK / COOKIES Lyrics

Shit
Fuck, nigga
Promise I'll never forget
And I promise I knew what it is
When I knew you, you wasn't a snitch, snitch
Tisk-tisk, nigga, snitch
Shit
Fuck, nigga
Promise I'll never forget
And I promise I knew what it is
When I knew you, you wasn't a snitch
Tisk-tisk, nigga


Run for your life
I took the cookies, put 'em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time

I need cash money, baby, we live
I remember they ain't save me a slot
Back up when niggas hit the jackpot
I got sense, I'm tryna get me some guap
I need the tint
Just like my daddy skin, dark
I see your nigga, too bad he a mark
I see real niggas just jab, they don't bark
I see you tryna rekindle the spark
Reelin' from loss, yeah
Inner remorse, divorce your spirit and corpse, corpse
I tell you I'm hearing it all
The wisdom that's in your remarks
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in 'em, the memories got strong
But some of 'em lost
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in 'em, the memories got strong
But some of 'em long gone
You might also like
Run for your life
I took the cookies, put 'em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time
Run for your, run for your life
I took the cookies, put 'em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time3Embed
