If you celebratin' tonight

Cheers to the good life
And I can tell that tonight's gonna be a good night
All my family is here
And we been gettin' it on this whole year, oh yeah
It's grad night, feel too good to have a bad night
Snoop Dogg came through to make sure
Everybody set, let's go
Mama in the house, what it do though?
It occurs to me that today's your happy anniversary
Bacardi over there, party over here, party over there
As we party everywhere
Hell yeah put yo' hands up, fill the stands up
This is the extravaganza
In it to win it
We start what we finish
The sky is not the limit
You might also like
Light the sky up tonight
Light the sky up tonight
Light the sky up tonight
Put your lighters real high
We gon' celebrate life tonight
It's the Fourth of July tonight
Fireworks up tonight
We gon' light the whole sky tonight
We gon' light ya whole life tonight
Light the whole sky tonight
We gon' light the whole sky tonight
Light the whole sky tonight
Celebrate tonight

Snoop Dogg's in the house
We gon' set this thang off tonight

And now the scene is set
This 'ill be sumin' that you never forget
We got it poppin' like champagne
Give me my damn ring
We want it all, we the champs
Did the damn thang
We are champions
So we gon' light up the night tonight
Man this sure feels great
So I'm livin' my life tonight
Fireworks in the air, work dat, murk dat, hurt dat there
Put that blue light way in the sky
Wave both hands from side to side
Can ya catch a vibe?
What a view
Walkin' on the moon makin' prints wit' my tennis shoe
Went in any mall
Eenie meenie mini mall
Anotha twenty-fo'
That's the only way to go
Nah nah nah nah,nah nah nah nah, hey hey hey snoop dogg nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah hey hey hey snoop dogg nah nah nah nah, hey hey hey snoop dogg1Embed
