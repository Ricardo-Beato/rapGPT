4 ContributorsCrop Circles LyricsYou gotta do whatever it takes to
Try not to repeat the same mistakes
How many times can you beat those eggs
Before you teach yourself not to feed the snakes
Everybody trying to sneak a taste
I wanna believe in some kind of escape
But this that not from concentrate
From underneath the grounds where they rob the graves
Go ahead and try to bite your plate
But keep your fork inside of your faceYou might also likeEmbed
