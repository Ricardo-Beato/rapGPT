We getting cash now, I keep a bad bitch
I'm balling all day, it's a habbit
I'm on a paper chase, I gotta make it stack
They call me rain man, cause bitch, I keep the racks
I keep the racks
Bitch, I keep the racks
I'm balling all day, I gotta make it stack
I keep the racks
Bitch, I keep the racks
I'm balling all day, I gotta make it stack

Fuck your team, it's G.I.B
And we got bands, as you can see
My nigga GC on the beat

We come through, we 30 deep
See us, better get your cleets
A hundred rounds a clip 
 with TIB
 we going strong
Tell  to get they bands up, cause bitch, I'm money long
And we blowing on that strong
AKA that loud pack
If you run up on me, then that boy gon hear that loud clap
And I ain't talking 'bout the stadiam
We ball like a gymnasiam
Hustle hard just like  and them
Can't bе stopped, like Mase and thеm
Big deals, I'm chasing them
Old hoes, I'm replacing them
Money bags, I'm taking them
Big rats, we snaking them
Big cakes, we baking them
Bitch niggas they 
Money bags, I'm taking them
Big rats, we snaking them
Big cakes, we baking them
Bitch niggas they

You fly her out

Hoes on my dick, I'm moonwalking like Michael
