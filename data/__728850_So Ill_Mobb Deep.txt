4 ContributorsSo Ill Lyrics
Yo, Hav, come here
Tell 50 to come here, listen to this shit
Aight, aight
Yeah... yeah
A lil story...
About a bum ass nigga
That became the world's richest bum ass nigga
Hahahaha, woo!
Word up
Fuck all you niggas
Ayo

Man, I been fucked up for so long and now I'm rich
All the other broke niggas that I used to fuck with
Got that look in their eyes, got that scheme on their face
When I pop up around the way, like shit changed
Look here, don't make me put your brains on display
You niggas never really gave a fuck about P
Now it's all about me and why I don't break bread
Where do he sleep and how can we break in
Is he in his Jeep or maybe it's the Porsche
Naw, let's catch him in the V and tear the nigga all up
No, I don't think so
I'm all in my mirrors and out my windows
I get up out the car with the Desert Eagle
Shorty don't like me, said I got an ego
So she tell niggas they should stick me
Gassing niggas up to make history
So, they take the jux so they can make the books
But I bang the heat when they came for me
You might also like
Niggas think they so ill
'Til you make a little blood spill
Now you punk-ass niggas know
Fucks with me, it's a must you bleed
Niggas think they so ill
'Til you make a little blood spill
Now you punk-ass niggas know
Fucks with me, it's a must you bleed

Catch me New York cruising, sticking and moving
Smoking that sour diesel on point every time that I blew it
Now scheming on me is foolish, don't think about it, just do it
I put you through it like that hurricane that ran through Houston
You ain't shooting, you ain't scaring nothing, y'all just flukes
Rob a nigga, strip his ass down to the birthday suit
I never pick grapes, but I cut me a bunch
I'm that nigga in the club watching your ass get duffed
Niggas want to hang up once they find they got war with us
And they baby mama slutting out there on tour with us
Pass it to the homie once a nigga get bored with her
Almost couldn't nut because your ass keep calling
And dude fronting, come on, baby, you ain't got them guns
All you got is that rusty ass revolver, son
And you can't fool me, I know they borrowed, nigga
Niggas think that they ill but the Mobb is iller
Niggas think they so ill
'Til you make a little blood spill
Now you punk-ass niggas know
Fucks with me, it's a must you bleed
Niggas think they so ill
'Til you make a little blood spill
Now you punk-ass niggas know
Fucks with me, it's a must you bleedEmbed
