Niggas gon' get it ASAP poppin', nigga
Rocky, nigga, ayy
Bang, bang, bang

Nigga, where my money? Need it A$AP Rocky, ayy
And we got them pistols, get it ASAP poppin', ayy
Nigga want beef, then it's A$AP Rocky, ayy
Pull up on 'em, shh, get to ASAP sparkin' (Ayy)
Nigga, we can do this ASAP doggy
Pull up on your ass with this ASAP doggy, ayy
I remember selling A$AP Rocky, ayy
Now I be getting ASAP guapy, ayy

Shawty wanna top me (Huh?), A$AP Rocky (Ayy)
And she from Hawaii, we just started talkin'
But I don't give a fuck (Nah), back to the money
Walked up in the bank, walk out laughin', it's funny
I remember sell to junkies, now I'm gettin' Rocky
A$AP Rocky, pull up on 'em, get it poppin'
This bitch pull up on me, treat my dick like Kawasaki
'Cause I be counting guapy and ballin' is my hobby
Runnin' round the lobby, ASAP Rocky
Pullin' all the thotties, the thotties with the bodies
Genius, got gold teeth, white diamonds, A$AP Rocky
I be gettin' money, remember running from the squally

Nigga wanna send shots, niggas SWAT me, nigga
Got my gun, got bullets for everybody

We can do this A$AP Ferg (A$AP Ferg)
Nigga I got ASAP birds (I got ASAP brr)
I ain't talkin' bricks, I'm talking Lugers
If you want it, I pull up, do you the worst (Pull up and do you)
What you want? I got it, pull up on the curb (Pull up on the, ayy)
Street slanging, straight birds, so absurd (So, ayy)
You missed yourself, and if you pussy you'll get stirred (Pussy, you'll get, ayy)
Pistols bangin', we don't talk, we gon' skrrt (Bang, bang)
