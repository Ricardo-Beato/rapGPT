Na-na, hmm
Na-na, hmm

I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void)
Fall in the void (The void)
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void)
Fall in the void (The void)

Hey, oh, need to free my mind, ah, yeah
This a little ritual of mine as I head home
Head up high, get some
Hello, sailin' by, nah-nah
Say, oh, been dead and alive, don't know
Let go, they say I'll survive
If you say so, please don't lie
My days are low, I'll give it a try, hey
See new things in my soul
When I'm just sittin' in my room all alone
This is the real, it's how I roll
Tell my friends and folks that I'm on a ridе, don't know when I'm comin' home
Things might change, but I'm cool with it
Flyin' highеr than I've ever been, I see the world just as it is
Please hear me, no, no, no, I cannot wait (No, no)
As we climb, I'm soarin'
You might also like
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid (Woah)
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void, mmm, yeah)
Fall in the void (The void, fall in the void)
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid (Woah)
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void, mmm)
Fall in the void (The void, bring me, ooh)

Oh

See ya, never have I flown so high
Feel a feeling takin' over, goodbye (Ooh)
Be just what you need to be, let's go (Ooh)
Everything is all on me, don't count me out (Yo)
These nights, they save him from my hellhole
When it's dark and my heartbeat echoes
Yeah, that's just what I love, ooh
Heaven ain't too far now
Show me what I don't know (What I don't know)
Imagine these things so simple, break the code
'Round and 'round, my mind is throwed
Prayin' I overdose on this love, it got me flyin', I'm headed home (Hey)
And I'm thinkin' I be dreamin', lights are gleamin'
God watchin', haters plottin', but I can't be focused on that
Here it goes, this the part, I cannot wait
Don't ask why
I'm soarin'
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void)
Fall in the void (The void, fall in the void)
I will fall in the void, fall in the void just to avoid (Woah)
Anything that can bring me down or fuck with my flow
Fall in the void (The void, mmm-mmm, no, no)
Fall in the void (The void, come, baby, oh)

Oh, no, no

Oh, God, oh, God, thank You
You've been in my dreams, you've been in my dreams
Oh, I'm just trying to be the best man I can be, mmm-mmm
Thank you for listening
Thank you for never leaving me
It's gon' be okay
It's gon' be okay
I promise you
I promise you30Embed
