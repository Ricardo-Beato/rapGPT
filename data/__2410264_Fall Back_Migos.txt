24 ContributorsFall Back Lyrics
He a rich nigga boss up
She a bad bitch boss up
Broke bitch fall back

Bad bitches boss up (boss up ay)
Broke bitches fall back (fall back ay)
Rich nigga boss up (boss up ay)
Broke nigga fall back (fall back ay)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)

I got 200 G's
And I got 200 keys
And you know I keep myself protected with the M16
And I'm serving fiends, at ease the police
I do not freeze, I'm from the nawfside I use my two feet
I'm getting rich with my dogs, please do not get involved
All it take is one call, they'll come knock you off
If you're talking 'bout that money baby we gets it all
Touchdown with that dirty bird like I'm Jamal
Plug count the babies when I saw him said awh
Bitch call my phone, I had decline the call
Make like a season, bitch you need to fall
Niggas ain't shit, you need to change your drawers
Broke niggas got a reason to complain baby
I came from nothing rich to spinning like a Tasmanian
You walk around pockets smaller than a Pomeranian
I got owls in my house but I'm not Canadian
You might also like
Bad bitches boss up (boss up ay)
Broke bitches fall back (fall back ay)
Rich nigga boss up (boss up ay)
Broke nigga fall back (fall back ay)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)

I ain't here for the foolishness
Slanging balls like I'm Ludacris
Your jewelry foolery
Your diamonds they ain't fooling me
I'm a boss from the nawf
Don't chase these bitches cause they flawed
I'm in Mansion with two strippers told them call when they off
Hit that bitch with that stick now he eat his food out a straw
Sippin' Actavis, I'm drinking syrup I don't got a cough
Fuck the media, they slandering my name in the blogs
Wikipedia, they got the Migo flow in they thought
These bitches fucking for nothing
These niggas flexing with nothing
That nigga was talkin', we bust him
Fucking that bitch and her cousin
I'm a rich nigga bitch I get more money than your husband
She a rich bitch, nigga you tryna spoil her she ain't want it
Woke up in the morning with two bitches made a porn
I didn't do this shit all by myself, I had a army
She a boss bitch, she pulling up in a Ferrari
Give me back my dab it don't belong to you, I'm sorry
Bad bitches boss up (boss up ay)
Broke bitches fall back (fall back ay)
Rich nigga boss up (boss up ay)
Broke nigga fall back (fall back ay)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)
No I ain't here for that (what you tell em' say)

I'm breaking that wall like a lumberjack
If police bust in my bando I'm flushing that
Rest in peace Pistol my nigga not coming back
Smoking on dry cause it come from a laundrymat
I got your bitch sucking me up, no Similac
Chopper nail a nigga like he a thumbin' tack
Call up Rel Money if you want a Migos show
Front end and back end, you sending that
If I take a loss I'ma get it back
They stealing the flow and I'm sick of that
Show me that pink slip cause you rented that
Ain't going back and forth cause I ain't here for that
Yung Rich Nation jeans, my thirty up under that
I've been balling but no Tennessee, plenty racks
They separated from the white and black mansion
No angry white people, we living that
All my bad bitches boss up
Broke bitches need to fall back
Nat nat alley cats
Back of the building fucking on my hoodrats
I'm dabbin' and watchin' like Cinemaxx
Dab on your bitch and I give her a heart attack
You still call it swag, don't call it that
And these niggas know we was the one started that
First I grab the mic, blow a stack, then I fall back
Racks and stacks taller than Shaq, but how good is your pack?
You need to get up and get off your ass and get you a sack
Ain't talking bout money, ain't tryna hear that then fall back
Bad bitches boss up (boss up ay)
Broke bitches fall back (fall back ay)
Rich nigga boss up (boss up ay)
Broke nigga fall back (fall back ay)
Longway hit for that (what you tell em' say)
Longway hit for that (what you tell em' say)
Longway hit for that (what you tell em' say)
Longway hit for that (what you tell em' say)5Embed
