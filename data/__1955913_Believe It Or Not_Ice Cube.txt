7 ContributorsBelieve It Or Not Lyrics
I'm the truth
Turn the mic up
West Coast, motherfucker
Ice Cube, motherfucker
Lench Mob, motherfucker

Is he real? Is he fake? Motherfucker, try me
Cube still grimy, Dub-C is my crimey
Got you all fooled, actin' all polished
Never been to college, far from Mr. Rogers
Loved by the kids, hated by the daddies
Loved by the mamas, addicted to the commas
Up at the bank, got the tellers in a sweat
Countin' hundred stacks (Are we done yet?)
Fuck no! The question: Will Cube still go
Back to the hood where the grass never grow? (What?!)
Are you serious? Nigga, I'm the man, bitch (Ha ha)
On Van Wyck, making me a sandwich
At my daddy house, bet' not fuck wit' me (No)
Or they'll find your ass, knife still stuck in him
Ice Cube, believe it or not
I'm not a movie, stop believin' the plot, or get your ass shot

West Coast, motherfucker
Ice Cube, motherfucker
Lench Mob, motherfucker
A nigga still hella hood (Believe it or not)
I'll never go Hollywood (Believe it or not)
I love hip-hop (Believe it or not)
I'll bust on SWAT (Believe it or not)
You might also like
Niggas tried to battle, niggas tried extortion
But tryin' to get it's like givin' an abortion
You gotta take it, 'cause I'll never give it
And fuck a critic who said I never lived it (Westside!)
I've been to places that your ass'll never visit
This the exquisite West Coast Grand Wizard
Ice Cube is a lyrical genius
A-list to G-list, it's so seamless
Nigga please, thought I forgot how to squeeze
Just sneeze, put your ass on freeze
Act like I don't know what the hood like
Act like I don't know what the hood like
Good night, I got to be the greatest
D-Boys, you lookin' at an A-plus
Can I still be the nigga that you love to hate?
Ask Oprah, and let me know what she told ya

West Coast, motherfucker
Ice Cube, motherfucker
Lench Mob, motherfucker
A nigga still hella hood (Believe it or not)
I'll never go Hollywood (Believe it or not)
I love hip-hop (Believe it or not)
I'll bust on SWAT (Believe it or not)
Let's go
A nigga still hella hood (Believe it or not)
I'll never go Hollywood (Believe it or not)
I love hip-hop (Believe it or not)
I'll bust on SWAT (Believe it or not)
A nigga still hella hood (Believe it or not)
I'll never go Hollywood (Believe it or not)
I love hip-hop (Believe it or not)
I'll bust on SWAT (Believe it or not)
West Coast, motherfucker
Ice Cube, motherfucker
Lench Mob, motherfucker1Embed
