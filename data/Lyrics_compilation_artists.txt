in the concrete
Proving nature's laws wrong it learned 2 walk
without having feet
Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams
it learned 2 breathe fresh air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
when no one else even cared!42Embed
You can be touched
You can be touched
You can be touched

Oh God, forgive me, mother, please say a prayer for me
Needed a father, but he was never there for me
Believin' everything they feed me, I'm seein' demons
I wake up screamin', who'd believe me or was I dreamin'?
Five fingers on the 45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, want to see what's after this
I'm livin' blind writin' rhymes 'til they capture this
If I die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes, hate to see a black man cry
They picture me inside a casket that's how they see us
Oh God, forgive us ghetto bastards, we human beings
Seein' us inside this hell-hole
Just waitin' to fail, so they tell us that's what jail is for
Adolescent young dream's turned violent
Explodin' in a world turned silent
'Cause you could be touched

My young niggas in the wild life
(You can be touched)
Criminal mind of a juvenile still livin' a child life
(You can be touched)
Thinkin' he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
(You can be touched)

Imagine us up in this game, you's a veteran
Bouncin' up in yo' plush spot watchin' David Letterman
Chillin', clearly made it and it's clearly stated
By that thirty yard pool, the five cars, the women and the jewels
Richness, oozing out your balls
But only you and God knows the evil you did to get yours
Crossed ever nigga that ever trusted you
Just a scared nigga, afraid one day they might bust at you
Look at you done came so far but did to much
And got to a point in the game where ya ass is stuck
Touched you because the Don gave the word too
He was going unprepared and got laced on and got murdered

Now I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggas that ever breathed
Initiated as an Outlaw back in '94
Snuck in the jaw and ever since I wanted more
Older niggas givin' me the game, nobody has touch me
On everybody's game, I put my cards on the table
And look through them carefully patiently
While everybody's racin', stay aware 'cause everyday there's another nigga dead
And this should tell you somethin'
Knowin' everybody dies (Yeah), sometimes it's just for nothin'
I know that I could be got but should they shoot me, I'm shot
Touched me, trust me, my nuts mean a lot
You can be touched

How you gonna live a life you can't see it in front of you?
I know and still know shorty hard, I'm one of you
Thinkin' that it just can't happen this quick
'Cause you run in the town and put that shit on a brick
Now don't nobody know you but the cops and robbers
Leavin' school with problems, tryna blame it on our father
But his place that you livin' in shit
Straight knowin' that's the place you gonna die
Probably why you ain't givin' a shit
While addicted, livin' my life lost and wicked
Nigga forget it
'Cause all that clownin' won't prevent this gat from blowin'
Me and my Outlawz we roam
Should have thought before you crossed now my big homies knowin'
And that's the wrongest of wrong, with the strength of the strong
Fuck around with Napo' should have moved out ya' home
'Cause nigga I'm knowin' who you fuckin' where you goin'
And the way you make your money, now your weakness is showin'
Brother drowned in this world give a damn who she loved
That her father won't be here long enough to see how ya' grown
He got touched

God made the world in seven days
How in the hell can niggas be so amazin'
Situations that muthafuckas have to face
For instance, the government admitted it. (MLK)

In today's music news: the ever-controversial Tupac Shakur has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli." Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:

It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches
Power and money, ridaz and punks
Which side are you on?
*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*
*Encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?
You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches
A'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (All day) (Up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!

Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes ‘cause they breed freely
See me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty, huh, in every city
You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, nah'mean?
I hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs, down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ’em
Cut ’em down, to Hell is where we send ’em
My whole team trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gon' cry
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
Bye, bye, bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gon' cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, JAY-Z die too
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay!
West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free – bomb first

But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first

For so many days, in so many ways we've been duckin' strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin' to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch, yo I'm dyin' with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a ma'fuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfuckin' cash, mane
Then what is your motherfuckin' purpose? None can serve us
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first, bitch (Biatch!)
Come on, bring it, down with it!
(We ride)
Come on, bring it
(Bomb first when we ride)
Hey, get that nigga!

Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin' patent leather
Causin' massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin, you're tellin' fairy tales, dunn
"King of New York" like you the motherfuckin' one?
But I'm from Jers', we don't play that shit
From the Clair down to Newark Bricks all my niggas flippin’ chips
Gettin’ rich, even though it's hard
Tryna creep through these halls and brawls without scarred by a revolve'
With no warning signs, ‘cause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the youngin with the 9 ready to put in my time

Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me

We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, but bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise

Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Tell me, nigga, tell me
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?

Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

Woke up with 50 enemies plottin' my death
All 50 seein' visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah nigga, I was stressed
Had me creepin' 'round corners, homie, sleepin' in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block
Call the cops, a thug nigga screamin' Westside
Bustin' double Glocks, hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got me drivin' up on the curb
Hand on the steerin' wheel, swervin'
Bless me, Father, I'm a sinner, I'm livin' in hell
Just let me live on the streets ‘cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin' world-wide exposure
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a fuck, ridin' as my soldiers
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside, Outlaw, Bad Boy killa
Complete my mission, my competition no longer beefin'

Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me?
Young Noble, Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
I'm still breathin'

Now, we was raised "fuck this life," my wrongs, my rights
Holdin' on a tight grip, with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleep walkin' as a true
Walk around town with a pound full of bitter food
Came a long way from my born day
Dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends! I'll say, rather die for my A-K
With these fag ass niggas, see-through-glass ass niggas
Only-ride-my-dick-and-the-skin-of-my-mash ass niggas
Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

I walk around with a knife in my back
Talkin' 'bout a bad day—I live a life like that
It's severe, and I'm losin' my hair, bless a hooligan
Catch me, I'm fallin' out flat yo, I'm ruined and
Breathin' in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me
I learned to like it like that when I was still in Mommy
The side of the city that the Devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still I'm breathin'!

And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest na'r, one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one, motherfucker, 'bout to do it again
Shit, Pac still doin' it, you hoes can't ruin it
Two million every time he drop, I know you fuckers losin' it
We movin' in for the kill, for a meal, holdin' steel
Hold the wheel
I'm 'bout to give these niggas somethin' they can feel
Fakin' real, but we the raw and uncut
Style-bitin', thug-lyin' niggas, give it up! We hit 'em up!
And we still breathin' and we still breathin'…
(Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?)

Tell 'em! Nigga, tell 'em! (And we still breathin'…)
Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?

Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

You claim to be a player, but I bust your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, brothers touched for life
Plus Puffy trying to see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. are some mark-ass tricks
We keep on coming while we gunning for your jewels
Steady rushing, while we busting at them fools
You know the rules
Lil' Caesar go ask your homie how I'll leave you
Cut your trick ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Little Kim, don't conversate with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly hair off the streets
You little weave! I'll let them suckas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride the night haha

Biggie Smalls just got dropped

Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer

Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than a block that I'm runnin' through
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you

Peep how we do it, keep it real, it's penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle, all you suckers gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryin' to come up off of me you and the clouds hopin', smokin' dope
It's like a Sherm high, brothers think they learned to fly
But they burn little suckers you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money but it's funny to me
All you suckers livin' bummy while you messin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air
Biggie remember when I use to let you sleep on the couch
And beg the trick that I let you sleep in the house
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight, with my A-K
I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Little busta I'll Hit 'Em Up

I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Big Momma, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
Please tell me is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked
You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't nothin' but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Prodigy in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, Outlawz we ain't no joke
Thug Life, cowards better be knowin'

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn’t pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin’ G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it’s a motherfuckin’ riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you’re not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can’t have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal

Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more

When they ask me, "When will the violence cease?"
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
I predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas, yesh
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The Penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather I'd be a dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Nigga shot ya from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game

Please bow your heads
Let us pray, my...Hail Mary...
Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body
That blows like a 12-gauge shotty (uh) feel me!
(Come with me Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now, do you wanna ride or die)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La la-da-la la la la la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me and my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
'Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart; now hail Mary, nigga!
Come with me!

They got a APB out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that muthafucka, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
'Cause word is bond; when I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take

Sometimes life can be a heavy load
We've been travelin' on this weary road

We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, life goes on

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', "Thug 'til I die!" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on

Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!

Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?

Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga
You gon' be like, "Goddamn, them niggas came up!"
That's right, baby, life goes on

Ay, you know what?

I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where these cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh Benz, flauntin' flashy rings, uh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks

So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me

The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
Motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me

The pussies gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now, everybody keep your eyes on the prize

That say they're your friends, but, in real life, they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life, they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life, those niggas will be snitches

Thug niggas from everywhere, Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waitin' for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors, but I'm infinite, Immortal Outlaw
Switchin' up on you ordinary bitches like a southpaw: you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a G
I rip the crowd, then I start again, eternally, I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The hearts of men

The hearts of men
("Hell motherfuckin' yeah")

My lyrical verge with so much pain, to some niggas, it hurts
My guns bust, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw, and five-o
Get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G to this until the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down, thought I'd rot in jail
Paid bail, well, a nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if you let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number, then start again
Don't have no motherfuckin' friends
Nigga, look inside the hearts of men
In the hearts of men
In the hearts of men
In the hearts of men

To all my niggas engaged in makin' money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer livin' in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced that this is my year like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is havin' problems, open fire and bomb
I died and came back, I hustle with these lyrics
As if it's a game of crack, thuggin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowin'
Scarred up but still flowin', energized and still goin'
Uhh, can it be fate, that makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous-ass cowards 'cause they evil and fake?
What will it take? Give me that bass line, I'm feelin' bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent, 'cause I've been sent, the hearts of men

("Hell motherfuckin' yeah")
Yeah, nigga, that's how we do it on Death Row
Y'all niggas feel me then you can rewind this and play it back, baby
That's why we give it to you, 'cause we know you love it
That's from your nigga Pac, throwin' that real shit to you every time
Keeping it rough, rugged and raw
Fuck a Delores Tucker, baby, you know?

Money gotta get made, niggas gotta be real

Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversatin', we relaxin', kickin' back
Got you curious for thug passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissin', hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you movin' in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweatin' up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespectin' when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, gettin' busy in the parkin' lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shakin', back-breakin'
When we're tossin' it up

Feel this baby, I like the way it's goin' down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride
Giving me that nice smile
Female I like, what I want to give all night
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up
Baby, let's get it on!
I like the way you please me, baby
The sexy way you tease me, shorty

Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass tricks
We keep on coming while we gunning for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools

Poisonous gats attack when I’m servin' ya

Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than a block that I’m runnin' through

It's like a Sherm high, brothers think they learned to fly
But they burn, little suckers, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money but it's funny to me
All you suckers livin' bummy while you messin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air
Biggie remember when I use to let you sleep on the couch
And begged the tricks to let you sleep in the house
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight, with my AK
I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Little busta I'll Hit 'Em Up
I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring my enemies to their knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Big Momma, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper clique smoked up
Please tell me is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't nothin' but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Prodigy in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, Outlawz we ain't no joke
Thug Life, cowards better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is poppin' off
HAHA, I hit 'em up!

See, at night I watch the sky
I take another breath
I smoke my Newport to the butt
Like it's the last motherfucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my dogs from the county jail
Sending me mail
Heard the block's in the same shape
Ain't nothing changed
Niggas slangin' at the same place
The same faces
Suppose to always hate our foes
This lifestyle lives forever
Watch the game unfold
Shedding crocodile tears, just got life plus
And you wonder if these white judges like us
Just stay strong, we'll appeal, nigga, you'll be free
Down with ya to the very end
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

How can I be blamed? Forgive me, Lord, I'm insane
In search of fame, won't hurt to change
Following the foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with Ski masks, no witnesses as we blast squealers
And now they feel us in this act of war
More casualties, no survivors
Any man that defies, quickly dies 'cause we riders
In my quest for chips
We wear vests, equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin'
'Cause niggas died over information
How much more can we take
Expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet so let's make Clinton pay
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we possess, we had to fight and take it
I think the president is smokin' weed, bumpin' this beat
Makin' a livin' out of my misery

Promise to visit
I know it's rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell
When I was younger
I could picture livin'
In luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison
Fuckin' snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama, he alone die, nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties, why the fuck should I let you live
When I'm dead inside?
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin' at they whole crew
Nigga, remember me
Hit up my Outlawz set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask
And get to straight coastin'

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was "fuck it," 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, ho!"
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart wrap it up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me, uh, yeah
And now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah
You might also like
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first to hop inside, give me the 9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, screamin' 'kill me,' witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys'
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

What'z ya phone number?
Now, I could make miracles tempos
It's instrumental, written for the nymphos
That's the intro
Shook when you rushed me
Walked up and touched me
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just 'cause I'm paid in the worst way? True
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if your wild and ya act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch when you lick your lips, shake your hips
Goddamn, I love that shit
Now let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard on, still down?
Met ya standin' at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we headed for my hideout, act right
Boss playa when I ride out, that's right
What'z ya phone number?

Baby, it's for sure that we can get it on all night
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?
'Til three or maybe four, I'm ready for it all, I'm down

Baby, throw me them keys and I will push the Gallardo
And I ain't tryna barter
Vice grip on them hips and my lips on your tip, yo
Now let your face take a taste
I could promise I'll squirt and it won't be mace
I'm dumb stuck up in my place
When you leave, it ain't your shoes but my neck you lace
Now tell me now, can you roll with a boss bitch?
Keep that thang standing tall for a boss bitch?
Spit game and keep it clean for a boss bitch?
Grab a pen and paper said the digits of the boss bitch

How long will it take to break you off?
'Til three or maybe four, I'm ready for it all, I'm down
Hey, baby, let me give you a call

Shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally best from the gods, if I seen her right
Now, she can get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me just to she see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What'z your phone number? Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme, take time to rewind
These ordinary words I say
If you open in your mind, better think and you'll find
It's time, let the outlaws play

I know you wanna fuck, let me hear you say
Give it to you good 'til I cum in your face
Keep it running like a faucet, who the boss, nigga?
Don't be scared to toss it, I bet you cum quicker
I love it how you keep it so thuggish, thuggish
I feel it through your fingers how you grip this shit
Got you leaning like a bat, nigga, hit it like a bat
Like, yeah, mayne, got me high like a plane
In the back of a G5, now my legs spread a mile high
Got you opening my thighs
When your hands on fire, poppin' bottles
Looking in my shadows, how we get it
Ain't no stoppin' how we did it
I don't know, I just know I gotta get some
So ruthless, when I fuck, better duck
When you see me with Pac in a truck
Rollin' like an 8-ball, now let me break you off
Baby, it's for sure that we can get it on all night
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

Uh, pain, pain...
(So much pain, so much pain)

They'll never take me alive
I'm gettin' high with my 4-5
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster
Causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labled as a troublemaker
Who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless
Rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm 'bout to crash up on the curb 'cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me
What should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family
What else could I do?
But be a thug
Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club
Got my mind on danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gangbangers and drive-bys
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young, but still a victim of the 12-gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin back to court, so fuck what you thought
I'm drinkin' Hennessy, runnin' from my enemies

Even hot from the flame of the 9
No stranger to danger in mine
Matter fact, I be bangin' for mine
Got a closet full of guns and I'm hangin' with mine
So much pain, yeah, I spent years doing sicker shit
If I cried, the tears'll probably be blood and liquor mixed

Bust some motherfuckers with a PASSION
Better duck 'cause I ain't lookin when I'm BBBBLASTIN'
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy
And gettin' high, on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why
'Cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across my face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
I keep my brain on tha game and stay head-strong
These sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep
I'm real, they cannot see
And every day is just a struggle
Steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas 'til you buried
I was born to raise, hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother, I'm touched
I'm kickin' dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean, until they kill me
I'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me

How was it promised to us? Was it bitter or sweet?

Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for G's
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin' Thug Life, comin' equipped, with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, and the cracks were blind

Yet and still we all feel pain

Just like Aladdin wish, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what my foes need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it
You might also like
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real

Tell me, baby, is it cool to touch?
I'm a man that you can trust, not just a fool in lust
Comin' to get you on the bus is so ironic
Exotic, on the verge of erotic
I'm hittin' switches on misses
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
My up and down like a roller coaster
Can I cum inside you?
I ain't stoppin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider
In and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alize
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
The players living Cali days
Delores Tucker, you a fake to me
Instead of tryin' to help a brother, wanna take his G's
Mistaking me for Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot tracks
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, try and top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in my cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I ain't giving up
Very wonder taught us all to cuss
Come on, tell me how you want it
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real

I was raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Say they bustin' off the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is gettin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
They wonder if my lifestyle's changed
And am I through with all the pain
Survivin' in this game, and still the same
Honey, just meet me at the strip club, bring the thong
Look how they shake it for that cash, once again it's on
I had no sympathy for those afraid of mystery
Come get with me, I promise passion and ecstasy
I'm alone, can I come over there tonight?
Depend on me to wanna handle it and get it right
Your body is bangin', baby, I love the way you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel
'Cause it's on my mind all the time
Don't you know I'm for real
Tell me how do you want it, babe
You know that I can make it feel

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

("Just think if niggas decide to retaliate")

I was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, 'cause I never had shit
I could remember being whooped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whooped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Move enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
'Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal

Here on Earth, tell me what's a Black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me: "When will the violence cease?"
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them 'cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down, huh
And now Bush can't stop the hit
I predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas
Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row

Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a Black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with Blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm Black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' nigga
Rather I'd be a dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
And when I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

Yo Pac I heard you got beat up by the police
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything (Word up)
Niggas just wanna know if your still gonna be on some crooked ass nigga shit

Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I do to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK-47 layin' on my hips so I don't trip
One mothafucker from the Underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
Yo why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch, the mothafuckers got a beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin' the finger at police
Instead of them mothafuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when the punk mothafuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then, I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too

Here's an example just another sample

And we ain't shootin' at each other (fuck no!)
That's my mothafuckin' brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover
And all the bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (Fuck that!)
Genuine draft, guns and ganja and my fucking TEC-9
They know their scared to see us sober (awwwww)
Stop drinking King Cobra, and niggas will take the world over
It's all up to you (Up to you)
Blame the Korean blame the Jew

Crooked with the crown on a flip tip
Swinging part two, the leaders of the mothafucking crooked ass crew
So pass the brew and let me sip and plot another hit for loot
And I'm aiming for ya head if a nigga gotta shoot true
Word is bond and niggas confess for stress
So when I'm in your presence play a game named death
And start guessing when and where the niggas snitches gonna
Move or groove or wax and tax
Flexing our show and prove I get wicked, hoes want to lick it
Tweed on a Mack and that ass'll catch a ticket
Ticking like a time bomb, boom too late
I'm wrecking when I'm stepping and a nigga full of hate
For the beef police and the K.K.K
So I'm scheming on a way to make 'em try this new spray

Here's an example just another sample
For ya crooked ass niggas
Here's an example just another sample
I'm a crooked nigga too

All you niggas out there, take your guns that you use to shoot each other
And start shooting these bitch ass mothafucking police
Die to impress a mothafucking nigga like me
The crooked mothafuckas
'Cause these Police getting way too mothafucking out of line
Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nuttin but love for each other
So mothafucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and OOOH
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga to

Good Evening
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
(2Pac! 2Pac! 2Pac! 2Pac!)
Awaiting the much-anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another posthumous release by 2Pac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're doing the countdown now

Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug's mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothing but peace, love
And street passion (I wanna go, nigga)
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's mama to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
‘Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just 20-some-odd years, I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
‘Cause, like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
‘Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings, in thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good (at thugs's mansion)
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion
Dear mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
(At thugs's mansion)
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion9Embed
Niggas
Yeah, uh
Niggas

Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice, no peace
Fuck the law, rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine, cross the line
My two .9s go "Bayah, bayah" when I shoot 'em
Korean motherfuckers was crooked. so niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night, my niggas (Niggas)
Uh, straight take his life
So don't sleep when my team creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip, 'cause we did 'em
Lickin' off shots for Latasha, that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now?
I packed a .9 last year, in '99, I'm packin' two now
And even if they pull they triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothin's gonna stop the plan of true niggas

Niggas
Yeah, niggas, can't fuck with us
Niggas
Yeah, niggas
'Cause bein' a nigga means you love niggas, haha

The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eating wit' you, I'm probably beefin' wit' you
If no money ain't involved, ain't no need for me speaking wit' you
I know you got a gun but I'm hopin' you keep it wit' you
'Cause, unfortunately, I'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol
And know what the llama do
Shady, Aftermath, Ruff Ryders, D Block, and, of course Amaru
Lot of people honor you
Probably 'cause the way that you used to bring the drama to

You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you

Now you lookin' like a jerk 'cause she hurts you
Now hands up, don't be a player hater, just peep game
Keep your mind on your money, watch the bitch change
See, hoes love thugs and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker 'fore I shoot, who do you love?

Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem
Now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfuckin' soldier, ready to roll and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin', 'cause there's no stoppin' till they rubbed out
And they vests don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty

Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryna keep a nigga down, but shit fails

Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin' pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin' for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

Play your cards right baby, haha, play your cards right
Play your cards right girl, take ya time
Take your time baby, be patient
Just be patient baby, don't rush
Don't you rush it girl
You might also like
Uh huh, Luda
You ain't gotta do that baby
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you playin' your cards
You got a brother feelin' mellow like a Cuban cigar
You truly a star, we'll take the days one at a time
I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more livin' like a playa, stop chasin' the hoes
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffin', no rushin', just takin' it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, baby girl
You made me hurry up and wait and I know patience is a virtue
Haha, play your cards right baby

Play your cards right baby, haha, play your cards right

Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this

Murderous mind state, can't keep my 9 straight
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckers bow down, recognize
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw ridaz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well-known felons, labelled for drug-sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dogs
Commence to lettin' off rounds then escape in the fog
Who wanna see me solo? Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My Mini-14 murderin' niggas while they creepin'
Uh, duck or you ass out, drink 'til you pass out
Ain't scared to die, drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories, nigga, now they wanna really see
"Bomb first" my motto, it's fully guaranteed
Niggas is playa haters, label them my enemies—I'm dumpin'

Who you are

When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get
Out the window on some "Uptown Anthem" shit

Fugitive, task force at my girlfriend door
Now they checkin' in her bedroom, I ain't there
.40 cal's, extended clips, still I ain't scared
Outlaw and best believe they won't take me alive
I'm different and I'ma prove it if it take me to die
Knew that God had a plan for me
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
Me dyin'—you think I'd let them see the joy from that shit?
Walkin' dead, angels spend they last days by me
New Jersey giant like Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt
Your guns clap, mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin' the black pound
When they put the Twin Towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' them back down
Poster child—cheque!
Air Force Ones with the crocodile checks, I'm supposed to wild sex
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the Devil
G ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the 9 and the shovel
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this

I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box ‘cause them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatch you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
With the Pac keepin' the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know your goons
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin', songs are evolution
If I load your gun for you when we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin'—I'm clever, stupid!
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless
You got the same bullets that you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pac—the revolution
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this20Embed
Do you understand nigga revolution, what's ya plan nigga {*gunshot*}
Since my transition I've been misquoted, disrespected, turnin' over in my grave
Watchin' y'all behave as if I should be proud or something
The I hear you speak my name like I had a devine strides or something
But relgions are seldom followed and all those sould back slide easy
My life is tarnished so the whole world sees me as a menace
But I implement that hate for me with love for y'all
I look from above for y'all but I can't find my soldiers
Who's holdin' the weight of the world on they shoulders since I left
Who caught my last breath as I exhaled
Derailed from the tracks, who's ridin'
Make sure they don't destroy the art form
If they can stop me they can stop thirty more emcees before they even born
So I sacrifice the longevity in life
To make sure you got the message the way you needed it
Existence turns into a lesson to be taught
Told, confessed, to be heard and heeded this
Kids walkin' these dirty roads and it's your job to pave it
You see niggas dyin' cuz of what you sayin'
Don't matter if you ain't kill 'em
If you ain't do shit to save 'em you in the way nigga
Save the day nigga or stopy playin' with 'em
I been yellin' and screamin' from my grave for ten years now
But y'all don't hear me though
Which one of you niggas is gonna step up and say, Pac I got you

Now up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And mama told me be a thug, since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, 'cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is, nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin', never heard my friends callin'
Couldn't stop myself from fallin', I'm all in
Shit's gettin' sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
'Cause in my mind, I see sunshine
I thought I didn't have to run
Now I'm duckin' from the gun yellin' "One time!"
Take your time to feel my record
And if you did, chill a second
My blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone

Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin' life as a thug, time to face the truth
What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God
Come and save me, had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin' crazy
I can't read the signs
I'm blind, but a nigga know he need his nine
'Cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
And my niggas on the streets, man, listen
'Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way, I'm bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay
It seems I can't find my focus and homie, I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, it's hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin' me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but are you still down

I wrote this for my critics and my enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh, remember me
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail
Just as well, 'cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped
And mercy Lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone and so I'm angry
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, "Baby, it's on!"
And now I'm hustlin' and bustin' them bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin' G's
Buyin' all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town
Please tell me, are you still down?
Are you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me

Guess who's back?

Here we go
It's ninety-fo', what's next?
Power.. enter my world
I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggas
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law? Man, fuck the law!
Niggas must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
The motherfuckin' law, in every way
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low'
Gots to be struggling
I see how the rich got theirs
Nigga I'm legit, shit
Where do we go from here?
(Who's afraid, of the punk police?
To my niggas run the streets, fuck peace) 
Heyyy niggas, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin' babies, killin' mommas
Killin' kids, puttin' this in they motherfuckin' mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
Before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
*singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here'*
All you niggas out there
The clouds shook, the world listened
We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggas, not the whites, not the enemies
Or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molesters
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go from here?

You know what my momma used to tell me
If ya can't find something to live for...

I thought about bumpin', but motherfuck jugglin'
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun 'cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject

'Cause of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin'
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac 'cause the dogg got it goin' on
If you come up steppin' you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, 'cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin' house, I'm strugglin'
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch

One love, one life

As she nurtures.. her young all alone
It's the seed.. that must grow regardless

In the concrete jungle, alone with her cub
It's the seed.. that must come to harvest
It's the tree.. that must grow out of love

Outlaw nigga, Westside, throw it up
Hahaha.. had love for 'em, but why you turnin' on me?
Why me? Westside, how you do it boy?

I went from, nothin' to somethin' now they all wanna see me fallin'
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ballin'
They say we hate the East coast, but that's funny
Got a lot of love for, any nigga gettin' money
I made a song about my enemies and niggas tripped
It was hip-hop until 2Pac fucked Biggie bitch
Y'all niggas hypocrites and bitch made
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggas get paid
Have me catchin' cases all across the nation
I went from jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facin' three strikes
And we might, just blast God bless the child, that can get cash
But all these niggas turnin' and never learn
Got a long line of niggas player hatin' me but gettin' burned
Talk a lot of shit but you's a trick in drag
Like the MAC make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back stab

Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggas see me you flee (yeah nigga)

It, started so innocent, but ended in the fifth precinct
Although two juvenile delinquents, we still decent
Playin' catch and kiss, used to diss the herbs
Fuck school we was skippin' drink a fifth on the curb
Me and you, no closer two, while drinkin' brew
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
I never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that? {​*laughter*}​
Revenge is a payback bitch, get ya gat
Fuck {​Wendy Williams}​ and I pray you choke
On the next dick down your throat
For turnin' on me

Why you wanna turn on me?

Why you always wearin' Spandex you fat bitch?
I know your pussy stinks, you fat ho
I'm puttin' Jenny Craig on you bitch
I'm about to put a twenty-thousand dollar, hit
Through Jenny Craig to come find yo' ass
And put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch!
Thug Life, Outlaw, Westside bitch
It's 2Pac so you know who said it
And for everybody who didn't like what I said about that other trick
And Mobb Deep, fuck you too nigga!
If a nigga didn't want to get talked about
He shouldn'ta stepped in the fuckin' ring
If Tyson don't want to get knocked out
He don't step in the fuckin' ring, that's how the shit go
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock motherfuckers out!
Well that's what 2Pac gon' do
When niggas come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out!
One way or the motherfuckin' other
This old motherfuckin' nigga in the South told me nigga
It's more than one way to skin a cat
It's more than one way to shoot a gat
It's more than one way to die nigga
When I'm through, everybody cry nigga
This is how we do it
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G..

Yeah, clear enough for ya? (alright)
Why niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas!

Picture me rollin' in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance
I swear somebody be tellin'
Know there's dope bein' sold, but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin'
And my hands are swollen
Thinkin' of the G's I'll be holdin'; picture me rollin'

Yeah, nigga!
Aye, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

I got keys comin' from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swangin'
Make me wanna start back bangin'
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin' 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on Rémy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin' a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight sufferin' from lack of havin' paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin'-ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)
Checkin' in the park, 'Pac

We caught him sleepin'
He didn't peep you niggas creepin'?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, you got the bomb spot
Nigga, time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you can get the females
This crooked shit that we inflictin', gettin' street sales
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm cool as a motherfucker, I'ma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swoll
Boss Hogg and this 'Pac nigga, picture us rollin'

Picture me rollin'

'Cause I hate to spend
My life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time! (Lost Soul)
How it start? How it start?

Started off with, runnin' from coppers
Duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us?
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' 25 to life, if the judge don't like us
Am I clear as pictures? I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF, state feds, scandalous bitches
How was it promised to us? Was it bitter or sweet?
See if a, nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat
On these streets livin' do or die, circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for G's
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin' Thug Life, comin' equipped, with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time; stranded in the county in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost souls...
Lost souls, nigga, for my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a lost soul

Makaveli & Dillinger, the First 2 Bomb (So don't sleep homeboy)
Hey, just like the M.O.B., money over bitches

You know that I'ma stay fly
Who can't understand the power that I gain
It's tryna stop up over me
You runnin' over like a 
Shining like a diamond, you know who I are
Imagine to keep on, wishin' up on the star

And then out with the pay, soon count up the pie

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine

In Oakland today, a black musician filed a 10 million dollar claim against two white police officers. Saying, "they assaulted him physically and verbally after arresting him from jaywalking"
I think they used a little bit too much force; because I mean he was already handcuffed and they were still hitting him
It's not the first time these officers have been accused of misconduct. Officer Kevin Rogers, one of those named in the lawsuit did not want to comment on the incident. The other officer Alexander Boyevich, is hospitalized with serious injuries

If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And, aw yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the ear with my phone or my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggas tryin' to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop

Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
"You're just another rapper, who swears he's makin' records"
That's what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though, always kept my head up high
Eventually I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night always comes a brighter day
And some would say, that turned away is all you'll get
I just said "Bet!," and never let 'em see me sweat
'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell
Yo, get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hit the studio, 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it 'til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you, and that way you can never fall
But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car note
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
Remember how it felt and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly for my niggas

Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stick-ups
I better see five stars next to my picture

I told you once, motherfucker, I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
Niggas know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore, nigga
It's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin' all that shit
Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggas that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin' trigger
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga
Mr. Troublesome, niggas tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator, nigga, I'll be back
Yeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me, ring the alarm, G
'Cause most motherfuckers love to act up, without they backup
When they get jacked up, they crack up
It's strictly for my niggas at the show
So they know, not to play me like a ho

Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
‘Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human bein'
So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
‘Cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly? Somebody else's child
Caught in gun smoke and we, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate
‘Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes
You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes
But we ain't, its grain to go against
With every artist comes the image he portrays
And the picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster
And I ain't hear no complaints
But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day, the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame and success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search, but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive
And we continue growin', one day at a time
You might also like
Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and lights
Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest
There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'
And the kids think beef is they only option
Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of Kadaf' while Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns
And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?
We needin' a change, the drama remains the same

I spend my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
And every now and then, I take rights from the left
I'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt
Yeah, and that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God, take a like to myself
No matter how much I try to stay alive
I'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride

Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ASCAP
The rappers in the game ain't changed (No)
And I finally realize that we're not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn17Embed

I had the opportunity to dream with 2Pac
Before his dreams became a reality
He used to always talk about music, you know
And I'm just so happy, so thankful to be a part of this project

Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
Hommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down

'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

New Bentley or not, watch the chinchilla
Sean Don spitter, Banshee four wheeler
I'm big in New York, I move like Godzilla
Gorilla, U.N.I.T Nigga
Grave digger, ask Puffy and Jigga
Made nigga, my pockets get bigger
And bigger, you got no choice but to feel a
Nigga when I spit that shit, I figure

Check the rhyme

Back in the days on the Boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
And me the five footer
I kicks the mad style, so step off the frankfurter
Ayo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
Okay, you on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
Ayo, so let me get down, and let me drop my lip
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an Energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then +Push it Along+
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect, have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah, that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

How far must I go to gain respect? Um...
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty:
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act

In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
She went lower than low, into limbo
A thought crossed her mind: her, a bimbo
She answered no, so she had to go...
On with the program
"Greetings, it seems that I've forgotten your name"
But it seems that she'd done the same
And now something has happened
Suddenly, she's been distracted
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Now, I think you understand
Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
Right then and there, she fainted
A really grim picture is painted
The brother who she acquainted
Was the enemy, scary, ain't it?
The pubic enemy
You might also likeQ-Tip:
Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Had a lady queen, married since 18
He protested, that he was infested
With thoughts of love and he couldn't digest it
All propaganda, one big fat lie
Cause I seen the king with my very own eye
Schemed the scheme like a crack fiend fiend
And poppin up on the teenage scene
And proppin and pimpin hunnies with moneys
Whole situation to Tip, was kinda funny
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
Saw the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
Caught the king scratchin, so she had to assume
That he got vicked by the enemy's tricks
The thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin
Threw a pot and his dome was beamin
You could hear him yellin in the motherland
"Baby, baby please. Baby, understand."
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate...
Of the enemy: the Pubic Enemy
Q-Tip:
Everybody get sweating, a deep is still a threaten
About the AIDS, they hate the AIDS, but still will be forgettin
About the Syph or Gony like the Rocky Picture Horror
Don't move tracks, cause the pubic had the hour
You can get it from sleepin' in nasty dirty sheets and
Wearin' nasty clothes for, oh, about a weekend
I suggest you do yourself a big favor
The press I keep questin, I'll be damned if I save ya
Please remember this: a kiss is just a kiss
A hug is just a hug, but a bug ain't just a bug
If you get the bug, oh boy, you'll be buggin'
You'll regrets your moments even when you started lovin'
....... Damn! After loving, just take it out
Don't get so far to Q, man
Inspect yourself, protect yourself
Respect yourself, then correct yourself
Make sure you don't get had by the man
Yo, Ali, man, damn
Give me some rubs, boo1Embed
Believe it or not, that is the sound of an invasion. Yes, that is the sound created by the musical invasion of America by the world's hottest recording group: A Tribe Called Quest
They are non-conformists to such a great degree that no two members ever dress alike. And many educators consider their popularity resulted from their becoming symbols of teenage rebellion
They certainly are raking in a lot of good green American money and gathering hundreds of thousands of teenage fans in the process

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like a Tribe does
Before this did you really know what life was
Comprehend to the track for it's wide 'cause
Gettin' mentions on the tip of the vibe buzz
Rock 'n' roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afro-centric living is a big shrug
A life filled with *horn* that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives its a plus love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove...

Like Rod Serling from The Twilight Zone
Earth to your brain - is anyone home? (What you talkin' 'bout?)
I see you there, tryin' to make amends
Try to make some friends, but now my story ends (Oh, man)
On the note, that I just wrote
Stay afloat on the reality boat (Oh)
Slow down and think and take it cool
And try to avoid the description of a fool
Man, Tip, you think you all that now that you on wax
Or something that you can tell a brotha what to do?
You know I'm older than you? I'm your senior, brotha
Man, you better go someplace with that old fool nonsense
I'm gon' keep doin' what I gotta do
And survive the way I gotta survive, know'm'sayin'?
You can't do nothin', can't do nothin', man
Know'm'sayin'? I've been out here too long doin' my thing...1Embed
Woo, ha-ha-ha, grand groove, grand groove
It's the beat, ah yeah
Woo, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, grand groove, grand groove
It's the beat, here we go

Rough, rough, rugged
Tough like a nugget
Listen to The Abstract Poetic, don't snub it
The midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger
Don't front on my lyrics or the tool 'cause it's danger
Hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey
To the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because I'm funky
I get down, down like a fly hooker's panties
Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
I be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly
Upset when I rock, 'cause yo, they rhymes are smelly
See, I got it going on like a Forbes tax return
Listening to these lyrics when it's hot will make you burn
Baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens
The skies up above, the one you think of
Is the highly regarded, hell of a people
Your mic and my mic? Come on, yo, no equal (Word!)
So if ya wanna do it to yourself
That is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself
'Cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it
That's your shit on the floor, then go and play in it
I refuse to catch a "L" in a battle
'Cause yo, I got the jazz and I'll whup a rapper's ass
Into little next to nothin'
Test me if I'm frontin'
I'll pass with flying colors 'cause yo, I am that brotha that can rock

No need for introductions 'cause y'all know who I be (The Phife Dawg)
Yep, the one who loves to slaughter MC's
I got style, grace and razamatazz
I'm like my girl Patrice Rushen, yo, I add pizzazz, now
Most people remember Phife from the Phife-like smoothness
But now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness
I'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw
The first punk who tries to flex, I'll be cracking your jaw
I'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff
Don't ever try for test or else that ass will get whipped
I'm forever poppin' junk, it's like a phat invite
To any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight
Gel up my posse up on Linden and 1-9-2
Pull up my brothas from Sayers Ave., the Brooklyn Zoo
All my crew up in Strong Island, so yo, don't sleep
'Cause it only takes a beat to watch that ass get beat
Brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some
Wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none
Don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with
Why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?
I'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro, too?
But beatin' on a girl, is somethin' that a puss' would do
I love jazz, but that doesn't mean that I'm timid
Not really a gangsta rapper but I can swing it for a minute
Who got the jazz? We've got the jazz

When the mic is in my hand, I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was "Eric B. for President"

Rude boy composer, step to me, you're over
Brothers wanna flex, you're not Mad Cobra
MC short and Black, there ain't no other
Trini-born lad like Nia Long's grandmother
Tip and Sha, they all that, Phife Dawg, ditto
Honey, tell your man to chill or else you'll be a widow
Did not you know that my styles are top-dollar?
The Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar
Hip-hop scholar since being knee high to a duck
The height of Muggsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip

Queens is in the house, represent, represent-sent
A Tribe Called Quest, represent, represent-sent
No taming of the style 'cause it gets irreverent
A Tribe Called Quest, represent, represent-sent

We work for the paper, so there'll never be a freebie
Lyrics are abundant 'cause we got it by the mass (Mass)
Egos are at idle 'cause the music is the task (Task)
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it

New York City, represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest, represent, represent-sent
The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent
A Tribe Called Quest, represent, represent-sent
MCs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
I let my lyrics flow, and juxt' your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after (Hahaha)
Yo, Tip, settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?
I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying (Crying)
So much going on, people killing, people dying (Dying)
But I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental
Yo, I'll take it back, I'm the Indian giver
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver (Word)
Percussion isn't less (Uh), Ds wear the vest (What?)
Why they dodging bullets? (What?) You should be dodging Quest (Uh, uh)
Don't get me wrong, violence is not our forté
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pelé
Tip, educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo
Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo (Okay)

I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself, but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a statewide tear (Tear)
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all (All) as we mingle at the ball (Ball)
We welcome competition 'cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card (Card)
Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
Try to be the phattest, also to stay alive7Embed

Yo, I'm savant with the game
Gon' tell Robi yo' name
Provide words that's heard, setting your body aflame
Ooh, you off the chain, I'm handling your terrain
Your valley h-has me standing down to the follicle
'Bout half of this bottle full of reasons for us to ball
Palming violations and travel vacation, ma
Lace your fancy bra, gon' take them vestments off
Skin and my lips involved, I'm licking a place that's soft

It's hard to break your defense, I guess I have to leap fence
Or scale wall, and break fall on a tree right by your window
Reward me for my efforts by rolling this indo
As I nibble your neck naughtily, sex is a big part of me
Agencies want to audit me, searching, snooping for sodomy
My thrust bust artery, I know you're on to me
Just wanna have shenanigan
Don't wanna make you mad again
So focus on the flattery you feel when I fling it
Acknowledge that I got it and you love it when I bring it
Dirty talk loud but they saying, "Fuck the shit out of me"
At the Queen's request, if it's gotta be, it's gotta be

I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
(What's your name?)
Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?)
American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend
(Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream)
(Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember)
(Shaytan got you caught in the storms of December)
(And brothers on the block packing nines like September)
(Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender)
Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies
Yo we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at the Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it, 'til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo I know the feeling when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that

Dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lo, dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lee

Ever since me was small as a youth out in Queens
What did you mash on de dancehall (all a me)
Until my best friend caught two in him head (Right, scene)
And ever since that day (ya nah hear me?) things been a mess
R.I.P Ghosta Rock, true ting, God bless
So nowadays I go see wifey just to cure me from stress
Lay my head on her breast
Sugar dumpling knows best
Explaining all my problems to her getting things off my chest
A little hookup, squeeze up, and no more am I vexed
Ayo son, without my peeps I'd be truly assed out
Making sure I have my medication so I wouldn't pass out
Native Tongues for believing in me, when everyone was fessing
Most of all Jah Mighty for the guidance and the blessings

I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so then picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El Segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said: "Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?"
When he said "Why?," I said, "We gotta go"
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo

Anyway, a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished, we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: "Pay for lunch," so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
"Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?"
I checked for keys and started to step
But what do you know, my wallet I forget
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts, we scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming, three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Shah
He said, "Alright, Tip, see you tomorrow"
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said "Why?," I said, "We gotta go
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo"
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo

Believe it or not, that is the sound of an invasion. Yes, that is the sound created by the musical invasion of America by the world's hottest recording group: A Tribe Called Quest
They are non-conformists to such a great degree that no two members ever dress alike. And many educators consider their popularity resulted from their becoming symbols of teenage rebellion
They certainly are raking in a lot of good green American money and gathering hundreds of thousands of teenage fans in the process

Can I kick it? Yes, you can!
"Um, you can!" Yes, you can!

"Um, you can!" Yes, you can!

Well, I'm gone...
Gone...

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like a Tribe does
Before this did you really know what life was
Comprehend to the track for it's wide 'cause
Gettin' mentions on the tip of the vibe buzz
Rock 'n' roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afro-centric living is a big shrug
A life filled with *horn* that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives its a plus love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove...

Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free to drop your pants and check your hair
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major

Come here, yo

Have you ever met a woman that just took your breath?
(yeah uh huh uh uh, yeah uh huh)
So deep inside her life, she contemplated death
(damn she deep, give a fella the creeps)
Can't help but get attached to a woman like that
(true that, true that, true that, true that)
The contact was quite immediate, I had good tact
(Because you the man, yo, you know you the man)
We related and debated over food and tunes
(*people talking* "No I'm Good)
Started out in September, now we entering June
(say word, say word, say word)
Simple night in the crib, no, it just won't do
(No, it just won't do, no, it just won't do)
Know why? Because she liable to start shit too wild for you
(wild for you, wild for...)
She wanna push my whip, buy diamond chips
And take on trips, conversin my flip
Gotta do her hair, take her out to the fair
Win a teddy bear, make sure you don't stare
At another one comin, don't be startin nuthin
Be a slave to her, don't be brave to her
Make sure that she's right, make sure that you're wrong
When she wants it, do it, make sure that it's long
If anyone wanna make it work it's me
(Phife Dawg, help me out, Phife Dawg, help me out)
But we gotta come to a common ground baby
(What you say, pop? What you say, pop? Help me out)
Any man, he can claim to be the one for you
(Say word, for you, say word, for you)

Phife Dawg in the break, is she more than you can take?

See, I'm not the one to be taken advantage of
And if you really think about it, I got nuthin but love
Now if your heart isn't in it, please let me know
There's no need to waste time, if it's no, then I'll go

And if it's me then let's get it going on

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin' measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh airEmbed
Babies babble on, they lookin' for excuses
Game for the buzzer who kicked it to the mooses
Lame as a brain, could be, golly gee
If you see a shrink he'll charge you a fee
If you see me, ya see, the fee is nothing
Fee will be for patience, all backs no fronting

Yo, that's the sound when MCs get mopped
Don't come around town without the hip in ya hop
'Cause when the shit hits the fan, that ass'll get dropped
MCs wanna attack me, but them punks can't cope
I'll have you left without a job like Isaac from The Love Boat
So money, watch your mouth, or I'ma have to bust ya
Battlin' MCs from JFK to Russia
Back down to London, Sweden, and Brazil
Do a US tour for three months, and then I chill
Styles be phat like Jackie Gleason, the rest be Art Carney
People love the Dawg like the kids love Barney
I love you, you love me
The shorty Phife Dawg is your favorite MC
So move back yourself, dread, you know the element
The Tribe is good for your health like a can of Nutrament
MCs don't have no wins, MCs don't have no bitches
I flip shit crazier than a busload full of Jerry's Kids
Your crew don't want it, and your crew don't want it
But if you feel you can swing it, then, money, please bring it

My fist stands firm because I'm Black and solid
I open up your pores like a plate full of collards
Come on, take it easy, would ya? Easy, easy
I'm up in the gulley, that's when I am her buddy
She told me pull her hair, I did, it drove her nutty
Filled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty
When we over joints like this, we never cruddy
Extra P hooked the beat, and kids, it feels lovely
Check it out, 'cause my conception is immaculate
A bachelor lookin' for a bachelorette
Back to you MCs, this is what you gonna get
A first-degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette
I hope you like Marlboro
Paul, you know we thorough like Denver
The beat feels like a never-ender
But all things good must, so I won't sweat it
Drop the seeds for the youthful crew, I hope you get it
As I stand, grip this mic inside my hand
Boy, I'll smack you up like I was your old gran
So respect yourself, son, and come and give me love
Once again, the Ab' is who you think of
So chill with the beef, money, we gotta dead it
It's Extra P, and yo, Tip, I'm 'bout to set it
On the country once again, here to win
I'm Uptown chillin', takin' in this Grandmaster Vic blend
From the projects, the PJs
Fuck them two DJ's
Self mission, I had her in the ill position
Sayin', "Large, you's the soul brother that I'd like to F with
For the rest of my life," yeah, yeah, now check the method
As I proceed with what you need like Akinyele
A whip looks complete when the tires say Pirelli
Funk monkey, one rapper fell off, now he's a junkie
There's eight million stories in the city, it's a pity
Don't fuck with the skins if she's tryin' to act shitty
Big shout to the Guru, Primo and Zulu Nation
Was on a vacation in the ghetto
Yo, Ras, slow your roll, I'm 'bout to bag this here schmeydl
Rapper Nas on top, it seems we gonna rock it

It's a new decade
The Native Tongues are about to proceed with the usual lingo
The usual rhythm

Devoted to, the art of moving butts
The rhythm's happening, and it's moving up
The Tribe has been on hold for much too long
Don't fear the rhythm because it's strong
On the corners, brothers bop their heads
From the high-tops to the natty dreads
I'm a nubian y'all, look what we did
Took the crust away from the third eyelid
Now it's kinda open, longs to see the sight
Rhythms of the Tribe which is passed outright
Night after night, day after day
Questing for the rhythms of the Native Tongue way
Rhythm is the key as we open up the door
Things a B-boy has never seen before
Poly-rhythm addict with a big fat boom
You have an eargasm as you start to consume
The ghetto beat with a ghetto poem
Yeah, it's from the heart, 'cause it's from the home
Jarobi, Phife, Ali Shaheed
Call me Koala, got what you need
You're a disc jock, then jock this
Rhythms can't lose, rhythms can't miss
If you feel uptight and you need to freak
It'll be alright once we drop this beat

Ma Massa-ya, Ma Makossa
Gets hectic, freak a bourgeois
We quest around for the musical heart
On avenues, streets and boulevards
Not selling out, that's a negative
Loving Hip Hop, loving heritage
Got the instinct to travel miles and miles
Gotta whole lot of rhythm, piles and piles
Now you're kinda with it, wanna get the funk
From the Zulu Nation, topping all the junk
Standing on the top like the Temptations said
Rhythms are obese, yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed
Read what I read, can't be better said
Tribe'll lick motions dabble in the head
Sweetback's bad, not as bad as a beat
It's a (stone groove baby)
Continue, on the windy road
But, I'm lugging, a crazy big load
Will we be on point for the ninety dec
Is it muscle bound and will it flex?
But trudging, we are used to
You don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew
We're four, once more, must make the tracks
You see four fronts, but now you see four backs
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm

Bonita Applebum, remember way back woo
When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail 'do
I used to be all on it like a fly to shit
Back in the days, Bonita was a hit
I flirted and I flirted 'til there was no end
But you kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
Honey, you was funny but I'm tired of that
It's three years later, I got a new rap
Got a little older, a titbit wiser
I gained twenty pounds, six inches higher
Speaking of high I saw you smoke a hootie mack
Your ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back
But I'm here to testify it'll be a hard try
Slapping my knees, letting out sighs
Want to keep it slamming like a hip-hop song
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

You wrong, I steer you strong, for affection steer here
I'll take you to a place that's farther than the Uno

Your presence should be closer like on "Buddy" I'll toast
To the ever clever youth, to say the least, you're the most
Honey, you're my honey, a-yo, dip, you're my dip
Treasure and forever there'll be pleasure with Tip
As we glide and move
Cushioned like a pillow that's soft and smooth
Ricky D said we got to "show and prove"
Do it to the music, that's the raw butt groove
Intimidate the boy
Cupid that's his name
Picking all us suckers is his flipping game
But Tip don't fall for that
Instead I'll get the Natives and we rush to the latest

Here in 1992, we present the fabulous What's The Scenario remix
Whereas, there are seven MC's
Six which are in physical form, one which is in spiritual essence
And he goes by the name of, uh... HOOD!

Check your rhyme, punk that ass or get got, F it (Shiittt!)
I lick buckshots, Hood, madman, I rip up stages
Lay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis
Extra! Extra! Pick up a clip
I'll tear ass out the frame (Ha!), and grab my dick (Ohh!)
I'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot, kid, I drop bombs
I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty
I baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news
I'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews
Death on the phono, my skills are porno
You say "Oh, no!," you bitch-ass homo
I bag up waste, electrifyin', I'm prime-time
I slaughter slime, I'm the greatest of all time
Sick-ass brother, nasty-ass nigga
Pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it! Kick the can
(Say what?! Say what?!) I'm a bad, bad man!

Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip
Punchin' out hits like Gladys Knight and The Pips
The Five-Foot Assassin has just raided your area
Your booty rhymes are wack, and that's the reason I ain't hearin' ya
(So!) Roll out the red carpet 'cause I'm gettin' this
Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous
Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew
And to you other sellouts — oh yeah, F you too
And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to
You're better off callin' D-Nice to your rescue
Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around
As for corny MC's, like Chuck D, I Shut 'Em Down
The Artical Don of hip-hop, and I won't stop
The Five-Foot Assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop
So do like Michael Jackson and "Remember the Time"
(Do you remember?)
Put on your dancin' shoes or somethin', 'cause you sure can't rhyme
You might also like
(Big up! Big up!) Enter new identity
Next to say somethin' 'cause you pass it to me
What does it take to check a technique? (Many styles, many styles!)
Hostile heat brings bursts of energy
Milo In De Dance is the new identity
One-two mic check
Select for the ruffnecks that tend to wander, I come (Correct!)
In my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots
So I can grow dreadlocks
Maintain the rock! (Don't stop the rock!)
Maintain the rock! (Don't stop the rock!)
Kickin' right inna your what's it not
I could rock longer, but fair is fair
So C. Brown, are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)
C. Brown, are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)

Makin' moves, y'all (Moves, y'all!) On and on and on
(Check it, check it out!!) To the break of, break of dawn
(Who's that?!) Just one of the L.O.N.S
And A Tribe Called Quest (East Coast!) to West
Remix mad kick, more than Metallica
To all MC's fall like the Battlestar Galactica
Stampin', stompin', rompin' Compton
(People all over the world!) I'm promptin' (Style!)
Pick a style, any style, Strong Isle
Representation, sensationalization
"Scenario" for the radio, 'BLS and KISS, so
(Here we go, yo!) Yeaaah!
Force, Main Source LP on the rise
In livin' color, let's see through original eyes
And I'm out like shout, ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh!
(Ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh!) There it is, baby pah!
Flyin' in on a limb, slim trim, D I am
There I am (There I am!) Don't run from a grim
Sike! We be right, be polite for my mics
Like I'm like (See sick! See syke!)
And slip away, and off to the Poconos
Spot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose
Yamaha (Ay-Ha-May!)
Let's flip the funk, now it all spells (Hey!)
Enough, enough, Ms. Fitted, I'm wit' it
If I did it, I was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it
'Cause yo, my vocal status at Knight's like the Gladys
Bed rest, spread test, and yo, I'm like the maddest
Male, not female, hail from Uniondale
Bounce the b-ball, 'cause beats are bein' yelled
In the hallways, always ringin' with a (Ho!)
This is my two-times-nine on the Scenario

Check it out, everybody — rhymes and mics
Black mens gettin' loot (Doin' what they like!)
Eight black brothers in the public eye
If you listen very close, I will tell you why
(Hood!) Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown
Shaheed, myself, and Busta Bust Down
Will commence to rock (Rock!), so bring on the flocks (Flock!)
Interrogation for the knockin' of the box
The boom-box ruler controls the medulla
None come cooler, I win like Shula
So bust out the move as you start to pursue her
Intensified mind, non-blunt consumer
Tip will come booty (Well, it's only a rumor!)
The meaning's so deep that it starts brain tumors (Tumors!)
Peace to Hood, baby, from the midnight crooner
Smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner
Hey! What we gon' do (Dooo) in '92?
Even though we had fun (Fuuun) in '91
Wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down
Ponna ponna! New sound leavin' cracks in the ground
What's goin' on, my man? Goddamn! And now my brain is hurtin'
Listen up — Busta, rhythm will hit 'em then I get 'em
Flip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em
Open up your mouth if you want the food
To get rude, Flipmode, 'cause I'm in the mood
Ah-heh, ah-heh! Yeah, man, that's how it goes
Body drippin' with blood comin' out your nose
Give me a Band-Aid, what are you askin' for?
(More!) Only your sacred and pure
Adverse, Zig-Zag, check it and the Busta new rap
Rap, Busta Rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes
Yeah y'all, in '92, I'm packin' my roach spray (Anyway!)
Take a lick, Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School
Mad brother when stealthy
RRRAAAOW! RRAOW! RRAOW!
To my dragon, baby, stop whinin'
I see my influence still shinin'
More crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo
That's the Scenario!Embed

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda, or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah (huh), so whom shall I fear? (Word)
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare (uh)
So jet to the store, and buy the LP (yeah)
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged (huh?) by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too (ha-ha)
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers (Yeah)
So the new shit can rock (uh), from Bronx to Massapequa (uh)
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew (yeah), and peace to this crew (Yeah)
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask
("What's, wrong?") Now check it out

All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop

FADE IN: EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT
MONDAY 9:37 P.M.
Minutes after the assassination attempt, several limousines are driving down the bridge, heading back to the White House. Sirens are heard everywhere.
MAN 
We have no idea on the sweep of the perimeter at this time. We have no idea...
CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
President Bartlet and Special Agent Ron Butterfield are inside the moving limo.
RON
Zoey's secure.
BARTLET
Get her again.
RON
She wasn't hit sir. She's...
BARTLET
Get her on the radio, please!
RON
Sir, she can't talk right now.
BARTLET
Why can't she talk?
RON
She's vomiting in the car.
BARTLET
Why the hell?
RON
It happens, sir, we'll...
BARTLET
Why is she vomiting?
RON
It happens.  It could be shock.
BARTLET
Ron...
RON
She might have got an elbow on the stomach...
BARTLET
Is Gina with her?
RON
Gina put her in the car.
BARTLET
She's not with her?
RON
She's got two other agents in the car. She's got Mike and Fred, sir. They're going to have her back in the White House.
BARTLET
Why isn't Gina in the car?
RON
Gina put Zoey in the car then stayed behind for the ID agent. Mr. President, please.
Bartlet sighs and gasps for breath.
BARTLET
Is anybody dead back there?
RON
We don't know, we don't think so.
We see Ron's bloody hand, wrapped with some bandage.
BARTLET
What happened to your hand?!
RON
I got hit.
BARTLET
Oh God.  Coop, turn around, we gotta go to the hospital.
RON
We got to get you to the White House.
BARTLET
We're going to the hospital! Let's go!
RON
I have to put you inside the White House, Mr. President. This isn't something we discuss.
BARTLET
This is... my daughter is throwing up on the floor in the car behind us. You're losing blood by the liter, not to mention how many broken bones you got in your hand, but let's make sure that I'm tucked in bed before we do anything...
Blood has started coming out of the President's mouth.
RON
Mr. President?
Ron quickly checks the President for a possible injury. He feels blood near Bartlet's stomach.
RON
G.W.! Blue! Blue! Blue!
The limousine makes a quick 180-degree turn.
CUT TO: INT. THE NEWSEUM PARKING AREA - NIGHT
We hear sirens everywhere. The place is full of policemen, agents, paramedics and the people from the ropeline.
MEDIC 1
Left thigh, nerovasc intact.
MEDIC 2
She's stable. Give me some 4 by 4's.
Two medics are attending to C.J., who is obviously hurt and has her hand on her head.
C.J.
I'm really fine.
MEDIC 3
Scalp laceration, secondary to fall. 
C.J.
I hit my head on the ground.
MEDIC 4
No LOC?
C.J.
Somebody pulled me down.
MEDIC 4
Are you C.J. Cregg?
C.J.
Yeah!
MEDIC 4
Can you tell me what day it is?
C.J.
It's still Monday.
MEDIC 4
Ok, C.J., you're more shaken up than anything else, I don't think you're going to need stitches but you should find some place to lie down.
C.J.
Is the President dead?
MEDIC 4
I wouldn't know anything about that.
The medic has left. C.J. walks around a police car. She notices the glass door broken. From behind, Sam approaches.
SAM
You all right?
C.J.
What?
SAM
Are you all right?
C.J.
Yeah, where's the President?
SAM
He's on the way back to the White House, so is Zoey, they just put Leo in the car, you all right?
C.J.
Somebody pulled me down.
Gina runs by.
SAM
Gina?
GINA
I can't talk right now.
Gina approaches an agent.
GINA
Gina Toscano.
TOMMY CHO
Tommy Cho.
GINA
Are you the I.D. agent?
CHO
Yeah.
GINA
Two shooters in that window, we got them both from the roof, but there was a signal.
CHO
There was somebody on the ground?
GINA
White male, 20, 25, maybe 5-10.
CHO
What else?
GINA
He was wearing a baseball cap.
CHO
What kind of cap?
GINA
Maybe it got knocked off from the crowd.
CHO
What kind of cap?!
GINA
I don't know.
CHO
 Fix the perimeter, close the airports, shut them down, I want the Harbor Patrol and the Coast Guard.
AGENT
You got it.
MAN
Stevie! Paul!
Somewhere near, Toby is looking around for Josh.
TOBY
Josh! Josh!
He spots Charlie.
TOBY
Hey, Charlie, are you okay?
CHARLIE
Yeah.
TOBY
Have you seen Josh?
CHARLIE
He got in the car with Leo.
TOBY
No, he didn't. Shanahan got in with Leo. Josh didn't get in the car.
They part ways. A woman shouts somewhere.
WOMAN
Can we get some help?
TOBY
Yeah. Stay right there.
Toby continues to look around for Josh. He spots the back of his head behind a ledge, away from everyone else. He was sitting beside it. Toby runs to him.
TOBY
Josh! Didn't you hear me shouting for you? I didn't know where the hell you...
As Toby faces his friend, Josh stares at him, gasping for breath, while holding his
stomach. A huge amount of blood has come out from his chest, to his shirt and all over his hands. Toby's face changes.
TOBY
I need a... I need a doctor! I need help!
C.J. and Sam heard him and starts to run towards them. Josh suddenly slumps over, his bloody hands still on his gunshot wound.
SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE
FADE IN: INT. GEORGE WASHINGTON HOSPITAL - NIGHT
It's a quiet night in the hospital lobby. Several patients are sitting in the waiting section. Two nurses meet.
NURSE 2
Hey.
NURSE 1
Hey. Your best friend's back.
The other nurse looks to the waiting section. She notices a familiar patient.
NURSE 2
Thank you for that.
She walks over to a pregnant woman.
NURSE 2
Cynthia. Hi. You can follow me.
Cynthia and her nurse walk away. We follow the first nurse as she walks to the reception desk. Another nurse comes.
NURSE 1
She's been in twice a week for the last three weeks because she can't feel the baby kick. I should just tell her ma'am, wait till eight months, the kid'll be doing the Macarena.
In the meantime, this is an emergency room.
NURSE 3
Did you really say that?
NURSE 1
No, I'm saying I should've said that.
The other nurse walks away as a phone rings. The first nurse answers the local phone in the desk.
NURSE 1
Emergency room.
Nobody there. Another phone continues to ring. The nurse hangs up and quietly answers a red phone attached to the wall.
NURSE 1
Station One.
CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet is now gasping for breath. Ron is shouting on the phone.
RON
We're coming in!
NURSE 1 
I copy that. Is this a drill?
RON
No!
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
Sirens are heard from a distance.
NURSE 1
 The thing is I have a few patients, not many but I do have a couple of kids
with alcohol poisoning. We're expecting more in a bit, so if this is a drill, I'd just as soon ...
The sirens get louder. The nurse looks to the entranceway where several cars and ambulances have already arrived. She hangs up the red phone and picks up the local phone. She punches a button for the P.A.
NURSE 1
Trauma One. Trauma One, Blue! Blue! Trauma One, Blue! Go!
Nurses and doctors around her start to get busy. A Secret Service Agent enters and approaches the nurse.
AGENT 1
You got priorities?
NURSE 1
No priorities.
AGENT 1
We're gonna need a hand. They're going to the memorial.
The nurse turns to the waiting patients.
NURSE 1
Okay, people. I need you to follow this man to the van that's waiting...
The patients hurry outside as we follow two agents.
AGENT 2
Get the south side clear. There are two backdoors and a loading dock. Put two units in the scaffolding, and get some light out there!
The agent comes in a room as DR. KELLER comes out.
DR. KELLER
Get me an ultrasound and a crash cart.
We close in on another agent.
AGENT 3
Eagle's two minutes away!
CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT
Reporters surround Vice President Hoynes in the lobby. He is holding a jersey while posing for the cameras.
CAMERAMAN
Mr. Vice President, could you hold the shirt up a little bit?
HOYNES
Yeah, one of my roommates at S.M.U. was Drew Harper. Anybody know that name?
WOMAN
'72?
HOYNES
'72 Olympics in Munich. Well, I played against him at a pick-up game while on the quad, and I thought I'd stuff him with an overhead slam. He sent that ball back at my face like I talked about his sister.
The reporters laugh. Hoynes approaches a man and shakes his hand.
HOYNES
Coach, I want to congratulate you and your team in the NCAA on a great season last year. I know you had four starters returning so I'm confident...
Several Secret Service Agents come storming inside. Hoynes gets worried.
AGENT
Excuse me! Everyone stay where you are. Mr. Vice President, would you come with us please?
The agents surround Hoynes and escort him outside as the reporters stand puzzled.
CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT
Agents cut in a hallway and meet with Abbey, who is rushing down the hall also with other agents.
AGENT 1
Mrs. Bartlet.
ABBEY
Is he conscious?
AGENT 2
He's conscious and they're moving him to pre-op. He was hit in the side, entry and exit.
They go outside, where a car is waiting.
AGENT 2
We're on our way.
ABBEY
What about Zoey?
AGENT 1
They got her in the car. She's cool. She's on her way to G.W.
AGENT 2
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
The cars screech as they drive away.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Nurses and paramedics are hurriedly pushing a gurney carrying President Bartlet. We see blood on the side of the his shirt as he groans and tries to catch his breath. Ron is nearby.
NURSE 1
He was shot in the abdomen. It's an entry and exit wound.
NURSE 2
B.P. 134 over 78. Pulse is 108. What's his pulse ox?
PARAMEDIC
98.
Dr. Keller tries to talk to the President.
DR. KELLER
Mr. President, I'm Dr. Keller. I'm the trauma surgeon on duty. The exit wound is a good indication we like your vital signs.
BARTLET
I swear to God if I don't speak to my daughter in the next five minutes, I'm gonna attack someone.
RON
She's on her way.
They enter a trauma room.
BARTLET
 This guy's got about seven broken bones in his hand, by the way. If somebody wants to give him an aspirin or something...
NURSE
We're there.
The gurney is stopped, and the nurses and doctors hurriedly prepare for the treatment.
DR. KELLER
Okay, sir, we're just gonna get you stabilized.
BARTLET
Listen, I want you to wait as long as you can before you give me the anesthesia. I need to speak to Leo McGarry before you give me the anesthesia.
RON
He's on his way as well.
NURSE
I need to ask you some questions, sir. Do you have any medical conditions?
BARTLET
Well... I've been shot.
CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
It's a quiet night in the West Wing as Margaret and Mrs. Landingham meet in the hallway.
MARGARET
Good evening, Mrs. Landingham.
MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good evening, Margaret.
MARGARET
The President's not back yet?
MRS. LANDINGHAM
I imagine he's schmoozing the rope line.
They enter the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Margaret immediately notices a SPECIAL REPORT on the television screen.
MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know, he said he's coming straight back, but he can't resist a ropeline. Never has.
Oh, he'll complain, but he just can't resist it. I remember a time in the Governor's mansion. It was about ten years ago...
MARGARET
 Mrs. Landingham.
MRS. LANDINGHAM
More. Maybe 12.
MARGARET
Mrs. Landingham!
Margaret turns up the volume as Mrs. Landingham watches with her. A newscaster appears on the monitor.
NEWSCASTER
Good evening. We are getting reports that multiple gunshots were fired at President Bartlet as he was leaving a public event in Rosslyn, Virginia. The shots were fired approximately seven minutes ago...
Mrs. Landingham runs out of the office before the newscaster could finish.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
Zoey walks inside and sees her father in pain. A look of fear is on her face. The nurses are still very busy.
ZOEY
Dad?
BARTLET
I'm okay.
ZOEY
Daddy?!
BARTLET
They didn't hit anything. They're just gonna look around and make sure.
ZOEY
Are you-- are you in a lot of pain?
BARTLET
No.
ZOEY
Are you lying?
BARTLET
Yeah, 'cause I want these guys to tell reporters that I was brave and joking around.
ZOEY
You are brave. You were so good tonight, dad.
BARTLET
 Honey, I'm fine. I'm just so happy to see you.
ZOEY
Mom's on her way.
BARTLET
Mom's gonna be pretty pissed.
ZOEY
Yeah.
All of a sudden, Leo comes storming in the trauma room, a troubling look in his face as he looks at Bartlet. He notices Zoey beside him.
LEO
How you doing, kid?
ZOEY
I'm fine.
BARTLET
She booted all over the back of her car. You know they're gonna bill me for that.
LEO
Yeah.
BARTLET
Honey, do me a favor, will you?
ZOEY
Yeah. I'll step outside. I'll go wait for mom.
BARTLET
Tell her not to frighten the doctors. I'll see you in a couple hours.
ZOEY
I love you.
BARTLET
I love you too, hon.
Zoey exits. Leo walks closer to Bartlet.
BARTLET
Anybody killed back there?
LEO
The two shooters. They got them through the window.
BARTLET
Anybody in the crowd?
LEO
There were some injuries. They're coming right now.
BARTLET
What about our people?
LEO
C.J. hit her head on the ground, but other than that...
BARTLET
 Get the cabinet together and the Security Council. Tell Jerome to suspend trading on the stock exchange.
LEO
Yeah.
BARTLET
Do we know who the shooters were?
LEO
No.
BARTLET
I'm gonna be under anesthesia for a couple hours.
LEO
It'll be fine.
BARTLET
You know what I'm talking about, right?
LEO
I'll talk to Abbey.
DR. KELLER
Sir, it's time.
BARTLET
 Hey. Come here.
He motions for Leo to come closer. Leo leans his head near him. Bartlet, looking to comfort his best friend, kisses Leo gently on the cheek.
BARTLET
It's okay.
LEO
I'll see you in a few hours, Mr. President.
Bartlet sighs as Leo exits.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL LOBBY - NIGHT
Zoey is talking to a woman.
WOMAN
Okay, Zoey. I'll find out.
The woman leaves. Abbey comes running inside and sees her daughter.
ABBEY
Oh. You all right?
ZOEY
Yeah.
They hug tight.
ZOEY
And Dad's making jokes.
ABBEY
Good ones, or...?
ZOEY
No.
ABBEY
Okay.
Leo approaches, along with Dr. Keller.
LEO
Abbey. This is Dr. Keller.
ABBEY
Oh, yes. We spoke in the car.
DR. KELLER
Hello.
ABBEY
What's his PO2?
DR. KELLER
It's good. It's a hundred.
ABBEY
You're gonna do a laperoscopy?
DR. KELLER
Yeah. We want to make sure the peritoneum's intact.
ABBEY
Mm-hmm. Who's the anesthesiologist?
DR. KELLER
Dr. Lee.
ABBEY
 You'll be okay honey?
ZOEY
Yeah.
Abbey walks away.
CUT TO: INT. TRAUMA ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Just outside Bartlet's trauma room. DR. LEE is standing. Abbey approaches him.
ABBEY
Dr. Lee?
DR. LEE
Dr. Bartlet. I hope they told you that it's looking very good.
ABBEY
There are 14 people in the world who know this, including the vice President, the chief of staff, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. You are going to be the fifteenth. Seven years ago, my husband was diagnosed with a relapsing/remitting course
of M.S. When all this is over, tell the press, don't tell the press. It's entirely up to you.
Abbey immediately exits.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Leo is strolling along the busy hospital. He spots Gina standing by a doorway. He puts his arm up and leans it in the wall.
LEO
You all right?
GINA
Yeah.
LEO
Was there someone on the ground?
GINA
There was a signal. I couldn't give a description.
LEO
Did they close the airports?
GINA
And Union Station. We've got troopers on the bridges and 300 field agents working Rosslyn. I can't tell them what they're looking for.
A faint sound of a siren is heard.
LEO
You got the girl in the car, Gina.
GINA
It's right in front of my face.
LEO
Look...
The sirens get louder as paramedics and nurses comes in the hospital with another patient.
NURSE
Gunshot wound! No exit!
PARAMEDIC
He's got decreased breath sounds in the left. Pulse ox is 92 on 15 liters.
Leo comes running out the door with several nurses. C.J. and Toby are running beside the gurney.
C.J.
It's Josh!
NURSE
I've got the hemocue.
LEO
Josh!
PARAMEDIC
Trauma panel, serial crits...
LEO
What happened?
TOBY
He was behind us.
PARAMEDIC
Single gunshot wound, left fifth intercostal space.
We hear Sam somewhere.
SAM
Josh, I'm here!
Josh has an oxygen mask in his mouth. He speaks groggily.
JOSH
I shouldn't be at this meeting.
NURSE
Trauma One's ready.
DOCTOR
I need a chest tube tray, 32 French.
JOSH
Senator...
LEO
Tell me what's happening!
DOCTOR
I don't have time!
They come inside TRAUMA ONE.
JOSH
I shouldn't be at this meeting.
NURSE
Pulse ox, 88.
JOSH
I need to get to New Hampshire.
Sam is now beside Josh.
SAM
You went to New Hampshire. We both did. You came and got me.
DOCTOR
On my count. One. Two. Three!
We see an OVERHEAD SHOT of Josh being lifted onto another bed. Everything around him switches into SLOW MOTION.
DOCTOR
Josh, a bullet collapsed your lung. We're putting in a tube to re-expand it.
NURSE 1
We've got blood in the theroseal.
NURSE 2
Over a liter and out.
NURSE 1
He's bradying down.
DOCTOR
Okay, tube him now.
NURSE 1
80 E.T. Tube?
A FAINT VOICE 
Social Security...
DOCTOR
Cricoid Pressure...
ANOTHER VOICE 
Senator.
As Josh loses consciousness in the trauma room, we --
FADE TO WHITE.
We find out that the voices are from Josh and Hoynes.
HOYNES 
Social Security is...
JOSH 
Senator.
HOYNES 
Social Security is the black hole...
JOSH 
Senator.
HOYNES 
Social Security--
JOSH 
Senator.
HOYNES 
Social Security--
JOSH 
Sir.
FADE IN: INT. THE SENATE BUILDING, A CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
An OVERHEAD SHOT from the chandelier in a conference room. Scanning the crowd, Senator John Hoynes of Texas holds a meeting with his staff, including Josh, from THREE YEARS EARLIER.
HOYNES
Social Security is the black hole of national politics.
JOSH
Yes.
HOYNES
Josh was cutting me off because he knew I was gonna say that. He knew I was gonna say that because I have said it, what?
JOSH
A few hundred times, sir.
HOYNES
It is the black hole of national politics, and I would just assume not get lost in it 13 weeks before the New Hampshire primary. It is the third rail. You step on it, and you die.

JOSH
Of the 537 federal election officials, there are 30 who put their names on Social Security reform legislation, and you're one of them. Why not say so?
MARK
He will say so. Just not now.
JOSH
Mark, 400 billion dollars. Social Security represents one-fourth of the federal budget, and it's gonna be bankrupt in exactly 17 years. Right around the time you're going to check your mailbox, half of the elderly population will be living in poverty. This now, qualifies as a priority, and running for President of the United States not putting Social Security front and center is like running for President of the Walt Disney Corporation by saying you're gonna fix the rides at Epcot.
MARK
We're gonna get to Social Security, Josh. It's a long campaign. For now, we focus on the tax cuts.
CANDY
It's what magicians call 'misdirection.'
JOSH
Really? 'Cause it's what the rest of us call bull--
HOYNES
Knock it off! I have a vote.  The rest of you should stay here and work on the ethanol tax credit. Josh, come with me, would you?
CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Hoynes is walking with Josh.
HOYNES
You don't seem to be having a very good time lately.
JOSH
I don't think the point of this is for me to have...
HOYNES
I'm saying you've been pissed off at every meeting for a month.
They stop walking.
JOSH
Senator, you're the prohibitive favorite to be the Democratic Party's nominee for President. You have 58 million dollars in war chest with no end in sight, and... I don't know what we're for.
HOYNES
Josh.
JOSH
I don't know what we're for, and I don't know what we're against. Except we seem to be for winning and against somebody else winning.
HOYNES
It's a start.
JOSH
Senator...
HOYNES
Josh, we are going to run a good campaign. You're gonna be very proud of it. When we get to the White House, you're gonna play a big role. In the meantime, cheer up, and
get off my ass about Social Security. I've got a vote.
Hoynes walks away, leaving Josh in the hallway.
CUT TO: INT. SENATE BUILDING OFFICES - CONTINUOUS
Josh wanders around the place. A familiar voice calls to him -- Leo McGarry.
LEO
Josh.
JOSH
Mr. Secretary!
LEO
I hope you don't mind I didn't make an appointment. I'm trying to fly under the radar a little.
JOSH
Of course, I don't mind, but the senator just went down for the 404 vote.
LEO
It's probably the annual vote override to veto on the resolution to ship nuclear wastes to Nevada.
JOSH
Yeah.
LEO
It won't pass.
JOSH
No kidding.
LEO
Actually, I came to see you.
JOSH
Really?
LEO
Yeah.
JOSH
What can I do for you?
LEO
You mind if we take a walk?
JOSH
Sure.
CUT TO: EXT. THE CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY
Just outside the building, near the Washington Monument, Josh and Leo are walking.
LEO
I heard your dad was in the hospital again.
JOSH
Yeah. They put... they got it all this time.
LEO
Is he taking it easy?
JOSH
No. He goes to the office at seven in the morning and goes home at eight every night. On the weekends, he cleans the gutters and yells at the squirrels.
LEO
Why does he yell at the squirrels?
JOSH
'Cause they eat the seeds out of the bird feeder.
LEO
You know, they make a thing now...
They stop walking.
JOSH
He knows, but he prefers to admonish them. But, listen, I-I need to get back to this meeting.
LEO
Josh, I'd like you to come to Nashua, New Hampshire Thursday night and hear Jed Bartlet speak.
JOSH
I work for Senator Hoynes.
LEO
Yeah.
JOSH
Mr. Secretary...
LEO
I'm not in the Cabinet anymore, Josh. Call me Leo.
JOSH
Look, Hoynes has the nomination sewn up.
LEO
Yeah.
JOSH
And if Bartlet's looking to be Treasury Secretary or a slot at the Convention, this really isn't...
LEO
Come to Nashua Thursday night.
JOSH
Why?
LEO
Because that's what sons do for old friends of their fathers. 
JOSH
Mr. Secretary...
LEO
Leo. 
JOSH
Leo, the-the Democrats aren't gonna nominate another liberal academic former governor from New England. I mean, we're dumb, but we're not that dumb.
LEO
 Nah. I think we're exactly that dumb.
Leo heads on his way, leaving Josh puzzled. After a moment, Josh pulls out his cell phone and dials a number as he walks up the stairs of the Capitol Building.
JOSH
 Yeah, uh, Janet. Uh, I need you to set up some plane tickets to New York. Uh, probably to Boston too...
The camera PANS UP to the top of the Capitol Building.
FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
FADE IN: INT. A LAW FIRM - DAY
	GAGE WHITNEY PACE
	MIDTOWN MANHATTAN
	THREE YEARS EARLIER
Sam is in a meeting with several lawyers, including his boss MR. GAGE,
MR. LOCH and
MR. CAMERON.
MR. GAGE 
All in, showroom floor to your garage, 18 million dollars.
MR. CAMERON
18 million dollars is a cheap price, isn't it?
MR. GAGE
Yes, it is. What you're happy about isn't the price. It's the structure of the deal.
MR. CAMERON
Well, how do you figure that?
MR. GAGE
Sam's going to tell you about it. Sam.
Sam looks up quickly.
SAM
Hmm?
MR. GAGE
Structure versus cost?
SAM
Uh, yeah. What Jack means is, if you were getting the tankers for a buck 85 and trading stamps it would still be a bad deal if we didn't limit your liability.
MR. CAMERON
And you did that?
SAM
We did.
MR. CAMERON
How?
SAM
The same way we do with any other asset acquisition. Create a separate corporation for each one of them, then mortgage the boats, top to bottom.
MR. CAMERON
Ships.
SAM
I'm sorry?
MR. CAMERON
Oil tankers aren't boats, they're ships.
SAM
Mr. Cameron, you want me to buy the boats, you're not asking me to be the first mate, right?
MR. CAMERON
No.
SAM
You want to finance the tankers a hundred percent so that if litigation does penetrate the liability shield we've set up for you there are no real assets at the end of the line, just debt. You're judgment proof. Let me run back to my office and get the tax figures while David and Rita talk about IMO regulations. 
CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Sam walks by the corridor where a secretary meets him.
SECRETARY
Sam. There's a guy waiting in your office who said he's a friend of yours.
SAM
What's his name?
SECRETARY
Josh Lyman?
SAM
 Seriously?
SECRETARY
Yeah.
Sam enters his office, where Josh is standing.
SAM
Hey!
JOSH
How you doing?
They hug.
SAM
Hey, you look fit.
JOSH
You made partner?
SAM
Next month. Listen, I'm hungry. You want to go grab a hot dog or something?
JOSH
It's 9:30 in the morning.
SAM
Yeah, they'll be fresh. Come on.
JOSH
Okay.
CUT TO: INT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY
Sam and Josh are walking away from a hot dog stand.
JOSH
Yeah, I was going to call before I came here, but then the strangest thing
happened.
Sam throws out his hot dog wrapper.
SAM
What?
JOSH
I forgot the name of your firm.
SAM
Gage Whitney.
JOSH
Yeah.
SAM
You couldn't remember Gage Whitney.
JOSH
I know.
SAM
Second biggest firm in New York?
JOSH
I know.
SAM
Did the Shearson deal--
JOSH
Yeah.
SAM
Bought Transcom.
JOSH
I really do know Gage Whitney. I'm saying, I'm just, um, I'm um, having a brain problem.
SAM
What are you doing in town?
JOSH
I'm on my way to Nashua.
SAM
What's in Nashua?
JOSH
Ah, a waste of time. Listen. You know why I'm here.
SAM
You want me to quit my job and come work for Hoynes?
JOSH
He's gonna win, Sam.
SAM
So what do you need me for?
JOSH
A better campaign. Come do some speech writing.
SAM
Lisa and I are getting married in September.
They stop.
JOSH
 Ah.
SAM
 Yeah.
JOSH
Okay. Listen, I should go, I got to go. I should let you--
SAM
I got to get back to this thing.
JOSH
It's good seeing you.
SAM
It's good seeing you. I miss you.
They start to walk in separate directions.
JOSH
Hey, congratulations on that partnership.
SAM
Josh!
They turn and face each other.
SAM
Hoynes. He's not the real thing, is he?
JOSH
See, that-the thing you gotta know about Hoynes is-- 
SAM
It's okay.
JOSH
I-I'm saying--
SAM
Josh.  What are you doing?
JOSH
I don't know. What are you doing?
SAM
Protecting oil companies from litigation.
Josh nods.
SAM
They're our client. They don't lose legal protection because they make a lot of money.
JOSH
I can't believe no one ever wrote a folk song about that.
Sam grins.
JOSH
If I see the real thing in Nashua, should I tell you about it?
SAM
You won't have to.
JOSH
Why?
SAM
You've got a pretty bad poker face.
JOSH
Okay.  Take it easy.
SAM
Okay.
Sam turns around and plows into a woman before we--
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL - PRESENT
Sam has just rammed into a nurse.
SAM
I'm sorry.
NURSE
That's okay.
SAM
I'm sorry. It's just--
A man in a suit, who we'll assume is a doctor, approaches Abbey.
DOCTOR
Dr. Bartlet.
<><>
ABBEY
Yes.
DOCTOR
The President's going to be fine.
ABBEY
Oh. 
DOCTOR
You can see him in the recovery room in about two hours.
The two of them start walking.
ABBEY
Thank you. No organ damage?
DOCTOR
No ma'am, and blood loss was minimal. Dr. Keller was able to visualize the entire abdomen, and he's secure with the diagnostic of the laparoscopy.
Abbey stops and turns.
ABBEY
What about Josh?
DOCTOR
The bullet lacerated his pulmonary artery.
ABBEY
Can they try a Gortex graft?
DOCTOR
No. They're going to have to stay in and try to repair the artery primarily.
ABBEY
Thank you.
Abbey enters the waiting room and addresses everyone inside.
ABBEY
The President's going to be fine. The bullet seems to have gone out of it's way not to hit anything. Now, here's what's happening with Josh...
A Secret Service Agent closes the door to the waiting room.
CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Leo and a man in uniform, Jack, are on a TV monitor starting to enter the room.
LEO
Thank you.
JACK
What do you know?
LEO
He'll be out of surgery in about two hours. Fitzwallace is on a plane?
JACK
He was on his way to Manila. They turned around, and he'll be back in about four hours.
LEO
We've got him by phone?
JACK
Yeah.
They enter the situation room full of busy military men.
LEO
Good evening.
MILITARY MEN
Good evening, Mr. McGarry.
LEO
Where's the National Security Advisor?
JACK
She's on her way. So's the Vice President.
NANCY McNALLY, the National Security Advisor, enters, wearing a gold evening gown.
NANCY McNALLY
Good evening everybody. Mike, could you have somebody send over some clothes from my office, please? I look like an idiot.
MIKE
Yes ma'am.
Nancy sits down.
LEO
Nancy, you've seen the KH-10 pictures?
NANCY
Yeah.
LEO
And you know what they mean?
NANCY
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Hoynes enters the room.
NANCY
Good evening, Mr. Vice President.
HOYNES
Good evening Nancy. Leo.
LEO
Jack.
Hoynes pauses at the head of the table.
JACK
Ten Hut!
Hoynes looks up, a little surprised as the people in the room stand.
HOYNES
No, as you were. It's-it's okay.  Bobby, your report on domestic activity?
BOBBY
Yes, sir. There's not much. Air traffic control was down for 22 minutes at Logan. City bank computers were off-line for a little more than an hour, and the lights went out for seven minutes at the Delta Center.
HOYNES
Somebody tell me-these shooters, they didn't have a wallet on them? They didn't have a driver's license?
ARMY MAN
They didn't have anything on them, Mr. Vice President. They knew we were
gonna get them
through the window.
HOYNES
If this signal guy isn't in custody in one hour, I'm going to federalize the Virginia and Maryland National Guards.
NANCY
It's worth mentioning that at this moment we do not know the whereabouts of about a half dozen cell leaders, including bin Laden, but that's not my concern right now.
HOYNES
What is your concern?
NANCY
Can we look at the KH-10's?
LEO
I've seen them. I'm not worried about it.
NANCY
Leo, these images show a sudden build-up of front-line Republican guard units along the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers.
LEO
The build-up isn't sudden. They do it every couple of months.
NANCY
And they're moving south. Now thirteen hours ago they shot down an F-117 in the No-Fly. The rescue mission invaded their airspace with armed M-50 Pave Hawks. And my
recommendation would be that the President order Fitzwallace to put the 32nd tactical on ready alert and take us to Defcon 4.
LEO
The President is under general anesthesia right now. If he weren't I'm sure he'd be comforted to know that RDF can put Marines on the ground in 36 hours.
NANCY
We may not have 36 hours.
LEO
The Iraqi Republican guard can't find their car keys in 36 hours.
NANCY
Look at the pictures, Mr. Vice-President. I think they've found 'em.
Hoynes pauses for several moments.
HOYNES
Nancy, we're gonna follow Leo for the moment.
LEO
Jack, what's the best way to get a message to Iraq?
JACK
The king of Jordan.
LEO
All right.
ARMY MAN
Leo. What do you want the message to be?
LEO<>
Don't mess with us tonight.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
The same doctor enters the waiting room where Sam, Toby, C.J., Charlie and the rest of the staff are waiting.
DOCTOR
Uh, excuse me.
Everyone looks up.
DOCTOR
We can't make you very comfortable here, and Josh's procedure is likely to take 12 to 14 hours. So--
Donna enters the room.
DONNA
I'm sorry, they told me I should come back here? I'm sorry. Is there word on the President?
C.J.
The President's going to be fine.
DONNA
Oh, thank God.  Oh, thank God, that's the best news I've ever heard. I got here as fast as I could. I had a hard time getting in. I had-I had to find an agent who knew me,
and I was shaking. I was just -- I didn't know--
TOBY<>
Donna.  Josh was hit.
DONNA
Hit with what?
TOBY
He was shot--in the chest.
C.J.
He's in surgery right now.
DONNA
I don't understand. I don't understand, is -- is it serious?
TOBY
Yes, it's critical. The bullet collapsed his lung and damaged a major artery.
Donna looks very shocked.
DOCTOR
I was just saying, we can't make you very comfortable here, and the procedure's likely to take 12 to 14 hours. We won't know anything until morning. I'm sure there are things
you're supposed to be attending to right now, so if you like we can stay in contact with your homes and offices throughout the night.
As the doctor exits, Donna sinks into a chair and stares into
space. C.J. begins to rub her back. Sam tears a piece of paper out of his notebook hands it to C.J.
C.J.
Leo's gonna meet with the leadership in ten minutes. When he's done, I'll talk to the press.
CHARLIE
I'm gonna go back to the residence and pick up some things for the President.
Charlie and C.J. stand up and exit the room. Donna is still sitting and staring into space.
FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO
* * *
ACT THREE
FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT
C.J is doing a briefing, but she looks somewhat dazed, like she's still in shock.
REPORTERS
C.J.!
C.J.
Yeah.
REPORTER 1
When can we talk to the medical team?
C.J.
Dr. Keller, the head surgeon, and Admiral Jarvis, the President's personal physician,
will be debriefing you in a few hours.
REPORTERS
C.J.!
C.J.
Danny!
DANNY
Has there been any discussion of the 25th amendment?
C.J.
No--
REPORTERS
C.J.!
DANNY
 Why not?
C.J.
What?
DANNY
Why hasn't there been any discussion of the 25th amendment?
C.J.
I'll get back to you on that.
REPORTERS
C.J.!
REPORTER 2
Do you have anything on the identity of the shooters?
C.J.
I'm sorry?
REPORTER 2
Do you have anything on the identity of the shooters?
C.J.
No.
REPORTER 2
Are you aware that the AP has been saying that two bodies were brought out of the building?
C.J.
I don't have anything for you on that.
REPORTER 2
Are you also aware that the AP is also saying there is now a massive manhunt underway for a suspected third accomplice?
C.J.
I don't have anything for you on that either.
REPORTERS
C.J.!
REPORTER 3
Why does the AP know more than you do?
C.J.
I don't believe the AP knows more than I do; I just believe they're willing to tell you more.
Carol leans over and tells C.J. something.
C.J.
One more question!
REPORTERS
C.J.!
C.J.
Arthur!
ARTHUR
In previous administrations the President entered and exited buildings under a tent or canopy, the Secret Service wanting to limit visibility in the open air. Can you tell me why these precautions weren't taken for President Bartlet or at least not
tonight?
C.J.
It's policy not to comment on security procedures.
ARTHUR
Well, C.J., if you can't answer the most straightforward question then what can you tell us?
C.J.
I'm sorry?
ARTHUR
What do you know? What can you tell us?
C.J. has her hand on her neck and looks dazed.
C.J.
 There'll be another briefing in an hour and a half. Hopefully we'll know more then.
The reporters groan as she announces this, and some try calling her.
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
C.J. and Carol are walking down the hall towards C.J.'s office.
C.J.
 What's that supposed to mean since you can't answer my question?
CAROL
You scratched your neck.
C.J.
What?
CAROL
You have scratch on the side of your neck.
C.J.
I lost my necklace. It must have come off when.
CAROL
When what?
C.J.
Somebody pushed me down.
Danny comes up behind them as they turn the corner into a HALLWAY.
DANNY
C.J.?
Carol heads off while Danny and C.J. walk through the communications area still towards her office.
C.J.
What?
DANNY
I'm sorry, I don't want to be a reporter for a few minutes but you've gotta answer my question.
C.J.
What was the question?
DANNY
The President's been under anesthetic for more than an hour. He's probably gonna be on a morphine drip. Without the 25th, who's in charge?
C.J.
The Vice President, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Secretary of Defense, one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House Chief of Staff.
DANNY
You just listed six people! Who's in charge?
C.J.
The Canadiens.
DANNY
C.J....
C.J.
You understand I'm talking about the hockey team.
DANNY
Look.
C.J.
Just... give me a little time.
Danny nods. C.J. walks away.
CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Nancy and Leo are arguing. C.J. and Toby are with them.
LEO
Fitzwallace agrees with me, Nancy. Upgrade our DefCon posture and the whole world's gonna wake up.
NANCY
The world's already awake Leo! Look at the TV. Look out the window! They had more than one shooter. We think they had a guy on the ground. If they had one, there's no reason to
believe they didn't have more than one. Somebody had to get them into that office. This was not a lonely guy who lived with his cats. There was a plan and one of the things we have to assume is that we're under attack right now.
STAFFER
Which is why the Vice President should order the 32nd tactical on a ready alert and take us to DefCon 4.
LEO
Counsel's office isn't sure he can do that.
TOBY
Why not?
LEO
He never signed a letter.
TOBY
What letter?
NANCY
Customarily if the President is going to be under anesthetic.
TOBY
He's gotta sign a letter giving the Vice President power?
NANCY
Absent of the 25th, the Constitution doesn't give it to him unless the President is dead.
TOBY
He's hemorrhaging and he's supposed to draft a memo?
NANCY
Yeah.
C.J.
I'm getting questions from Danny Concannon on it.
NANCY
It gets more complicated if you'd read section 202 the National Securities Act of 1947.
C.J.
Let's assume I haven't.
NANCY
It says the Secretary of Defense will be the principal assistant to the President on all matters relating to national security.
C.J.
And what does 'principal assistant' mean?
NANCY
It doesn't specify.
TOBY
Of course it wouldn't, 'cause that's an area of federal law where he'd want to have as much ambiguity as possible.
NANCY
Yeah.
TOBY
Excuse me. 
C.J.
I'm gonna go back to the hospital.
LEO
I'll be there in a little bit.
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Toby is entering something onto a handheld device as he walks. C.J. catches up with him.
TOBY
Try and hold Danny off for a few hours until the Counsel's office tells us where we are.
C.J.
Okay.
TOBY
You scratched your neck.
C.J.
What?
TOBY
Your neck.
C.J.
Yeah, it's where my necklace. Listen, Toby, I've been getting some questions about the canopy the Secret Service used to use for outdoor entrances and exits.
They stop walking.
TOBY
Who asked you?
C.J.
It was. Arthur Leeds, then a couple of others stopped me.
TOBY
Okay.
They start walking again.
C.J.
We don't comment on security procedures.
TOBY
Yeah.
C.J.
So I don't think I'll have to answer that question.
TOBY
Yeah.
C.J.
Okay.
TOBY
I'll see you at the hospital.
C.J.
Yeah.
C.J. walks away. Toby goes into the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.
TOBY
I need section 202 of the National Securities Act of 1947.
He notices Ginger, who is standing by her desk.
TOBY
Hey Ginger. I didn't know you were here.
GINGER
I just... I turned on the T.V.
Her hands are shaking. She looks very upset and scared.
TOBY
It's okay.  Come here.
He gives her a big hug.
TOBY
It's okay.
GINGER
I'm sorry.
TOBY
You all right?
GINGER
Yeah.
TOBY
Ready to go to work?
GINGER
 Yeah.
Toby enters his office and Ginger goes to a desk.
MAN 
You want another one of those?
TOBY
What?
GINGER
I didn't say anything.
CUT TO: INT. A DARK BAR - DAY
BARTENDER
You want another one of those?
TOBY
Yeah.
	HANK'S TAVERN
	NASHUA, NH
	THREE YEARS EARLIER
Toby and a woman are sitting at the bar. Toby looks pretty drunk and is smoking a cigar. The bartender pours some more of Toby's drink.
WOMAN
I gotta tell you.
TOBY
Yeah.
WOMAN
I didn't even know Bartlet was running.
TOBY
Yeah, we kept that secret pretty good. You know, he's speaking at the VFW hall tonight. You should come.
WOMAN
I'm not very political.
TOBY
There'll be free chicken.
WOMAN
You've been a... um, uh, what did you call it?
TOBY
Professional political operative.
WOMAN
You've been one your whole life.
TOBY
Well, there was a while back there when I was in elementary school.
The woman laughs.
WOMAN
You any good?
TOBY
 Yes, I'm very good.
WOMAN
What's your record?
TOBY
My record?
WOMAN
How many elections have you won?
TOBY
Altogether?
The woman nods.
TOBY
Including city council, two Congressional elections, a senate race, a Gubernatorial campaign, and a national campaign?
There's a long pause.
TOBY
...None.
WOMAN
None of them?
TOBY
You gotta be impressed with my consistency.
WOMAN
So, let me ask you something.
TOBY
Sure.
WOMAN
How come you're drinking so much so early in the day?
TOBY
Cause I'm about to get fired.
Toby finishes his drink, puts some money on the counter, and picks up his
coat.
TOBY
It was nice meeting you. 
FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *
ACT FOUR
FADE IN: INT. VFW HALL - NIGHT
	VFW HALL
	NASHUA, NH
	THREE YEARS EARLIER
Bartlet is speaking. Several people are seated and eating.
BARTLET
...Consumer price index, we tend to be late in responding to these trends, and we get what doctors call a "false positive". The science of economics is a lot less an exact science that we pretend. We build complex models with thousands of
interdependent and independent variables.
Toby is seated near a corner. Another member of Bartlet's staff, CAL MATHIS, approaches.
CAL MATHIS
What's he gonna say?
TOBY
About what?
CAL
If he's asked the question.
TOBY
What question?
CAL
New England D.F.C.
TOBY
I don't know.
CAL
You talked to him, didn't you?
TOBY
Yeah.
CAL
What's he gonna say?
TOBY
I don't know.
CAL
You talked to him about the New England D.F.C. if he's asked?
TOBY
Yes.
CAL
You wrote him a memo.
TOBY
Yes.
CAL
So what's he gonna say?
TOBY
I have no new information since the last time you asked me that question.
Bartlet is now speaking to a woman, who is standing.
BARTLET
Let me put it another way: you and your husband pay $600 more every year than you would if you were unmarried, living together, and filing individually. Couples living outside the covenant of marriage do so.
Josh is in the back of the room, reading a newspaper. Cal and Toby are still talking.
CAL
You told him to go ahead and piss off the dairy farmers, didn't you?
Toby just looks at him.
CAL
If he's asked about the New England D.F.C, you told him to piss off the dairy farmers.
TOBY
I asked him about his vote, he told me, I said then if he's asked about it tonight he should and only because it's the easiest thing to remember, tell the truth.
CAL
Do you enjoy losing?
TOBY
Not that much, but then I haven't had much to compare it to so...
Cal walks off. Bartlet continues talking to the woman.
BARTLET
...which then again is a much larger tax on overstated real profits.
WOMAN
Yes.
BARTLET
You really didn't understand any of that, right?
WOMAN
A little.
BARTLET
Me too. Yeah?
The man who raised his hand stands up.
MAN
Governor Bartlet, when you were a member of Congress, you voted against the New England Dairy Farming Compact. That vote hurt me sir.
Cal looks over at Toby.
MAN
I'm a businessman. That vote hurt me to the tune of maybe, 10 cents a gallon. I voted for you three times for Congress. I voted for you twice for Governor.
We see Josh again, still reading the newspaper.
MAN
And I'm here sir, and I'd like to ask you for an explanation.
BARTLET
 Yeah, I screwed you on that one.
Josh looks up, surprised.
MAN
I'm sorry?
BARTLET
I screwed you. You got hosed.
MAN
Sir, I...
BARTLET
And not just you. A lot of my constituents. I put the hammer to farms in Concord, Salem,
Laconia, and Elem.
Josh looks really shocked and is now watching Bartlet.
BARTLET
You guys got rogered but good.
The man sits down.
BARTLET
Today, for the first time in history, one in five Americans living in poverty are children.
We see a still surprised Josh.
BARTLET
One in five children live in the most abject, dangerous, hopeless, backbreaking, gut wrenching, poverty, one in five, and they're children. If fidelity to freedom and democracy is the code of our civic religion then surely, the code of our humanity is faithful service to that unwritten commandment that says "We shall give our children better than we ourselves had." I voted against the bill 'cause I didn't want it to be
hard for people to buy milk. I stopped some money from flowing into your pocket. If that angers you, if you resent me, I completely respect that, but if you expect anything different from the President of the United States, I suggest you vote for
somebody else. Thanks very much. Hope you enjoyed the chicken.
The audience applauds. Josh claps too.
CUT TO: EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON HOSPITAL - PRESENT
	TUESDAY, 1:45 A.M.
A car drives past.
INT. BARTLET'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Ron opens the door for Leo.
ABBEY
Jed, please. I want you to lie still for a few hours.
LEO
Mr. President?
BARTLET
I wanna see him.
LEO
 Is he okay?
ABBEY
I told him about Josh.
BARTLET
Please. Help me to the door.
LEO
You should stay in bed.
BARTLET
Charlie brought me some clothes. Please let me see him.
Abbey looks at Dr. Keller. He nods.
ABBEY
Okay. Just for a minute.
BARTLET
Great.
He starts to get up.
CUT TO: INT. VFW HALL, NASHUA, N.H. - NIGHT, THREE YEARS EARLIER
After the speech, Leo, Cal, Toby, Bartlet, and the rest of his staff are having a meeting.
BARTLET
What's next?
CAL
The thing about saying the name.
BARTLET
I understand.
JERRY
If I could just reframe the point that Cal was making.
BARTLET
I understand the point that Cal was making. I was sitting next to him when he made it, my ears are connected to my brain just like every body else. And I'm saying what's next?
CAL
Sir, not to put my head in the lion's mouth but by saying the name of your opponent in public you're essentially giving him free advertising.
JERRY
Cal thinks you should start referring to him as "my opponent" or "the other guy"?
CAL
Sir.
BARTLET
You're not afraid he's gonna make me look like I can't remember his name?
JERRY
No.
BARTLET
I am. I think it's going to make me look like I can't remember his name. I think it's going to make me look addled. I think it's going to make me look dotty. And even if it didn't make me look like those things it would remain a stupid idea. What's
next? Nothing? Excellent. 
LEO
Okay, what's next?
CAL
Leo, we have to talk about what happened tonight.
LEO
I think he did well. I would of liked to have seen more of those seats filled.
CAL
That's not what I'm talking about.
LEO
What're you talking about?
TOBY
He's talking about the Governor's answer tonight.
Everybody looks at Toby.
TOBY
I'm just guessing. I'm pretty drunk.
CAL
I am talking about the Governor's answer tonight. But I'm also talking about. Every day there's some. Look, Toby, we can talk about this in the room or if you're more comfortable we can--
LEO
Listen, I don't have time to make people comfortable. If a change has to be made, it has to be made. Jerry, Cal, Mack, Steve -- you're fired.
CAL
What?
TOBY
What?
LEO
No kidding. It's moving day. I want Toby. The rest of you-- thanks very much.
They all stare at Leo.
LEO
Fellas. Look at my face. You're done.
Everyone except Leo and Toby leaves.
LEO
 Don't screw up.
Leo exits. Toby is sitting alone under the light.
CUT TO: EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE THE VFW HALL - NIGHT
Leo joins Bartlet outside.
LEO
Its freezing cold in October! I don't know how you people live here.
BARTLET
Did you just fire Cal Mathis?
LEO
Yeah.
BARTLET
You fired him.
LEO
Yeah, and Jerry, and Mack, and Steve and the other guy.
BARTLET
Is there anyone you kept?
LEO
I kept Toby Ziegler.
BARTLET
Oh, you kept Toby Ziegler, and you fired everyone else.
LEO
Yeah.
BARTLET
Toby Ziegler is the only person working for us I don't know, and he's the one you kept!
LEO
Take him home, would you?
BARTLET
Those were the only people I know.
LEO
Those people were worthless. It's time we bring in what we need.
BARTLET
So you made that decision on your own.
LEO
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you're a crappy politician. I think you'll find I'll be making a lot of decisions on my own so get used to it.
BARTLET
You know I got elected to Congress by this state. This state sent me to Congress three times and elected me Governor all without your help.
LEO starts grinning.
BARTLET
Don't start!
LEO
No, seriously, that's a real political accomplishment, considering that your family founded this state.
BARTLET
Hey.
LEO
Were you even opposed in any of those elections?
BARTLET
You got rid of all the people I know!
LEO
Yeah. Have a good night.
Leo walks off. Bartlet follows.
BARTLET
Why are you doing this? You're a player. You're bigger in the party than I am. Hoynes would make you national chairman. Leo! Tell me this isn't one of the twelve steps.
Leo turns around to face his friend.
LEO
Yeah, that's what it is. Right after admitting we're powerless over alcohol and that a higher power can restore us to sanity, that's where you come in.
BARTLET
Leo.
LEO
Because I'm tired of it year after year after year after year having to chose between the lesser of who cares? Of trying to get myself excited about a candidate who can speak in
complete sentences. Of setting the bar so low, I can hardly look at it. They say a good man can't get elected President. I don't believe that, do you?
BARTLET
And you think I'm that man.
LEO
Yes.
BARTLET
Does it matter that I'm not as sure?
LEO
Nah. Act as if ye have faith and faith shall be given to you. Put it another way, fake it till you make it. You did good tonight.
BARTLET
Yeah.
They start walking again.
LEO
This is the time of Jed Bartlet, old friend. You're gonna open your mouth and lift houses off the ground. Whole houses, clear off the ground...
They continue to walk down the street as we --
FADE TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - PRESENT
Bartlet and Leo are slowly walking down the hospital hall. Music has started, and we hear several news reports.
REPORTER 1 
And it's unknown at this time whether the President before going under anesthesia signed a letter that would give temporary custody.
REPORTER 2
...between George Washington Hospital and the White House where several thousand people have...
A big number of people are gathered in the streets.
REPORTER 3 
...begun to gather behind police barricades. An impromptu TV vigil with prayers being made...
We see Sam in his office, staring at his desk.
REPORTER 3 
...and collective breath being held.
We fade to Toby, in his office, as he puts his hands on his face.
REPORTER 2 
Clearly, I think, and understandably rocked on their heels at this hour, to put it mildly.
We see C.J. in her office, staring into space, her hand scratching her neck.
REPORTER 2 
Press Secretary C.J. Cregg appeared at her briefings to be shaken and withdrawn.
REPORTER 1 
...officials at George Washington Hospital. And in the third hour of a massive manhunt for a third suspect, airports up and down the Atlantic Coast are closed.
In Rosslyn, FBI agents and cops are searching the area.
REPORTER 4 
Major delays, cancellations, and closures at major airports, rail stations...
Massive traffic is seen in a Washington street.
REPORTER 2 
...and bus stations, and harbors. Travelers are strongly advised to wait.
In the Situation Room, military men are discussing tactics.
REPORTER 1 
...Two navy carrier groups as well as the 32nd marine tactical division have been put on heightened alert.
REPORTER 2 
...Secret Service agent Ron Butterfield, head of the President's Secret Service detail, who was shot in the hand during the attack.
We see Ron and Gina outside the waiting room in the G.W. Hospital. Inside, Mrs. Landingham has her hand over Donna's. They are silently sitting next to each other.
FADE TO: INT. JOSH'S OPERATION ROOM - NIGHT
Busy surgeons surround the unconscious Josh. Bartlet and Leo looks through the window.
BARTLET
Look what happened.
There is much concern on their faces as we slowly --

The view is shared by the leading establishment critic of Cold War policies, George Kennan, who writes that it was a historic error for the US to reject any effort to negotiate a peaceful settlement of conflicts with the Russians for 40 years; one of the benefits of the end of the Cold War is that the clouds are finally lifting on these issues. Kennan too counsels that we restrict our foreign engagements. We must bear in mind that "it is primarily by example, never by precept, that a country such as ours exerts the most useful influence beyond its border"; countries unlike ours may undertake the grubbier pursuits. We must also remember "that there are limits to what one sovereign country can do to help another," even "a country such as ours." Others question that stance on the grounds that it is unfair to deprive suffering humanity of our attention, necessarily benevolent.1
To qualify for membership in respectable society, one must appreciate a simple thesis: we are perfect. Therefore we need only ask what is the right course for a saintly power, how best we may proceed to "save people from others or from themselves" -- not from us, surely. The tune is, in fact, a very familiar one, an interesting topic for some other time.
Like earlier angelic powers, we are able to recognize that there are some flaws and errors in the record. But the sophisticated understand that history can teach no lessons about our institutions and the ways they have functioned, surely nothing about what may lie ahead. Review of the historical record is nothing more than "sound-bites and invectives about Washington's historically evil foreign policy," Brown University professor Thomas Weiss writes with derision, hence "easy to ignore."2 A perceptive comment, accurately discerning the most valued principles of the commissar culture.
Discussion of the fashionable topic of the moral obligation of humanitarian intervention -- not a trivial question -- is rarely tainted by concerns about such matters. We do not, of course, counsel that Iran should undertake humanitarian intervention in Bosnia, as it has offered to do. Why? Because of its record and the nature of its institutions. In the case of Iran -- or anyone else -- inquiry into these questions is appropriate. But not for us, given our necessary perfection.
It follows that any departures from the path of righteousness can only have been a reaction -- perhaps excessive, though understandable -- to terrible dangers from which we defended ourselves, and more recently, the entire civilized world. The Cold War provides the favored current formula: any lapse in recent years is attributable to the cosmic struggle with the Russians. Thus if experimental subjects for radiation studies were chosen from Boston's Fernald School for mentally retarded children, not an elite prep school, that was unfortunate, but understandable in the atmosphere of the Cold War, so it is alleged -- about as plausibly as in most other cases. And we have now "changed course," so that history may rest in peace.
At the critical extreme, we do find occasional notice of imperfection. "There's something troubling about the way we select our cases for intervention," Harvard historian Stanley Hoffmann observed in opening a conference at Tufts university. He noted that there has been no "international cry to intervene in ethnic bloodshed in East Timor," the Boston Globe reported. The example is instructive.3
Let us disregard the phrase "ethnic bloodshed," not quite the term applied to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That aside, some obvious questions come to mind: just who might call for such intervention, and how should it proceed? By bombing Washington and London, the main supporters of Indonesia's aggression and mass slaughter? Suppose that a commentator in pre-Gorbachev Russia had found something troubling about Soviet intervention policy, wondering why Russia did not intervene to prevent the imposition of martial law in Poland or repression in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Would we even laugh? How could Moscow intervene to bar the policies it actively supported? These questions cannot arise, however, in our case, whatever the facts, given our perfection. No one laughs.
Respectable British opinion is scarcely different. Writing in the (London) Times Higher Education Supplement, Leslie Macfarlane, emeritus politics fellow at St. John's College in Oxford, recognizes that the US and UK, "to their shame, failed to put pressure on President Suharto to refrain from invasion" of East Timor. But the 200,000 or more deaths "cannot be attributed to `the West'," he adds, reproaching Edward Herman for his calculations of the costs of Western state terrorism which erroneously included this case: no "Western promotion or support for the invasion and pacification of East Timor in the early 1980s  is laid at the West's door," Macfarlane instructs us with proper indignation.4
There is no need to review the facts, familiar outside of the doctrinal system, which not only suppressed them with great efficiency as the terrible story unfolded but continues to do so today. Right now, Western oil companies are plundering East Timor's oil under a treaty between Australia and Indonesia, terror and repression continue unabated, and new atrocities have been discovered from the very recent past, among them, the slaughter of many people by Indonesian doctors in hospitals after the November 1991 Dili massacre. But we must understand that the news room is a busy place, and some things inevitably seep through the cracks -- in a remarkably systematic way. Who can be expected to notice prominent stories in the British and Australian press, including even the Guardian Weekly, widely circulated here? One wonders whether the news room would have been too busy to notice Libyan robbery of Kuwaiti oil under a treaty with Saddam Hussein, after he had occupied and annexed the country.5
In the United States, public protest has hampered government support for Indonesian atrocities, but not much. Congress cut off funds for military training, but the Clinton Administration was undeterred. On the anniversary of the US-backed Indonesian invasion, the State Department announced that "Congress's action did not ban Indonesia's purchase of training with its own funds," so it can proceed despite the ban. Such training has, after all, been quite successful in the past, including the training of officers who took part in the highly praised slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people, mostly landless peasants, as the present government took power in 1965. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara took particular pride in that fact, informing LBJ that US military assistance to the Indonesian army had "encouraged it" to undertake the useful slaughter "when the opportunity was presented." Particularly valuable, McNamara said, was the program that brought Indonesian military personnel to the United States for training at universities. Congress agreed, noting the "enormous dividends" of US military training of the killers and continued communication with them. The same training expedited the war crimes in Timor, and much else.6
Plainly, it would be unfair to deprive the people of the region of such benefits. That is exactly the position taken by advocates of US military training, for example Senator Bennett Johnson. His evidence is a quote from the Commander of the US forces in the Pacific, Admiral Larson, who explains that "by studying in our schools," Indonesian army officers "gain an appreciation for our value system, specifically respect for human rights, adherence to democratic principles, and the rule of law." For similar reasons, we must allow arms sales to Indonesia, so that we can continue to have a constructive "dialogue" and maintain our "leverage and influence," so benignly exercised in the past, much as in Latin America, Haiti, the Philippines, and other places where US training has instilled such admirable respect for human rights.7
1. Defending Human Rights
With the support of Senate Democrats, the Administration was also able to block human rights conditions on aid to Indonesia. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced further that Washington would "suspend" its annual review of Indonesian labor practices. Agreeing with Senator Bennett, who is impressed by "the steps Indonesia has taken...to improve conditions for workers in Indonesia," Kantor commended Indonesia for "bringing its labor law and practice into closer conformity with international standards" -- a witticism that is in particularly poor taste, though it must be conceded that Indonesia did take some steps forward, fearing that Congress might override its friends in the White House. "Reforms hastily pushed through by the Indonesian government in recent months include withdrawing the authority of the military to intervene in strikes, allowing workers to form a company union to negotiate labour contracts, and raising the minimum wage in Jakarta by 27%" to about $2 a day, the London Guardian reports. The new company unions that are magnanimously authorized must, to be sure, join the All-Indonesia Labor Union, the state-run union. To ensure that these promising advances toward international labor standards would not be misunderstood, authorities also arrested 21 labor activists.
"We have done much to change and improve," Indonesia's Foreign Minister said, "so according to us there is no reason to revoke" the trade privileges. Clinton liberals evidently agree.8
One effect of the activism of the 1960s was the pressure on Congress to impose human rights conditions on aid, trade, and military sales. Every Administration from Carter until today has had to seek ways to evade such constraints. In the 1980s, it became a sick joke, as the Reaganites regularly assured Congress (always happy to be "deceived") that its favorite assassins and torturers were making impressive progress. Clinton is forging no new paths with his Indonesia chicanery.
Other tasks are proving harder, however, notably China, which must have its Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status renewed by June. As I've reviewed in earlier articles, China is not giving poor Clinton much help in his endeavor to bypass the executive order that he issued imposing human rights conditions -- in "fear that Congressional Democrats might otherwise have forced an even more stringent approach" through legislation, Thomas Friedman reports in the New York Times, and because Clinton "did not want to appear to be going back on another campaign promise," having "strongly criticized President Bush for `coddling' China."9
The problem arose again as Warren Christopher visited Beijing in March to express Washington's concerns on human rights, which, the State Department hastened to explain, are quite limited -- in fact, limited to finding means to evade Congressional pressures. John Shattuck, US assistant secretary of human rights, clarified to the Chinese leaders that Clinton's requirements for improvement are "very narrow," that pledges of progress may be enough: "What the president is looking for is an indication of direction...that is generally forward looking." Please, please, give us some straw, so that we can respond to the needs of our constituency in the corporate sector. The Chinese, however, seem to enjoy watching their partners twist in the wind.10
As Christopher left for China, the Administration announced that it would once again relax the sanctions on high technology transfers, this time by allowing the Hughes Aircraft Company to launch a satellite from China. This "gesture of good will toward Beijing" is one "part of the strategy to engage China rather than to isolate it," Elaine Sciolino reported in the New York Times. Asked about this decision while China is under pressure on issues of missile proliferation and human rights, Christopher responded that it "simply sends a signal of even-handed treatment." The "good will gesture," as usual, is directed towards a leading segment of the publicly subsidized "private enterprise" system, much like the "good-will gestures" announced at the Asia-Pacific summit last November, which allowed China to purchase supercomputers, nuclear power generators, and satellites despite their adaptability to weapons and missile proliferation. The Pentagon also sent high officials with Christopher "to discuss ways to upgrade the two countries' military relationship," Sciolino reported, another part of the "strategy."11
Christopher did not return empty-handed. At a White House session, Thomas Friedman reports, he "presented a chart...showing that on many fronts China was making some progress toward meeting the terms of the President's executive order, but that forward movement had been obscured by the confrontational atmosphere of his visit." On leaving Beijing, he had stated that his discussions with the Chinese leaders were "businesslike and productive." "The differences between China and the US are narrowing somewhat," Christopher informed the press, though he "was hard put to point to examples of specific progress on the vexed human rights issue beyond a memorandum of understanding on trade in prison labour products," the London Financial Times commented. China did (once again) agree to restrict exports from prison factories to the United States.12
Such exports have greatly exercised Washington and the press, the sole labor rights issue to have achieved this status. "U.S. Inspections of Jail Exports Likely in China," a front-page story by Thomas Friedman was headlined in the New York Times in January. The Chinese "agreed to a demand to allow more visits by American customs inspectors to Chinese prison factories to make sure they are not producing goods for export to the United States," he reported from Beijing. US influence is having further benign effects, "forcing liberalization, factory by factory," including contract, bankruptcy, and other laws that are "critical elements of a market economy," all welcome steps towards a "virtuous circle."
Unmentioned are a few other questions about economic virtue: horrifying labor conditions, for example. Perhaps the case of 81 women burned to death locked into their factory last November, which merited a few lines in the national press in the midst of much euphoria about Clinton's grand vision of a free market future in the Asia-Pacific region. Or 60 workers killed in a fire a few weeks later in another foreign-owned factory. Or the doubling of deaths in industrial accidents last year, with over 11,000 just in the first eight months. "Chinese officials and analysts say the accidents stem from abysmal working conditions, which, combined with long hours, inadequate pay, and even physical beatings, are stirring unprecedented labor unrest among China's booming foreign joint ventures," Sheila Tefft reported in the Christian Science Monitor. That problem is a real one: "the tensions reveal the great gap between competitive foreign capitalists lured by cheap Chinese labor and workers weaned on socialist job security and the safety net of cradle-to-grave benefits." Workers do not yet understand that in the capitalist utopia we are preparing for them, they are to be "beaten for producing poor quality goods, fired for dozing on the job during long work hours" and other such misdeeds, and locked into their factories to be burned to death. But we understand all of that, so China is not called to account for violations of labor rights; only for exporting prison products to the United States.13
Why the distinction? Simplicity itself. Prison factories are state-owned industry, and exports to the US interfere with profits, unlike locking women into factories, beating workers, and other such means to improve the balance sheet. QED.
Accuracy requires a few qualifications. Thus, the rules allow the United States to sell prison goods -- for export: they are not permitted to enter US markets. California and Oregon export prison-made clothing to Asia, including specialty jeans, shirts, and a line of shorts quaintly called "Prison Blues." The prisoners earn far less than the minimum wage, and work under "slave labor" conditions, prison rights activists allege. But their products do not interfere with the rights that count, so there is no problem here.14
The Clinton Administration "has been quietly signaling Beijing that if it met Washington's minimum human rights demands, the United States would consider ending the annual threat of trade sanctions to change China's behavior," Friedman reports. The reason is that the old human rights policy imposed by Congressional (ultimately popular) pressures is "outmoded and should be replaced." This is a "major shift in policy which reflects the increasing importance of trade to the American economy." The human rights policy "is also outmoded, other officials argue, because trade is now such an important instrument for opening up Chinese society, for promoting the rule of law and the freedom of movement there, and for encouraging" private property.15
The hypocrisy is stunning, though hardly more than the "human rights" policy that is now "outmoded," which was always carefully crafted to avoid endangering profits and to somehow "not see" huge atrocities carried out by US clients under Washington's sponsorship. Human rights concerns have been a passion in the case of Nicaragua and Cuba, subjected to crushing embargoes and terror. In such cases, trade is not "an instrument" that induces good behavior. The criminals have to be restored to their service role; if cynical posturing about human rights contributes to that end, well and good. The same was true of the Soviet empire, which also had to be returned to its traditional Third World role, providing resources, investment opportunities, markets, cheap labor, and other amenities, as it had for hundreds of years (an essential feature of the Cold War since 1918, in the real world). Until that end was achieved, trade was not "an instrument" to help lift the chains. The same was true of China, until it began to open its doors to foreign investment and control, offering wonderful opportunities for profit -- or in technical Newspeak, "jobs."
2. Promoting Democracy
Our current vocation, as everyone knows, is promoting democracy. There are many illuminating examples since the fall of the Berlin Wall freed us from the Cold War burden.
The first, and one of the most revealing, is Nicaragua. Recall that just as the Wall fell, the White House and Congress announced with great clarity that unless Nicaraguans voted as we told them, the terrorist war and the embargo that was strangling the country would continue. Washington also voted (alone with Israel) against a UN General Assembly resolution calling on it once again to observe international law and call off these illegal actions; unthinkable of course, so the press continued to observe its vow of silence. When Nicaraguans met their obligations a few months later, joy was unrestrained. At the dissident extreme, Anthony Lewis hailed Washington's "experiment in peace and democracy," which gives "fresh testimony to the power of Jefferson's idea: government with the consent of the governed.... To say so seems romantic, but then we live in a romantic age." Across the spectrum there was rejoicing over the latest of the "happy series of democratic surprises," as Time magazine expressed the uniform view while outlining the methods used to achieve our Jeffersonian ideals: to "wreck the economy and prosecute a long and deadly proxy war until the exhausted natives overthrow the unwanted government themselves," with a cost to us that is "minimal," leaving the victim "with wrecked bridges, sabotaged power stations, and ruined farms," and providing Washington's candidate with "a winning issue," ending the "impoverishment of the people of Nicaragua."
It would be hard to imagine a more conclusive demonstration of the understanding of "democracy" in the dominant political and intellectual culture. It is inconceivable that the clear and unmistakeable meaning of any of this should enter the respectable culture, or probably even history.16
That interesting story continues. On March 15, US assistant Secretary of State Alexander Watson announced that "With the conflicts of the past behind us, the Clinton administration accepts the Sandinistas as a legitimate political force in Nicaragua with all the rights and obligations of any party in a democracy supposing that it uses only peaceful and legitimate methods," as we did through the 1980s, setting the stage for a "fair election," by US standards. The brief Reuters report noted that "the United States financed the Contra rebels against the Soviet-backed Sandinista government." Translating from Newspeak, Washington followed standard procedure, doing everything it could to compel Nicaragua to abandon its despicable efforts to maintain a nonaligned stand and balanced trade and to turn to the Russians as a last resort, so that Washington's attack could be construed as part of the Cold War conflict raging in our backyard, now to be dispatched to the category of irrelevance for understanding ourselves, or what the future holds.17
Washington's willingness to accept the Sandinistas as a legitimate political force, if they mind their manners, cannot claim the prize for moral cowardice and depravity. That is still held by Washington's display of magnanimity towards the Vietnamese, now permitted to enter the civilized world, their many crimes against us put to the side (though not, of course, forgiven) once US business made it clear that the pleasure of torturing our victims must give way to the more important task of enrichment of the wealthy.
The next example of our post-Cold War passion for democracy was the invasion of Panama a month after the Berlin Wall fell, the first exercise of humanitarian intervention in the post-Cold War era. Operation Just Cause may have served as a model for Saddam Hussein shortly after, the cheering section now quietly concedes. Bush's greatest fear when Iraq invaded Kuwait seems to have been that Saddam would mimic his achievement in Panama. According to the account of Washington planning by investigative reporter Bob Woodward, regarded as "generally convincing" by US government Middle East specialist William Quandt, President Bush feared that the Saudis would "bug out at the last minute and accept a puppet regime in Kuwait" after Iraqi withdrawal. His advisers expected that Iraq would withdraw, leaving behind "lots of Iraqi special forces in civilian clothes," if not armed forces as the US did in Panama, while taking over two uninhabited mudflats that had been assigned to Kuwait in the British imperial settlement to block Iraq's access to the sea (Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf). Chief of Staff Gen. Colin Powell warned that the status quo would be changed under the influence of the aggressors even after withdrawal, again as in Panama.
In a highly-praised academic study regarded as the standard current work of scholarship on this "textbook case of aggression" and the reaction to it, University of London historians Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh, who labor to present the US-UK effort in the most favorable possible light, conclude that "Saddam apparently intended neither officially to annex the tiny emirate nor to maintain a permanent military presence there. Instead, he sought to establish hegemony over Kuwait, ensuring its complete financial, political and strategic subservience to his wishes," much as intended by the US in Panama, and achieved. Saddam's scheme "turned sour," they continue, because of the international reaction; to translate to doctrinally unacceptable truth, because the US and Britain did not follow their usual practice of vetoing or otherwise nullifying the international reaction to such "textbook cases of aggression" as US-South Vietnam, Turkey-Cyprus, Indonesia-East Timor, Israel-Lebanon, US-Panama, and many others.18
Operation Just Cause was presented as a "textbook case" of Washington's dedication to democracy -- quite accurately, as it turned out. In the latest of its annual reports on human rights (January, 1994), Panama's governmental Human Rights Commission charged that the right to self-determination and sovereignty of the Panamanian people continues to be violated by the "state of occupation by a foreign army," reviewing US army, airforce, and DEA operations in Panama, including a DEA agent's assault on a Panamanian journalist and attacks on Panamanian citizens by US military personnel. The nongovernmental Human Rights Commission, in its accompanying report "Democracy and Human Rights in Panama...Four Years Later" added that democracy has meant nothing more than formal voting while government policies "do not attend to the necessities of the most impoverished" -- whose numbers have significantly increased since the "liberation." Within a year after the invasion, Latin Americanist Stephen Ropp observes, Washington was well aware "that removing the mantle of United States protection would quickly result in a civilian or military overthrow of  Endara and his supporters"-- that is, the puppet regime of bankers, businessmen, and narcotraffickers installed by the occupying army. "Drugs and their rewards are more visible today than in General Noriega's time," the Economist reports in March, including hard drugs. A senior employee of the Panama Branch of Merrill Lynch was one of those recently caught in a DEA operation as they were laundering Colombian cocaine cash through Panama's large financial industry, the one real economic success story of the "occupation by a foreign army." "All they were doing is what almost every bank in Panama does," a local investigative reporter commented. All exactly as predicted when the troops landed to restore the mainly white oligarchy to power and ensure US control over the strategically important region and its financial institutions.
An election is scheduled for May. Far ahead in polls is Perez Balladares, the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), the party of populist dictator Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega. Balladares was Noriega's campaign manager for the 1989 election that Noriega stole, causing much outrage in the US because he was no longer following Washington's orders; when he was still a "good boy" in 1984, he was lauded by Reagan, Shultz, et al. for stealing the election with considerably greater fraud and violence. Balladares has learned his lessons and should cause no problems.19
Other exercises of "democracy enhancement" in the region proceed on course. In November 1993, Hondurans went to the polls for the fourth time since 1980. They voted against the neoliberal structural adjustment programs that have had the usual consequences. But the gesture is empty; the rich and powerful will permit nothing else. "The voters have no real options for improving their living standards which worsen every day," Mexico's major newspaper Excelsior reported -- familiar with "economic miracles" in its own country. Three-fourths of those who went to the polls "live in misery and are disenchanted with formal democracy." Hondurans' purchasing power is lower than in the 1970s, before the gift of "democracy" was granted by the United States while turning Honduras into a military base for its war against Nicaragua and establishing more firmly the rule of the generals. There are other beneficiaries, the Honduran College of Economists points out: "a group of privileged exporters and local investors linked to financial capital and multinational corporations who have multiplied their capital" in a country where "growing economic polarization is generating ever more evident constrasts, between the rich who do not hide the ostentation of their moral misery and the every more miserable poor." "At least one of every two dollars coming to Honduras has left in the last three years  to pay the interest on more than $3 billion foreign debt," Excelsior continues. Debt service now represents 40% of exports; and though almost 20% of the debt was forgiven, it has increased by almost 10% since 1990.20
In March 1994, the "democracy enhancement" project reached El Salvador. The elections conducted in the 1980s to legitimize the US-backed terror state were hailed at the time as impressive steps towards democracy ("demonstration elections," as Edward Herman accurately called them). But with the policy imperatives of those days gone, the pretense has been quietly shelved. It is the 1994 elections that are to represent the triumph of Washington's dedication to democracy.
The elections are indeed an innovation in that at least the forms were maintained, pretty much. "Tens of thousands of voters who had electoral cards were unable to vote because they did not appear on electoral lists," the Financial Times reported, "while some 74,000 people, a high number of which were from areas believed to be sympathetic to the FMLN, were excluded because they did not have birth certificates." FMLN leaders alleged that more than 300,000 voters were excluded in such ways, charging "massive" fraud. The left coalition presidential candidate Rubn Zamora estimated "conservatively" that over 10% of voters were barred. The UN mission downplayed the problems, but independent observers were not convinced. "I used to give them the benefit of the doubt," the official British observer commented, "but it comes to the point when you have to say it is bad faith," referring to the "bad administration" of the election by the governing ARENA party, which received almost half the votes cast, and the UN mission reaction.21
But the irregularities, whatever they may have been, do not change the fact that the elections broke new ground at a formal level. There was no blatant fraud or massive terror; rather, minor fraud against the background of the successful use of terror and repression, with a narrow aspect that received some attention, and a broader and more significant one that did not.
In the 1994 elections, the US naturally supported ARENA, the party of the death squads, a fact understood throughout though denied for propaganda reasons. Partial declassification of documents has revealed that much. It also illustrates once again why documents are classified in the first place: not for security reasons, as alleged, but to undermine American democracy by protecting state power from popular scrutiny. In February 1985 the CIA reported that "behind ARENA's legitimate exterior lies a terrorist network led by D'Aubuisson and funded by wealthy Salvadoran expatriates residing in Guatemala and the United States," using "both active-duty and retired military personnel in their campaigns"; "death squads in the armed forces operate out of both urban military headquarters and rural outposts." The main death squad, the "Secret Anti-Communist Army," was described by the CIA as the "paramilitary organization" of ARENA, led by the Constituent Assembly security chief and drawing most of its members from the National Police and other security forces. The military and police themselves, of course, were the major terrorist forces, carrying out the great mass of the atrocities against the civilian population, funded directly from Washington, which was also responsible for their training and direction.22
As the 1994 elections approached, there was a "resurgence in death squad-style murders and death threats," Americas Watch observed, concluding that "no issue represents a greater threat to the peace process than the rise in political murders of leaders and grassroots activists" of the FMLN, assassinations that "became more frequent, brazen, and selective in the fall of 1993." These "injected a level of fear, almost impossible to measure, into the campaign," enhanced by government cover-ups and refusal to investigate, part of a pattern of violation of the peace treaty, to which we return. The government's own human rights office and the UN Observer Mission reported the "grave deterioration in citizen security" made worse by "organized violence in the political arena." This proceeds against the backdrop of an "astronomical rise of crime in post-war El Salvador," Americas Watch reports, and "reliable" evidence that the army and National Police are involved in organized crime.23
The major political opposition, Rubn Zamora's left coalition, not only lacked resources for the campaign that was virtually monopolized by ARENA, but was "unable to convince supporters or sympathizers to appear in campaign ads because they fear retaliation from the right" (New York Times). Terror continued at a level sufficient to give substance to such fears. Among those who took the threat seriously was Jos Mar!a Mendez, named El Salvador's "Lawyer of the Century" by three prestigious legal associations. He fled the country shortly after, threatened with death unless he convinced the vice-presidential candidate of the left coalition to resign.
Foreign observers were struck by the lack of popular interest in the "elections of the century." "Salvadorans Ambivalent Toward Historic Poll," a headline in the Christian Science Monitor read, reporting fear and apathy, and concern that war will return unless ARENA wins. The abstention rate, about 45%, was about the same as 10 years earlier, at the peak of the violence. A "conservative political analyst" quoted by the New York Times (Hctor Dada) attributed the low participation "to a deliberate disenfranchisment of voters and a sense of apathy among the electorate." As for those who voted, another analyst, Luis Cardenal, observed that "the electorate voted more than anything for tranquillity, for security." "The war-weary populace bought the ruling party's party line, which equated ARENA with security and the left with instability and violence," Christian Science Monitor reporter David Clark Scott added. That is plausible enough. Any other outcome could be expected to lead to revival of the large-scale terror and atrocities.24
These assessments bear on the broader aspects of the successful use of violence. Before the election, church and popular sources attributed the "climate of apathy" to the fact that "hunger and poverty reign among a population whose demands have received no attention, which makes the electoral climate difficult" (Notimex, Mexico).25 In the 1970s, popular organizations were proliferating, in part under church auspices, seeking to articulate these demands in the political arena and to work to overcome hunger, poverty, and harsh oppression. It was that popular awakening that elicited the response of the state terror apparatus and its superpower sponsor, committed as always to a form of "democracy enhancement" that bars the threat of democracy -- by extreme violence, if necessary, as in this case. Here as elsewhere, the programs of the terrorist superpower were highly successful, leading to the "climate of apathy," the search for security above all else, and the general conditions in which "free elections" become tolerable.
Recall the conclusion of Reaganite official Thomas Carothers, who recognizes that the "democracy enhancement" programs in which he was involved "inevitably sought only limited, top-down forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied," maintaining "the basic order of...quite undemocratic societies" and avoiding "populist-based change" that might upset "established economic and political orders" and open "a leftist direction." Nothing has changed in this regard.
A January 1994 conference of Jesuits and lay associates in San Salvador considered both the narrow and broad aspects of the state terrorist project. Its summary report concludes that "It is important to explore to what degree terror continues to act, cloaked by the mask of common crime. Also to be explored is what weight the culture of terror has had in domesticating the expectations of the majority vis-a-vis alternatives different to those of the powerful, in a context in which many of the revolutionaries of yesterday act today with values similar to the long powerful."26
The latter issue, the broader one, is of particular significance. The great achievement of the massive terror operations of the past years organized by Washington and its local associates has been to destroy hope. The observation generalizes to much of the Third World and also to the growing masses of superfluous people at home, as the Third World model of sharply two-tiered societies is increasingly internationalized. These are major themes of the "New World Order" being constructed by the privileged sectors of global society, with US state and private power in the lead.
3. Rewarding Democracy
A particularly instructive illustration of the democracy enhancement program in the region is Colombia, which seems to have taken first place in the competition for leading terrorist state in Latin America -- and, to the surprise of no one familiar with "sound-bites and invectives about Washington's historically evil foreign policy," has become the leading recipient of US military aid, accompanied by much praise for its stellar accomplishments.
In the March 1994 issue of Current History, Latin Americanist John Martz writes that "Colombia now enjoys one of the healthiest and most flourishing economies in Latin America. And in political terms its democratic structures, notwithstanding inevitable flaws, are among the most solid on the continent," a model of "well-established political stability." The Clinton Administration is particularly impressed by outgoing President Csar Gaviria, whom it is now promoting as next Secretary General of the Organization of American States, because, as the US representative to the OAS explained, "He has been very forward looking in building democratic institutions in a country where it was sometimes dangerous to do so" and also "on economic reform in Colombia and on economic integration in the hemisphere," code words that are readily interpreted.27
That it has been dangerous to build democratic institutions in Colombia is true enough, thanks primarily to President Gaviria, his predecessors, and their fervent supporters in Washington.
The "inevitable flaws" are reviewed in some detail -- once again -- in current publications of Americas Watch and Amnesty International.28 They find "appalling levels of violence," the worst in the hemisphere. Since 1986, more than 20,000 people have been killed for political reasons, most of them by the Colombian military and police and the paramilitary forces that are closely linked to them; for example, the private army of rancher, emerald dealer, and reputed drug dealer Victor Carranza, considered to be the largest in the country, dedicated primarily to the destruction of the leftwing political opposition Patriotic Union (UP), in alliance with police and military officers. The department in which Carranza operates (Meta) is one of the most heavily militarized, with some 35,000 troops and thousands of police. Nevertheless, paramilitary forces and hired killers operate freely, carrying out massacres and political assassinations. An official government inquiry in the early '80s found that over a third of the members of paramilitary groups engaged in political killings and other terror in Colombia were active-duty military officers; the pattern continues, including the usual alliances with private power and criminal sectors.
More than 1500 leaders, members and supporters of UP have been assassinated since the party was established in 1985. This "systematic elimination of the leadership" of UP is "the most dramatic expression of political intolerance in recent years," AI observes -- one of the "inevitable flaws" that make it "dangerous to build democratic institutions," if not quite the danger that the Clinton Administration wants us to notice. Other "dangers" were illustrated at the March 1994 elections, largely bought by the powerful Cali cocaine cartel, critics allege, noting the history of vote-buying in this "stable democracy," the vast amounts of money spent by the cartel, and the low turnout.29
The pretext for terror operations is the war against guerrillas and narcotraffickers, the former a very partial truth, the latter "a myth," Amnesty International concludes in agreement with other investigators; the myth was concocted in large measure to replace the "Communist threat" as the Cold War was fading along with the propaganda system based on it. In reality, the official security forces and their paramilitary associates work hand in glove with the drug lords, organized crime, landowners, and other private interests in a country where avenues of social action have long been closed, and are to be kept that way by intimidation and terror. The Government's own Commission to Overcome Violence concluded that "the criminalization of social protest" is one of the "principal factors which permit and encourage violations of human rights" by the military and police authorities and their paramilitary collaborators.
The problems have become much worse in the past 10 years, particularly during President Gaviria's term, when "violence reached unprecedented levels," the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) reports, with the National Police taking over as the leading official killers while US aid shifted to them. 1992 was the most violent year in Colombia since the 1950s, WOLA reported in early 1993, which proved to be still worse.30 Atrocities run the gamut familiar in the spheres of US influence and support: death squads, "disappearance," torture, rape, massacre of civilian populations under the doctrine of "collective responsibility," and aerial bombardment. The specially-trained counterinsurgency and mobile brigades are among the worst offenders. Targets include community leaders, human rights and health workers, union activists, students, members of religious youth organizations, and young people in shanty towns, but primarily peasants. Merely to give one example, from August 1992 to August 1993, 217 union activists were murdered, "a point that demonstrates the strong intolerance on the part of the State of union activity," the Andean Commission of Jurists comments.31 The official concept of "terrorism" has been extended to virtually anyone opposing government policies, the human rights reports observe.
One project of the security forces and their allies is "social cleansing" -- that is, murder of vagrants and unemployed, street children, prostitutes, homosexuals, and other undesirables. The Ministry of Defense formulated the official attitude toward the matter in response to a compensation claim: "There is no case for the payment of any compensation by the nation, particularly for an individual who was neither useful nor productive, either to society or to his family."
The security forces also murder suspects, another practice familiar in US domains. It is, for example, standard operating procedure for Israeli forces in the occupied territories, passing with little notice among the paymasters, who accept it as routine. Thus, the day before the Hebron massacre of February 25, soldiers fired antitank rockets and grenades at a stone house near Jerusalem, killing one Palestinian and wounding another who were "accused by the army in the slaying of an undercover agent" and other actions, the press casually reported.32
The plague of murder for sale of organs, rampant through the domains of US influence, has not spared Colombia, where undesirables are killed so that their corpses "can be chopped up and sold on the black market for body parts" (AI). It is not known whether children are sold and killed for organ transplants as in El Salvador, where the practice is officially conceded; and according to extensive report, elsewhere in the region.
As Human Rights groups and others observe, the Colombian model is that of El Salvador and Guatemala. The doctrines instilled by US advisers and trainers can be traced back directly to the Nazis, as Michael McClintock documented in an important study that has been ignored. Colombia has also enjoyed the assistance of British, German, and Israeli mercenaries who train assassins and perform other services for the narco-military-landlord combine in their war against peasants and potential social activism. to my knowledge, there has been no attempt to investigate the report of Colombian intelligence that North Americans have also been engaged in these operations, or any notice of it, in the mainstream.
Other similarities to Washington's Salvador-Guatemala model abound. Consider, for example, the case of Major Luis Felipe Becerra, charged with responsibility for an army massacre by a civilian judge, who fled the country under death threats days after issuing the arrest warrant (her father was then murdered). But the warrants were not served, because Major Becerra was then in the United States undergoing a training course for promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel. Returning after his promotion, Lt.-Col. Becerra was appointed to head the army's press and public relations department, despite a recommendation by the Procurator Delegate to the Armed Forces that he be dismissed for his part in the peasant massacre. In April 1993, charges against him were dropped. In October, he was again implicated in a massacre of unarmed civilians. Under the pretext of a battle against guerrillas, troops under his command executed 13 people in a rural area; the victims were unarmed, the women were raped and tortured, according to residents of the area.33
But impunity prevails, as is regularly the case.
The story is that of Central America, Haiti, Brazil, indeed wherever the Monroe Doctrine extends, along with the Philippines, Iran under the Shah, and other countries that share an elusive property.34
Whatever could it be? Whatever it is, we are strictly enjoined not to see it and to learn nothing from it.
A detailed 1992 investigation by European and Latin American church and human rights organizations concludes that "state terrorism in Colombia is a reality: it has its institutions, its doctrine, its structures, its legal arrangements, its means and instruments, its victims, and above all its responsible authorities." Its goal is "systematic elimination of opposition, criminalization of large sectors of the population, massive resort to political assassination and disappearance, general use of torture, extreme powers for the security forces, exceptional legislation, etc..." (State Terror in Colombia). The modern version has its roots in the security doctrines pioneered by the Kennedy Administration, which established them officially in a crucial 1962 decision that shifted the mission of the Latin American military from "hemispheric defense" to "internal security": the war against the "internal enemy," understood in practice to be those who challenge the traditional order of domination and control.
The doctrines were expounded in US manuals of counterinsurgency and low intensity conflict, and developed further by local security authorities. They benefited from training and direction by US advisers and experts, new technologies of repression, and improved structures and methodologies to maintain "stability" and obedience. The result is a highly efficient apparatus of official terror, designed for "total war" by state power "in the political, economic, and social arenas," as the Colombian Minister of Defense articulated the standard doctrine in 1989. While officially the targets were guerrilla organizations, a high military official explained in 1987 that these were only of minor importance: "the real danger" is "what the insurgents have called the political and psychological war," the war "to control the popular elements" and "to manipulate the masses." The "subversives" hope to influence unions, universities, media, and so on. Therefore, the State Terror inquiry observes, the "internal enemy" of the state terrorist apparatus extends to "labor organizations, popular movements, indigenous organizations, opposition political parties, peasant movements, intellectual sectors, religious currents, youth and student groups, neighborhood organizations," and so on, all legitimate targets for destruction because they must be secured against undesirable influences. "Every individual who in one or another manner supports the goals of the enemy must be considered a traitor and treated in that manner," a 1963 military manual prescribed, as the Kennedy initiatives were moving into high gear.
The war against the "internal enemy" escalated in the 1980s as the Reaganites updated the Kennedy doctrines, moving from "legal" repression to "systematic employment of political assassination and disappearance, later massacres" (State Terror). Atrocities escalated. A new judicial regime in 1988 "allowed maximal criminalization of the political and social opposition" in order to implement what was officially called "total war against the internal enemy." The use of paramilitary auxiliaries for terror, explicitly authorized in military manuals, also took new and more comprehensive forms; and alliances with industrialists, ranchers and landowners, and later narcotraffickers were more firmly entrenched. The 1980s saw "the consolidation of state terror in Colombia," the inquiry concludes.35
In its December 1993 study, America's Watch observes that "most of the materiel used by and training provided the Colombian army and police come from the United States," mainly counterinsurgency equipment and training. A study of the "drug war" by the US General Accounting Office in August 1993 concluded that US military officials have not "fully implemented end-use monitoring procedures to ensure that Colombia's military is using aid primarily for counter-narcotic purposes," an oversight with few consequences, considering what falls under the rubric of "counter-narcotic purposes." Washington's own interpretation of such purposes was nicely illustrated in early 1989 when Colombia asked it to install a radar system to monitor flights from the south, the source of most of the cocaine for the drug merchants. The US government fulfilled the request -- in a sense; it installed a radar system on San Andrs island in the Caribbean, 500 miles from mainland Colombia and as far removed as possible on Colombian territory from the drug routes, but well-located for the intensive surveillance of Nicaragua that was a critical component of the terrorist war, then peaking as Washington sought to conclude its demolition of the "peace process" of the Central American presidents (as it did, another fact unlikely to enter history). A Costa Rican request for radar assistance in the drug war ended up the same way.36
>From 1984 through 1992, 6,844 Colombian soldiers were trained under the US International Military Education and Training Program, over 2,000 from 1990 to 1992, as atrocities were mounting. Like their counterparts elsewhere, they were thus able to "gain an appreciation for our value system, specifically respect for human rights, adherence to democratic principles, and the rule of law," as Admiral Larson and Senator Bennett explained. The Colombian program is the largest in the hemisphere, three times that of El Salvador. US advisors are helping build military bases, officially to "increase the battlefronts against the guerrillas and narcotrafficking operations." Four have been constructed, five more are underway, according to the US Embassy. The real targets will be evident from the record elsewhere in the region, or in Colombia itself.
Washington is also supporting the "public order" courts that operate under conditions that severely undermine civil rights and due process. Again, the parallel to El Salvador is obvious. One of the requirements of the UN-brokered peace accord was that the Salvadoran government dismantle the Supreme Court, largely an appendage of the death squad apparatus run by the state and its private sector allies. The agreement was ignored, like the requirement that the National Police, noted for their brutality, be dismantled and replaced by a new National Civilan Police (PNC) that is not under army control and includes the FMLN. "Government figures...show that instead of phasing out the old national police force as called for by the peace accord, it actually has increased by about 2,000 men to 10,500," the Chicago Tribune reported. In further violation of the agreement, the ARENA government in 1992 transferred to the National Police 1,000 members of the Treasury Police and National Guard, which were to be abolished because of their notorious human rights abuses; former members were accepted to training programs for the PNC, "an explicit violation of the accord," Americas Watch notes. The expanding National Police are considered responsible for 35% of human rights violations reported to the UN observers in 1993, "a larger share than any other force," Americas Watch continues, reviewing also a series of other government violations of the accords designed to sustain the terror system, either in official or "privatized" form. "Time is on the side of the government," a UN official observed: it is only necessary to hold out until the UN Mission ends, and then the remnants of the peace accords can be completely scrapped, going the way of the Central American peace accords of 1987.37
Since there is no interest here, El Salvador too proceeds towards a "stable democracy," though with "inevitable flaws," such as those already mentioned.
In July 1989 the State Department submitted a report entitled "Justification for Determination to Authorize Export-Import Act Guarantees and Insurance for Sales of Military Equipment to Colombia for Antinarcotics Purposes," the official cover story. The report states: "Colombia has a democratic form of government and does not exhibit a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights." Three months later, the UN Special Rapporteur on Summary Executions, Amos Wako, returned from a visit to Colombia with severe warnings about the extreme violence of the paramilitary forces in coordination with drug lords and government security forces: "There are currently over 140 paramilitary groups operating in Colombia today  trained and financed by drug traffickers and possibly a few landowners. They operate very closely with elements in the armed forces and the police. Most of the killings and massacres carried out by the paramilitary groups occur in areas which are heavily militarized  they are able to move easily...and commit murders with impunity. In some cases, the military or police either turn a blind eye to what is being done by paramilitary groups or give suport by offering safe conduct passes to members of the paramilitary or by impeding investigation." His mandate did not extend to the direct terror of the security forces, which far outweighs the depredations of its informal allies.
A few months before the State Department praise for Colombia's humane democracy, a Jesuit-sponsored development and research organization published a report documenting atrocities in the first part of 1988, including over 3000 politically-motivated killings, 273 in "social cleansing" campaigns.38 Excluding those killed in combat, political killings averaged 8 a day, with seven murdered in their homes or in the street and one "disappeared." "The vast majority of those who have disappeared in recent years," WOLA added, "are grassroots organizers, peasant or union leaders, leftist politicians, human rights workers and other activists," over 1500 by the time of the State Department endorsement. Perhaps the State Department had in mind the recent (1988) mayoral campaigns, in which 29 of the 87 mayoral candidates of the UP were assassinated along with over 100 of its candidates for municipal councilor. The Central Organization of Workers, a coalition of trade unions formed in 1986, had by then lost over 230 members, most of them found dead after brutal torture.
Recall also that in 1988, the more advanced forms of "maximal criminalization of the political and social opposition" were instituted for "total war against the internal enemy," as the regime of state terror consolidated. By the time the State Department report appeared, the methods of control it found praiseworthy were being still more systematically implemented. From 1988 through early 1992, 9500 people were assassinated for political reasons along with 830 disappearances and 313 massacres (between 1988 and 1990) of peasants and poor people.39
The primary victims of atrocities were, as usual, the poor, mainly peasants. In one southern department, grassroots organizations testified in February 1988 that a "campaign of total annihilation and scorched earth, Vietnam-style," was being conducted by the military forces "in a most criminal manner, with assassinations of men, women, elderly and children. Homes and crops are burned, obligating the peasants to leave their lands." The State Department had a plethora of evidence of this sort before it when it cleared Colombia of human rights violations. Its own official Human Rights reports attributed virtually all violence to the guerrillas and narcotraffickers, so that the US was "justified" in providing the mass murderers and torturers with military equipment, putting our taxes to good use.
That, of course, was the "bad old days" of 1989, when we were still defending civilization from the Russian threat. Moving to the present, matters become worse, for reasons explained by President Gaviria in May 1992. When questioned about atrocities by the military in the Colombian press, he responded that "The battle against the guerrillas must be waged on unequal terms. The defense of human rights, of democratic principles, of the separation of powers, could prove to be an obstacle for the counterinsurgency struggle."40
During the Bush years, the US Embassy "did not make a single public statement urging the government to curb political or military abuses," WOLA observes, while US support for the military and police increased.41 But now that liberal Democrats have taken over, the Clinton Administration has called for a change in policy towards the Colombian killers: more active US participation. For fiscal year 1994, the Administration requested that military financing and training funds be increased by over 12%, reaching about half of proposed military aid for all of Latin America. Congressional budget cuts for the Pentagon interfered with these plans, so the Administration "intends to use emergency drawdown authority to bolster the Colombia account," Americas Watch reports. Congress, however, is continuing to interfere, taking note of "continuing human rights abuses on a large scale" and imposing conditions on US aid, which the Administration will have to find ways to evade, with the usual formulas and devices. The Senate also urged the Colombian Government to permit Red Cross access to police and detention facilities, which it has generally denied.
The Human Rights organizations (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch) are committed to international conventions on human rights. Thus AI reports open by stating that the organization "works to promote all the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international standards." In practice, however, the commitment is skewed in accord with Western standards, which are significantly different. The United States, in particular, rejects the universality of the Universal Declaration, amidst much posturing about our noble defense of the sacred principle of universality and self-righteous denunciation of the "cultural relativism" of the backward peoples who fall short of our exalted standards. The United States has always flatly rejected the sections of the Universal Declaration dealing with social and economic rights, and also consistently disregards, ignores, and violates much of the remainder of the Declaration -- even putting aside its massive involvement in terror, torture, and other abuses.
The Human Rights Groups say little about social and economic rights, generally adopting the highly biased Western perspective on these matters. In the case of Colombia, we have to go beyond these (in themselves, very valuable) reports to discover the roots of the extraordinary violence. They are not obscure. The president of the Colombian Permanent Committee for Human Rights, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfredo V squez Carrizosa, writes that it is "poverty and insufficient land reform" that "have made Colombia one of the most tragic countries of Latin America," and are the source of the violence, including the mass killings of the 1940s and early 1950s, which took hundreds of thousands of lives. Land reform was legislated in 1961, but "has practically been a myth," unimplemented because landowners "have had the power to stop it" in this admirable democracy with its constitutional regime, which V squez Carrizosa dismisses as a "facade," granting rights that have no relation to reality. The violence has been caused "by the dual structure of a prosperous minority and an impoverished, excluded majority, with great differences in wealth, income, and access to political participation."
And as elsewhere in Latin America, "violence has been exacerbated by external factors," primarily the initiatives of the Kennedy Administration, which "took great pains to transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades, accepting the new strategy of the death squads," ushering in "what is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine,...not defense against an external enemy, but a way to make the military establishment the masters of the game... the right to combat the internal enemy, as set forth in the Brazilian doctrine, the Argentine doctrine, the Uruguayan doctrine, and the Colombian doctrine: it is the right to fight and to exterminate social workers, trade unionists, men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and who are assumed to be communist extremists."42
It is in this precise sense, no other, that the Cold War guided our policies.
The results are an income distribution that is "dramatically skewed," WOLA observes, another striking feature of the domains of longstanding US influence, from which we are, again, to learn nothing. The top three percent of Colombia's landed elite own over 70% of arable land, while 57% of the poorest farmers subsist on under 3%. 40% of Colombians live in "absolute poverty," unable to satisfy basic subsistence needs, according to a 1986 report of the National Administration Bureau of Statistics, while 18% live in "absolute misery," unable to meet nutritional needs. The Colombian Institute of Family Welfare estimates that four and a half million children under 14 are hungry: that is, one of every two children, in this triumph of capitalism, a country of enormous resources and potential, lauded as "one of the healthiest and most flourishing economies in Latin America" (Martz).43
The "stable democracy" does exist, but as what Jenny Pearce calls "democracy without the people," the majority of whom are excluded from the political system monopolized by elites, more so as political space has been "rapidly closing by the mid-1980s." For Colombian elites, the international funding agencies, and foreign investors, "democracy" functions. But it is not intended for the public generally, who are "marginalized economically and politically." "The state has reserved for the majority the `state of siege' and all the exceptional repressive legislation and procedures that can guarantee order where other mechanisms fail," Pearce continues, increasingly in recent years. That is democracy, in exactly the sense of regular practice and even doctrine, if we attend closely.
No discussion of "democracy enhancement" in the current era can fail to consider Haiti, a sickening story that requires separate treatment, particularly now, when Clinton Administration efforts to undermine Haitian democracy have reached such a sordid level that even his allies are deserting the ship. As of March, the latest revelation of Clintonite deceit on "restoring democracy" to Haiti was the Congressional testimony of Lawrence Pezzullo, the Secretary of State's special adviser for Haiti. Pezzullo was questioned about a plan "portrayed as a Haitian solution spawned by weeks of tough negotiations in Washington among disparate leaders of Haitian society," Christopher Marquis reported in the Miami Herald. The Clinton Administration had strongly supported the plan as the optimal solution, representing Haitian democrats. It harshly condemned Aristide for his intransigence in rejecting the plan -- which, true enough, ignored such minor matters as the return of the elected President to Haiti and the removal of the worst of the state terrorists from power. Pezzullo conceded that the plan had in fact been "spawned" in the offices of the State Department, which selected the "Haitian negotiators" who were to ratify it in Washington. Included among them were right-wing extremists with close military ties, notably Frantz-Robert Mond, a former member of Duvalier's terrorist Tontons Macoute and a close associate of police chief Lt.-Col. Joseph Michel Francois, the most brutal and powerful of the Haitian state terrorists (incidentally, another beneficiary of US training).
"In other words, the operation was a hoax" (Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs), yet another effort to ensure that democracy is "enhanced" in Haiti in the familiar way -- without any "populist-based change" that might upset "established economic and political orders" and open "a leftist direction" (Carothers).44
I'll save until next time the Haitian illustration of the "romantic age" to which we have led suffering humanity.

Part II:
The Case of Haiti
July-August, 1994
As discussed in Part I, the Reagan-Bush Administrations reluctantly adopted "prodemocracy policies as a means of relieving pressure for more radical change," and "inevitably sought only limited, top-down forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied" (Thomas Carothers of the Reagan State Department). The leading idea is revealed in the documents of USAID's democracy project, which stress that the U.S. supports "processes of democratic institutional reform that will further economic liberalization objectives" -- that is, entrenchment of the service role.1
The reference to "the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied" has to undergo the usual translation. The phrase "United States" refers to the "traditional structures of power" at home. This is among the elementary truths that are to remain unspoken, along with the fact that the policies for the service areas merely adapt a conception of democracy that is to apply to the home societies as well. Here the general public "must be put in its place," as Walter Lippmann explained in his progressive essays on democracy long ago. The "ignorant and meddlesome outsiders" are to be only "interested spectators of action," not "participants." Their sole "function" in a democracy is to choose periodically among the leadership class (elections). Also unspoken is the fact that the "responsible men" who manage the democratic society gain that status by virtue of their service to "the traditional structures of power." There is a very broad consensus in the intellectual community, and of course the business world, that the "ignorant and incapable mass of humanity" must not be allowed to disrupt policy formation (Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State Robert Lansing), that planners must be "insulated" from politics, in World Bank lingo.
The "prodemocracy policies" in the service areas long antedate the Reaganites, and have little to do with the Cold War, apart from ideological cover. Accordingly, they should be expected to persist, as they do. Among the cases reviewed in Part I, the most striking is Colombia, which has become the leading human rights violator in the hemisphere and the recipient of more than half of total U.S. military aid and training, sent on its way with the usual acclaim for Colombia's democratic achievements as state terror mounts -- all rising to new heights under Clinton.
"Human Rights enhancement" marches on in parallel. In Part I, I reviewed Clinton's steps to evade congressional efforts to impose human rights conditions on military aid and trade privileges for Indonesia and China, and the concept of "human rights" itself, crafted to evade atrocities that contribute to profit. In the weeks since, the China story took its predictable course. "President Clinton's decision to renew China's trade benefits was the culmination of a titanic clash between America's global economic interests and its self-image as the world's leading advocate of human rights," Thomas Friedman's lead article opened in the New York Times, reporting the surprising outcome. Clinton did not merely endorse the Bush Administration policies that he had caustically denounced during the presidential campaign, but went well beyond them, deciding "to delink human rights" completely from trade privileges.2
The Indonesia case sheds further light on the "titanic clash." As discussed in Part I, Clinton joined his predecessors and colleagues abroad in ensuring the welfare of the Indonesian tyrants and murderers and the foreign corporations that benefit from their rule, blocking and evading congressional restrictions on military assistance. The issue was quite narrow: whether to refrain from direct participation in Indonesian atrocities at home and abroad. There was no thought of proceeding beyond, to some action to deter some of the worst crimes of the modern era.
The review in Part I was perhaps unfair in not mentioning that world leaders do recognize some limits, and have indeed considered sanctions against Indonesia. In November 1993, on behalf of the nonaligned movement and the World Health Organization (WHO), Indonesia submitted to the UN a resolution requesting an opinion from the World Court on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons. In the face of this atrocity, the guardians of international morality leaped into action. The U.S., U.K., and France threatened Indonesia with trade sanctions and termination of aid unless it withdrew the resolution, as it did. Traditional clients understand very well when a message from the powerful is to be heeded.
Citizens of the free world were again fortunate to have the information readily available to them; in this case, in the Catholic Church press in Canada.3
Freedom of information can go only so far, however. On June 10, the World Court was scheduled to take up the WHO request for an opinion, despite a furious campaign by the U.S., U.K., and their allies to prevent this outrage. The matter is of some importance. Even consideration of the issue by the Court would be a contribution to the cause of nonproliferation; even more so a decision that use of nuclear weapons is a crime under international law -- hence by implication, possession as well. As of mid-June, I have found no word on the matter, though the nonproliferation treaty is a topic of lead headlines, particularly the threat posed to its renewal in 1995 by North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program.
I barely mentioned one of the clearest tests of the Clinton vision on "democracy enhancement": Haiti. The case serves well to illustrate the "prodemocracy policies" of the Reagan-Bush years, as Carothers accurately describes them. We may ask, then, how things changed as the New Democrats took command.4
1. The Legacy of History
Even the briefest glimpse of Haiti's torment leaves impressions that do not easily fade, beginning with the scene of desolation on approaching the international airport. It is hard to remember that through the 18th century the island was the richest and most profitable of the Western colonies, and like today's Bangladesh, had struck the European conquerors as a virtual paradise. The Presidential Palace in Port-au-Prince, dominating a large square, is flanked by the headquarters of the military command and, at a slight remove, the equally-dreaded police. The symbols of authority and violence stand in impudent mockery of the misery that lies below them -- "confirming the permanence of power, a reminder to the people of their smallness in regard to the state, a reminder to the executioners of the omnipotence of their chief," in the worlds of Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolph Trouillot, expressing the logic of the Duvalierists, Papa Doc and Baby Doc, who ruled with brutal violence for 30 years.5
In the markets and slums below, it is barely possible to make one's way down alleys of mud and filth through teeming masses of people clad in rags. Women struggle past with huge burdens on their heads, children try to sell any miserable object, an occasional cart is dragged through mud that is inches deep and puddles left by recent rains. Flies swarm over a handful of vegetables and what might pass for fish. Peasants who have trudged down from the mountains on ancient trails sit by their paltry offerings, sleeping in the relics of shacks that line the alleys. In the depths of Third World poverty, one rarely finds a scene so noxious and depressing.
When I visited briefly a year ago, before the renewed terror, some people in the marketplace were willing to speak in the presence of a translator who was known and trusted, but only in circumlocution. The eyes of the security forces are everywhere, they intimated by their gestures more than their words. These were uniform: hunger, no work, no hope -- unless, somehow, President Aristide returns, though few dare to articulate the phrase beyond hints and nods. Some do, with remarkable courage, even after police torture and the threat of worse. It is not easy to believe that such courage can long survive, even if the people do.
U.S. relations with Haiti are not a thing of yesterday, and show no sign of fundamental change. They go back 200 years, to the days when the Republic that had just won its independence from Britain joined the imperial powers in their campaign to quell Haiti's slave rebellion by violence. When the rebellion nevertheless succeeded, the U.S. exceeded all others in the harshness of its reaction, refusing to recognize Haiti until 1862, in the context of the American civil war. At that moment, Haiti was important for its strategic location and as a possible dumping ground for freed slaves; Liberia was recognized in the same year, for the same reasons. Haiti then became a plaything for U.S.-European power politics, with numerous U.S. interventions culminating in Woodrow Wilson's invasion of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where his warriors -- as viciously racist as the Administration in Washington -- murdered and destroyed, reinstituted virtual slavery, dismantled the constitutional system because the backward Haitians could not see the merits of turning their country into a U.S. plantation, and established the National Guards that held both countries in their grip after the Marines finally left.
Wilson's thuggery has entered history in two different versions: here and there. In the U.S., the events figure in the amusing reconstructions entitled "history" as an illustration of U.S. "humanitarian intervention" and its difficulties (for us). Haitians have somewhat different memories. "Most observers agree that the achievements of the occupation were minor; they disagree only as to the amount of damage it inflicted," Trouillot writes under the heading "unhealed sores." The damage included the acceleration of Haiti's economic, military, and political centralization, its economic dependence and sharp class divisions, the vicious exploitation of the peasantry, the internal racial conflicts much intensified by the extreme racism of the occupying forces, and perhaps worst of all, the establishment of "an army to fight the people." "The 1915-1934 U.S. occupation of Haiti," he writes, "left the country with two poisoned gifts: a weaker civil society and a solidified state apparatus.6
A year ago, after enduring almost two years of renewed state violence, grassroots organizations, priests in hiding, tortured labor leaders, and others suffering bitterly from the violence of the security forces expressed marked opposition to the plan to dispatch 500 UN police to the terrorized country, seeing them as a cover for a U.S. intervention that evokes bitter memories of the Marine occupation. If ever noted, such reactions may be attributed to the fact that "even a benevolent occupation creates resistance...among the beneficiaries" (Harvard historian David Landes, writing about the Marine occupation). Or to the deficiencies of people who need only a new culture and more kind tutelage of the kind he provided as director of the USAID mission in 1977-79, Lawrence Harrison writes in a "think piece" on Haiti's problems in which the U.S. military occupation merits only the words: "And some of the Marines abused their power."7
Poor and suffering people do not have the luxury of indulging in fairy tales. Not uncommonly, their own experience gives them a grasp of realities that are well concealed by the intellectual culture. The usual victims can not so easily dismiss the record of U.S. power, which leaves little doubt that U.S. military intervention in Haiti would be the death knell for any form of democracy that "risks upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied." Haitians who have lost all hope for restoration of democracy might support a military intervention that could, perhaps, reduce terror and torture. But that is the most that can be realistically expected.
The military occupation left the island under U.S. control and largely U.S.-owned. The killer and torturer Trujillo took over the Dominican Republic, remaining a great friend until he began to get out of hand in the 1950s. In Haiti, Washington reacted with some ambivalence to the murderous and brutal dictatorship of "Papa Doc" Francois Duvalier, finding him a bit too independent for its taste. Nevertheless, Kennedy provided him with military assistance, in line with his general program of establishing firm U.S. control over the hemisphere's military and police as they undertook the task of "internal security" that he assigned them in a historic 1962 decision. Kennedy also provided aid for the Francois Duvalier International Airport in exchange for the Haitian vote to expel Cuba from the OAS. When "Baby Doc" Jean-Claude took over in 1971, relations rapidly improved, and Haiti became another "darling" of the business community, along with Brazil under the neo-Nazi generals and other right-thinking folk. USAID undertook to turn Haiti into the "Taiwan of the Caribbean," forecasting "a historic change toward deeper market interdependence with the United States," Trouillot observes. U.S. taxpayers funded projects to establish assembly plants that would exploit such advantages as enormous unemployment (thanks in part to USAID policies emphasizing agroexport) and a workforce -- mainly women, as elsewhere considered more docile -- with wages of 14 cents an hour, no unions, ample terror, and the other usual amenities. The consequences were profits for U.S. corporations and their Haitian associates, and a decline of 56% in wages in the 1980s. In short, if not Taiwan exactly, Haiti was an "economic miracle" of the usual sort.
Haiti offered the Reaganites yet another opportunity to reveal their understanding of democracy enhancement in June 1985, when its legislature unanimously adopted a new law requiring that every political party must recognize President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier as the supreme arbiter of the nation, outlawing the Christian Democrats, and granting the government the right to suspend the rights of any party without reasons. The law was ratified by a majority of 99.98%. Washington was deeply impressed, as much so as it was when Mussolini won 99% of the vote in the March 1934 election, leading Roosevelt's State Department to conclude that the results "demonstrate incontestably the popularity of the Fascist regime" and of "that admirable Italian gentleman" who ran it, as Roosevelt described the dictator. These are among the many interesting facts that might be recalled as neo-Fascists now take their place openly in the political system that was reconstructed with their interests in mind as Italy was liberated by American forces 50 years ago. Curiously, all this escaped attention during the D-Day anniversary extravaganza, along with much else that is too enlightening.
The 1985 steps to enhance democracy in Haiti were "an encouraging step forward," the U.S. Ambassador informed his guests at a July 4 celebration. The Reagan Administration certified to Congress that "democratic development" was progressing, so that military and economic aid could continue to flow -- mainly into the pockets of Baby Doc and his entourage. It also informed Congress that the human rights situation was improving, as it was at the time in El Salvador and Guatemala, and today in Colombia, and quite generally when some client regime requires military aid for "internal security." The House Foreign Affairs Committee, controlled by Democrats, had given its approval in advance, calling on Reagan "to maintain friendly relations with Duvalier's non-Communist government."
To justify their perception of an "encouraging step forward" in "democratic development," the Reaganites could have recalled the vote held under Woodrow Wilson's rule after he had disbanded the Haitian parliament in punishment for its refusal to turn Haiti over to American corporations under a new U.S.-designed Constitution. Wilson's Marines organized a plebiscite in which the Constitution was ratified by a 99.9% vote, with 5% of the population participating, using "rather high handed methods to get the Constitution adopted by the people of Haiti," the State Department conceded a decade later. Baby Doc, in contrast, allowed a much broader franchise, though it is true that he demanded a slightly higher degree of acquiescence than Wilsonian idealists, Mussolini, and New Dealers. A case could be made, then, that the lessons in democracy that Washington had been laboring to impart were finally sinking in.
These gratifying developments were short-lived, however. By December 1985, popular protests were straining the resources of state terror. What happened next was described by the Wall Street Journal with engaging frankness: after "huge demonstrations," the White House concluded "that the regime was unraveling" and that "Haiti's ruling inner circle had lost faith in" its favored democrat, Baby Doc. "As a result, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State George Shultz, began openly calling for a `democratic process' in Haiti." Small wonder that Shultz is so praised for his commitment to democracy and other noble traits.
The meaning of this call for democracy was underscored by the scenario then unfolding in the Philippines, where the army and elite made it clear they would no longer support another gangster for whom Reagan and Bush had expressed their admiration, even "love," not long before, so that the White House "began openly calling for a `democratic process'" there as well. Both events accordingly enter the canon as a demonstration of how we "served as inspiration for the triumph of democracy in our time" in those wondrous years (New Republic).
Washington lent its support to the post-Duvalier National Council of Government (CNG), providing $2.8 million in military aid in its first year, while the CNG, "generously helped by the U.S. taxpayer's money, had openly gunned down more civilians than Jean-Claude Duvalier's government had done in fifteen years" (Trouillot). After a series of coups and massacres, Reagan's Ambassador explained to Human Rights investigators that "I don't see any evidence of a policy against human rights"; there may be violence, it is true, but it is just "part of the culture." We can only watch in dismay and incomprehension.
Haitian violence thus falls into the same category as the atrocities in El Salvador at the same time, for example, the massacre at El Mozote, one of the many conducted by U.S.-trained elite battalions -- and one of the few to be admitted to History, after exposure by the UN Truth Commission. Given their origins in U.S. planning, these routine atrocities must also be "part of the culture." Or perhaps "There is no one to blame except the gods of war," as Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of the New York Times observed, reviewing the "fair-minded" account by Mark Danner which "aptly denotes" the "horrifying incident" as "a central parable of the cold war" for which blame is shared equally by Salvadorans on all sides, murderers and victims alike. In contrast, atrocities organized and directed by the Soviet Union always seemed to have more determinable origins, for some reason.8
2. The Democratic Interlude
Haiti's happy ascent towards Taiwan was deflected unexpectedly in December 1990, when a real problem arose, unlike the terror and virtual enslavement of workers that are just "part of the culture." Washington made a serious error, allowing a free election in expectation of an easy victory for its candidate, Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official. To the surprise of outside observers, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected with two-thirds of the vote (Bazin was second with 14%), backed by a popular movement, Lavalas, which had escaped the notice of the rich folk. Outside of properly educated circles, one question came to the fore at once: What would the U.S. and its clients do to remove this cancer?
President Aristide held office from February to September, when his government was overthrown by a military coup, plunging the country into even deeper barbarism than before. There are two versions of what happened in the interim. One is given by various extremists who see Aristide as the representative of a "remarkably advanced" array of grass-roots organizations (Lavalas) that gave the large majority of the population a "considerable voice in local affairs" and even in national politics (Americas Watch); and who were impressed by Aristide's domestic policies as he "acted quickly to restore order to the government's finances" after taking power when "the economy was in an unprecedented state of disintegration" (Inter-American Development Bank). Other international lending agencies agreed, offering aid and endorsing Aristide's investment program. They were particularly impressed by the steps he took to reduce foreign debt and inflation, to raise foreign exchange reserves from near zero to $12 million, to increase government revenues with successful tax collection measures (reaching into the kleptocracy), to streamline the bloated government bureaucracy and eliminate fictitious positions in an anti-corruption campaign, to cut back contraband trade and improve customs, and to establish a responsible fiscal system.
These actions were "welcomed by the international financial community," the IADB noted, leading to "a substantial increase in assistance." Atrocities and flight of refugees also virtually ended; indeed the refugee flow reversed, as Haitians began to return to their country in its moment of hope. The U.S. Embassy in Haiti secretly acknowledged the facts. In a February 1991 State Department cable, declassified in 1994, the number two person in the Embassy, Vicky Huddleston, reported to Washington on "the surprisingly successful efforts of the Aristide government,...quickly reversed after the coup" (reported by Dennis Bernstein for Pacific News Service).9
Sophisticates in Washington and New York could understand that all of this is illusion. As Secretary of State Lansing had explained: "The experience of Liberia and Haiti show that the African race are devoid of any capacity for political organization and lack genius for government. Unquestionably there is an inherent tendency to revert to savagery and to cast aside the shackles of civilization which are irksome to their physical nature. Of course, there are many exceptions to this racial weakness, but it is true of the mass, as we know from experience in this country. It is that which makes the negro problem practically unsolvable."
A more acceptable version of Aristide's months in offices is offered by New York Times Haiti correspondent Howard French. He reported after the coup that Aristide had governed "with the aid of fear," leaning "heavily on Lavalas, an unstructured movement of affluent idealists and long-exiled leftists" whose model was China's Cultural Revolution. Aristide's power hunger led to "troubles with civil society." Furthermore, "Haitian political leaders and diplomats say, the growing climate of vigilantism as well as increasingly strident statements by Father Aristide blaming the wealthier classes for the poverty of the masses encouraged" the coup. "Although he retains much of the popular support that enabled him to win 67% of the popular vote in the country's December 1990 elections, Father Aristide was overthrown in part because of concerns among politically active people over his commitment to the Constitution, and growing fears of political and class-based violence, which many believe the President endorsed.10
Relation to fact aside, the analysis provides some lessons in Political Correctness. Two-thirds of the population and their organizations fall outside of "civil society." Those involved in the popular organizations and in local and national politics are not among the "politically active people." It is scandalous to tell the plain truth about the responsibility of the kleptocracy for "the poverty of the masses." "Fears of political and class-based violence" are limited to the months when such violence sharply declined, its traditional perpetrators being unable, temporarily, to pursue their vocation.
These lessons should be remembered as Washington moves to construct a "civil society" and "democratic political order" for this "failed state" with its degenerate culture and people, quite incapable of governing themselves.
In reality, the two versions of what happened during the democratic interlude are closer than it may seem on the surface. The "remarkably advanced" array of popular organizations that brought the large majority of the population into the political arena is precisely what frightened Washington and the mainstream generally. They have a different understanding of "democracy" and "civil society," one that offers no place to popular organizations that allow the overwhelming majority a voice in managing their own affairs. By definition, the "political leaders" of such popular organizations have only "meager" democratic credentials, and can therefore be granted only symbolic participation in the "democratic institutions" that we will construct in accord with our traditional "prodemocracy policies." So the government and media have been instructing us since the coup removed the radical extremist Aristide and his Maoist clique.
These simple truths account for much of what has happened in Haiti since Aristide's election. Trouillot concludes his study by observing that "In Haiti, the peasantry is the nation." But for policymakers, the peasantry are worthless objects except insofar as they can advance corporate profits. They may produce food for export and enrich local affiliates of U.S. agribusiness, or flock to the city to provide super-cheap labor for assembly plants, but they have no further function. It is therefore entirely natural that USAID, while providing $100 million in assistance to the private sector, should never have provided a penny to the leading popular peasant organization, the Peasant Movement of Papaye (MPP); and that former USAID director Harrison should see no special problem when MPP members are massacred by the military forces and should dismiss with contempt its call for moves to reinstitute the popularly elected President who was committed to "bottom-up" rather than "top-down" democracy.
Similarly, it is hardly surprising that USAID should have denounced the labor reforms Aristide sought to institute and opposed his efforts to raise the minimum wage to a princely 37 cents an hour. Nor should we find it odd that USAID invested massively in the low wage assembly sector while wages sharply declined and working conditions fell to abysmal levels, but terminated all efforts to promote investment as the democratically elected government took office. Rather, USAID reacted to this catastrophe by dedicating itself still more firmly to providing the Haitian business community with what it called "technical assistance in labor relations, development of a business oriented public relations campaign, and intensified efforts to attract U.S. products assembly operations to Haiti." Given the unfortunate democratic deviation, USAID's task, in its own words, was to "work to develop sustainable dialogue between the government and the business community"; no comparable efforts for workers and peasants were needed when Haiti was run by U.S.-backed killers and torturers. All of this conforms well to USAID's conception of "processes of democratic institutional reform" as those that "further economic liberalization objectives.11
Similarly, there is no reason to be surprised that U.S. elites suddenly began to show a sensitive concern for human rights and democracy just as human rights violations precipitously declined and democracy (though not in the preferred "top-down" sense) began to flourish. Amy Wilentz observes that during Aristide's brief term, Washington suddenly became concerned with "human rights and the rule of law in Haiti." "During the four regimes that preceded Aristide," she writes, "international human-rights advocates and democratic observers had begged the State Department to consider helping the democratic opposition in Haiti. But no steps were taken by the United States to strengthen anything but the executive and the military until Aristide won the presidency. Then, all of a sudden, the United States began to think about how it could help those Haitians eager to limit the powers of the executive or to replace the government constitutionally." The State Department "Democracy Enhancement" project was "specifically designed to fund those sectors of the Haitian political spectrum where opposition to the Aristide government could be encouraged," precisely as "prodemocracy policies" dictate. The institutions and leaders that merited such support are just the ones that survived the military coup, also no surprise.12
3. After the Coup
Wilentz reports further that immediately after the September 30 coup, the State Department apparently "circulated a thick notebook filled with alleged human rights violations" under Aristide -- "something it had not done under the previous rulers, Duvalierists and military men," who were deemed proper recipients for aid, including military aid, "based on unsubstantiated human-rights improvements." Toronto Star reporter Linda Diebel adds details. A "thick, bound dossier" on Aristide's alleged crimes was presented by the coup leader, General Cedras, to OAS negotiators. On October 3, U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams summoned reporters from the New York Times, Washington Post, and other major U.S. journals to private meetings where he briefed them on these alleged crimes, reportedly presenting them with the "dossier" -- which, we may learn some day, was compiled by U.S. intelligence and provided to its favorite generals. The Ambassador and his helpers began leaking the tales that have been used since to demonstrate Aristide's meager democratic credentials and his psychological disorders.13
The approved version is reflected by coverage of human rights abuses after the coup. As shown in a study by Boston Media Action, while the military were rampaging, the press focussed on abuses attributed to Aristide supporters, less than 1% of the total but the topic of 60% of the coverage in major journals during the two weeks following the coup, and over half of coverage in the New York Times through mid-1992. During the two-week period after the coup, Catherine Orenstein reports, the Times "spent over three times as many column inches discussing Aristide's alleged transgressions  it spent reporting on the ongoing military repression. Mass murders, executions, and tortures that were reported in human rights publications earned less than 4% of the space that the Times devoted to Haiti in those weeks." A week after the coup, the Washington Post accused Aristide of having organized his followers into "an instrument of real terror," ignoring the 75% reduction in human rights abuses during his term reported by human rights groups.14
While attention was directed to the really important topic of the "class-based violence" of Aristide and the popular movements, the U.S.-trained military and police were conducting their reign of terror, "ruthlessly suppressing Haiti's once diverse and vibrant civil society," Americas Watch reported. Though "Washington's capacity to curb attacks on civil society was tremendous, this power was largely unexercised by the Bush administration," which "sought to convey an image of normalcy" while forcefully returning refugees. The terror is functional: it ensures that even if Aristide is permitted to return, "he would have difficulty transforming his personal popularity into the organized support needed to exert civilian authority," Americas Watch observed in early 1993, quoting priests and others who feared that the destruction of the popular social organizations that "gave people hope" had already undermined the great promise of Haiti's first democratic experiment.15
The coup and ensuing terror revived the flow of refugees that had lapsed under Aristide. The Bush Administration ordered the Coast Guard and Navy to force them back, or to imprison them in the U.S. military base in Guantanamo until a court order terminated the shocking practices there. During the presidential campaign, Clinton bitterly condemned these cruel policies. On taking over in January 1993, he at once tightened the noose, imposing a still harsher blockade. Forceful return of refugees continued in violation of international law and human rights conventions. Clinton's increased brutality proved to be a grand success. Refugee flow, which had reached over 30,000 in 1992, sharply declined under Clinton's ministrations, to about the level of 1989, before the sharp decline under Aristide.16
The official story is that these are "economic refugees," not victims of political persecution who would be eligible for asylum. The onset of poverty can be quite precisely dated: to the date of the coup. During Aristide's term, refugee flow was slight, skyrocketing after the coup though economic sanctions were minimal. These oddities are noted by the indispensable journal Haiti Info published in Port-au-Prince, in a discussion of a cable circulated to high officials by U.S. Ambassador William Swing. The 11-page cable, full of racist slanders, alleges that "the Haitian left manipulates and fabricates human rights abuses as a propaganda tool" and is "wittingly or unwittingly assisted in this effort" by human rights organizations and the civilian monitors of the UN and OAS missions; all "comsymps" in the terminology of an earlier day. The Embassy dismissed with a sneer the reports of "the sudden epidemic of rapes" on the grounds that "For a range of cultural reasons (not pleasant to contemplate), rape has never been considered or reported as a serious crime here." The testimony of a man that his wife was raped and that he was badly beaten under police custody, corroborated by a foreign nurse, is dismissed because he chose asylum in Canada (granted at once), avoiding the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) -- a transparent admission of iniquity. Clinton's Embassy attributes problems in Haiti to "a high level of structural, or endemic, violence," which, again, is just "part of the culture." Like the poverty that causes refugee flight, the "structural" factors causing violence had an unexplained 8-month gap: during Aristide's tenure even his most vehement opponents, the USAID-supported "human rights" advocates who moved quickly into power after the coup, could compile only 25 cases of "mob violence" and four crimes that could be considered political, a tiny fraction of the terror before, not to speak of the atrocities that followed the coup.
Kenneth Roth, the director of Human Rights Watch, comments that the cable reveals the "extreme antipathy for Aristide" in the Embassy and its "willingness to play down human rights abuses to prevent a political momentum to build for  return." It "reflects a dislike and distrust of Aristide that has been widely felt in the Administration -- though voiced only privately," Times correspondent Elaine Sciolino adds. In reality, the dislike is quite public and widely reported, along with the fact that it has sent a very clear message to the Haitian rulers, military and civilian.17
As the Embassy cable was released, an experienced INS asylum officer in Haiti went public with his charges that thousands of "egregious cases of persecution" were rejected by the Haitian INS office, where the "entire process" of asylum review "had been politicized" and under 1% of legitimate petitions were accepted by racist and contemptuous officials; similar accounts have been documented by human rights organizations, who have also denounced the very idea that petitioners should have to identify themselves to the murderers by appearing at the INS office. At the same time, a "Top Secret" memo of the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba was leaked. Addressed to the Secretary of State, the CIA, and the INS, the document complains about the lack of genuine claims of political persecution in Cuba, contrary to policy needs. The usual silence prevailed.18
Meanwhile refugees from Cuba receive royal treatment while Haitians are returned to terror. That is nothing new. Of the more than 24,000 Haitians intercepted by U.S. forces from 1981 to Aristide's takeover in 1991, 11 were granted asylum as victims of political persecution, in comparison with 75,000 out of 75,000 Cubans. In these years of terror, Washington allowed 28 asylum claims. During Aristide's tenure, with violence and repression radically reduced, 20 were allowed from a refugee pool perhaps 1/50th the scale. Practice returned to normal after the military coup and the renewed terror. As always, human rights are understood in purely instrumental terms: as a weapon to be selectively deployed for power interests, nothing more.
The democratically elected President will be acceptable to Washington and elite opinion generally only if he abandons his popular mandate, ceding effective power to the "moderates" in the business world. The "moderates" are those who do not favor slaughter and mutilation, preferring to see the population driven to agroexport and the low-wage assembly sector. They constitute "civil society," in the technical sense. Since the coup, the U.S. has demanded that Aristide agree to "broaden the government" in such a way as to place the "moderates" in power. Insofar as he refuses to transfer power into these proper hands, he is an "extremist" whom we can hardly support.
While these are the basic terms of respectable discourse, the spectrum is not entirely uniform. It ranges from the far right, which is honest and outspoken in its call for dismantling Haitian democracy, to the more nuanced versions of the liberal Democrats. Taking a stand in the middle, George Bush calls for abandoning Aristide because "he has become unreliable" and even "turned on our president the other day" (May 1994). Aristide should be dumped because his "undemocratic behavior...included fostering violence against his opponents," according to another noted pacifist who has distinguished himself particularly for his dedication to legality and democratic principle (Elliott Abrams).
Moving toward the liberal end, a Clinton official explained in the last days of 1993 that "We're not talking about dumping Aristide or about military power-sharing. But we have two adversaries who don't want to compromise and we have to find enough of a middle to make a functioning democracy," marginalizing the extremists on both sides. The elected President should be "restored to power, at least nominally," World Peace Foundation president and historian Robert Rotberg added; but also at most nominally, as all understand. The Washington director of the Inter-American Dialogue, Peter Hakim, urged in May 1994 that "the US ought to separate out the notion of protecting human rights, and reestablishing some semblance of society in Haiti, from restoring Aristide to power." "So it is only honest for the United States to tell Father Aristide that he has little hope of returning to power without making large political compromises," as the Times editors phrased the common understanding a few weeks later. In short, the traditional "prodemocracy policies."19 The basic idea was outlined by Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his confirmation hearings. Christopher "expressed support for Father Aristide," Elaine Sciolino reported, "but stopped short of calling for his reinstatement as President. `There is no question in my mind that because of the election, he has to be part of the solution to this,' Mr. Christopher said. `I don't have a precise system worked out in my mind as to how he would be part of the solution, but certainly he cannot be ignored in the matter'.20 With this ringing endorsement of democracy, the Clinton Administration took charge.
Across the spectrum, it is taken for granted that we have both the right and the competence to "establish some semblance of society" in Haiti, whose people are so retrograde as to have developed a "remarkably advanced" array of grass-roots organizations that gave the majority of the population a place in the public arena. Plainly, they desperately need our tutelage.
4. The Clinton Compromise
To much acclaim, Washington finally succeeded in compelling Aristide to transfer authority to the "moderates." Under severe pressure, in July 1993 the Haitian President accepted the U.S.-UN terms for settlement, which were to allow him to return four months later in a "compromise" with the gangsters and killers. He agreed to appoint as Prime Minister a businessman from the traditional mulatto elite, Robert Malval, who is "known to be opposed to the populist policies during Aristide's seven months in power," the press announced with relief, noting that he is "generally well regarded by the business community," "respected by many businessmen who supported the coup that ousted the President," and seen as "a reassuring choice" by coup-supporters.
Shortly after these happy developments took place, UN/OAS observers reported, with little notice, that they were "very concerned that there is no perceptible lessening of human rights violations," and a few weeks later, reported an increase in "arbitrary executions and suspicious deaths" in the weeks following the UN-brokered accord, over one a day in the Port-au-Prince area alone; "the mission said that many of the victims were members of popular organizations and neighborhood associations and that some of the killers were police," wire services reported.21
Expected to be a transitional figure, Malval resigned at the year's end. His presence did, however, serve a useful role for Washington and its media, diverting attention to a "political settlement" while attacks on the popular organizations and general terror mounted, Aristide's promised return was blocked, and new initiatives were put forth to transfer power to traditional power centers ("broadening the government"). Malval's presence also offered the press a great method to bring out Aristide's unreasonable intransigence. He couldn't even come to terms with "his handpicked Prime Minister," a phrase that ritually accompanied the name "Robert Malval." In a typical exercise, Howard French opened a report of Malval's resignation by writing: "Three days after formally resigning, the handpicked Prime Minister of Haiti's exiled President lashed out this weekend at the man who appointed him" -- hammering home the message in the fashion that became so routine as to be comical. Malval described Aristide as an "erratic figure" with a "serious ego problem," French continued, referring to his commitment to restore the democratically-elected government.22
As the date for Aristide's scheduled October 30 return approached, atrocities mounted high enough to gain some attention, though no action. Amidst reports of "terrifying stories" of terror, murder, and threats to exterminate all members of the popular organizations, the Clinton Administration announced that the UN Mission "will rely on the Haitian military and police to maintain order" -- that is, on the killers. "It is not a peacekeeping role," Secretary of Defense Aspin explained: "We are doing something other than peacekeeping here." Meanwhile, the press emphasized the concerns of U.S. officials that Aristide "isn't moving strongly to restore democratic rights," from his exile in Washington. "Even as the situation has grown worse, foreign diplomats have increasingly blamed Father Aristide for what they say is his failure to take constructive initiatives," Howard French wrote, using the standard device to disguise propaganda as reporting.23
The stage was set for ignoring the October deadline, as the U.S. stood helplessly by, unable to bring the uncompromising and violent extremists on both sides to accept "democracy."
Reviewing these mid-1993 developments, Ian Martin, who directed the OAS/UN mission from April through December 1993, writes that one basic problem was U.S. insistence on adding "a mostly American military component to the negotiators' proposals." Aristide's call for reducing the Haitian army to 1000 men was rejected. "The Haitian high command, for its part, sought U.S. assistance to ensure the army's future." The generals trusted the U.S. and "mistrusted the U.N. and the proposal for the Canadians and French, both more committed supporters of Aristide than the United States, to take the lead in the police contingent. The U.S. hoped to preserve the military -- an institution it had often assisted and in fact had created for purposes of internal control during the American occupation of 1915-34." Haitian army "resistance was encouraged whenever they perceived that the United States, despite its rhetoric of democracy, was ambivalent about that power shift" to the popular elements represented by Aristide. There was no shortage of such occasions.
The crucial signal, Martin and others agree, came on October 11, when the USS Harlan County was scheduled to disembark U.S. and Canadian troops at Port-au-Prince. The military organized "a hostile demonstration of armed thugs," Martin observes, and "instead of waiting in the harbor while the Haitian military was pressured to ensure a safe landing, the Harlan County turned tail for Guantanamo Bay," leaving officials of the UN/OAS mission "aghast"; they "had been neither consulted nor informed of the decision by President Bill Clinton's National Security Council to retreat." "The organizers of the Haitian protest could hardly believe their success," Martin continues. The leader of the paramilitary organization FRAPH, responsible for much of the terror, said that "My people kept wanting to run away, but I took the gamble and urged them to stay. Then the Americans pulled out! We were astonished. That was the day FRAPH was actually born. Before, everyone said we were crazy, suicidal, that we would all be burned if Aristide returned. But now we know he is never going to return." The military got the message too, loud and clear.
Perhaps they were even notified in advance. New York Daily News correspondent Juan Gonzalez learned of the October 11 port demonstration the day before at a Duvalierist meeting attended by U.S. Embassy personnel. The following day, he asked in print: "How can two Daily News reporters who have only visited Haiti on a few occasions learn beforehand of secret plans to sabotage the landing of our troops, while our vaunted officialdom claims it was caught flat-footed?" How indeed.
Another possible line of communication is suggested in a report by Father Antoine Adrien, former head of Aristide's religious order in Haiti and a close associate. Just before the ship "turned tail," he informed the Catholic Church press that Haitian military officers had not only attended training school in Fort Benning, Ga., in 1992, but that "some were there as recently as the previous week" -- October 1993. "How are you going to tell those people they have no backing in the United States?," Father Adrien asked. That Haitian army officers received training in the U.S. after the coup was confirmed in an internal Pentagon document, including eight officers who started courses in early 1992. The program they joined is designed to expose "future leaders of foreign defense establishments" to "American values, regard for human rights and democratic institutions," according to the Defense Secretary's report to the President for 1993. Earlier graduates include the leading killers in Haiti, Central America, and elsewhere.
What lay behind the decision to turn tail was explained by Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe, who "boasted at a cocktail party that by turning back the U.S.S. Harlan County, he had helped save the United States from a `small war'," the Times reported six months later: "He vowed that the Pentagon would not risk American soldiers' lives to put `that psychopath' back in power."24
While messages were coming through to the military, the Haitian people were deprived of the one voice they longed to hear. "Senior Clinton administration officials are embroiled in a fight over whether to allow...Aristide to broadcast into the junta-ruled country using airborne U.S. military transmitters," Paul Quinn-Judge reported in May 1994. The USIA is opposed, fearing that "the plan may violate international law," always a prime concern in Washington. USIA was also concerned that such broadcasts "would provide Aristide with an uncomfortably direct means to communicate with Haitians, who elected him by an overwhelming margin in 1990." His oratory has been known to "create problems," a classifed USIA memorandum of May 23 noted, asking whether "we wish to have the responsibility for having given him the means to broadcast whatever he chooses to Haiti." He might even challenge the U.S. publicly "the first time we refuse to air something." It wouldn't even suffice to have him submit his scripts in advance, because of the "highly nuanced language and context" of a radio broadcast; who knows what thoughts this devious creature might convey by his tone of voice? "Debate over the idea...underscores the continuing ambivalence and nervousness with which some senior officials view Aristide," Quinn-Judge observed.25
After the military coup, the OAS instituted a toothless embargo, which the Bush Administration reluctantly joined, while making clear that it was not to be taken seriously. The reasons were explained a year later by Howard French: "Washington's deep-seated ambivalence about a leftward-tilting nationalist whose style diplomats say has sometimes been disquietingly erratic" precludes any meaningful support for sanctions against the military rulers. "Despite much blood on the army's hands, United States diplomats consider it a vital counterweight to Father Aristide, whose class-struggle rhetoric...threatened or antagonized traditional power centers at home and abroad." Aristide's "call for punishment of the military leadership" that had slaughtered and tortured thousands of people "reinforced a view of him as an inflexible and vindictive crusader," and heightened Washington's "antipathy" towards the "clumsy" and "erratic" extremist who has aroused great "anger" because of "his tendency toward ingratitude."26
The "vital counterweight" is therefore to hold total power while the "leftward tilting nationalist" remains in exile, awaiting the "eventual return" that Bill Clinton promised on the eve of his inauguration. Meanwhile, the "traditional power centers" in Haiti and the U.S. will carry on with class struggle as usual, employing such terror as may be needed in order for plunder to proceed unhampered. And as the London Financial Times added at the same time, Washington was proving oddly ineffective in detecting the "lucrative use of the country in the transhipment of narcotics" by which "the military is funding its oil and other necessary imports," financing the necessary terror and rapacity -- though U.S. forces seem able to find every fishing boat carrying miserable refugees. Nor had Washington figured out a way to freeze the assets of "civil society" or to hinder their shopping trips to Miami and New York, or to induce its Dominican clients to monitor the border to impede the flow of goods that takes care of the wants of "civil society" while the embargo remains "at best, sieve-like."27
Meanwhile Washington continued to provide Haitian military leaders with intelligence on narcotics trafficking -- which they naturally used to expedite their activities and tighten their grip on power. It is not easy to intercept narcotraffickers, the press explained, because "Haiti has no radar," and evidently the U.S. Navy and Air Force lack the means to remedy this deficiency.28
Under Clinton, matters only got worse. An April 1994 report of Human Rights Watch/Americas documents the increasing terror and State Department apologetics and evasions, condemning the Administration for having "embraced a murderous armed force as a counterweight to a populist president it distrusts."
On February 4, 1992, the Bush Administration lifted the embargo for assembly plants, "under heavy pressure from American businesses with interests in Haiti," the Washington Post reported, with its editorial endorsement; the lobbying effort was assisted by Elliott Abrams, Human Rights Watch noted. For January-October 1992, U.S. trade with Haiti came to $265 million, according to the Department of Commerce.29
As Clinton took over, the embargo became still more porous. The Dominican border was left wide open. Meanwhile, U.S. companies continued to be exempted from the embargo -- so as to ease its effects on the population, the Administration announced with a straight face; only exemptions for U.S. firms have this curious feature. There were many heartfelt laments about the suffering of poor Haitians under the embargo, but one had to turn to the underground press in Haiti, the alternative media here, or an occasional letter to learn that the major peasant organization (MPP), church coalitions, labor organizations, and the National Federation of Haitian Students continued to call for a real embargo.30
Curiously, some of those most distressed by the impact of the embargo on the Haitian poor were the most forceful advocates of a still harsher embargo on Cuba, notably liberal Democrat Robert Torricelli, author of the stepped-up embargo that the Bush Administration accepted under pressure from the Clintonites. Evidently, hunger causes no pain to Cuban children, another oddity that passed unnoticed, along with the U.S.-Haiti trade figures.
Clinton's tinkering with the embargo also passed without comment here, though the facts are known, and occasionally even leak through, as in a tiny Feb. 13 Reuters dispatch in the New York Times reporting efforts of human rights advocates to convince the President to observe the embargo. "US imports from Haiti rose by more than half last year ," the Financial Times reported in London, "thanks in part to an exemption granted by the US Treasury for imports of goods assembled in Haiti from US parts." U.S. exports to Haiti also rose in 1993. Exports from Haiti to the United States included food (fruits and nuts, citrus fruit or melons) from the starving country, which increased by a factor of 35 from January-July 1992 to January-July 1993. The federal government was among the purchasers of the baseballs imported from Haiti (duty free), stitched by women who work 11 hour days with a half-hour break in unbearable heat without running water or a working toilet, for 10 cents an hour if they can meet the quota (few can), using toxic materials without protection so that the U.S. importer can advertise proudly that their softballs are "hand-dipped for maximum bonding." The manufacturers are the wealthy Haitian families who supported the coup and have gained new riches during the embargo, along with others profiting handsomely from the black market, such as the fuel supplier for the U.S. embassy. The "assembly zone" loophole, criticized by U.S. labor unions and at the UN Security Council by France and Canada in January, was extended by the Clinton Administration on April 25, 1994, four days after announcing that it would seek to tighten UN sanctions; the latter announcement was reported. On the same day, the U.S. Coast Guard returned 98 refugees to military authorities, 18 of them at once arrested.
"The Clinton administration still formally declares its support for Mr Aristide, but scarcely disguises its wish for a leader more accommodating to the military," the Financial Times reported, while "European diplomats in Washington are scathing in their comments on what they see as the US's abdication of leadership over Haiti."31
In his January 1994 testimony to Congress on "Threats to the U.S. and Its Interests Abroad," the Director of the CIA predicted that Haiti "probably will be out of fuel and power very shortly." "Our intelligence efforts are focused on detecting attempts to circumvent the embargo and monitoring its impact," and "any indication of an imminent exodus." The "Threats to the U.S." were contained with the usual selectivity and skill. "Exodus" from the charnel house was effectively blocked, while the press reported an "oil boom" as "diplomats expressed amazement at the extent of the trafficking" organized by the Haitian and Dominican armies, and the former assured reporters that "The military is not concerned about fuel shortages; it has plenty.32
The Clinton Administration has scarcely departed from the prescriptions outlined by the Washington Post and New York Times as it came into office.33 The preferred solution, John Goshko explained in the Post, would "delay indefinitely" the return to Haiti of the "radical priest with anti-American leanings" whose "strident populism led the Haitian armed forces to seize power," and would "allow Bazin or some other prime minister to govern in his place." Bazin was then prime minister under army rule, but was having problems, because although "well-known and well-regarded in the United States," unfortunately "the masses in Haiti consider him a front man for military and business interests." A replacement would therefore be needed to represent the interests of the moderates. In the Times, Howard French indicated the scale of the required delay: "In the past, diplomats have said the Haitian President could return only after a substantial interim period during which the country's economy was revived and all its institutions, from the army itself to the judiciary to health care and education, were stabilized." That should overcome the danger of Aristide's "personalist and electoralist politics." But unfortunately, the troublesome priest has been recalcitrant: "Father Aristide and many of his supporters have held out for a quick return," undermining the moderate course.
As understood on all sides, the "delay" need not be too long. Aristide's term ends in 1996, and he is barred from running again. By then military terror should have sufficiently intimidated the population and demolished popular organizations so that "free elections" can be tolerated, as in the Central American terror states, without too much fear of any threat to "civil society" from the rabble.
5. The May 1994 Reversal
Plans proceeded on course into early 1994. By then, the cynicism and brutality of U.S. policy had become too blatant for the usual cover-up, particularly after Clinton's point man Lawrence Pezzullo revealed in congressional testimony that the plan that the Administration had touted as the product of negotiations among Haitian democrats, denouncing Aristide for his intransigence in rejecting it (it made no provision for his return), had in fact been produced by the State Department, which brought to Washington selected Haitians to ratify it, among them Duvalierist collaborators of the murderous police chief Col. Francois. Something new was needed.
Pezzullo was replaced by William Gray, a more credible voice. In May Clinton instituted a new and more humane refugee policy, which "will mean the forcible return of 95 percent of boat people instead of 100 percent," a Human Rights Watch Haiti analyst observed, pointing out that "The US policy excludes people who are not high profile but are persecuted nonetheless." The new policy is just "window dressing," the national refugee coordinator of Amnesty International added.
But 5% of the boat people fleeing persecution is beyond what the United States can be expected to handle. It will "devastate Florida," a Republican congressional staff member complained. Explaining a few days later why the U.S. might have to invade, "Mr. Clinton saved his strongest warning for what he described as `the continuous possibility' that Haitians left poor and desperate under military rule would join in a `massive outflow' and seek refuge in the United States," the Times reported; the terms "poor and desperate" convey the doctrine that these are economic refugees. Overcrowded and destitute, the United States plainly cannot bear the burden of accepting refugees or even housing them until their claims of persecution are rejected; and surely it has no historical responsibilities in the matter. The President piteously pleaded with other countries to help us in our plight.34
Curiously, the anguished debate over this issue missed the obvious candidate: Tanzania, which had just then accommodated hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, and could surely come to the rescue of the beleaguered United States by accepting a few thousand more black faces.
On May 21, an embargo was announced which, for the first time, may have some serious intent. The "assembly plant" exemption was quietly removed, and the Dominican border was (at least briefly) closed. The long-known involvement of the Haitian military in narcotrafficking was also officially reported. "We're not going to say, `Let the masses and the middle class suffer, but the very wealthy don't have to pay a price," a senior Administration official stated. "Even Wealthy Haitians Starting to Feel Pinched," a Times headline read, again letting out the real story of the efforts to "restore democracy" during the 2 1/2 years since the coup. Government statements and press reports tacitly conceded what had always been clear: that the U.S. has the means, far short of military intervention, to restore democracy in Haiti, but had no intention of doing so, and still does not. What has always been required is a clear declaration of intent to restore democracy, but that cannot be given, because there is no such intent. The military and their civilian allies understand that perfectly well.
In the following weeks, the U.S. banned commercial air flights and financial transactions, while leaving crucial loopholes open. Personal assets of the coup supporters were not frozen, so they can withdraw funds from U.S. bank accounts at will and transfer money to banks abroad, Administration officials acknowledged -- a matter that may be academic, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Kweisi Mfume, observed, since "the dictators of Haiti have long ago moved their assets in anticipation of this." The sanctions also permit the families that have long dominated the economy to hold on to the monopoly of the food trade that is a major source of their wealth, including the Mevs family, which is building "a huge new oil depot here to help the army defy the embargo," French reported, adding that "Washington's hesitancy in taking firm action against the business elite and the army is a result of a long history of close ties and perceived common interests," if not fear of "a spate of embarrassing revelations made by Haitians in reprisal for a crackdown."
After sanctions were finally imposed in May 1994, a U.S. diplomat conceded that the continuing failure to move against the richest families has left "a perception out there of sending mixed messages and having double agendas." Other diplomats and Haitian experts agree that the decision not to target key civilian supporters of the coup is yet another mixed signal, noting particularly the relief granted the Mev, Brandt, Acra and Madsen families, who "still have a role to play," a U.S. Embassy source informed the press, though they have made no effort to disguise their support for the coup. Washington is "imposing sanctions designed to strangle the country into restoring Aristide at the same time they are telling the people who backed the coup and are in business with the military in keeping Aristide out that they are free to lead their privileged lives," another diplomat said. Haitian Senators who lead the anti-Aristide movement were not denied their permanent U.S. resident status, including Bernard Sansaricq, who played a leading role in installing the puppet civilian government with its new "president" Emile Jonassaint, appointed to replace Aristide.35
Meanwhile, the serious work of undermining the basis for democracy continues unhampered. By the time Clinton took office, as Americas Watch reported, the terror had already decimated the popular organizations that would allow Aristide "to exert civilian authority," even if he were eventually permitted to return. As Clinton finally agreed to sanctions 16 months later, Douglas Farah reported in the Washington Post that "the army and its allies have damaged democratic institutions and grass-roots organizations that had begun to grow in Haiti to such an extent that they would take years to rebuild even if Haiti's military leaders surrendered power, according to diplomats and human rights monitors." "The Duvalierist system will continue, with or without the return of Aristide," the leader of a now-clandestine pro-Aristide group said, a judgment endorsed by "a veteran human rights worker" who prefers anonymity "because of numerous threats against his life." "The Duvialierists have many fine days ahead of them in this country," he said: "People are losing their ability to make things happen here, and it will take many years to reverse that under the best of circumstances." Even nonpolitical community organizations have been repressed, thousands of community leaders have been driven into hiding along with hundreds of thousands of others, while over 4000 have been murdered outright. The "massive terrorism," Farah reports, is "aimed at dismantling the last vestiges of organized support" for Aristide, while the civilian allies of the army and police in FRAPH have "become a very efficient machine of repression," which will remain the only authority even if Aristide were to return, the same human rights worker comments. Members of the popular organizations interviewed in hiding have "applied for political asylum at the U.S. Embassy and been denied.36
To ensure a smooth transition to the intended post-coup system, with the "moderates" in charge and the Duvalierists preserving order, FRAPH and USAID-funded groups linked to it are establishing a monopoly of social services, so that "the poor who are compliant and docile get health services," a Haitian doctor explains. This is the "soft side" of counterinsurgency, on the model of Guatemala and other terror states. Meanwhile we are to ponder the question of whether Haitians "can muster the maturity and cohesiveness to forge a working democracy" (Howard French), or whether we must labor for decades in a (perhaps vain) effort to overcome the defects -- cultural, if not genetic -- that had been discerned by Wilson's Secretary of State and Carter's USAID director in Haiti.37
As the Bush Administration prepared to hand over the reins, a senior UN official observed that its dislike of Aristide was an open secret: "Two lines about Haiti co-existed at the time. There was the line about `return to democracy,' which was for public consumption. And then there was a second line, spoken privately within the administration. And the Haitian military knew it perfectly well." A year later, after the Harlan County affair gave birth to FRAPH, a French military adviser updated the picture: "Do you know what the real problem is? The Americans don't want Aristide back, and they want the rest of us out" -- "the rest of us" being Canada, France and Venezuela, the other three of "Aristide's so-called Four Friends."38
That this judgment is exactly right has been apparent throughout. It should be clear, however, that the issue is not Aristide personally. The problem is the forces he represents: the lively and vibrant popular movements that swept him into office, greatly alarming the rich and powerful in Haiti and their American counterparts, and teaching lessons in democracy that have to be silenced, for who can tell what minds they might reach?

"Adieu, adieu! my native shore
Fades o'er the waters blue;
The night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,
And shrieks the wild sea-mew.
Yon Sun that sets upon the sea
We follow in his flight;
Farewell awhile to him and thee,
My native Land—Good Night!
"A few short hours and He will rise
To give the Morrow birth;
And I shall hail the main and skies,
But not my mother Earth.
Deserted is my own good Hall,
Its hearth is desolate;
Wild weeds are gathering on the wall;
My Dog howls at the gate.
"Come hither, hither, my little page
Why dost thou weep and wail?
Or dost thou dread the billows' rage,
Or tremble at the gale?
But dash the tear-drop from thine eye;
Our ship is swift and strong:
Our fleetest falcon scarce can fly
More merrily along."
"Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,
I fear not wave nor wind:
Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I
Am sorrowful in mind;
For I have from my father gone,
A mother whom I love,
And have no friend, save these alone,
But thee—and One above.

'My father blessed me fervently,
Yet did not much complain;
But sorely will my mother sigh
Till I come back again.'—
"Enough, enough, my little lad!
Such tears become thine eye;
If I thy guileless bosom had,
Mine own would not be dry.
"Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,
Why dost thou look so pale?
Or dost thou dread a French foeman?
Or shiver at the gale?"—
'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?
Sir Childe, I'm not so weak;
But thinking on an absent wife
Will blanch a faithful cheek.
'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,
Along the bordering Lake,
And when they on their father call,
What answer shall she make?'—
"Enough, enough, my yeoman good,
Thy grief let none gainsay;
But I, who am of lighter mood,
Will laugh to flee away.
"For who would trust the seeming sighs
Of wife or paramour?
Fresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes
We late saw streaming o'er.
For pleasures past I do not grieve,
Nor perils gathering near;
My greatest grief is that I leave
No thing that claims a tear.

"And now I'm in the world alone,
Upon the wide, wide sea:
But why should I for others groan,
When none will sigh for me?
Perchance my Dog will whine in vain,
Till fed by stranger hands;
But long ere I come back again,
He'd tear me where he stands.
"With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go
Athwart the foaming brine;
Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,
So not again to mine.
Welcome, welcome, ye dark-blue waves!
And when you fail my sight,
Welcome, ye deserts, and ye caves!
My native Land—Good Night!"
On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,
And winds are rude in Biscay's sleepless bay.
Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,
New shores descried make every bosom gay;
And Cintra's mountain greets them on their way,
And Tagus dashing onward to the Deep,
His fabled golden tribute bent to pay;
And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,
And steer 'twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.

Oh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see
What Heaven hath done for this delicious land!
What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!
What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!
But man would mar them with an impious hand:
And when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge
'Gainst those who most transgress his high command,
With treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge
Gaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge
What beauties doth Lisboa first unfold!
Her image floating on that noble tide,
Which poets vainly pave with sands of gold,
But now whereon a thousand keels did ride
Of mighty strength, since Albion was allied,
And to the Lusians did her aid afford:
A nation swoln with ignorance and pride,
Who lick yet loathe the hand that waves the sword
To save them from the wrath of Gaul's unsparing lord.
But whoso entereth within this town,
That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,
Disconsolate will wander up and down,
'Mid many things unsightly to strange ee;
For hut and palace show like filthily:
The dingy denizens are reared in dirt;
Ne personage of high or mean degree
Doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,
Though shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt.
Poor, paltry slaves! yet born 'midst noblest scenes—
Why, Nature, waste thy wonders on such men?
Lo! Cintra's glorious Eden intervenes
In variegated maze of mount and glen.
Ah, me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,
To follow half on which the eye dilates
Through views more dazzling unto mortal ken
Than those whereof such things the Bard relates,
Who to the awe-struck world unlocked Elysium's gates.
The horrid crags, by toppling convent crowned,
The cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,
The mountain-moss by scorching skies imbrowned,
The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,
The tender azure of the unruffled deep,
The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,
The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,
The vine on high, the willow branch below,
Mixed in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.

Then slowly climb the many-winding way,
And frequent turn to linger as you go,
From loftier rocks new loveliness survey,
And rest ye at "Our Lady's house of Woe;" 
Where frugal monks their little relics show,
And sundry legends to the stranger tell:
Here impious men have punished been, and lo!
Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,
In hope to merit Heaven by making earth a Hell.

And here and there, as up the crags you spring,
Mark many rude-carved crosses near the path:
Yet deem not these Devotion's offering—
These are memorials frail of murderous wrath:
For wheresoe'er the shrieking victim hath
Pour'd forth his blood beneath the assassin's knife,
Some hand erects a cross of mouldering lath;
And grove and glen with thousand such are rife
Throughout this purple land, where Law secures not life. 
On sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,
Are domes where whilome kings did make repair;
But now the wild flowers round them only breathe:
Yet ruined Splendour still is lingering there.
And yonder towers the Prince's palace fair:
There thou too, Vathek! England's wealthiest son,
Once formed thy Paradise, as not aware
When wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,
Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever won't to shun.
Here didst thou dwell, here schemes of pleasure plan,
Beneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow:
But now, as if a thing unblest by Man,
Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as Thou!
Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow
To Halls deserted, portals gaping wide:
Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how
Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;
Swept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide!
Behold the hall where chiefs were late convened! 
Oh! dome displeasing unto British eye!
With diadem hight Foolscap, lo! a Fiend,
A little Fiend that scoffs incessantly,
There sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by
His side is hung a seal and sable scroll,
Where blazoned glare names known to chivalry,
And sundry signatures adorn the roll,
Whereat the Urchin points and laughs with all his soul.

Convention is the dwarfish demon styled
That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:
Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,
And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.
Here Folly dashed to earth the victor's plume,
And Policy regained what arms had lost:
For chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom!
Woe to the conquering, not the conquered host,
Since baffled Triumph droops on Lusitania's coast.
And ever since that martial Synod met,
Britannia sickens, Cintra! at thy name;
And folks in office at the mention fret,
And fain would blush, if blush they could, for shame.
How will Posterity the deed proclaim!
Will not our own and fellow-nations sneer,
To view these champions cheated of their fame,
By foes in fight o'erthrown, yet victors here,
Where Scorn her finger points through many a coming year?

So deemed the Childe, as o'er the mountains he
Did take his way in solitary guise:
Sweet was the scene, yet soon he thought to flee,
More restless than the swallow in the skies:
Though here awhile he learned to moralise,
For Meditation fixed at times on him;
And conscious Reason whispered to despise
His early youth, misspent in maddest whim;
But as he gazed on truth his aching eyes grew dim.
To horse! to horse! he quits, for ever quits
A scene of peace, though soothing to his soul:
Again he rouses from his moping fits,
But seeks not now the harlot and the bowl.
Onward he flies, nor fixed as yet the goal
Where he shall rest him on his pilgrimage;
And o'er him many changing scenes must roll
Ere toil his thirst for travel can assuage,
Or he shall calm his breast, or learn experience sage.
Yet Mafra shall one moment claim delay, 
Where dwelt of yore the Lusians' luckless queen;
And Church and Court did mingle their array,
And Mass and revel were alternate seen;
Lordlings and freres—ill-sorted fry I ween!
But here the Babylonian Whore hath built
A dome, where flaunts she in such glorious sheen,
That men forget the blood which she hath spilt,
And bow the knee to Pomp that loves to varnish guilt.
O'er vales that teem with fruits, romantic hills,
(Oh, that such hills upheld a freeborn race!)
Whereon to gaze the eye with joyaunce fills,
Childe Harold wends through many a pleasant place.
Though sluggards deem it but a foolish chase,
And marvel men should quit their easy chair,
The toilsome way, and long, long league to trace,
Oh! there is sweetness in the mountain air,
And Life, that bloated Ease can never hope to share.
More bleak to view the hills at length recede,
And, less luxuriant, smoother vales extend:
Immense horizon-bounded plains succeed!
Far as the eye discerns, withouten end,
Spain's realms appear whereon her shepherds tend
Flocks, whose rich fleece right well the trader knows—
Now must the Pastor's arm his lambs defend:
For Spain is compassed by unyielding foes,
And all must shield their all, or share Subjection's woes.

Where Lusitania and her Sister meet,
Deem ye what bounds the rival realms divide?
Or ere the jealous Queens of Nations greet,
Doth Tayo interpose his mighty tide?
Or dark Sierras rise in craggy pride?
Or fence of art, like China's vasty wall?—
Ne barrier wall, ne river deep and wide,
Ne horrid crags, nor mountains dark and tall,
Rise like the rocks that part Hispania's land from Gaul:
But these between a silver streamlet glides,
And scarce a name distinguisheth the brook,
Though rival kingdoms press its verdant sides:
Here leans the idle shepherd on his crook,
And vacant on the rippling waves doth look,
That peaceful still 'twixt bitterest foemen flow;
For proud each peasant as the noblest duke:
Well doth the Spanish hind the difference know
'Twixt him and Lusian slave, the lowest of the low. 

But ere the mingling bounds have far been passed,
Dark Guadiana rolls his power along
In sullen billows, murmuring and vast,
So noted ancient roundelays among.
Whilome upon his banks did legions throng
Of Moor and Knight, in mailéd splendour drest:
Here ceased the swift their race, here sunk the strong;
The Paynim turban and the Christian crest
Mixed on the bleeding stream, by floating hosts oppressed.
Oh, lovely Spain! renowned, romantic Land!
Where is that standard which Pelagio bore,
When Cava's traitor-sire first called the band
That dyed thy mountain streams with Gothic gore? 
Where are those bloody Banners which of yore
Waved o'er thy sons, victorious to the gale,
And drove at last the spoilers to their shore?
Red gleamed the Cross, and waned the Crescent pale,
While Afric's echoes thrilled with Moorish matrons' wail.
Teems not each ditty with the glorious tale?
Ah! such, alas! the hero's amplest fate!
When granite moulders and when records fail,
A peasant's plaint prolongs his dubious date.
Pride! bend thine eye from Heaven to thine estate,
See how the Mighty shrink into a song!
Can Volume, Pillar, Pile preserve thee great?
Or must thou trust Tradition's simple tongue,
When Flattery sleeps with thee, and History does thee wrong?
Awake, ye Sons of Spain! awake! advance!
Lo! Chivalry, your ancient Goddess, cries,
But wields not, as of old, her thirsty lance,
Nor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies:
Now on the smoke of blazing bolts she flies,
And speaks in thunder through yon engine's roar:
In every peal she calls—"Awake! arise!"
Say, is her voice more feeble than of yore,
When her war-song was heard on Andalusia's shore?
Hark!—heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note?
Sounds not the clang of conflict on the heath?
Saw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote,
Nor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath
Tyrants and Tyrants' slaves?—the fires of Death,
The Bale-fires flash on high:—from rock to rock!
Each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe;
Death rides upon the sulphury Siroc,
Red Battle stamps his foot, and Nations feel the shock.
Lo! where the Giant on the mountain stands,
His blood-red tresses deepening in the Sun,
With death-shot glowing in his fiery hands,
And eye that scorcheth all it glares upon;
Restless it rolls, now fixed, and now anon
Flashing afar,—and at his iron feet
Destruction cowers, to mark what deeds are done;
For on this morn three potent Nations meet,
To shed before his Shrine the blood he deems most sweet.
By Heaven! it is a splendid sight to see
(For one who hath no friend, no brother there)
Their rival scarfs of mixed embroidery,
Their various arms that glitter in the air!
What gallant War-hounds rouse them from their lair,
And gnash their fangs, loud yelling for the prey!
All join the chase, but few the triumph share;
The Grave shall bear the chiefest prize away,
And Havoc scarce for joy can number their array.
Three hosts combine to offer sacrifice;
Three tongues prefer strange orisons on high;
Three gaudy standards flout the pale blue skies;
The shouts are France, Spain, Albion, Victory!
The Foe, the Victim, and the fond Ally
That fights for all, but ever fights in vain,
Are met—as if at home they could not die—
To feed the crow on Talavera's plain,
And fertilise the field that each pretends to gain.
There shall they rot—Ambition's honoured fools!
Yes, Honour decks the turf that wraps their clay!
Vain Sophistry! in these behold the tools,
The broken tools, that Tyrants cast away
By myriads, when they dare to pave their way
With human hearts—to what?—a dream alone.
Can Despots compass aught that hails their sway?
Or call with truth one span of earth their own,
Save that wherein at last they crumble bone by bone?
Oh, Albuera! glorious field of grief!
As o'er thy plain the Pilgrim pricked his steed,
Who could foresee thee, in a space so brief,
A scene where mingling foes should boast and bleed!
Peace to the perished! may the warrior's meed
And tears of triumph their reward prolong!
Till others fall where other chieftains lead
Thy name shall circle round the gaping throng,
And shine in worthless lays, the theme of transient song.

Enough of Battle's minions! let them play
Their game of lives, and barter breath for fame:
Fame that will scarce reanimate their clay,
Though thousands fall to deck some single name.
In sooth 'twere sad to thwart their noble aim
Who strike, blest hirelings! for their country's good,
And die, that living might have proved her shame;
Perished, perchance, in some domestic feud,
Or in a narrower sphere wild Rapine's path pursued.
Full swiftly Harold wends his lonely way
Where proud Sevilla triumphs unsubdued:
Yet is she free? the Spoiler's wished-for prey!
Soon, soon shall Conquest's fiery foot intrude,
Blackening her lovely domes with traces rude.
Inevitable hour! 'Gainst fate to strive
Where Desolation plants her famished brood
Is vain, or Ilion, Tyre might yet survive,
And Virtue vanquish all, and Murder cease to thrive

But all unconscious of the coming doom,
The feast, the song, the revel here abounds;
Strange modes of merriment the hours consume,
Nor bleed these patriots with their country's wounds:
Nor here War's clarion, but Love's rebeck sounds;
Here Folly still his votaries inthralls;
And young-eyed Lewdness walks her midnight rounds:
Girt with the silent crimes of Capitals,
Still to the last kind Vice clings to the tott'ring walls.
Not so the rustic—with his trembling mate
He lurks, nor casts his heavy eye afar,
Lest he should view his vineyard desolate,
Blasted below the dun hot breath of War.
No more beneath soft Eve's consenting star
Fandango twirls his jocund castanet:
Ah, Monarchs! could ye taste the mirth ye mar,
Not in the toils of Glory would ye fret;
The hoarse dull drum would sleep, and Man be happy yet!
How carols now the lusty muleteer?
Of Love, Romance, Devotion is his lay,
As whilome he was won't the leagues to cheer,
His quick bells wildly jingling on the way?
No! as he speeds, he chants "Vivā el Rey!" 
And checks his song to execrate Godoy,
The royal wittol Charles, and curse the day
When first Spain's queen beheld the black-eyed boy,
And gore-faced Treason sprung from her adulterate joy.
On yon long level plain, at distance crowned
With crags, whereon those Moorish turrets rest,
Wide-scattered hoof-marks dint the wounded ground;
And, scathed by fire, the greensward's darkened vest
Tells that the foe was Andalusia's guest:
Here was the camp, the watch-flame, and the host,
Here the bold peasant stormed the Dragon's nest;
Still does he mark it with triumphant boast,
And points to yonder cliffs, which oft were won and lost.
And whomsoe'er along the path you meet
Bears in his cap the badge of crimson hue,
Which tells you whom to shun and whom to greet: 
Woe to the man that walks in public view
Without of loyalty this token true:
Sharp is the knife, and sudden is the stroke;
And sorely would the Gallic foeman rue,
If subtle poniards, wrapt beneath the cloke,
Could blunt the sabre's edge, or clear the cannon's smoke.
At every turn Morena's dusky height
Sustains aloft the battery's iron load;
And, far as mortal eye can compass sight,
The mountain-howitzer, the broken road,
The bristling palisade, the fosse o'erflowed,
The stationed bands, the never-vacant watch,
The magazine in rocky durance stowed,
The bolstered steed beneath the shed of thatch,
The ball-piled pyramid, the ever-blazing match, 
Portend the deeds to come:—but he whose nod
Has tumbled feebler despots from their sway,
A moment pauseth ere he lifts the rod;
A little moment deigneth to delay:
Soon will his legions sweep through these their way;
The West must own the Scourger of the world.
Ah! Spain! how sad will be thy reckoning-day,
When soars Gaul's Vulture, with his wings unfurled,
And thou shall view thy sons in crowds to Hades hurled.
And must they fall? the young, the proud, the brave,
To swell one bloated Chiefs unwholesome reign?
No step between submission and a grave?
The rise of Rapine and the fall of Spain?
And doth the Power that man adores ordain
Their doom, nor heed the suppliant's appeal?
Is all that desperate Valour acts in vain?
And Counsel sage, and patriotic Zeal—
The Veteran's skill—Youth's fire—and Manhood's heart of steel?
Is it for this the Spanish maid, aroused,
Hangs on the willow her unstrung guitar,
And, all unsexed, the Anlace hath espoused,
Sung the loud song, and dared the deed of war?
And she, whom once the semblance of a scar
Appalled, an owlet's 'larum chilled with dread,
Now views the column-scattering bay'net jar,
The falchion flash, and o'er the yet warm dead
Stalks with Minerva's step where Mars might quake to tread.
Ye who shall marvel when you hear her tale,
Oh! had you known her in her softer hour,
Marked her black eye that mocks her coal-black veil,
Heard her light, lively tones in Lady's bower,
Seen her long locks that foil the painter's power,
Her fairy form, with more than female grace,
Scarce would you deem that Saragoza's tower
Beheld her smile in Danger's Gorgon face,
Thin the closed ranks, and lead in Glory's fearful chase.
Her lover sinks—she sheds no ill-timed tear;
Her Chief is slain—she fills his fatal post;
Her fellows flee—she checks their base career;
The Foe retires—she heads the sallying host:
Who can appease like her a lover's ghost?
Who can avenge so well a leader's fall?
What maid retrieve when man's flushed hope is lost?
Who hang so fiercely on the flying Gaul,
Foiled by a woman's hand, before a battered wall? 
Yet are Spain's maids no race of Amazons,
But formed for all the witching arts of love:
Though thus in arms they emulate her sons,
And in the horrid phalanx dare to move,
'Tis but the tender fierceness of the dove,
Pecking the hand that hovers o'er her mate:
In softness as in firmness far above
Remoter females, famed for sickening prate;
Her mind is nobler sure, her charms perchance as great.

The seal Love's dimpling finger hath impressed
Denotes how soft that chin which bears his touch: 
Her lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest,
Bid man be valiant ere he merit such:
Her glance how wildly beautiful! how much
Hath Phoebus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek,
Which glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!
Who round the North for paler dames would seek?
How poor their forms appear! how languid, wan, and weak!
Match me, ye climes! which poets love to laud;
Match me, ye harems of the land! where now
I strike my strain, far distant, to applaud
Beauties that ev'n a cynic must avow;
Match me those Houries, whom ye scarce allow
To taste the gale lest Love should ride the wind,
With Spain's dark-glancing daughters—deign to know,
There your wise Prophet's Paradise we find,
His black-eyed maids of Heaven, angelically kind.
Oh, thou Parnassus! whom I now survey, 
Not in the phrensy of a dreamer's eye,
Not in the fabled landscape of a lay,
But soaring snow-clad through thy native sky,
In the wild pomp of mountain-majesty!
What marvel if I thus essay to sing?
The humblest of thy pilgrims passing by
Would gladly woo thine Echoes with his string,
Though from thy heights no more one Muse will wave her wing.

Oft have I dreamed of Thee! whose glorious name
Who knows not, knows not man's divinest lore:
And now I view thee—'tis, alas, with shame
That I in feeblest accents must adore.
When I recount thy worshippers of yore
I tremble, and can only bend the knee;
Nor raise my voice, nor vainly dare to soar,
But gaze beneath thy cloudy canopy
In silent joy to think at last I look on Thee!
Happier in this than mightiest Bards have been,
Whose Fate to distant homes confined their lot,
Shall I unmoved behold the hallowed scene,
Which others rave of, though they know it not?
Though here no more Apollo haunts his Grot,
And thou, the Muses' seat, art now their grave,
Some gentle Spirit still pervades the spot,
Sighs in the gale, keeps silence in the Cave,
And glides with glassy foot o'er yon melodious wave.
Of thee hereafter.—Ev'n amidst my strain
I turned aside to pay my homage here;
Forgot the land, the sons, the maids of Spain;
Her fate, to every freeborn bosom dear;
And hailed thee, not perchance without a tear.
Now to my theme—but from thy holy haunt
Let me some remnant, some memorial bear;
Yield me one leaf of Daphne's deathless plant,
Nor let thy votary's hope be deemed an idle vaunt.
But ne'er didst thou, fair Mount! when Greece was young,
See round thy giant base a brighter choir,
Nor e'er did Delphi, when her Priestess sung
The Pythian hymn with more than mortal fire,
Behold a train more fitting to inspire
The song of love, than Andalusia's maids,
Nurst in the glowing lap of soft Desire:
Ah! that to these were given such peaceful shades
As Greece can still bestow, though Glory fly her glades.
Fair is proud Seville; let her country boast
Her strength, her wealth, her site of ancient days; 
But Cadiz, rising on the distant coast,
Calls forth a sweeter, though ignoble praise.
Ah, Vice! how soft are thy voluptuous ways!
While boyish blood is mantling, who can 'scape
The fascination of thy magic gaze?
A Cherub-Hydra round us dost thou gape,
And mould to every taste thy dear delusive shape.
When Paphos fell by Time—accurséd Time!
The Queen who conquers all must yield to thee—
The Pleasures fled, but sought as warm a clime;
And Venus, constant to her native Sea,
To nought else constant, hither deigned to flee,
And fixed her shrine within these walls of white:
Though not to one dome circumscribeth She
Her worship, but, devoted to her rite,
A thousand Altars rise, for ever blazing bright.
From morn till night, from night till startled Morn
Peeps blushing on the Revel's laughing crew,
The Song is heard, the rosy Garland worn;
Devices quaint, and Frolics ever new,
Tread on each other's kibes. A long adieu
He bids to sober joy that here sojourns:
Nought interrupts the riot, though in lieu
Of true devotion monkish incense burns,
And Love and Prayer unite, or rule the hour by turns.

The Sabbath comes, a day of blessed rest:
What hallows it upon this Christian shore?
Lo! it is sacred to a solemn Feast:
Hark! heard you not the forest-monarch's roar?
Crashing the lance, he snuffs the spouting gore
Of man and steed, o'erthrown beneath his horn;
The thronged arena shakes with shouts for more;
Yells the mad crowd o'er entrails freshly torn,
Nor shrinks the female eye, nor ev'n affects to mourn.
.
The seventh day this—the Jubilee of man!
London! right well thou know'st the day of prayer:
Then thy spruce citizen, washed artisan,
And smug apprentice gulp their weekly air:
Thy coach of hackney, whiskey, one-horse chair,
And humblest gig through sundry suburbs whirl,
To Hampstead, Brentford, Harrow make repair;
Till the tired jade the wheel forgets to hurl,
Provoking envious gibe from each pedestrian churl.
Some o'er thy Thamis row the ribboned fair,
Others along the safer turnpike fly;
Some Richmond-hill ascend, some scud to Ware,
And many to the steep of Highgate hie.
Ask ye, Boeotian Shades! the reason why? 
'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,
Grasped in the holy hand of Mystery,
In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,
And consecrate the oath with draught, and dance till morn.
All have their fooleries—not alike are thine,
Fair Cadiz, rising o'er the dark blue sea!
Soon as the Matin bell proclaimeth nine,
Thy Saint-adorers count the Rosary:
Much is the Virgin teased to shrive them free
(Well do I ween the only virgin there)
From crimes as numerous as her beadsmen be;
Then to the crowded circus forth they fare:
Young, old, high, low, at once the same diversion share.
The lists are oped, the spacious area cleared,
Thousands on thousands piled are seated round;
Long ere the first loud trumpet's note is heard,
Ne vacant space for lated wight is found:
Here Dons, Grandees, but chiefly Dames abound,
Skilled in the ogle of a roguish eye,
Yet ever well inclined to heal the wound;
None through their cold disdain are doomed to die,
As moon-struck bards complain, by Love's sad archery.
Hushed is the din of tongues—on gallant steeds,
With milk-white crest, gold spur, and light-poised lance,
Four cavaliers prepare for venturous deeds,
And lowly-bending to the lists advance;
Rich are their scarfs, their chargers featly prance:
If in the dangerous game they shine to-day,
The crowd's loud shout and ladies' lovely glance,
Best prize of better acts! they bear away,
And all that kings or chiefs e'er gain their toils repay.
In costly sheen and gaudy cloak arrayed.
But all afoot, the light-limbed Matadore
Stands in the centre, eager to invade
The lord of lowing herds; but not before
The ground, with cautious tread, is traversed o'er,
Lest aught unseen should lurk to thwart his speed:
His arms a dart, he fights aloof, nor more
Can Man achieve without the friendly steed—
Alas! too oft condemned for him to bear and bleed.
Thrice sounds the Clarion; lo! the signal falls,
The den expands, and Expectation mute
Gapes round the silent circle's peopled walls.
Bounds with one lashing spring the mighty brute,
And, wildly staring, spurns, with sounding foot,
The sand, nor blindly rushes on his foe:
Here, there, he points his threatening front, to suit
His first attack, wide-waving to and fro
His angry tail; red rolls his eye's dilated glow.

Sudden he stops—his eye is fixed—away—
Away, thou heedless boy! prepare the spear:
Now is thy time, to perish, or display
The skill that yet may check his mad career!
With well-timed croupe the nimble coursers veer;
On foams the Bull, but not unscathed he goes;
Streams from his flank the crimson torrent clear:
He flies, he wheels, distracted with his throes;
Dart follows dart—lance, lance—loud bellowings speak his woes.
Again he comes; nor dart nor lance avail,
Nor the wild plunging of the tortured horse;
Though Man and Man's avenging arms assail,
Vain are his weapons, vainer is his force.
One gallant steed is stretched a mangled corse;
Another, hideous sight! unseamed appears,
His gory chest unveils life's panting source;
Though death-struck, still his feeble frame he rears;
Staggering, but stemming all, his Lord unharmed he bears.

Foiled, bleeding, breathless, furious to the last,
Full in the centre stands the Bull at bay,
Mid wounds, and clinging darts, and lances brast,
And foes disabled in the brutal fray:
And now the Matadores around him play,
Shake the red cloak, and poise the ready brand:
Once more through all he bursts his thundering way—
Vain rage! the mantle quits the conynge hand,
Wraps his fierce eye—'tis past—he sinks upon the sand!
Where his vast neck just mingles with the spine,
Sheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies.
He stops—he starts—disdaining to decline:
Slowly he falls, amidst triumphant cries,
Without a groan, without a struggle dies.
The decorated car appears—on high
The corse is piled—sweet sight for vulgar eyes—
Four steeds that spurn the rein, as swift as shy,
Hurl the dark bulk along, scarce seen in dashing by.
Such the ungentle sport that oft invites
The Spanish maid, and cheers the Spanish swain.
Nurtured in blood betimes, his heart delights
In vengeance, gloating on another's pain.
What private feuds the troubled village stain!
Though now one phalanxed host should meet the foe,
Enough, alas! in humble homes remain,
To meditate 'gainst friend the secret blow,
For some slight cause of wrath, whence Life's warm stream must flow.
But Jealousy has fled: his bars, his bolts,
His withered Centinel, Duenna sage!
And all whereat the generous soul revolts,
Which the stern dotard deemed he could encage,
Have passed to darkness with the vanished age.
Who late so free as Spanish girls were seen,
(Ere War uprose in his volcanic rage,)
With braided tresses bounding o'er the green,
While on the gay dance shone Night's lover-loving Queen?
Oh! many a time and oft, had Harold loved,
Or dreamed he loved, since Rapture is a dream;
But now his wayward bosom was unmoved,
For not yet had he drunk of Lethe's stream;
And lately had he learned with truth to deem
Love has no gift so grateful as his wings:
How fair, how young, how soft soe'er he seem,
Full from the fount of Joy's delicious springs
Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings. 
Yet to the beauteous form he was not blind,
Though now it moved him as it moves the wise;
Not that Philosophy on such a mind
E'er deigned to bend her chastely-awful eyes:
But Passion raves herself to rest, or flies;
And Vice, that digs her own voluptuous tomb,
Had buried long his hopes, no more to rise:
Pleasure's palled Victim! life-abhorring Gloom
Wrote on his faded brow curst Cain's unresting doom.
Still he beheld, nor mingled with the throng;
But viewed them not with misanthropic hate:
Fain would he now have joined the dance, the song;
But who may smile that sinks beneath his fate?
Nought that he saw his sadness could abate:
Yet once he struggled 'gainst the Demon's sway,
And as in Beauty's bower he pensive sate,
Poured forth his unpremeditated lay,
To charms as fair as those that soothed his happier day.

My mother is a high-born dame,
And much misliketh me;
She saith my riot bringeth shame
On all my ancestry.
I had a sister once I ween,
Whose tears perhaps will flow;
But her fair face I have not seen
For three long years and moe.

Oh master dear I do not cry

All this is well to say;

Methinks it would my bosom glad,
To change my proud estate,
And be again a laughing lad
With one beloved playmate.
Since youth I scarce have pass'd an hour
Without disgust or pain,
Except sometimes in Lady's bower,
Or when the bowl I drain.
 ["I do not mean to exchange the ninth verse of the 'Good Night.' I have no reason to suppose my dog better than his brother brutes, mankind; and Argus we know to be a fable" (letter to Dallas, September 23, 1811: Letters, 1898, ii. 44).
Byron was recalling an incident which had befallen him some time previously (see letter to Moore, January 19, 1815): "When I thought he was going to enact Argus, he bit away the backside of my breeches, and never would consent to any kind of recognition, in despite of all kinds of bones which I offered him." See, too, for another thrust at Argus, Don Juan, Canto III. stanza xxiii. But he should have remembered that this particular Argus "was half a wolf by the she side." His portrait is preserved at Newstead (see Poetical Works, 1898, i. 280, Edition de Luxe).
For the expression of a different sentiment, compare The Inscription on the Monument of a Newfoundland Dog (first published in Hobhouse's Imit. and Transl., 1809), and the prefatory inscription on Boatswain's grave in the gardens of Newstead, dated November 16, 1808 (Life, p. 73).]

"Our first object was the convent of Nossa Senhora da Penha, the little romantic pile of white building I had seen glittering from afar when I first sailed by the coast of Lisbon. From this pyramidical elevation the view is boundless; you look immediately down upon an immense expanse of sea.
... A long series of detached clouds of a dazzling whiteness suspended low over the waves had a magic effect, and in pagan times might have appeared, without any great stretch of fancy, the cars of marine divinities, just risen from the bosom of their element."—Italy, etc., p. 249.
"Before the entrance, formed by two ledges of ponderous rock, extends a smooth level of greensward.... The Hermitage, its cell, chapel, and refectory, are all scooped out of the native marble, and lined with the bark of the cork tree. Several of the passages are not only roofed, but floored with the same material ... The shrubberies and garden-plots dispersed amongst the mossy rocks ... are delightful, and I took great pleasure in ... following the course of a transparent rill, which was conducted through a rustic water-shoot, between bushes of lavender and roses, many of the tenderest green."—Ibid., p. 250.
The inscription to the memory of Honorius (d. 159, æt. 95) is on a stone in front of the cave—
"Hic Honorius vitam finivit;
Et ideo cum Deo in coelis revivit."]
 {36} "I don't remember any crosses there."—

 [Beckford, describing the view from the convent, notices the wild flowers which adorned "the ruined splendour." "Amidst the crevices of the mouldering walls ... I noticed some capillaries and polypodiums of infinite delicacy; and on a little flat space before the convent a numerous tribe of pinks, gentians, and other Alpine plants, fanned and invigorated by the fresh mountain air."—Italy, etc., 1834, p. 229.

 The following stanzas, which appear in the MS., were excluded at the request of Dallas (see his letter of October 10, 1811, Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron, 1824, pp. 173-187), Letters, 1898, ii. 51:—
In golden characters right well designed
First on the list appeareth one "Junot;"
Then certain other glorious names we find,
(Which Rhyme compelleth me to place below:)
Dull victors! baffled by a vanquished foe,
Wheedled by conynge tongues of laurels due,
Stand, worthy of each other in a row—
Sirs Arthur, Harry, and the dizzard Hew
Dalrymple, seely wight, sore dupe of t'other tew.
Convention is the dwarfy demon styled
That failed the knights in Marialva's dome:
Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,
And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.
For well I wot, when first the news did come
That Vimiera's field by Gaul was lost,
For paragraph ne paper scarce had room,
Such Pæans teemed for our triumphant host,
In Courier, Chronicle, and eke in Morning Post.
But when Convention sent his handy workbr />
Pens, tongues, feet, hands combined in wild uproar;
Mayor, Aldermen, laid down the uplifted fork;
The Bench of Bishops half forgot to snore;
Stern Cobbett,—who for one whole week forbore
To question aught, once more with transport leapt,
And bit his devilish quill agen, and swore
With foes such treaty never should be kept,
While roared the blatant Beast, and roared, and raged, and—slept!!
Thus unto Heaven appealed the people: Heaven
Which loves the lieges of our gracious King,
Decreed that ere our Generals were forgiven,
Enquiry should be held about the thing.
But Mercy cloaked the babes beneath her wing;
And as they spared our foes so spared we them;
(Where was the pity of our Sires for Byng?)
Yet knaves, not idiots should the law condemn;
Then live ye gallant Knights! and bless your Judges' phlegm!
 , or were they like curs, who, having felt the bite of the mastiff, lose all confidence in their number, and, though they bark victory, suffer him to retire in quiet, carrying off his bone to be disposed of at his leisure? No, not so; for they complaisantly carry the bone for him." The rest of the article is written in a similar strain.]
  A figure for the mob. I think first used by Smollett, in his Adventures of an Atom. Horace has the 'bellua multorum capitum.' In England, fortunately enough, the illustrious mobility has not even one."—]

 [Her luckless Majesty went subsequently mad; and Dr. Willis, who so dexterously cudgelled kingly pericraniums, could make nothing of hers. (For the Rev. Francis Willis, see Poetical Works, 1898, i. 416.)
Maria I. (b. 1734), who married her uncle, Pedro III., reigned with him 1777-86, and, as sole monarch, from 1786 to 1816. The death of her husband, of her favourite confessor, Ignatio de San Caetano, who had been raised by Pombal from the humblest rank to the position of archbishop in partibus, and of her son, turned her brain, and she became melancholy mad. She was only queen in name after 1791, and in 1799 her son, Maria José Luis, was appointed regent. Beckford saw her in 1787, and was impressed by her dignified bearing. "Justice and clemency," he writes, "the motto so glaringly misapplied on the banner of the abhorred Inquisition, might be transferred, with the strictest truth, to this good princess" (Italy, with Sketches of Spain and Portugal, 1834, p. 256). Ten years later, Southey, in his Letters from Spain, 1797, p. 541, ascribes the "gloom" of the court of Lisbon to "the dreadful malady of the queen." When the Portuguese royal family were about to embark for Brazil in November, 1807, the queen was once more seen in public after an interval of sixteen years. "She had to wait some while upon the quay for the chair in which she was to be carried to the boat, and her countenance, in which the insensibility of madness was only disturbed by wonder, formed a striking contrast to the grief which appeared in every other face" (Southey's History of the Peninsular War, i. 110).]

 [Writing to his mother (August 11, 1809), Byron compares "the Spanish style" of beauty to the disadvantage of the English: "Long black hair, dark languishing eyes, clear olive complexions, and forms more graceful in motion than can be conceived by an Englishman ... render a Spanish beauty irresistible" (Letters, 1898, i. 239). Compare, too, the opening lines of The Girl of Cadiz, which gave place to the stanzas To Inez, at the close of this canto—
"Oh never talk again to me
Of northern climes and British ladies."
But in Don Juan, Canto XII. stanzas lxxiv.-lxxvii., he makes the amende to the fair Briton—
"She cannot step as doth an Arab barb,
Or Andalusian girl from mass returning.

Les pots de fleurs, les volutes et les tourelles qui terminent les maisons, varient à l'infini la dentelure. Byron a merveilleusement caractérisé la physionomie de Cadix en une seule touche:

My word my bond, u niggas word about as strong as plastic is
I shoulda never smoked that sweet n sour widow
Got me power napping with my eyes open staring out the window
And from me u gets no sympathy
I lost my feelings cuz a nigga stay so incoherent
I lost my bitch just for buying another bitch some earrings
I lost some weight and had to leave the state for goodness sake
Snuck back in my mamas crib and fixed myself a healthy plate
I'm bout my green soon as I wake up like healthy shakes
She lookin at me like boy u funny but don't think you bout to penetrate
And i dont hesitate

New doc on the block, u see I got no patients
My pockets real colorful lined up wit lots of crayons
Squeeze racks out these chickens
Lil mama do it for the D they call her Big Sean
But this is Big Christian, ur server
This game full of chips and its looking like its crunch time, lunch time
If u think it's ur time then u staring at the wrong time
Better check ur wrist watch
I'm just tryna upgrade to an AP from a G-Shock, that's what I call a flip flop
No joke, got fiends yelling out ayo Chris Rock
I lift my shirt up like I'm 2Pac minus the sit-ups
I be the big one at the bando wit a bad ho playing instrumentals
My pockets keep some fat Wallace, ain't that Big
I think I'm too high if I'm being honest
I be a comet
I got that yak mixed wit that chronic
Boy keep me on it

Sir Tristram, violer d'amores, fr'over the short sea, had passencore rearrived from North Armorica on this side the scraggy isthmus of Europe Minor to wielderfight his penisolate war: nor had topsawyer's rocks by the stream Oconee exaggerated themselse to Laurens County's gorgios while they went doublin their mumper all the time: nor avoice from afire bellowsed mishe mishe to tauftauf thuartpeatrick: not yet, though venissoon after, had a kidscad buttended a bland old isaac: not yet, though all's fair in vanessy, were sosie sesthers wroth with twone nathandjoe. Rot a peck of pa's malt had Jhem or Shen brewed by arclight and rory end to the regginbrow was to be seen ringsome on the aquaface.
The fall (bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronn- tuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk!) of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and later on life down through all christian minstrelsy. The great fall of the offwall entailed at such short notice the pftjschute of Finnegan, erse solid man, that the humptyhillhead of humself prumptly sends an unquiring one well to the west in quest of his tumptytumtoes: and their upturnpikepointandplace is at the knock out in the park where oranges have been laid to rust upon the green since devlinsfirst loved livvy.
What clashes here of wills gen wonts, oystrygods gaggin fishygods! Brékkek Kékkek Kékkek Kékkek! Kóax Kóax Kóax! Ualu Ualu Ualu! Quaouauh! Where the Baddelaries partisans are still out to mathmaster Malachus Micgranes and the Verdons catapelting the camibalistics out of the Whoyteboyce of Hoodie Head. Assiegates and boomeringstroms. Sod’s brood, be me fear! Sanglorians, save! Arms apeal with larms, appalling. Killykillkilly: a toll, a toll. What chance cuddleys, what cashels aired and ventilated! What bidimetoloves sinduced by what tegotetabsolvers! What true feeling for their’s hayair with what strawng voice of false jiccup! O here here how hoth sprowled met the duskt the father of fornicationists but, (O my shining stars and body!) how hath fanespanned most high heaven the skysign of soft advertisement! But was iz? Iseut? Ere were sewers? The oaks of ald now they lie in peat yet elms leap where askes lay. Phall if you but will, rise you must: and none so soon either shall the pharce for the nunce come to a setdown secular phoenish.
Bygmester Finnegan, of the Stuttering Hand, freemen’s maurer, lived in the broadest way immarginable in his rushlit toofarback for messuages before joshuan judges had given us numbers or Helviticus committed deuteronomy (one yeastyday he sternely struxk his tete in a tub for to watsch the future of his fates but ere he swiftly stook it out again, by the might of moses, the very water was eviparated and all the guenneses had met their exodus so that ought to show you what a pentschanjeuchy chap he was!) and during mighty odd years this man of hod, cement and edifices in Toper’s Thorp piled buildung supra buildung pon the banks for the livers by the Soangso. He addle liddle phifie Annie ugged the little craythur. Wither hayre in honds tuck up your part inher. Oftwhile balbulous, mithre ahead, with goodly trowel in grasp and ivoroiled overalls which he habitacularly fondseed, like Haroun Childeric Eggeberth he would caligulate by multiplicables the alltitude and malltitude until he seesaw by neatlight of the liquor wheretwin ’twas born, his roundhead staple of other days to rise in undress maisonry upstanded (joygrantit!), a waalworth of a skyerscape of most eyeful hoyth entowerly, erigenating from next to nothing and celescalating the himals and all, hierarchitectitiptitoploftical, with a burning bush abob off its baubletop and with larrons o’toolers clittering up and tombles a’buckets clottering down.
Of the first was he to bare arms and a name: Wassaily Booslaeugh of Riesengeborg. His crest of huroldry, in vert with ancillars, troublant, argent, a hegoak, poursuivant, horrid, horned. His scutschum fessed, with archers strung, helio, of the second. Hootch is for husbandman handling his ho. Hohohoho, Mister Finn, you’re going to be Mister Finnagain! Comeday morm and, O, you’re vine! Sendday’s eve and, ah, you’re vinegar! Hahahaha, Mister Funn, you’re going to be fined again!
What then agentlike brought about that tragoady thundersday this municipal sin business? Our cubehouse still rocks as earwitness to the thunder of his arafatas but we hear also through successive ages that shebby choruysh of unkalified muzzlenimiissilehims that would blackguardise the whitestone ever hurtleturtled out of heaven. Stay us wherefore in our search for tighteousness, O Sustainer, what time we rise and when we take up to toothmick and before we lump down upown our leatherbed and in the night and at the fading of the stars!

For what we are, gifs a gross if we are, about to believe. So pool the begg and pass the kish for crawsake. Omen. So sigh us. Grampupus is fallen down but grinny sprids the boord. Whase on the joint of a desh? Finfoefom the Fush. Whase be his baken head? A loaf of Singpantry’s Kennedy bread. And whase hitched to the hop in his tayle?

But, lo, as you would quaffoff his fraudstuff and sink teeth through that pyth of a flowerwhite bodey behold of him as behemoth for he is noewhemoe. Finiche! Only a fadograph of a yestern scene. Almost rubicund Salmosalar, ancient fromout the ages of the Agapemonides, he is smolten in our mist, woebecanned and packt away.

Phew!
What a warm time we were in there but how keling is here the airabouts! We nowhere she lives but you mussna tell annaone for the lamp of Jig-a-Lanthern! It’s a candlelittle houthse of a month and one windies. Downadown, High Downadown. And nummered quaintlymine. And such reasonable weather too! The wagrant wind’s awalt’zaround the piltdowns and on every blasted knollyrock (if you can spot fifty I spy four more) there’s that gnarlybird ygathering, a runalittle, doalittle, preealittle, pouralittle, wipealittle, kicksalittle, severalittle, eatalittle, whinealittle, kenalittle, helfalittle, pelfalittle gnarlybird. A verytableland of bleakbardfields! Under his seven wrothschields lies one, Lumproar. His glav toside him. Skud ontorsed. Our pigeons pair are flewn for northcliffs. The three of crows have flapped it southenly, kraaking of de baccle to the kvarters of that sky whence triboos answer; Wail, ’tis well! She niver comes out when Thon’s on shower or when Thon’s flash with his Nixy girls or when Thon’s blowing toomcracks down the gaels of Thon. No nubo no! Neblas on you liv! Her would be too moochy afreet. Of Burymeleg and Bindmerollingeyes and all the deed in the woe. Fe fo fom! She jist does hopes till byes will be byes. Here, and it goes on to appear now, she comes, a peacefugle, a parody’s bird, a peri potmother, a pringlpik in the ilandiskippy, with peewee and powwows in beggybaggy on her bickybacky and a flick flask fleckflinging its pixylighting pacts’ huemeramybows, picking here, pecking there, pussypussy plunderpussy. But it’s the armitides toonigh, militopucos, and toomourn we wish for a muddy kissmans to the minutia workers and there’s to be a gorgeups truce for happinest childher everwere. Come nebo me and suso sing the day we sallybright. She’s burrowed the coacher’s headlight the better to pry (who goes cute goes siocur and shoos aroun) and all spoiled goods go into her nabsack: curtrages and rattlin buttins, nappy spattees and flasks of all nations, clavicures and scampulars, maps, keys and woodpiles of haypennies and moonled brooches with bloodstaned breeks in em, boaston nightgarters and masses of shoesets and nickelly nacks and foder allmicheal and a lugly parson of cates and howitzer muchears and midgers and maggets, ills and ells with loffs of toffs and pleures of bells and the last sigh that come fro the hart (bucklied!) and the fairest sin the sunsaw (that’s cearc!). With Kiss. Kiss Criss. Cross Criss. Kiss Cross. Undo lives ‘end. Slain.
How bootifull and how truetowife of her, when strengly forebidden, to steal our historic presents from the past postpropheticals so as to will make us all lordy heirs and ladymaidesses of a pretty nice kettle of fruit. She is livving in our midst of debt and laffing through all plores for us (her birth is uncontrollable), with a naperon for her mask and her sabboes kickin arias (so sair! so solly!) if yous ask me and I saack you. Hou! Hou! Gricks may rise and Troysirs fall (there being two sights for ever a picture) for in the byways of high improvidence that’s what makes lifework leaving and the world’s a cell for citters to cit in. Let young wimman run away with the story and let young min talk smooth behind the butteler’s back. She knows her knight’s duty while Luntum sleeps. Did ye save any tin? says he. Did I what? with a grin says she. And we all like a marriedann because she is mercenary. Though the length of the land lies under liquidation (floote!) and there’s nare a hairbrow nor an eyebush on this glaubrous phace of Herrschuft Whatarwelter she’ll loan a vesta and hire some peat and sarch the shores her cockles to heat and she’ll do all a turfwoman can to piff the business on. Paff. To puff the blaziness on. Poffpoff. And even if Humpty shell fall frumpty times as awkward again in the beardsboosoloom of all our grand remonstrancers there’ll be iggs for the brekkers come to mournhim, sunny side up with care. So true is it that therewhere’s a turnover the tay is wet too and when you think you ketch sight of a hind make sure but you’re cocked by a hin.
Then as she is on her behaviourite job of quainance bandy, fruting for firstlings and taking her tithe, we may take our review of the two mounds to see nothing of the himples here as at elsewhere, by sixes and sevens, like so many heegills and collines, sitton aroont, scentbreeched ant somepotreek, in their swishawish satins and their taffetaffe tights, playing Wharton’s Folly, at a treepurty on the planko in the purk. Stand up, mickos! Make strake for minnas! By order, Nicholas Proud. We may see and hear nothing if we choose of the shortlegged bergins off Corkhill or the bergamoors of Arbourhill or the bergagambols of Summerhill or the bergincellies of Miseryhill or the countrybossed bergones of Constitutionhill though every crowd has its several tones and every trade has its clever mechanics and each harmonical has a point of its own, Olaf’s on the rise and Ivor’s on the lift and Sitric’s place’s between them. But all they are all there scraping along to sneeze out a likelihood that will solve and salve life’s robulous rebus, hopping round his middle like kippers on a griddle, O, as he lays dormont from the macroborg of Holdhard to the microbirg of Pied de Poudre. Behove this sound of Irish sense. Really? Here English might be seen. Royally? One sovereign punned to petery pence. Regally? The silence speaks the scene. Fake!
So This Is Dyoublong?
Hush! Caution! Echoland!
How charmingly exquisite! It reminds you of the outwashed engravure that we used to be blurring on the blotchwall of his innkempt house. Used they? (I am sure that tiring chabelshoveller with the mujikal chocolat box, Miry Mitchel, is listening) I say, the remains of the outworn gravemure where used to be blurried the Ptollmens of the Incabus. Used we? (He is only pretendant to be stugging at the jubalee harp from a second existed lishener, Fiery Farrelly.) It is well known. Lokk for himself and see the old butte new. Dbln. W. K. O. O.

They will be lichening for allof. They will be pretumbling forover. The harpsdischord shall be theirs for ollaves.

And here now they are, the fear of um. T. Totities! Unum. (Adar.) A bulbenboss surmounted upon an alderman. Ay, ay! Duum. (Nizam.) A shoe on a puir old wobban. Ah, ho! Triom. (Tamuz.) An auburn mayde, o’brine a’bride, to be desarted. Adear, adear! Quodlibus. (Marchessvan.) A penn no weightier nor a polepost. And so. And all. (Succoth.)
So, how idlers’ wind turning pages on pages, as innocens with anaclete play popeye antipop, the leaves of the living in the boke of the deeds, annals of themselves timing the cycles of events grand and national, bring fassilwise to pass how.
1132 A.D. Men like to ants or emmets wondern upon a groot hwide Whallfisk which lay in a Runnel. Blubby wares upat Ublanium.

566 A.D. At this time it fell out that a brazenlockt damsel grieved (sobralasolas!) because that Puppette her minion was ravisht of her by the ogre Puropeus Pious. Bloody wars in Ballyaughacleeaghbally.
1132. A.D. Two sons at an hour were born until a goodman and his hag. These sons called themselves Caddy and Primas. Primas was a santryman and drilled all decent people. Caddy went to Winehouse and wrote o peace a farce. Blotty words for Dublin.
Somewhere, parently, in the ginnandgo gap between antediluvious and annadominant the copyist must have fled with his scroll. The billy flood rose or an elk charged him or the sultrup worldwright from the excelsissimost empyrean (bolt, in sum) earthspake or the Dannamen gallous banged pan the bliddy duran. A scribicide then and there is led off under old’s code with some fine covered by six marks or ninepins in metalmen for the sake of his labour’s dross while it will be only now and again in our rear of o’er era, as an upshoot of military and civil engagements, that a gynecure was let on to the scuffold for taking that same fine sum covertly by meddlement with the drawers of his neighbour’s safe.
Now after all that farfatch’d and peragrine or dingnant or clere lift we our ears, eyes of the darkness, from the tome of Liber Lividus and, (toh!), how paisibly eirenical, all dimmering dunes and gloamering glades, selfstretches afore us our fredeland’s plain! Lean neath stone pine the pastor lies with his crook; young pricket by pricket’s sister nibbleth on returned viridities; amaid her rocking grasses the herb trinity shams lowliness; skyup is of evergrey. Thus, too, for donkey’s years. Since the bouts of Hebear and Hairyman the cornflowers have been staying at Ballymun, the duskrose has choosed out Goatstown’s hedges, twolips have pressed togatherthem by sweet Rush, townland of twinedlights, the whitethorn and the redthorn have fairygeyed the mayvalleys of Knockmaroon, and, though for rings round them, during a chiliad of perihelygangs, the Formoreans have brittled the tooath of the Danes and the Oxman has been pestered by the Firebugs and the Joynts have thrown up jerrybuilding to the Kevanses and Little on the Green is childsfather to the City (Year! Year! And laughtears!), these paxsealing buttonholes have quadrilled across the centuries and whiff now whafft to us, fresh and made-of-all-smiles as, on the eve of Killallwho.
The babbelers with their thangas vain have been (confusium hold them!) they were and went; thigging thugs were and houhnhymn songtoms were and comely norgels were and pollyfool fiansees. Menn have thawed, clerks have surssurhummed, the blond has sought of the brune: Elsekiss thou may, mean Kerry piggy?: and the duncledames have countered with the hellish fellows: Who ails tongue coddeau, aspace of dumbillsilly? And they fell upong one another: and themselves they have fallen. And still nowanights and by nights of yore do all bold floras of the field to their shyfaun lovers say only: Cull me ere I wilt to thee!: and, but a little later: Pluck me whilst I blush! Well may they wilt, marry, and profusedly blush, be troth! For that saying is as old as the howitts. Lave a whale a while in a whillbarrow (isn’t it the truath I’m tallin ye?) to have fins and flippers that shimmy and shake. Tim Timmycan timped hir, tampting Tam. Fleppety! Flippety! Fleapow!

Many. Miscegenations on miscegenations. Tieckle. They lived und laughed ant loved end left. Forsin. Thy thingdome is given to the Meades and Porsons. The meandertale, aloss and again, of our old Heidenburgh in the days when HeadinClouds walked the earth. In the ignorance that implies impression that knits knowledge that finds the nameform that whets the wits that convey contacts that sweeten sensation that drives desire that adheres to attachment that dogs death that bitches birth that entails the ensuance of existentiality. But with a rush out of his navel reaching the reredos of Ramasbatham. A terricolous vivelyonview this; queer and it continues to be quaky. A hatch, a celt, an earshare the pourquose of which was to cassay the earthcrust at all of hours, furrowards, bagawards, like yoxen at the turnpaht. Here say figurines billycoose arming and mounting. Mounting and arming bellicose figurines see here. Futhorc, this liffle effingee is for a firefing called a flintforfall. Face at the eased! O I fay! Face at the waist! Ho, you fie! Upwap and dump em, ace to ace! When a part so ptee does duty for the holos we soon grow to use of an allforabit. Here (please to stoop) are selveran cued peteet peas of quite a pecuniar interest inaslittle as they are the pellets that make the tomtummy’s pay roll. Right rank ragnar rocks and with these rox orangotangos rangled rough and rightgorong. Wisha, wisha, whydidtha?

True there was in nillohs dieybos as yet no lumpend papeer in the waste, and mightmountain Penn still groaned for the micies to let flee. All was of ancientry. You gave me a boot (signs on it!) and I ate the wind. I quizzed you a quid (with for what?) and you went to the quod. But the world, mind, is, was and will be writing its own wrunes for ever, man, on all matters that fall under the ban of our infrarational senses fore the last milchcamel, the heartvein throbbing between his eyebrowns, has still to moor before the tomb of his cousin charmian where his date is tethered by the palm that’s hers. But the horn, the drinking, the day of dread are not now.

Cry not yet! There’s many a smile to Nondum, with sytty maids per man, sir, and the park’s so dark by kindlelight. But look what you have in your handself! The movibles are scrawling in motions, marching, all of them ago, in pitpat and zingzang for every busy eerie whig’s a bit of a torytale to tell. One’s upon a thyme and two’s behind their lettice leap and three’s among the strubbely beds. And the chicks picked their teeths and the dombkey he begay began. You can ask your ass if he believes it. And so cuddy me only wallops have heels. That one of a wife with folty barnets. For then was the age when hoops ran high.

It was of a night, late, lang time agone, in an auldstane eld, when Adam was delvin and his madameen spinning watersilts, when mulk mountynotty man was everybully and the first leal ribberrobber that ever had her ainway everybuddy to his lovesaking eyes and everybilly lived alove with everybiddy else, and Jarl van Hoother had his burnt head high up in his lamphouse, laying cold hands on himself. And his two little jiminies, cousins of ourn, Tristopher and Hilary, were kickaheeling their dummy on the oil cloth flure of his homerigh, castle and earthenhouse. And, be dermot, who come to the keep of his inn only the niece-of-his-inlaw, the prankquean. And the prankquean pulled a rosy one and made her wit foreninst the dour. And she lit up and fireland was ablaze. And spoke she to the dour in her petty perusienne: Mark the Wans, why do I am alook alike a poss of porterpease? And that was how the skirtmisshes began. But the dour handworded her grace in dootch nossow: Shut! So her grace o’malice kidsnapped up the jiminy Tristopher and into the shandy westerness she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl van Hoother warlessed after her with soft dovesgall: Stop deef stop come back to my earin stop. But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihud. And there was a brannewail that same sabboath night of falling angles somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years’ walk in Tourlemonde and she washed the blessings of the lovespots off the jiminy with soap sulliver suddles and she had her four owlers masters for to tauch him his tickles and she convorted him to the onesure allgood and he became a luderman. So then she started to rain and to rain and, be redtom, she was back again at Jarl van Hoother’s in a brace of samers and the jiminy with her in her pinafrond, lace at night, at another time. And where did she come but to the bar of his bristolry. And Jarl von Hoother had his baretholobruised heels drowned in his cellarmalt, shaking warm hands with himself and the jimminy Hilary and the dummy in their first infancy were below on the tearsheet, wringing and coughing, like brodar and histher. And the prankquean nipped a paly one and lit up again and redcocks flew flackering from the hillcombs. And she made her witter before the wicked, saying: Mark the Twy, why do I am alook alike two poss of porterpease? And: Shut! says the wicked, handwording her madesty. So her madesty ‘a forethought’ set down a jiminy and took up a jiminy and all the lilipath ways to Woeman’s Land she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl von Hoother bleethered atter her with a loud finegale: Stop domb stop come back with my earring stop. But the prankquean swaradid: Am liking it. And there was a wild old grannewwail that laurency night of starshootings somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years’ walk in Turnlemeem and she punched the curses of cromcruwell with the nail of a top into the jiminy and she had her four larksical monitrix to touch him his tears and she provorted him to the onecertain allsecure and he became a tristian. So then she started raining, raining, and in a pair of changers, be dom ter, she was back again at Jarl von Hoother’s and the Larryhill with her under her abromette. And why would she halt at all if not by the ward of his mansionhome of another nice lace for the third charm? And Jarl von Hoother had his hurricane hips up to his pantrybox, ruminating in his holdfour stomachs (Dare! O dare!), ant the jiminy Toughertrees and the dummy were belove on the watercloth, kissing and spitting, and roguing and poghuing, like knavepaltry and naivebride and in their second infancy. And the prankquean picked a blank and lit out and the valleys lay twinkling. And she made her wittest in front of the arkway of trihump, asking: Mark the Tris, why do I am alook alike three poss of porter pease? But that was how the skirtmishes endupped. For like the campbells acoming with a fork lance of lightning, Jarl von Hoother Boanerges himself, the old terror of the dames, came hip hop handihap out through the pikeopened arkway of his three shuttoned castles, in his broadginger hat and his civic chollar and his allabuff hemmed and his bullbraggin soxangloves and his ladbroke breeks and his cattegut bandolair and his furframed panuncular cumbottes like a rudd yellan gruebleen orangeman in his violet indigonation, to the whole longth of the strongth of his bowman’s bill. And he clopped his rude hand to his eacy hitch and he ordurd and his thick spch spck for her to shut up shop, dappy. And the duppy shot the shutter clup (Perkodhuskurunbarggruauyagokgorlayorgromgremmitghundhurthrumathunaradidillifaititillibumullunukkunun!) And they all drank free. For one man in his armour was a fat match always for any girls under shurts. And that was the first peace of illiterative porthery in all the flamend floody flatuous world. How kirssy the tiler made a sweet unclose to the Narwhealian captol. Saw fore shalt thou sea. Betoun ye and be. The prankquean was to hold her dummyship and the jimminies was to keep the peacewave and van Hoother was to git the wind up. Thus the hearsomeness of the burger felicitates the whole of the polis.
O foenix culprit! Ex nickylow malo comes mickelmassed bonum. Hill, rill, ones in company, billeted, less be proud of. Breast high and bestride! Only for that these will not breathe upon Norronesen or Irenean the secrest of their soorcelossness. Quarry silex, Homfrie Noanswa! Undy gentian festyknees, Livia Noanswa?

Landloughed by his neaghboormistress and perpetrified in his offsprung, sabes and suckers, the moaning pipers could tell him to his faceback, the louthly one whose loab we are devorers of, how butt for his hold halibutt, or her to her pudor puff, the lipalip one whose libe we drink at, how biff for her tiddywink of a windfall, our breed and washer givers, there would not be a holey spier on the town nor a vestal flouting in the dock, nay to make plein avowels, nor a yew nor an eye to play cash cash in Novo Nilbud by swamplight nor a’ toole o’ tall o’ toll and noddy hint to the convaynience.
He dug in and dug out by the skill of his tilth for himself and all belonging to him and he sweated his crew beneath his auspice for the living and he urned his dread, that dragon volant, and he made louse for us and delivered us to boll weevils amain, that mighty liberator, Unfru–Chikda-Uru–Wukru and begad he did, our ancestor most worshipful, till he thought of a better one in his windower’s house with that blushmantle upon him from earsend to earsend. And would again could whispring grassies wake him and may again when the fiery bird disembers. And will again if so be sooth by elder to his youngers shall be said.

Now be aisy, good Mr Finnimore, sir. And take your laysure like a god on pension and don’t be walking abroad. Sure you’d only lose yourself in Healiopolis now the way your roads in Kapelavaster are that winding there after the calvary, the North Umbrian and the Fivs Barrow and Waddlings Raid and the Bower Moore and wet your feet maybe with the foggy dew’s abroad. Meeting some sick old bankrupt or the Cottericks’ donkey with his shoe hanging, clankatachankata, or a slut snoring with an impure infant on a bench. ‘Twould turn you against life, so ‘twould. And the weather’s that mean too. To part from Devlin is hard as Nugent knew, to leave the clean tanglesome one lushier than its neighbour enfranchisable fields but let your ghost have no grievance. You’re better off, sir, where you are, primesigned in the full of your dress, bloodeagle waistcoat and all, remembering your shapes and sizes on the pillow of your babycurls under your sycamore by the keld water where the Tory’s clay will scare the varmints and have all you want, pouch, gloves, flask, bricket, kerchief, ring and amberulla, the whole treasure of the pyre, in the land of souls with Homin and Broin Baroke and pole ole Lonan and Nobucketnozzler and the Guinnghis Khan. And we’ll be coming here, the ombre players, to rake your gravel and bringing you presents, won’t we, fenians? And il isn’t our spittle we’ll stint you of, is it, druids? Not shabbty little imagettes, pennydirts and dodgemyeyes you buy in the soottee stores. But offerings of the field.
Mieliodories, that Doctor Faherty, the madison man, taught to gooden you. Poppypap’s a passport out. And honey is the holiest thing ever was, hive, comb and earwax, the food for glory, (mind you keep the pot or your nectar cup may yield too light!) and some goat’s milk, sir, like the maid used to bring you. Your fame is spreading like Basilico’s ointment since the Fintan Lalors piped you overborder and there’s whole households beyond the Bothnians and they calling names after you. The menhere’s always talking of you sitting around on the pig’s cheeks under the sacred rooftree, over the bowls of memory where every hollow holds a hallow, with a pledge till the drengs, in the Salmon House. And admiring to our supershillelagh where the palmsweat on high is the mark of your manument. All the toethpicks ever Eirenesians chewed on are chips chepped from that battery block. If you were bowed and soild and letdown itself from the oner of the load it was that paddyplanters might pack up plenty and when you were undone in every point fore the laps of goddesses you showed our labourlasses how to free was easy. The game old Gunne, they do be saying, (skull!) that was a planter for you, a spicer of them all. Begog but he was, the G.O.G! He’s duddandgunne now and we’re apter finding the sores of his sedeq but peace to his great limbs, the buddhoch, with the last league long rest of him, while the millioncandled eye of Tuskar sweeps the Moylean Main! There was never a warlord in Great Erinnes and Brettland, no, nor in all Pike County like you, they say. No, nor a king nor an ardking, bung king, sung king or hung king. That you could fell an elmstree twelve urchins couldn’t ring round and hoist high the stone that Liam failed. Who but a Maccullaghmore the reise of our fortunes and the faunayman at the funeral to compass our cause? If you was hogglebully itself and most frifty like you was taken waters still what all where was your like to lay the cable or who was the batter could better Your Grace? Mick Mac Magnus MacCawley can take you off to the pure perfection and Leatherbags Reynolds tries your shuffle and cut. But as Hopkins and Hopkins puts it, you were the pale eggynaggy and a kis to tilly up. We calls him the journeyall Buggaloffs since he went Jerusalemfaring in Arssia Manor. You had a gamier cock than Pete, Jake or Martin and your archgoose of geese stubbled for All Angels’ Day. So may the priest of seven worms and scalding tayboil, Papa Vestray, come never anear you as your hair grows wheater beside the Liffey that’s in Heaven! Hep, hep, hurrah there! Hero! Seven times thereto we salute you! The whole bag of kits, falconplumes and jackboots incloted, is where you flung them that time. Your heart is in the system of the Shewolf and your crested head is in the tropic of Copricapron. Your feet are in the cloister of Virgo. Your olala is in the region of sahuls. And that’s ashore as you were born. Your shuck tick’s swell. And that there texas is tow linen. The loamsome roam to Laffayette is ended. Drop in your tracks, babe! Be not unrested! The headboddylwatcher of the chempel of Isid, Totumcalmum, saith: I know thee, metherjar, I know thee, salvation boat. For we have performed upon thee, thou abramanation, who comest ever without being invoked, whose coming is unknown, all the things which the company of the precentors and of the grammarians of Christpatrick’s ordered concerning thee in the matter of the work of thy tombing. Howe of the shipmen, steep wall!
Everything’s going on the same or so it appeals to all of us, in the old holmsted here. Coughings all over the sanctuary, bad scrant to me aunt Florenza. The horn for breakfast, one o’gong for lunch and dinnerchime. As popular as when Belly the First was keng and his members met in the Diet of Man. The same shop slop in the window. Jacob’s lettercrackers and Dr Tipple’s Vi–Cocoa and the Eswuards’ desippated soup beside Mother Seagull’s syrup. Meat took a drop when Reilly–Parsons failed. Coal’s short but we’ve plenty of bog in the yard. And barley’s up again, begrained to it. The lads is attending school nessans regular, sir, spelling beesknees with hathatansy and turning out tables by mudapplication. Allfor the books and never pegging smashers after Tom Bowe Glassarse or Timmy the Tosser. ‘Tisraely the truth! No isn’t it, roman pathoricks? You were the doublejoynted janitor the morning they were delivered and you’ll be a grandfer yet entirely when the ritehand seizes what the lovearm knows. Kevin’s just a doat with his cherub cheek, chalking oghres on walls, and his little lamp and schoolbelt and bag of knicks, playing postman’s knock round the diggings and if the seep were milk you could lieve his olde by his ide but, laus sake, the devil does be in that knirps of a Jerry sometimes, the tarandtan plaidboy, making encostive inkum out of the last of his lavings and writing a blue streak over his bourseday shirt. Hetty Jane’s a child of Mary. She’ll be coming (for they’re sure to choose her) in her white of gold with a tourch of ivy to rekindle the flame on Felix Day. But Essie Shanahan has let down her skirts. You remember Essie in our Luna’s Convent? They called her Holly Merry her lips were so ruddyberry and Pia de Purebelle when the redminers riots was on about her. Were I a clerk designate to the Williamswoodsmenufactors I’d poster those pouters on every jamb in the town. She’s making her rep at Lanner’s twicenightly. With the tabarine tamtammers of the whirligigmagees. Beats that cachucha flat. ‘Twould dilate your heart to go.
Aisy now, you decent man, with your knees and lie quiet and repose your honour’s lordship! Hold him here, Ezekiel Irons, and may God strengthen you! It’s our warm spirits, boys, he’s spooring. Dimitrius O’Flagonan, cork that cure for the Clancartys! You swamped enough since Portobello to float the Pomeroy. Fetch neahere, Pat Koy! And fetch nouyou, Pam Yates! Be nayther angst of Wramawitch! Here’s lumbos. Where misties swaddlum, where misches lodge none, where mystries pour kind on, O sleepy! So be yet!

Assure a sure there! And we put on your clock again, sir, for you. Did or didn’t we, sharestutterers? So you won’t be up a stump entirely. Nor shed your remnants. The sternwheel’s crawling strong. I seen your missus in the hall. Like the queenoveire. Arrah, it’s herself that’s fine, too, don’t be talking! Shirksends? You storyan Harry chap longa me Harry chap storyan grass woman plelthy good trout. Shakeshands. Dibble a hayfork’s wrong with her only her lex’s salig. Boald Tib does be yawning and smirking cat’s hours on the Pollockses’ woolly round tabouretcushion watching her sewing a dream together, the tailor’s daughter, stitch to her last. Or while waiting for winter to fire the enchantement, decoying more nesters to fall down the flue. It’s allavalonche that blows nopussy food. If you only were there to explain the meaning, best of men, and talk to her nice of guldenselver. The lips would moisten once again. As when you drove with her to Findrinny Fair. What with reins here and ribbons there all your hands were employed so she never knew was she on land or at sea or swooped through the blue like Airwinger’s bride. She was flirtsome then and she’s fluttersome yet. She can second a song and adores a scandal when the last post’s gone by. Fond of a concertina and pairs passing when she’s had her forty winks for supper after kanekannan and abbely dimpling and is in her merlin chair assotted, reading her Evening World. To see is it smarts, full lengths or swaggers. News, news, all the news. Death, a leopard, kills fellah in Fez. Angry scenes at Stormount. Stilla Star with her lucky in goingaways.
Opportunity fair with the China floods and we hear these rosy rumours. Ding Tams he noise about all same Harry chap. She’s seeking her way, a chickle a chuckle, in and out of their serial story, Les Loves of Selskar et Pervenche, freely adapted to The Novvergin’s Viv. There’ll be bluebells blowing in salty sepulchres the night she signs her final tear. Zee End. But that’s a world of ways away. Till track laws time. No silver ash or switches for that one! While flattering candles flare. Anna Stacey’s how are you! Worther waist in the noblest, says Adams and Sons, the wouldpay actionneers. Her hair’s as brown as ever it was. And wivvy and wavy. Repose you now! Finn no more!
For, be that samesake sibsubstitute of a hooky salmon, there’s already a big rody ram lad at random on the premises of his haunt of the hungred bordles, as it is told me. Shop Illicit, flourishing like a lordmajor or a buaboabaybohm, litting flop a deadlop (aloose!) to lee but lifting a bennbranch a yardalong (Ivoeh!) the breezy side (for showm!), the height of Brewster’s chimpney and as broad below as Phineas Barnum; humphing his share of the showthers is senken on him he’s such a grandfallar, with a pocked wife in pickle that’s a flyfire and three lice nittle clinkers, two twilling bugs and one midgit pucelle. And aither he cursed and recursed and was everseen doing what your fourfootlers saw or he was never done seeing what you coolpigeons know, weep the clouds aboon for smiledown witnesses, and that’ll do now about the fairyhees and the frailyshees. Though Eset fibble it to the zephiroth and Artsa zoom it round her heavens for ever. Creator he has created for his creatured ones a creation. White monothoid? Red theatrocrat? And all the pinkprophets cohalething? Very much so! But however ’twas ’tis sure for one thing, what sherif Toragh voucherfors and Mapqiq makes put out, that the man, Humme the Cheapner, Esc, overseen as we thought him, yet a worthy of the naym, came at this timecoloured place where we live in our paroqial fermament one tide on another, with a bumrush in a hull of a wherry, the twin turbane dhow, The Bey for Dybbling, this archipelago’s first visiting schooner, with a wicklowpattern waxenwench at her prow for a figurehead, the deadsea dugong updipdripping from his depths, and has been repreaching himself like a fishmummer these siktyten years ever since, his shebi by his shide, adi and aid, growing hoarish under his turban and changing cane sugar into sethulose starch (Tuttut’s cess to him!) as also that, batin the bulkihood he bloats about when innebbiated, our old offender was humile, commune and ensectuous from his nature, which you may gauge after the bynames was put under him, in lashons of languages, (honnein suit and praisers be!) and, totalisating him, even hamissim of himashim that he, sober serious, he is ee and no counter he who will be ultimendly respunchable for the hubbub caused in Edenborough.17Embed

Looking for a better day
My girl is worried 'bout me dying on the road
Man, some things will never change (Argh)
Now they put me for the cover
Now I'm looking at my brother
Now I'm grinding like no other
It's my life, I fucking love it
Feel like we stuck on the same page
Baby, we ain't on the same book
Feel like I struggled to make change
Baby, don't give me that same look
Went from a couple of G's to half-pounds
In a glasshouse passed in a couple of weeks
And these days, though, I struggle to breathe
Because I don't get nothin' for free, so let my brother be free, ah
You can't harm me, five racks in a Giorgio Armani
Classy, ride 'round in a Class C (Skrrt)
Medusa's head like Versace
Party, bullshit, I don't need half of the bullshit
I drive through with the drive-through (Ching)
And now I laugh at your bullshit like
Don't look back and regret, still not catching my breath
And my actions reflect the heartbreak
I had the neglect to block that, the cash and the cheque
And I drown my pain in the money and smoke
Chase my pays and my brothers ain't broke
Raised like that so my brothers don't show
All the pain like that, so my brothers don't know

Homeboy said he got good smoke
But the OGs went through the herb in a hour
Homeboy said he got good coke
Then he shows me a bag of detergent and powder
Chopped it up, then robbed the cunt
We gave head to his best friend's girl in the shower
And people swear we only smoke diesel
It's lethal, it's probably why the herb's all sour
(Switch it up) See ya later, beast creator
Freak of nature, weed and vapours
Sweet in flavour, chopped up when I block past
Like I move E for the credit, forget it
We don't keep the razor, treat inhaler
Cruise like Tom on a top gun when I rock one
Catch air with a deep inhale, go (Ching)
Everybody needs a favour, not me

Mark Waugh, last ball, we do not run
Drop one, Shane Warne when he got spun
Flip him one, I bounce to the ball, I was off stump
Now Chill's out, better chill out
Get a off-cut from the field now
Blue hairs on the bud like Milhouse
Welcome to The Octagon, we go argh1Embed


Killings reflect the destiny of the village
So when 20 count regrets float down futility spillage
See I'll pass the broken arrow this time for certain
Yeah but from here on out it's hoofed mare or bare footed urchin
Dig in your person
Now exhibit true audacity and passively hack reason to ribbons
And you're excused from the round-table admissions committee
Activist legends turned hostage in fallen cities
Dirty earthlings circling vision immaculate
Spin me dizzy in a crosswalk
My too far gone mastodon senses inspect relentless
For fitted boogie systems with crook addictions
Well sure my crown is formed of thorns
Yeah but my thorns are formed of sound
And I have found sound's what keeps me warm
When mornings born with frozen ground
Throw the rope down, pull me from where the buzzards cleared
The meat from the bones of you and your little bad-ass mad max musketeers
When the silhouettes of emaciated frames dance on a high-wire
Mistook for aspiring third world poster children
But is inserted ghost with dealin'
Dare to administer links like chieftain whats your forte
Knuckle dragger in disguise seeking the match made in your eyes
Friend it don’t take the wisest men in triplicate pacing to find
I don’t condone the blasphemy hatchery’s procreation
From the floods, to the fires, to the droughts, to the cyclones
Tidal waves, the twisters, tornadoes, and hail stones
Whirlwinds, tropical storms, blizzards and monsoons
All of which I witnessed prior to waking up inside my room
Look at the crook as I panic episode tantrums
Fuck hugging my cool
The edginess readies the Mach 9 quick draw hence the duel
The company of similars couldn't excite the motor
But hermit crab Aes home a-loner
One barrel of idioms and charcoal stick, courage under desire
Canopy draped beautiful messiah reluctant
Stuck in the pluck in the harp buzzing the fuzzing television mixer
Book of saturated matches and a half-made bed (sleep on my other half made bed)
Pick of the litter, litter of the pick
Pack leader will huff cannibal fumes, mechanical zoom
There's ample room
Stowaways inside the cargo bed
Said leech prior to firing up his barnacle magnet
Instincts leashing himself to where the wind splitting ice storms
And termite swarms are commonplace
I'm a trace this silver lining winding round the profit chase
I know there is good in you if one peels back the opulence
But I also know its ratio to bad don't feed my confidence
The nutrients moody tints of blue circle
The clues units of success being personal
Then sucked basic diversion
Rusty anchor budging for nothing
Wedged between aesop rock and a scarred face of frustrated fuck yous Bound by concern
I can't believe I'm still concerned
I can't believe sly children turn in their sleep over one-liners
While I yield to hear your burns
Color me out of my skull draggin' a wagon of creature features
And all I ever wanted was to aggravate the sleepers
Look self-crafted heroics murder worthless
Crash test ideologies, catalog alien doctrines type disturbance
Got em out, killing machines turn belly up
Buckled, the troubles I've seen
Coax twenty four sevens of wide eyes from day dreamers
Clean or dirty serpents in turn wish preference for the latter
Justified the germs birth cauterize the gashes after
On my left, one finger for each borough I can touch
On my right, one finger for each time that I wake up midsummer night
Who's cloaked in a pristine mantle of hellfire
But A-capital glaciers out the east slide lateral
Born for one task indeed
To spoil the citizen kane emote self this ugly duckling seed
Look I too am tired of draggin' the baggage over the seesaw seats
When the reapers turns mortals to caspers
See the plain and stone conjurable can't mimic the null
Of a billion troops holding matchsticks to empty cannons
Stand in for many moons when the sun hit the mountainside splendidly
Bask in the last warmth that be known to man's tangents
In the wink of an innocent starchild's eyelid drop he vanished
Managed to carve initials in the granite wall that damned it all up
I hung with cats that do the don'ts
Cats that forage through the moats
Hoping they'll open with sovereignty and a canteen deemed with prodigies
I log the wake, the watch, the walk, the work
The well it's almost six o'clock
I've never seen so many tugboats miss the dock (watch)You might also likeEmbed
I fell asleep again
I wasn't ready for it
Yo

The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season
I imagine sloppy seed handling evoked a stroke of tardy planting
And the crops we'd have harnessed mid-November
Had only brushed the blossom bracket
Then soon sacrificed lives to icicle jackets when the frost hit
I sunk to find the warmth beneath the mosses
With a plan to tunnel past after the rains have run their courses
But alas, the portraits of these frostbit corpses tortured in the grass
Offered this torch supporter one tall glass of nauseous
And I'm asking you: Why's the spy supply hiding in strangers
When they know atop the food chains I could spot biters for acres?
Now be gracious, these minstrels turn a bully cycle civil
By dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels
The upbringing of self-styled freedom brigade investors
And their studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors
Puts it down
It's down beneath your sappy sing-a-longs
Let's take it further down, we'll let Dante decide which ring I'm on
Nova
The elders took positions and the fans marched
Parched, plain and steamed
Hawking the rain in my canteen
Now I'm like point:
I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads
Counterpoint:
During my famine I never got broke your bread
Well, equation of intrigue, yes, yes
Lemme fence sit for a bit
These tense lips need soaking before I hand out tokens
Shut the fuck up
Drama like kabuki with a heart of dirt
Skull fucked cross bones hence my birth
It hurts

I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine
But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning

Crowning the glory of our advance
Fire ants to water beetles
These Freemasons adjacent to pacing pins and needles
Pupil turned pedagogue, benediction to my dream
Beaming a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine
Check it
I'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time
Gripping the stem in the right; invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline
It's a metaphor for nighttime
Ante up the slight cost of exhaustion
To salute the moon above paradise lost and you're a spectator, stringent
Inch by sacred inch shoveling coal into my earthworm soul
(You should know!)
Burrow up through the dirt with bloody digit
Lick my knuckles clean
Noting the corporate clusters holding hands
'round the abode of the damned
Now what's your poison?
Starlight in a maser with a nicotine chaser
Sip it clean, savor the taste to sit and dream later:
The eyelids pivot back upon the hinges
20 miles across the glassy eyed window of wonders to passers by
Now I'm 6 foot 4 with a 6-floor walk up just to recline
With no free time. The alarm storms at nine
My daytime's on some, 'Yes, sir. Ok, sir. Right away sir
Sir, do you mind if I breathe, sir?
Oh you do? Well excuse me, sir, fuck you.'
I breathe slow
I run in with these fantastic amalgams
Painting casket-bound careers to peers gunning with classic albums
Security's the javelin, catch it
Labor
Clocked in in '76 and haven't clocked out ever since
Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want
Sometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut
Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers

Maybe conjure up a storm of locusts
Or maybe cockroaches
Or a gang of angry bees
Some type of plague or disease
It's all the same to me
Of everyone I know, I like you the least
I've lost all respect I could have ever carried (C'mon)
Now I curse your name when it's mentioned (Get out)
I'd shoot you in your face if I thought it would relieve the tension
When I see you my temper's temperament just sky rockets
I wanna grab a pipe wrench and put a dent in your eye socket
Pry apart your jaws, pull out all your teeth
Shove a funnel in ya, fill you up with ammonia and bleach (Take this, take this)
Gotta get a grip, can't let you affect me like this
But I'm pissed, you're at the top of my shit list
I wish you'd slit your wrist and kiss an electric fence
So the means can finally justify the ends
I stare at you in contempt, you look at me the same
Won't be content till I forget your fucking name
Here I am once again, high out of my mind

This mirror don't reflect life

I've got a picture in my head of what you look like when you're sleepin'
This skin sinks into the instincts of a demon (Demon)
Can't believe the words exist with your breathin'
The evil-eyed еagle flies high into the еvenin' (Evenin')
Every season has a reason
And every allegiance was inspired by some type of a treason
You can keep your secrets, nobody needs 'em
Convinced everything'll get better after you leave him
Skip the proper impeachment, not enough to call the bluff
Of the cotton thief, rotten top feeder got a fever
Caught him stealin' from his own father
Fuck the globe, fuck her off of his mother, no, don't bother

A little more history, a lot less truth to hide

Unaware and lost of where the watchtower sits
Power fits in your wallet, too much for the mountain of big guns
Death count, it's got you all surrounded now

Fuck ya, fuck ya, fuck ya, lots of kiss, kiss, kiss got wet (Splash!)
Break the body, set fire, no loss
Make the dollar holler, how much will your soul cost?
When you die, are you gonna be surprised?
Will you see it coming? Will it be your summons?
When you face the judgement of death
Reinterpretation is all that's left, now hold your breath and

Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have

Nobody want to struggle at home
Bass in his voice, trouble in her tone
What kind of couple makes a puzzle out of stone?
Chopping and popping all of the bubbles that are blown
Nobody want to be wrong
And once the line gets drawn across what we disagree upon
It could be the time bomb that we sleep on
It's just a little one, back and forth like a ping pong
Nobody wants an argument
You try to bargain as a friend
But it's hard to with a star offence against a smart defence
And the history you share is full of scars and dents
Nobody likes breaking up
When you hate the situation but you crave the touch
You might stay in the relationship for the simple sake of it
Because you know it's based in love

Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have

Nobody want to go to work
For some older jerk that doesn't know the dirt
That's embedded in the hearts of those that hurt
Monday through Friday, and Saturdays for bonus perks
Nobody befriends beast
Just to make ends meet and try to pay rent and eat
Spread sheets by the end of the week
He'd rather spread them sheets than try to get some sleep
Nobody want to lift a crate
That ain't living great, you want a kid and play
You should dip, escape, no two week notification
Show up late and quit today
Nobody wants an awful boss
That got you popping out the top of your mouth as if it's common talk
You ought to wait until you off the clock
And appreciate that fact that you've got a job

Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have

But somebody want that life you got
They think your boyfriend's nice or your wife is hot
They on your block looking at that home you bought
They'd move in today if that door wasn't locked
Nowadays you ought to watch your spot
Even with all the flaws of that boss you mock
You could still close your eyes and toss a rock
I bet you'd hit someone that'd love to cop your job
That's what I thought, of course you don't stop
You won't take the shot, you can't afford the loss
If you don't want to taste the sauce
Then put the plate down and take a walk
Drop, or move away from the pot
Cause every time you talk you complain a lot
Don't forget to count the balls y'all caught
Enjoy what you got before it all falls off
Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path

And she loved me more than I could imagine
So I waited till she slept then I stepped into traffic
Ran away from the backyard to drift some more
Woke up in Texas next to a liquor store
With a woman who don't even drink alcohol
Big letters IRONY tagged on the wall
She was named for another flat land
We had it strong back then
In common we had a bond
That would never see the break of dawn
To damn afraid of the queen trying to take the pawn
Threw that away
Yes, yes headed out west
And got undressed
With the nurture that she gave me made me drip and get obsessed
There was a lady in Los Angeles
That handled this the way the manual suggest (the way the manual suggest)
She turned me on to music that I never heard before
She told me stories from a cup I haven't learned to pour
And I don't know what hurt it more
Professional journals or perpetual burn holes
Scarring up the dirty floor
Peace! Found a hollow hole in the Colorado snow
It's like I follow anywhere El Diablo go
Took a stroll with a feline
And sat silent while the snowflakes fell into the design
Can't let her dance up on the top floor
Been there done that what do you think it's locked for?
I've lost more to my traveling soul
Then I care to talk about so I'll be out, I'll be on the road
Down, down, down in Gainesville
No stranger to shame, Coltrane, and pain pills
Sometimes the ceiling's too easy to stare at
But it keeps me from a forest full of snare taps and bear traps
And it can't come clean without the sun beams
And it ain't complete without the drum beats
I can tell she don't want me
As is time to climb back into the van and make the back stiff
I had to add one more story to the infinite
Already interwoven through a New York cigarette
Ex lover and a best friend, best lover and an ex friend’ll bend
For alcoholic sentimentalism and the rhythm of
Religion on the PA
Make the people here say
God bless the DJ
She stays to wait for a replay
While I wonder if I'll be able to hear it from the freeway
You might also likeChicago inside of an empty bottle
There's a thin line between gossip and gospel
There's a house over there near Wicker Park
Where I found out Smart was afraid of the dark
Had to break a heart just to help me heal up
Tie a knot in the stomach just to help me seal up
And make sure them demons stay beneath the core
Pray for you and yours and whomever you believe in more
Look around you there's angels amongst us
Look around you there's angels amongst us
Sitting in the rain at some sidewalk cafe
Half of her wet cigarette in the ash tray
Trying to find a lost soul to save
And I'm a lost soul trying to find a road that's paved
Keep faith in my suitcase packed my beliefs
Angels exist, I've even seen some sleep
I love this fucking country
And she loved me more than I could imagine
So I waited till she slept then I stepped into trafficEmbed
See, they could try to trick you, couldn't they?
Here's something for you, make you really feel good

Little mama got a little pill to swallow
A little water to follow it down the tunnel
Gotta lotta walls but the house is hollow
Got a lot of holes, never found the shovel
Panic attack, so what's the plan of attack?
You had to be had, you cut in half, you had to react
You battle with your shadow from front to back
Stack up the stats, handle the math and that'll be that
Hold your head up, I know you're fed up
But don't let it get up to the top of them steps, love
Instead of playin' with the pieces that got messed up
Get dressed up, we goin' out to catch the best buzz
Self-medicated, spirit on elevated
Help take the self-made self-hate and celebrate it
And I could tell you hated it when you felt naked
But the poison tastes great, wanna know how the hell they made it?
And if the dizzy don't kill you, the city will
Simply for the thrill of wiping up a sticky spill
Little tricky get busy off a fifty bill
So take the little pill straight to your pretty grill

So what you drinking? So what you popping?
So what you eating? So what you dropping?
So what you smoking? So what you sniffing?
So how you coping? So what's the difference?

Contagious, it runs like the paint does
Sedate the sober and over-anxious
The pages of pain that make the songs on the playlist
The renegade rain that jumped just to flood the basements
Look honey, everybody needs a helper buddy
Nobody's drug-free, the streets would be hella bloody
Do you call yourself a patient or a junkie?
The only thing that separates is who takes your money
All smile like we're gonna go buck wild
Order up a shot, prescription filled up now
Pop another (what?) distracted by the rush while
We fight all night about what to name the love child
I'm on that go nuts life that got that gold touch
Fresh Fly Wild, Bold what like the Cold Crush
No luck, don't hold much, just an old flush
Made up of hearts, queen high off the faux-blush
Freak outs, leak out, and bleed out, and speak out
And reroute and seek out the weak crowd
And we doubt, but when I see it keep out
The beast I'll believe for now, it's all "Peace, I gotta be out"

Grab a hold of yourself, open your eyes
Get wise to the exercise
Being taught by the teacher that's most dominant
You need knowledge? Well, I'm dropping it
Listen to the rap, allow it to trap
Your body and soul so that you can adapt
To the man on display as I take you away
So may I? Yes, you may
Proud to be a Black man coming exact and
Giving up to brothers, five on the backhand
Pray for lease and peace upon each other
With my sisters and brothers (Yo, word to the mother)
I say the mother as in the motherland
But on the other hand, another man
Tackled and shackled our ancestors
But we beat him with freedom, so let's bless the
Country that we all came from
Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome
The cream will keep rising, we be sizing
Up, the Asiatic one is enterprising
Building and building to carry on
All the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan
Martin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils
Those who fell victim were those without scruples
However, to sever, we could never
So hold up the peace sign and stand together
Take heed to the words that I manifest
And when I'm through speaking, Marley Marl'll do the rest

Yo, Big Daddy, what you gon' say now?

Take a stand, the fight for power
'Cause we've been here before the Mayflower
Living superior, abiding by nature
The history of the Asiatic one paid the
Price to be paid in slavery
Like the name of Antonio was gave to me
But knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain
Now I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane
The teacher teaching a lesson to be heard
That's word to the mother, my brother
So discover the truth of one another
'Cause here's the real deal upon our skin color
Lay down white, yellow, red, or pink
But the color of black is most dominant
The rising and sizing can never cease
(What you gon' say now?) Peace
The mother of all living things and the Black man
Is the original man, we just can't escape our destiny
(Word to the mother)
The mother of all living things and the Black man
Is the original man, we just can't escape our destiny

On the Black Caesar tip, my dialogue
Is just like a frank inside of a supermarket, raw dog
I'm the untouchable, never to be took out
A Sexy Mother.. ooh, child! Prince, look out!
I'm keepin' girls of all shades on my trail
From a Sister Act down to a Single White Female
'Cause when I hit the skins, they all say, "Damn, Kane..
You knock out the Bush like a presidential campaign"
But if you think that lickin' toes makes me weak
You better treat me like Freddy Krueger — don't sleep
I write raps, ready to rip and rock real rough rhymes
Run in rugged and raw, rapidly ruinin' roaches
Point blank, I spell murder to a bum
All you backwards rappers — REDRUM! REDRUM!
'Cause I do 'em somethin' awful, break 'em down to a morsel
Makin' sure that you're no longer adorable
Rappers get so quiet when I'm comin'
That if they shitted a dictionary, you couldn't get a word from 'em
It's sort of a tradition in Bed-Stuy to do or die
So steppin' to me is suicide!
I couldn't think of a rapper takin' mines
Huh! I feel like Ali — "I'm the greatest of all times"
Floatin' like a butterfly, stingin' like a bee
Yeah, I know this ain't boxing, but that's still my pedigree
But as for you, you have no appeal
How you get a record deal?

Uh! I keep the body count massive
But if you say you increased the Body Count, troop
You must admit that you joined Ice-T's group
'Cause you ain't hurtin' niggedy-nuthin', so why you bluffin'?
Tryin' to be the new Big Daddy Somethin'
But there's only one, before me, no one is pitchin'
Huh! You couldn't come Pryor if your name was Richard
'Cause I'm the Alpha and Omega
Arm-Leg-uh-Leg-uh-Arm-Head, stayin' raw 'til I'm dead
And to battle me — you shouldn't even try
'Cause with wings on your tongue, you still couldn't say nothin' fly
And I don't care if you bring a crew
And I don't even care if someone else writes for you
Man, you could even be someone the crowd may just like
But, shoot.. you couldn't see me with a bifocal mic
Check my resume: Rapmasters, Word Up!
Yo! MTV, BET, The Box and all that good stuff
And Billboard from a five-year duration
And see that I got more spots than a dalmatian
Let's get down to bidness, yes, large
You could bring on your whole squad, none of you chumps are hard!
All that garbage you mumble ain't real
And seriously, seriously.. how you get a record deal?
A lot of rappers today
Wonder, "Should I ask Kane to write rhymes for me to say?"
Well, you're goddamn right you should
'Cause my rhymes are like spandex, they make any ass seem good
So act like you know, baby pop
When I riggedy-rock the higgedy-hip-hop nonstop
As I freak the funk and flip the flavor to flow
The flyest, a fury full force in the flames of the fire
Now! May these MC's rest in peace
Because when I come to town, the population decrease
I leave 'em finished, dead and that's that!
Huh! Not even Pet Sematary could bring 'em back
I slay my prey, they decay
I tell 'em like Jennifer Holiday — no-no-no nooooooo way!
That you could ever touch this
No, you know how I feel? I think you bought your record dealEmbed
One-fifty-eight Lewis Avenue

Now in ninety-three I'm still bein me
You think my 'fridgerator ain't full of Olde E?  Huh
A lot of times I get fly with a suit and a tie
Yeah I went from rags to riches but I still rock the saggy britches
And I don't try to act brand new
Eatin escargots and usin words like "rendezvous"
The ghetto life I've seen a lot overcome
Make a little money and then forget where they came from
Livin a plastic lifestyle, you're more false than dentures
Don't make me pull your file -- stop shammin!

"Stop, hold-up, pause, wait" (2X)
Stop shammin!

So why you wanna be what you're not?
And claim to have things that you know you ain't got
You're just a fantasizer -- spendin all your money
On Luster's pink oil moisturizer
Just to make your hair curly and thin
You say, "Black is beautiful," but then you go and bleach your skin
Money you're worse than Yacub
Cause there are eight stages of graft and you broke down to two
Plus you got a bad case of jungle fever
And nmmana-nah-nah I just can't believe ya
It's quite obvious you don't wanna be a black man
So what's next - you're gonna join the Klu Klux Klan?
You sold out to your race and it's a big disgrace
You can't look your own people in the face
You wonder why it ain't no black schools or hospitals
You're makin millions of dollars and it's pitiful
That you can donate to leukemia all the time
But you can't give the Nation of Islam a dime
They mention Muslims, you change the subject
You can't even shake Farrakhan hand in public
That whole busy attitude is a sham
Umm bro, umm brother, umm.. Brougham, stop shammin!

Now all of a sudden the honies they wanna give me rhythm
Well I'ma hit it, but still I show no pity
So I hope you don't think you gonna be in my next video
And many brothers I never even ran with
Be actin like they been hangin with me since I was a kid
I mean just to get a piece of the action
Man they start rememberin more times than Michael Jackson
But I can't fade to the tag-alongs

Here's a little food for thought
As I tell it, cause if it happened to this cat
Then it can happen to you
Do the knowledge

I was sittin' outside double parked after dark
I think it was the corner of Nostrand and St. Mark
That's when this stray cat walked up to me
Now I was sure he would be
But you woulda thought he'd know me
Tellin' his life story to me
He said 'Yo Kane', since way back in his life
Days of Rappers Delight, yo he was after the hype
He rocked the Kangols, Adidas when Run and them had that spot
When I came out, he had a flat-top
And when Naughty came out, a couple years ago
He even tried the braids up in his hair, but they ain't hear him tho
Vexed and down, you know next he found
Heavy D was blowing up, so then he tried to gain extra pounds
No thanks to that, they ranked him wack
Only thing that's left to do, was to go gangsta rap
So now he rhyme about the keys being sold
The G's being fold, the trees being rolled
Now sure he should, he started acting like he from the hood
Talking thug game and had his record sales doing good
And so now, you on the road to riches
Referring to the womankind as hoes and bitches
Yeah, you the man now because you rap different
But you got your 7 year old daughter listenin'
The twist begin
When that the image you projecting
It starts to reflecting on your shorty cause she checking
You might also like
Do you really know
What's the path that you really need to go
And what example you really need to show
The good rep or the hood rep
While she's walking in her father's footsteps

It be that excess drama, wonder rhymer
That could make one rapper, convert to, gun clapper
That acting buckwild, boy you know that ain't your style
Plus your thug profile is now reflecting on your child
You thinking that it couldn't happen
But then it happen
And now you're rappin, came back to haunt you
Because you want to
Be in her face puffin' li with your crew
You even let her take a sip or two upon your brew
Instead of tryin to shed light, to keep her head right
So that she wouldn't do the things that the next kid might
Oh now you never did consider tho
Your kid could go
Trying to do the things she saw you do up in your video
You went upstairs thinking that she wasn't able
Slipping, left your Glock sittin' pon the coffee table
So as you hang, with your gang, doin your thang
BLOWE! unexpectedly to your ears the shot rang
Came down, never thinking that you'd see what you saw
Right there, layin in blood across your livin room floor
So now, as you sit in grief, total disbelief
Cause everything that ever mattered
To you is all shattered
Instead of concentratin' heavily on what your rep be
You should have been thankful for your child like Cheryl Pepsi
Cause if you would have stayed aware
To whose in your care
She wouldn't be no casualty to your career"

Where did they find you?
You came into this game and let this new trend blind ya
A&R's was wrong to sign ya
You gotta be true to this game to stay in the art
But guys like you get bent apart
Because you ain't got it in the heart
Representing who? you better not be getting new
How you gonna be guerilla when you never been up in the zoo
Your whole persona's theatrical
Ain't nothing bout you natural
Here, show me now, how many gats you pull
Cause when you talk that talk
You gotta walk that walk
Or leave it up to the real OG's up North
Cause those who dramatize, realize, and be advised
You couldn't handle 3 to 5
Cause many seeking fortune and fame
Got caught in the game
Thinking the thug status was supporting the claim
All you gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks
But relax, cause this is just wax
Tell em again
You gangsta acts be guerillas on tracks
But relax, cause this is just wax
One more time
Y'all gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks
But relax, this just wax, nigga, damn

There's no myth or fable about the pimpin' at your label
What goes on under the table, why you think your deal is so unstable?
Now, whose the macaroni, A&R's acting phony
Once you make the matrimony, then he start to slackin' don't he
Or could it be the president that's being hesitant
Playin' his artist like a corner workin' specimen
And I ain't kidding you when I say it's political
The way they make a ridicule of artists can be pitiful
You know damn well there shouldn't be no company CO
Trying to show me about rap that's 53 or so
But yet and still they want to add advice, trying to keep their status right
When they should be working records for Gladys Knight
Who shape artists, man they catching rape charges
Once you sign on the dotted line, they lead you in the blind
Then you find, your state of revenue remains the same
Cause you getting less points than Steve Kerr be getting in a game
And just because it be too hardcore to judge it
They won't even touch it, and get to frontin' on the budget
When new artists come out, I can foresee the worst outcome
Cause everybody I know got beat their first album
So I took my contract to a lawyer so he can check it out (He don't know)
Then I took it to Dionne Warwick so she can  read my hand (She don't know)
Chorus
It's a shame, when artists gotta deal with cheats
They got game, for every young rapper they see out on the streets
You sign your name, they get like Big Red on the Five Heartbeats
Now who the blame, when you starvin' and your record label eats
You might also like
Preach brother
They say the truth will set you free, but I see signs of treachery
Go on perpetually, here's how they get you G
They use the tricks, just to juice your mix
But cross be in their heart like a vampire stabbed with a crucifix
I had the enemy in my vicinity with the false identity
Of a friend to me to injure me
They ride along just to guide you wrong
Play like they beside you strong, and start to faking moves like Olajuwon
Who side you on, revealing all that low down dirty dealing
I can see your skin peeling it changed like a chameleon
First you believe in them, but once you disagree with them
They try to get Magilla repertoire and that ain't even them
And all those who has betrayed, be fast to fade
Cause they cast a shade, with the masquerade
What's dealt, is low blows below the belt
Lord have mercy, I know how Julius Caesar must have felt
I start to think back when I was just a youth
I should have listened to the words of the God Born Truth
He said, "look out for black snakes they all up in your cypher
Black snakes you can't see therefore they sneak up and they bite ya'"
They get to flippin' cause they think you slippin'
So remember, don't get to slippin' cause they get to flippin'
And trippin', what's that you grippin', beside your hippin'
You think my heart is skippin', go save that game for Scottie Pippen
It's a shame, to see how far left people be going
They got game, to think that all this time you said you know them
It ain't the same, Aah, so now you see the way they flowin'
Now who they blame, ain't nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing

Now, wait a minute, I'm starting to see lotsa, hip-hop imposters
Is rap a category at the Oscars?
Too much Nino Brown up in your life
Cause since then, man I done seen Wesley Snipes playin' a drag queen
But yet and still you want to mimic the stars of cinema
Pretending huh? So full of it they need an enema
Cause see dig, they all like to talk big
But then they want to renege, when there's a curling iron in their wig
You talking loud and saying nothing, what's the world becoming?
The frontin', now pay attention you may learn something
Now, I ain't knocking you, but come on let's be logical
You know that it's impossible to stop the unstoppable
I would suggest that they, go back and check my resume
Cause tunes that I made yesterday, can hang out with the best today
Peace to Easy Mo, cause he makes the beats to flow
And I grab the microphone and flip it like pizza dough

Shame
Now who the blame
I need to be the Mayor, so I can change the things around here
I need to be the Governor, I need to be the Governor1Embed
Mm, mm, mm
Aw yeah, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
'Cause '88 time to set it straight, know what I'm sayin'?
And ain't no half-steppin'
Word, I'm ready

Rappers steppin' to me, they wanna get some
But I'm the Kane, so, yo, you know the outcome
Another victory, they can't get with me
So pick a B.C. date 'cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And steppin' to me, yo, that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition, I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
'Cause when it comes to bein' dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
'Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you tried to be basin'
Friday the 13th, I'ma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes, Big, not little
So define it, here's your walkin' papers, sign it
And take a walk as the Kane starts to talk, 'cause

Down the road
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin'
To sound like me, so soon, I'll have to open
A school of emceein' for those who wanna be in
My field and court, then again, on second thought
To have MCs comin' out soundin' so similar
It's quite confusin' for you to remember the
Originator, and boy, do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best, oh yes, I guess, suggest the rest
Should fess, don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraphs I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stoppin' the groove until when it's
The climax and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me actin' ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, makin' it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, aw shit
I stop and stand strong over MCs
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
'Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff or get with
The man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleepin' on your rhymes 'til I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, 'cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're tryna go
When you wanna step to me, I think you should know that
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Down the road

I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare, put him in the rear
Back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to the wannabe competition
Tryin' to step to me, must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I'm losin'? Tsk, picture that

Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'
Mister Cee, step to me
Get on— Get on down
Get on down— down
Get on— Get on down
Down
Get on— Get on down
Get on—
Get on— Get on—
Down— (Look) Down— (Look) Down— (Look) Down—

The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make MCs evaporate
The party people say, "Damn, that rapper's great"
The creator, conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy bein' me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceedin' to my innovation
Not like the other MCs that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo, I'ma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messin' around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take your title
Namely me, because I'm homicidal
That means murder, yes, I'm out to hurt a-
-nother MC that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him and take him
And mold him and make him hold up the peace sign

Passport dated up, hair braided up
I fucked your bitch, but I ain't rape the slut, she gave it up
I'm runnin' wit' Cheeks, he runnin wit' me
We runnin' together
We get drunk and blunted together, but don't front
The guns is under the leather
Ready to ill, ready to kill, ready to peel
Steppin' to Corle, you betta be real
Cause none of my niggas be lettin' me chill
My crew be deliverin' hot lead, when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I been killin' up shit at rap events

When I rock gators, hoes be like "Them shoes is nice!"
Dimes I'm willin' to hit, I stay drillin' a chick
They all know I ain't shit, but they still on my dick
And I never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
Cause all my jewels be Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
I'll blast the TEC at your dome and leave you restin' alone
Go home and puff a fat bag of ses' 'til I'm gone

Told honey: Let's leave
Took her to M&G's, got some eggs & cheese
Grits, fish cakes, and orange juice, freshly squeezed
When she finished her meal, I said: What's the deal?

They first knew I was a crazy nigga
When my mother came home and found out I killed the
Baby-sitter
I did more crime in due time
Started my life of crime
About nine going out for mine
I made every little kid from my hood run
I was just like that little bastard from The Good Son
And my mind was past bummed
Dropped the blow-dryer in the water while my moms was in the
Bathtub
Then I just saluted as she electrocuted
They got booted, 'cause that's another I executed
I was a child runnin' wild like a goose chase
Punish my dad, I put poison in his toothpaste
Then I pick my aunt or sister up, gave her a quick spank
Then dropped the little bitch in a fish tank
I invited company, murdered the four guests
Put a cap in each whore chest and ate their raw flesh
I tell the truth I ain't lyin' man (When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus)

Ayyo folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin’ this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast when my Smith-Wes’ blast
So jus’ dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don’t get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smoke ‘cause these knuckles hurt
I’m from the alley not the valley
I’m hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I’d rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don’t hang with jive pals
Adiós, ghost, I’m five thous’

Flave it’s always easy for new bait
Taken here to groove quake
Make ya more addictin’ than tube steak
‘Cause when I work a line, nobody’s jerkin’ mine
So bring the noise an’ I’ll poison like turpentine
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass rubber, your rhymes left trash gutter
I’ll leave chumps done, don’t come with some junk son
‘Cause I’m makin’ flave niggas cool for consumption
I’m more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it’s too late for that lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow up
Sour luck, niggas got popped an’ swallowed nut

Terra just caught wreck, so I guess I got the green light
Niggas know about Herb McGruff
I’m on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough

Ayyo my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this an’ get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice an’ peas
(Herb can you fight?) Yo I’m nice with these
Put up your dukes, then me an’ you cook raw
‘Cause I stand tall an’ kick ass like a football
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I’m the fuck up outta here

Ayyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I’ma melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews ‘cause I'm bad news
In a mad move I'm servin’ brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this an’ get your body blown
‘Cause I'm a no maricón for poems and slidin’ hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Ayyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin’ melon got niggas gellin’
Ayyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon
Yo I’m bustin’ chumps like a Glock ten, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill ya show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail kids get nailed and read Braille when they fail
Yeah and I’m nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, ayyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that’s sawed off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
For dissin’, you’ll come up missin’, like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like flesh ‘cause they sections say they slaughter son
Talk about nines an’ tecs an’ never shot a water gun
But Killa Kam I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease ‘cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin’ at least
Twenty police deceased, it’s the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats an’ black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain’t no light looks, you fight crooks
Left an’ right hooks, if you front, get your life took
I'm havin’ nail sharp pains in my brain like a hell raiser
I'm blazin’ trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin’ but lead
Boom bye-bye then find another batty boy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call ‘em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein’ heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up to keep my head straight

I should never rhyme ‘cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
‘Cause they know when I start droppin poems
That I be knockin’ domes, poppin’ bones and sendin’ niggas hoppin’ home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin’ to see me, nigga, bring a cast an’ crutches
And niggas, I don’t need a gun for you, none of you
‘Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my number two
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn they motherfuckin’ ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, ‘cause it's a fact friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a mac ten
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm ‘bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin’ it tough
Peace to Big L, ayyo, eight is enoughEmbed
I'm straight loco, to hell with you and your broke ho
You ain't a big dog, you more like Toto, you got no dough
I smoke dro mixed with cocoa, strong as Bolo
I pack a fo'-fo', platinum Ro'-Ro'
Anti-homo, that's a no-no, so fuck po'-po'
I push the 740 and not the Volvo
C-Town push the six-oh-oh, I'm with a bitch or I'm dolo

Some people was born in heaven
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven, which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them... and never will

I'm only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel, it's quite ill
Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, "How will I make it?"

It seems like my life's been cursed ever since I was a child
And how will I make it? I won't, that's how
I walk around with a frown, I got no reason to smile
And how will I make it, I won't, that's how
Aiyo times was rough, I had to grow up foul
And how will I make it, I won't, that's how
I always knew that I'd end up doing time on the Isle
And how will I make it, I won't, that's how

Five years passed by, now I'm at the age of 15
No more fun and games, it's time to get cream
Cause I'm about to burst, it's like my life was cursed
I went to church, prayed everyday and it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets late, robbing suckers for funds
Now everyday I creep with the heat, ain't nothing sweet
I rob for meat, If I don't steal I don't eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living Hell
Then I started to realize, I'm better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep, now I can eat
Can't hit skins, but I wasn't hitting skins when I was in the street
Aiyo, I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'How will I make it?'


Doing time was full of stress G
All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didn't find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease, I'm back on the streets again
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic cause I'm broke, get up naked
And can't get a job cause of my jail record
Before you know it, I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for their change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either I'ma go back to jail or get murdered, but do I deserve it?
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I can't get a fair shot
I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'How will I make it?'

It'll be a cold day in Hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake, for real, I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the fat one that you love to hate, catch you at your mother's wake
Smack you, then I whack you with my snub tré-eight

Supposed to supply us with rights, tonight, I hold my rosaries tight as I can
I'm one man against the world
Just me and my girl — Black Pearl Latina, más fina, but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it, it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it
Creep with me, as I cruise in my Bimmer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat
And, you never see me talk to police
So, you should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat and I'll leave you right there
So beware — it's rare that niggas want beef
Big Pun — speak, and let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashin', catchin' niggas while they sleepin', no relaxin'
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three TEC's is in the Jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad — ghetto scholars
Full-A-Clips mob inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down, until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock down

We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine every time
Plus, I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk our prey like a predator
Whoever want it — go and get it, set it, baby, and I'ma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm reppin'
I fill a clip of my weapon and punish niggas 'til it's Armageddon
Yeah! And you don't stop!
Twenty-shot Glock with the cop-killers, fill 'em to the top

You couldn't take the impact with steel shoulder pads

Imagine and make it happen, I prayed about it and grabbed it
My life is a fucking movie, the baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself to see who could get it the fastest

I had a dream about a trillion in cash
It's time to make it happen!
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
Talking cash, you gotta fake an accent
I've broke enough tree down that I could make a cabin
Look: I turn all my problems to ash
All my wants into haves and then divided it by half
Pass it on to my man, write my will out then
Pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Bigs, greatest of all Seans

Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go on and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life’d it
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch?
I’m moonwalking
And my middle name Michael, ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title, ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Motherfuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’ma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
These will be the best memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories

Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til you considered great?
How many missed calls til you considered fake?
How many dreams til it's considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes
You don’t know how that shit feels mentally
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say in memory
I’m praying that he make it, wishing we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those will be the best memories

Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back

Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Mailed one when I heard Unique had died in that crash
Seems like yesterday I just seen her smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, light will swallow the dark
Hurtin' with my Mama looking at cribs we can't purchase
Houses bigger than the Palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles, I'm marathoning
To the money and you just running off in a circle
I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purses
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die first then I have the memories
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed

I'm tryna move in my safe like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like "This the girl Imma take out"
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way-way out

First place, no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast

Yes, and I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like "Sign these"
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gon' stop

Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like "man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother"
But that's on some other shit, look

I'm into making it then get back to making like I ain't made it yet
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work
Even if you don't get paid for it
Shit, call me the greatest
Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour
Like thank you God, look at all we created
I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement
And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers61Embed
Yeah yeah

Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back
I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that
And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that
Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating
Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it
Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs
And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings
And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk
Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed
What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?
Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this crossed
Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft
Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw
Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off
Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk
It be like "we don't got time for bullshit, dawg"
You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype
You look like the "um, you owe me" type
Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no
Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like
"Oh, you owe me likes"
Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em
The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em
The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em
I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD
And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first
No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy
Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know
But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um
White people with a black son
And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper
Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn
Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do
Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?
But what about now? 313

Bitches calling me, wanna smoke, beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killer

Fake weed, too much makeup, clown

What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your xan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love

I ain't really that good at goodbyes, I ain't really that bad at leavin'
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses, even persons leave 'em hurtin', bleedin'
I ain't really help the helpless, I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses, I'm good like books in churches

When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight
I ain't really that bad at sleepin'
With bad bitches, put 'em aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings, birthdays, even Tuesdays
Wednesdays, Thursdays, weekends
Rehearsing verses
Murdering merch and events
Damn, it feel good to be a gangsta
And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up
'Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound
And I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo
Thanks Justin, lending them pencils

I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as mama's hands
Running water standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold like Nat King
I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous, unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label, pro-famous
I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me, but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shorty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public
I speak to God in public, He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music

You gotta remember that our imagery is made from the best
So pray for the best

Married, tossed the veil, moved to Fort Lauderdale

Be the best ho you could be, go get the bread 'fore it's toast"
Boy, I fucked all of your hoes, you be spiralin' your hoes

They'll probably burn my jersey
Call up the pastor clergy
Call up the plastic surgeon
Call 'em the brand new version
Call me whatever you want, just call me back like it's urgent
I learned the art of forgiveness from the son of a virgin
I made so many clean slates that I could sell you detergent
I'm from a city full of finesses and janky merchants
Fragrance in pagan churches
Debt collectors that settle vendetta better in person
I wasn't born last week, yesterday I was nursing

Open up the pack, and let it reek
This is checkered field T, it's not Burberry
We ain't scared of po-po, word to Tyler Perry

After my Miranda rights, I need my attorney
Wifebeater like it's hot, but it's really really not
All this well earned ice, that I really really rock
All these damn designer clothes that I really really cop
Niggas pray really really that I really really flop
Gas in the car, I don't ever let it up
Got a foreign out the cut, it was time to rev it up
All green Valentino looking like some 7-Up
I wipe my ass with a hundred, fuck around and tear it up (catch up)
Get that backwards redrum
You wanna smoke, here we come
Loaded with them drums

Feeling like the man
Your bitch can get ran
In the club with some bands

Just to get the fucking loot, bitch ain't in my room
All this water, I need a swimming suit, counting up revenue
I just met this bitch but I put fuck her in my schedule
Bitches on my testicles, cruisin down Melrose

Power 106!
LA, it's ya girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd, called "Oakland", on Power 106
I was making Japanese and she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5 and she waits 'til I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me, "Turn around," then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland

Foot on the gas, I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights and the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay, babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, and oh
You might also like
I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die in Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends on Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old in Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot in Oakland, in Oakland

Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute

Foot on the gas, I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights and the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready, girl, that's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know you choose to stay, and oh
All the girlfriends saying, "Here we go again"
Rich kid, but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes, right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah, we can try
So let's try

Whoa, whoa
I took off my nine-to-five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon in Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you
So the fuck I'm supposed to do in Oakland? In Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland

When we were coming down, they left us all alone

How are you? Do you sleep? Are you with me?

Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can vibe out for the night
Stepping outside for a light
No coke and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know 'bout photos
Let's go though
How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
Why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his Goose (Woo!)

Craftmatic, making moves, but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Grind 'cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same-sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost God, never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say it just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walkin' in it
With a gun that they 3D printed and finish it

He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina, thirty dollars I swallowed

I'm gone—now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden, this burden hurting, they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and had a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying, "Go hard"
Making dope, it's a trap; Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out; "It's the best," no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make him believe in himself, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, killing myself, no one's ever been this lost
I just get the information, retweet it or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who is this? Don't do it, where are you?
Who is this? Who is this?) I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he move with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make her dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces of shit for breakfast
Funny, the day you born, that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversatin'
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talk in the evening, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas take her props, like a musical, live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams, on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her, "I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help"
She text me, "How you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?"
I mean she right though, .45 like a lightbulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took Chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass: "You see what these labels do to me?"
Text said, "I'm wet"; I said, "Hold up, wait a minute"
H2O plus my D, that's my hood, I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gon' reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish, but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit, eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
"Life: The Biggest Troll", but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up

So ditch the lame twit you are currently involved with
The Derrick boys a bunch of crazy brothers like the Baldwins
Echo, motherfucker, you are just another dolphin
Hello, motherfucker, like I walked in on incest
Do it, motherfucker, talking does not impress
Us, man, us, it's all about us
Like them self-absorbed teen girls talking on the bus
We trust you to pay when we ask you to pay
'Till then, Chili Peppers, we give it away
I don't fuck the fans, I am not the industry
Man, I hate it when the man comes between you and me
I don't masturbate, I give a handjob to a star and
Picture you bumping out this anthem in your car
Still showing up for our dorks, geeks, losers
Rode out from New York on six beach cruisers
And if we could, we'd ride with every kid right on the handlebars
We are just some rappers like some fat kid ate the candy bars

Yes, I'm back with a whole new attitude
Flier than a Cardinal, check my fuckin' latitude
Yes, I'm so sick, man, somebody call the doctor
Girls stay wet like I'm fucking with a lobster
I stopped talking, I'm tired of paying 'em lip service
Switched over them street niggas to hipsters
I am so different, Donald Glover in this bitch
I don't need to use my rapper name, that's just childish
And they used to call me "Oreo", dunk me in that milk
Maybe then I will be white enough to hang out with them kids
They have to call you names when they don't know what you are
Now they know just what I are, baby girl, I am a star
APC kicks, looking like a British boy
More money means more problems, I have been annoyed
Dude mad 'bout the girl that I came with
I'm fly, she fly, you are just penguin
I am just a rapper, so I don't speak English
I just go hard like the traffic light changes
Sick Boi, bitch, we the clique like seatbelts
Yes, I'm on fire, I don't have to ask how heat felt
When I was 14, man, nobody else was thinking this
A nigga off the chain; man, I Abraham Lincoln'd this

Get girls on the floor like slow jams
Fuck yeah, I'm feelin' myself, no lotion
My light shine bright, no roaches
Nigga, I'm focused
You the one who eyes wrong
Only time I'm worried is when I'm the no-fly zone
Cause I'm so fly, homes
Fresh like pinecones
Female phone book my iPhone
Margarita bright, meanin' limelight
Nerd girls losin' their shit like prom night
Mouth like a pussy, it can never be too tight
Let me guess, you know a better rapper you, right?
Bam-B
Sicker than your grandma
Pass the mix-tape to a friend like Chandler
This track is gettin' over written:
'Sports Night' banter
Tell 'em that you know me when you runnin' through Atlanta
I am at the top
Whether you want or not
And I am in my prime
I am an autobot
I do not talk a lot
I am just a rapper
Fuck a girl's pussy bright red like snapper

Someone tell me why these muthafuckers busy hatin' me
Just because I'm rappin' and my style is kinda Japanese
Band of outsiders
Kitsune, APC
Macy's got shit on me
Fuck what you heard like a dick inside alarm clock
I ain't got no jewelry, I leave it at the pawn shop
Two of your chains equals one of my shirts, sir
You got Jacob's Jeweler, I got Anna Wintour
Niggas jealous cause I got more green than seven splinters
I'd rather spend that money on a polo from La Tigre
Young, smart, and handsome
Who could even ask for more?
I change the situation like auditioning for Jersey Shore
I'm the prince, put your crown on the ground (x7)
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh

Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic
Mistake still burning but I'm learning like a raptor
Take what I'm given make it work like an adapter
Make short work of her, then I will adapt her
Critics all agree it was the work of a master
At last my success will match my fatigue
And at last I'll send my children to an ivy league
In the masks from The Strangers, freak the whole place out
Get your glasses on, girl, geek your whole face out
Don't open up your mouth unless to let something great out
And that's not a beef, that's just a peek at the steakhouse
A week at my maid's house to recharge my battery
Then I'll be right back on top like Slattery
You know from Sterling and Cooper
If she's paid out then I will recoup her
And if she's paid out then I will invest
And if she's really played out then I will impress
Upon her the need to please please me, whoa yeah
Girl I'm on my knees, Ooh, I need it so bad
It's like I work at NORAD
It's DEFCON-5
Go out back to my car and drive
Cause shit just got real
Take a thirty wreck drive into a field
Pass out in my vehicle
Hope I wake up in a world more agreeable
Hope I wake aboard unidentified flying objects
Or a reject Enterprise
A Starfleet drop out odyssey
A route to cop out galaxies

White girls, so the twelve never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god she need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in?
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down, then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique, there's a lot of us
They talk shit, but nobody else on top of us
Got popular, this the real shit
Get—in the face with a full clip
Get—in the aim, niggas don't slip
Then get—with a case just for sellin' it
I know them gorillas, I hang with them killers
They paint 'em as villains when really they livin', we gotta ball

I used to walk on the beach at night
I remember
The best time was when well, me and you
We got all our friends and we got a tent
We slept in it
Not the whole night, but just enough time
Magic happened, nothing was born luckily
It's up to me, but
Then we left
The times have changed
The pleasures that I feel
They say you never say never, it's real
Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep

I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny how I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes were the potion
Cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
Cause I wear these tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah, I'm self conscious
Go ahead - laugh it up
Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up
They told my ass to blacken up
What the fuck are you?
You don't even say shit
Quit writing gay shit
Now they see me and have to squint like asians
Cause I'm on fire and everything I touch blazes
Giving you the realness
Kid I got a lot of it
Listen to my mixtapes, tell me if they contradict
Don't fuck with these niggas cause this swag is abstinent
I don't have time to sleep
I don't have time to eat

Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me

Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us

Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike
She got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams

As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I reserve love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What He showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

Erotica, wet dreaming on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, "P.S., with love", I sign

Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (Ahh) I feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me, our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face
Your mouth half open, your love I can taste
Embracin' you, life I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

Enslaved by loneliness (Oh-oh)

I want you to come inside your mind
And find a place, nasty and kind
This is where our desires grind
And where they peak is most divine
A place and time I hope we reach together

Check it, check it

Driftin' on a memory
Brought forth from a fifth of Hennessy
As in times of '89 they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually, broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes, this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggas be fuckin' girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin' over if he said, "Dumb bitch"
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin' the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin' lot
Unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin' off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
And start thinkin' they thugs
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion, so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin'
Saved my day, dancin' on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin'
Over gossip, Kenwood broads was pourin'
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
And Starter coats out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD I would quote Stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
Either go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin' like Vice Lords, down to the Taste
Not wantin' to bring my lady around crew 'cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
At 'em I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up

There go the break
To get the break go, it go OOH OH
Yeah, it go OOH OH
You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yo, check it, check it

Nowadays, niggas is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with 'em, 'cause they was born to trace
At times, I contemplate movin' to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline give me a warm embrace
Remindin' me of the pointed parties Moe used to make
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin' Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late, callin' broads, hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at, then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes, havin' bakeouts
We'd eat at Giordano's and break out
Then, everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin' and
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin' and
Tim'll be basin' Mike down at I.I.T
Rememberin' numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
My man Sef passed, I feel hollow but still

Words out my cipher, the life of my circle
Pain trapped inside of me, Cabrini to Ida B., don't lie to me
You want me in your needle
Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch

Beat digger, not a nigga or a niggaro
I figure you're the winner of the bread
Precede your thoughts 'fore they come into your head

Heads I'm boring, soaring to a new height of flight

I dilate pupils that's cornea than a retina
My Book of Life you felt it, because of the texture
When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me
I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me
Cheap ass niggas, go and purchase it
I ain't do all this work for shit
My style's my child I gave birth to it
Like an immaculate conception, clean I came
Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name
I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys
So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind
I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon' be like
"I can't believe it! I got shot!"
Bowe, so I lick one, not for Riddick
But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MC's that be all over it
Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?
I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall
I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel
I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in
Now them same gumps be askin' me to get them in

Now I'm talkin' square biz to you and I'm out
I'm in my own worldEmbed
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a Person In Making Profit
See, I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be travelin'
And Chevy windows be rattlin'
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asking her the name wasn't the way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin' on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried

Pimp yo' punk ass, have you write me poetry
I'm from a lane called cash, you too slow for me

Or have you on the corner trickin' in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
(Common: Try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball?
I know pimpin' ain't easy but damn, you barely surviving

Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (Common: And pimp what?)
Pimp systems
Got stores called Big Pimpin' (Common: Where?)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house

(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou

Bring 'em back to the States to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer

(HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Common: Why you laughin'?)
I'm laughin' 'cause you funny
I make bitch niggas like you have my money

You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki

Yo, whatever happened to loyalty?
Don't you want to become royalty?
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher


Well there you have it y'all

What what, we do this time
Rock rock....
Yes, let this music travel through you
Talk about feelings, yeah yo

Yo wassup world?
Yo what's happening?
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been, time travelin *echoes*
Time travelin *echoes*

Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
Though my sex drive is like a car chase
More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on
My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown
Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my guy caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down
Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross
Many paid dues, but few knew the costs
I ran through the Moss like Randy
Touching down with God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this

Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man
Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel

Loud niggas that whisper carelessness
If we livin in Revelation
Why should the people of the sun have to run?
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason
He said, "Rah, give back what you receivin"
In a race against time, I was caught
In the same game as you, but long live the sport
It's time travelin
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been
Time travelin *fades out* time travelin....

I wanna be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in a direction
In the right way, told her, "Inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say"
Chicago nights, they stay on the mind
But I write many lives, they lay on these lines
Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise, I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back, or too far in front of me
The present is a gift, and I just wanna be (Be, be, be, be)

Opportunity knocks, I'm lookin' through the peephole
In my daughter’s laugh, I can hear a deep soul
E was my first love, now I'm on the sequel
Heart stay open, in you I keep gold
Crossroads of beast mode to peace mode
Southeast cold, Avalon to Eckersall
Too much on my back to set it off
From the offset, I just wanna be, be, be
Like Cardi or 'Oncé, or Harry Belafonte
Whenever I eat, my peeps get the same entrée
Like they my fiance
It ain't easy, when niggas like, "Feed me"
When I ain't got it they don't believe me
Read me truth, lead me truth

We reproduce, so our fruits can see
The fruit's a harvest for the world that the mustard seed produced

Meditatin' took Kamasi song, ask him
Robbin' in Baskin, our heroes ain't masked men
When I do it, Com' do it with passion
My compassion for brown and black skin
In the hood I used to backspin
Now I'm spinnin' back in the hood
When I'm back, "Yo, what's good?"
If you stand up, then that's understood
I tell the black sheep, "Don't react to them wolves"
Crib love, our heroes are on murals
So five Euros get told in their earlobe
That they can let fear go
Souls clear the way, let these palms pirouette
Or pirouette, in the silhouette of blackness and cigarettes
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well
They want us to be in jail

The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music

In this never-ending battle to please
Niggas, magazine writers, emcees
Who request hot shit, I freeze
And tell them where I was rose, we always said cold
Hold your horses and your carriages
This never-went-gold nigga rocks shows carat-less
You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage
Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this
And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had dreams of fucking R&B broads, it came true
Journalist I wreck, shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee
Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me
Some say "You changing, Rashid"
Times are, we still close

You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay emcees, just don't come around me with it
You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger, eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs, of Mary J. Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky
My verse depth, is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing, inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone

Plus your health record ain't really that clean
We don't forget like Nat King, what happened in Tuskegee
We getting over high blood pressure and diabetes
Like trees, we fall in the wilderness of America
Is it you don't hear us or don't care for us?

I don't know what we should call it
Some say it's love, some call it lust
They say that we free but we falling
So what should we call it?
Blood on the leaves, it ain't autumn
The weight is so heavy, it hurts underneath
Don't it seem like we got it the hardest?
And we keep on falling
Once upon a time, there was a Black man
They loved him when he shot ball, they loved him when he ran
They loved him when he rapped, they loved him when he danced
But really didn't love him when he was out with his fam
Couldn't love him in the hood or selling CD's
And couldn't love her when she was in her house sleep
I'm wondering if it's love if it's really love at all
'Cause in that type of love, we fall

I don't know what we should call it
Some say it's love, some call it lust
They say that we free but we falling
So what should we call it?
Blood on the leaves, it ain't autumn
The weight is so heavy, it hurts underneath
Don't it seem like we got it the hardest?
And we keep on falling

Ooh, we keep falling

For the Black diaspora and all its vastness
You in my plans, thinkin' of a master
The essence of your dance, the truth in your laughter
That I wanna capture and cultivate stature
I'll be here for you 'til the hereafter
There's a clear path to, to the love inside you
My name's Rashid, that means I'm a guide too
We both are driven, that's why we arrive to
A place where now anything we could ride through

To get the people freed up
The soul of a rebel with his feet up
When it feel like the world about to erupt
I'ma hold you down 'til you see up
Optimism that we got from wisdom
We from the same tribe and we locked in rhythm
To de-block the system
We did lots of livin', and lots of givin'
A higher vibration but it's not religion
I wanna pour into the riches of your bein'
We don't diss each other even when we disagreein'

Superstar status, everything stellar
With some bad bitches and some ex-drugs sellers
Niggas already jealous
We in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers
She already wanna pick, bitch don't be so over zealous
Go to the bar to get around like a propeller
The barmaid's name is Stella
I'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me
Am I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party
Wanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah
Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah
Seen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah
Wanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha
Hmmmm! Well let me take my time
She ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight
Seen that ass cause I got hindsight
She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight
'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt
She said "You rap?" Yea mummy

Code is to always stay fresh
Aware of a chest cause I stay abreast
She was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest
This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess
Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled
I'm locked into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove
I won't have to take it back to high school
Rewind! No need to take me back in time
Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline
Cause what's in front of me is this behind
Up north, she's thick; down south she's fine
Tuned in to what I'm doing
I'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing
The ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade
Showing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me
Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady
Dude got foul like crack in the 80s
Uh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo
You never know who got a Tec up in the disco

After bein' 25 you know just trying to survive in the world
About to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?
Anyway just when you start gettin' that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves
So bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it

Yo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn
Began, began with time
Being my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brother, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the devil's White
Well, the devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Qur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doing right and got you this far
Whether you say "in Jesus name" or "Hum do Allah"
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
'Cause when the trumpets blowin', 24 elders surround the throne
Only 144,000 gon' get home

I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me

Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn, something in me wanna know who I am
So I began my search, my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
Takin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White
Some leads were granted with insight
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So, with following I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas
You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me7Embed
Push out the noise
Songbirds replace the morning commute
Face adjusting to the lack of sunshine in the blink of an eye
We know exactly where we were when the world stood still and grounded all the stars
On our back porch patios relearning the subtle art of breathing
Our tribes, our well traveled scars
We found warmth inside a family of arms
Connected with other mothers
Crafting countless lives and transforming two-bedroom apartments into theatrical stages
Ceilings covered in constellations
Learning really begins at home now
We remember every lyric to every song ever played
Living room is the dance floor
God bless the DJs
Perhaps the battleground and our peace of mind our suspended on the edge of Earth
Balancing gracefully right outside our front doors
And the laughter of our brilliant boys and the de-silencing of our majestic girls
We (We) push out (Push out) the noise (The Noise)
What is more radical then authentic love?
Moon at half mass, masquerading as global light
I see the God in you, that's what goddesses do
I made you breakfast too, we eat at noon
We move time
Sometimes the bravest step is standing our ground
B-Girl stands defiant along these divided skies
The same hands that built all those churches dipped in gold
Palms open and breakdance pose into prayer position
Also made you dinner and kissed away all your fears
The ones that saw us in the future and prayed us into existence from the 1700's
We still here
Everywhere aliens
Where to win if not in our own mythology?
Where to find comfort if not in the arms of our lover?
Our children swing, our breath pushes them into possibility and whispers their stories into truth
Birth is never planned, but oh, how we first cry
Fly Sankofa style back into a safe place along his treasure chest
A few moments right before the sun sets when summer returns after winter wept
Tears become a necessary blessing, a holy water for the forgotten
We are praying to any ancestor listening
Ain't we always been a amplified joy?
A boombox altered for the descendants of drums and water bearers
A gathering of souls
A sanctuary surrounded by natural springs, the bling of butterflies
Headphone escape route, a survivor's anthem plays on
Someone will tell them, "We are still alive"
We fight inside the music on our own land
Built from ancestral memory and questions
When do warriors rest? When there is nothing left to die for
What have you learned from being inside?
There's still no place like homeYou might also likeEmbed

Tell you something about poetry, it refuses
It breaks and asks to be broken
The broken pieces form a question mark
And this is the revolutionary poem, exclamation point
The radical belief that broken is beautiful
That breaking is essential
That revolution is built from wreckage
Exclamation comes from asking
The question is, "What use do we have for time not measured by the rivers dancing beneath us?
In us? Beforе us?"
We pray like this, majestic, еlectric
We slide, step, dip, shake, every room a dance floor
Let all my skin kin in, let sunshine in
Let me kiss on my loves chosen and fought for
Come, make you a plate
Pour some out
Return and get it
This is the thing about poems
They want to live
They remind us when we forget how to love and be love
How even leaves have veins with stories to tell
And we are the stories
We are the radical and hopeful
We are the revolutionary poem, exclamation point
You don't have to go home, but this is only the start
The good part is what comes nextYou might also likeEmbed

And in his shoes there were holes
But the white man didn't care, shit;
He didn't have to wear it (Uh-uh)
The scratch that he had, he got from his parents
With his tight ass, he woulda been poor white trash, but anyway
Everyday the black man would ask him to spare change
But at him, the white man would stare strange
So the black man got fed up
Cause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him
And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him
The Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon
And now the black man own the store

I will be by your side (What's up, what's up)
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
(Yo, yo)

I never knew a luh-luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spеnd it slow forever
I know your heart is wеathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some ****** recognize the light, but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort, I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close...

And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my *****, or even my boo
There's so much in a name, and so much more in you

And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all

This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognise sunshine
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh, darling
There is a light that shines (Yeah)
Special for you and me
(Yo, yo, check it)

It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know, to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!
There are times

Freak to the funk that no one else is bringin' (yeah)
Sen Dog with the funky biling'in
Yeah that's the nombre, heard that homey
Peace to Mellow and Frost en el deporte
Sen Dog is not a kid, a veterano
I'm down, another proud hispano
One of the many of the Latin de éste año
And I got plenty for the Jennies tryin' to hound yo
But wait, they're clownin' on me cause of my language
I have to tell em straight up, its called Spanglish
Now who's on the pinga, the gringo
Tryin' to get paid, from the funky bilingual

Latin lingo, baby (Funky bilingual), funky bilingual
(Yeah, funky bilingual!)
Latin lingo, baby (Funky bilingual), funky bilingual
(It's the latin lingo!)

Cuando entro, (when I come in) suckers frontin'
Me mira another bilingual from villa
Vengo como un ejemplo, check the tempo
Ahhh... esta chingon el instrumento
Ya oiste, como somos
Yo no jodo, I gots the soul though
And you can hear it, en las congas
Tribal ceremony as the Hill gets stronger
Don't be such a leva, what u got for that cabeza?
Hey homes, pass the cerveza
Before I have to go and push up on your esa
Hmm she's fine, son que fresca
Here homes have a hit of this yesca
Teach you enseño, el leño lo prendo
Now you know, that I am in the centro
Where you live, si tu puedes
Nowadays you ain't shit without your cuetes
Something like it's gangbang, vatos quieren bang, bang!
Cause I hung out with them now you callin' me a insane

And I'm down with La Raza
Kid Frost got my back, BOO-YAA! en la casa
Cause everyday things get a little crazier
As I step to the microphone area
First I claim my city, puro Los Angeles
Yeah (you know homes) that's where the gangas at
Vatos waitin' on me, along with the heinas
Catchin' all the sweat for what I said to one-timer
So when you see me at the party or the baile
Before I got here I was gaffled in the calle
Who's that gabacho who said I was borracho
Had an attitude while you tried to play me macho
Just relax, calmado mijo

Quemando putos que se creen mazisos
Dejando ceniza, tu no quieres ser la
Victima de un ciclon
Simon, tu sabes que soy el chingon
Sacalos and muevelos ya
Juras que soy el mejor
Tu quedaras igual que los demas
Esta alegandome, no lo trates
Porque te pego asi como tus padres
Has lo que te digo yo, si no
(pinche puto, vengo en control)
Balas, ayy! no les importa quien muera
Cuando estan en guerra
Con que maten, un vato del otro lado
Diferentes rumbos, cargan soldados
Si la lluvia cae, pronto miraras
Los huetos que hay (mueve tus cañones)
Somos intocables, cypress cero si
Calla y si no cruces claro que vas a morir
Grandes familias, mueren nunca
Siempre filerosas como puntas
De navajas, balas que cargas
No te me brinques (ese no chingues!)...

Putos vienen en todas medidas y clases
Te agarro con el mecate, por el cuello pa colgarte
Asi no puedes respirar, lo que necesita
Es la mota que te voy a dar
Como un muñeco, yo te controlo
Con las mañas de maniaco
Mi ejercito crece como mota
La familia mas grande que la chota
Ahora te ecuentro en panico
Atrapado por mi clicka en el auto
Nunca encuentran cuerpos que tiramos
En lagos entierran evidencia y cae la miseria
Muy tarde llegan a buscarte a ti
Si me preguntan digo que yo no te vi
Un miedo vive en tu mente
Vente y deveras vas a conocer la muerte...

Dejenme pasar soy el que domina
Cuando viene el pleito soy el que termina vidas
38 voy a cargar
Buscando a levas que tengo que eliminar
(que onda pues, corres cuando me ves
Por que sabes que controlo el 1 y 3)
Y corto por la mitad quien me mire mal
No puedes escapar, llegaste a tu final

Si tu quieres que me toque pues caele
Soy el grifo mas escandaloso
De Los Angeles Cypress peligroso
Enciende el leño o la pipa
Pasalo por mi clica la que rifa
Mota rica, chipa chipa
Quemando yesca, estoy arriba
Es algo que yo hago diario
Al despertar y tambien todo el dia en mi barrio
Cuando me encuentres en cualquier lugar
Saca papeles porque quiero fumar mota...

La famosa Cypress Hill rifa
Todos los vatos salen, están en la calle
Tírense cabrones, si me ven manejar
Con los que me junto
Con un Magnum quebrando unos putos
Puro cholo loco, empaca cromo
Y te llenamos el saco de plomo

Hay mucha gente que me dice
Que no valgo madre y no voy hacer
Nada porque me critican
Ahora tengo feria y ellos me envidian
Chingan y piden siempre me siguen
Y al mismo tiempo me dicen:
No entendemos tu onda
Con tu cuete, tu dinero y adicto a mota
Yo nunca quise golpear a vatos
Pero si me cruzas a mi yo te mato
6 pies bajo de la tierra
Yo no miento es verdad
Ese, quedaras como antes
Solo me acuerdo cuando me asaltaste
Clik clak, cuete esta cabron
Me queria bajar la feria este ladron
Pero no dejo que me maten
Wa da da dang, wa dada daa dang...

Con el perro a hueso yo lo necesito
Si estas a 5 pies de mi, yo te lo quito
Pido la espalda, tas ahi? un payasito
Te tumbo, como un control remado
Te persigo y te sigo y te meto como un palo
Juntando raperos como modos en la mesa
Sopresa, te rompi la cabeza
Te pongo a dormir, con abrazo de pescueso
No me importa lo que tengo que hacer, yo hago queso
Pasele, cuidado con mi estilo
Te mato bien matado, ya dormi un ratico...

Tira la bala de la loma con la bomba

Matando raperos y quitandote la vida
Me llevo la tuya, simple, no vales nada

Cypress Hill vive, siempre tamos aqui
Corriendo el juego con el mismo fuego
Quemando los demas, tirandolo en el hueco
Ya despues que queme, yo bajo la llama
Corre, escondete bajo la cama
No te hagas bobo, mi juego apretado
Listo, preparado, como un soldado
Te corto tan malo tu madre ni te conoce

Aunque ahi estan los puercos no parare
Con conecta influencia yo seguire
Bendito sea Dios por el zacate
No dejes que la torta al rescate

Peep though
Things are on the fallout
Kids all lookin' to peel my wig back
I figure that shit out
The other day
The rearview mirror
When things are closer than they appear
Tear shit down hit the corner
Cut through the alley
Seen a fine chick
Didn't have time to rally
I remember you but I gotta dip
Skip the fuck out
These niggas are following me from behind haters
They can't fade us or eliminate us to get famous
It's all painless
I'll show 'em what insane in the brain is
Maybe they'll run, or find out what the rain is
They want beef fuck giving it to 'em shameless

That causes a nigga to react
More to the back hit the corner
Know what they say
Caught a nigga live on to fight another day
Maybe fight and not appear
Maybe they want it
Maybe you niggas following my attention
I dispatch the troops quick didn't give 'em time
Didn't give 'em a second to push me over the line
Between that the humiliation I saw my life flash
Gun blast, all out confusion
The smoke clears
Foes crawlin' outta here
Snap fingers like magic, they disappear
These bitches had it no question they're all bloody
Never fuck with nobody who's crazy!

I'm in this world hell called life
Willin' to risk it
Pop the disc and you ain't bustin' a biscuit
Fools think they heavy weight
They never wait
Like a nigga tryin' to get pussy on the first date
They featherweight, whatever hate if you want to
Kill me in my soul will come back to haunt you
You never sleep, never get rest
Feelin' the cold breath, you're the opposite of everlast
You never last!
Pass 7 days of madness
After my soul path
Your spiritual plane is weak, nigga you need to fast
Cause you're bitin' my shit
Mouths full but don't swallow
My shit's acid burning your stomach making you hollow
Best learn who you're fucking with
Before you try shit
You might die with my name caught in your eyelids
See that, weave that, inhale the weed sack

I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits
She didn't wanna be one of those hoes
In clothes exploiting her body from head to toes
She had glossy lips she was swaying her hips
On the dance floor and every nigga's flashing her grip
Trying to impress her in vain she gave no play
Niggas hit her up for numbers and she said no way
I thought to myself let it go and roll on, B
But like Smokey said she really had a hold on me
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya
Even if I moved to the other side of the party
I had pictures in my head of her moving that body
I was beside myself with hunger pain
So I slowly walked over and I asked her name

What's your name, what's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, girl give me a chance!

I offered her a drink she turned me down flat
She said if you want my name you gotta do better than that
I said OK, now your shit don't stink
I'ma walk away only tried to buy you a drink
As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for real
But every guy in the club tried slipping me pills
I don't trust guys each and every one will lie to you
I said I understand but it's not what I try to do
I wasn't even gonna come to your table
But if I didn't I knew that I'd regret it later
I go after what I want but I got class
For me no need to slip a pill if I want ass
She gave me a funny look I couldn't tell what it meant
She let her guard down and on our conversation went


She said I want a man with a plan and ambition
Not an immature nigga on a "pussy-hit mission"
I'm too good for that I have so much to offer
Got a good job working at my mom and dad's law firm
You got goals, that's what she asked
Yeah I wanna fill my home with platinum plaques
It takes hard work but you know it's coming after
She said 'oh my God you must be a famous rapper!'
I do all right but I'm never satisfied
I'm told when you still love what you do it never gets old
I strive for more but that's enough about me
Why don't we skip out the club and take a walk on the streets
We slipped out of the club with no worries
Seems she wanted to get out in a hurry
We hung all night till we lost our friends
Till they caught us bangin in the back of a Benz

This is the story of Cypress Hill

I used to carry a Glock on the waist line
Man I don't waste time
I'm strong on the bass line
You'll never taste mine
See me on the screen
Fuckers beggin' for face time
Get your own tape
But don't bother to chase mine
I got a block, man, we havin' a great time
You couldn't fill the shoes
Anytime that I laced mine
Light up the stage
For the homies we make shine
Sick the dogs on you get more by the K-9
Homies on the yard never walk in the main line
The manes find that they can never be in the game
I'm lettin' off rounds
Hittin' blunts at the same time
Pick a crew homie
You a neon to save time
Bitches like you always spittin' the same rhymes
We put you all to shame
You never went through the same grind
Put you in the bind the minute you came by

And your little ass safe couldn't hold my cake
Get your asks denied down the road I take
And let me tell you one more thing before I skate
If you a fake or a snake, I'mma send you to your grave

Runnin' hot, but I'm still comin' to get'cha
Thinkin' like a peace smoke comin' on a homicide

Finger on the trigger wit' my hands upon a steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is goin' Boo-Ya
Ya stuck in my hood so what ya gonna do now?
Bein' the hunted one is no fun
Here I come son, yo I think ya better run
Better run more and move a little faster

Ain't takin' shit from you, him, or no man

All because a nigga tried to play me on a trigger
He missed, so now the niggas hiss
Rude and crude like a pit-bull, get ta the point
Your fuckin' card will get pulled, now...
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beat-downs

No Pierdo Nada (Nothin' To Lose)
Juega con las reglas o si no te rompo
Bien apretado estas en mi luz
Si vienen los puercos te pongo en una cruz
Nada que hacer nomas esconderte
Entraste, tu pacas siendo tu viente
Cuando conviene esto me da sabor
Si estas en mi camino te enseño mi calor (ahh!)
La pongo en la mesa laten las tijeras
Raperos son esclavos de compañia disquera
No puedes perder, nomas escoje
Un grupo de matones que no son ladrones
Has lo que tiene que ser y no te rompas
Cuida la salud y comparte con las compas (compa)
Ten cuidado, con la pista
Si estas en la loma usa tu vista (vista)
Que se cuenta? que soy cuento...

Te doy mi todo, no pierdo nada
Pasa que ayer, el tiempo se acaba...
Te doy mi todo, sabes como soy
Me meto a tu cabeza, te destruyo hoy
Agarro mi pluma la meto en tu cerebro
No voy a parar hasta que quedes muerto
Estoy en mi zona corro y te destuerco
Pongo en un palo a cocinar, dia de puercos
Yo soy el loco, agarro una foto
Entiende la foto me importa poco

Down for my barrio, enter mi villa
Tha Hill Cartel,  takin' over your area
Makin' mad queso down, en Mexico
Where the sun burns hot and goes down slow
Got my clientele, so everythin' is well
Got a villa in the mountains, with the big spanish bill
And let it be know, that I'm down for tha tranza!
The brown Robin Hood, lookin' out for tha raza
See me in my ranfla, I'm straight bala proof
A conquistador, con crane on the loot
Try to pull a swoop but I got my soldados
Tha soul asesinos vienen preparados
Tha rappers desperados, with the foot on the throttle
You know what we say, "get the money, hit the model!"
Get the cash, make the dash, callin' my hermano
We all get drunk down with the red-gusano!

Never slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you
Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bid in the pen
You got that? Getting your cup, I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shhh
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
"Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question"
"Just do what I say, and you'll be rich"
"And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine"
"Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game"
"Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame"
"Why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving"
"Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out"
"Always be aware of what's around you"
"They wanna down you, and they clown you"
"Keep your shhh in order the money won't stop"
"Pretty soon you'll be on top"

Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die

Tequila Sunrise, with the bloodshot eyes
My, my, my, how time flies and goes by surprise
My mentor passed on and passed a warn to me, emergency
For my enemies who wanna murder me
Eat the worm, little brotha, while you burn, you sucka
Better kill me, don't let me return, mother-
Trust no man, cause I'll be back, you understand?
With a plan, and my ace in hand, I want it all
I recall the words from Jesus, you are the Juice
Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die
Now take of a sip, caution it, but I never lie

31 years old so I done been through all that dizzirt
Came up off the porch, straight serving off the cizzurb
Long time ago, I don't do that shit no more
This the last time I'mma tell you, wanna hear it? (Here it goes!)
It was me and Baby James, with an ounce to our name
Rolling up two at a time, same clothes from yesterday
Had a smoke around a custo, paid his ass a stone
When the narcs came and raided hid on the roof and smoked bong
Fuck with rat bitches, head from them hunnies
Lost a sack but I got back, cause the dice game was hitting
It was me and Carbo, breaking day in the lobby
Nigga popping NoDoz, selling rocks as a hobby
Bankroll in my pocket, so everybody know me
Went home and gave my momma three hundred for some groceries
We hit the mall and ball, hit the club and spend it all
Now I'm back to Square A with them squares to get off

In the kitchen, oven open for the heat
Got my young, light-skinned ho rolling up the tree
Wearing jackets in the house, it's a Michigan winter
Boiling water on the stove, Ramen noodles for dinner
Dope fiends out the halfway house and they still sniffing
Homie mommy's 50, smoking and still tricking
Still talking shit with this loosie, I'm ash flicking
See my breath when I talk, but nigga, I ain't tripping
Landlord is, the nigga tryna put us out
Selling all the samples, can't afford to give 'em out
Just copped a half-track, see my nigga tryna get it
Standing on the baseline, Scottie Pippen pivot
Needles in they arms just to keep the lights on
Shit, fuck around, be on hardcore pawn
Tryna get this shit off, the window, we snuck in
Won't live for anything, but might die for nothing

To bag up and sell a whole pound

Imma just grab your hand and be like (hey)
Could be standing at bus stop, faygo red pop
If you lookin' hot, I'm like (hey)
And I'm checking ID's, girl you won't R.Kelly me
So if you under 18, I'm like (hey)
And the ancients of the dance, let me pull up my pants
Put my hands in the air and be like (Hey)1Embed
The product of Reaganomics
Teen parents, failing on a promise
Try to stay modest, hard to live honest
When it's no dollars and you talking with ebonics
Far from a scholar, bad at job interviews
Can't type a resume, dropped out of high school
Tried to go to night school, kept leaving early
Fucking with this thick freak lightskin shorty
Looking for an answer, only get questions
Like I'm in reverse on a busy intersection
Rolling up , close to perfection
Lost in the streets, won't ask for directions
Wanna find corrections, keep doing wrong
Same old song and it don't last long
Tapping out early, submittin' to the streets
But I stay focused, put the words on the beat
But I stay focused, put the words on the beat
I wanna go to heaven, 'cause I'm livin' in hell
My excuse being broke: being in jail
Been broke my whole life and it still ain't fixed
I'ma die tryna get rich
How the fuck you gon' eat, if you can't 
Who the fuck gon' feed us? We can't starve
It ain't good over here
You rollin' up purple but it's wood over here
I lay in bed and think, then I shed a couple tears
Know before noon, I be on my third beer
Go to sleep late but I wake up early
Way I live, dawg, prolly won't see thirty
Wrote my first will when I turned 18
Turnt out ever since I served my first fiend
Hot cup of ramen might last me a day
Broke and ain't ate shit since yesterdayYou might also likeEmbed


Yo, something's wrong here. No, not again!
Get the daisies for the (Potholes in my lawn)
(Potholes in my lawn, potholes in my lawn)

Everybody's sayin' what to do when
Sucker lunatics start diggin' and chewin'
They don't know that the Soul don't go for that
Potholes in my lawn
And that goes for my rhyme sheet
Which I concentrated so hard on, see
I don't ask for maximum security
But my dwellin' is swellin'
It nipped my bud when I happened to fall into a spot
Where no ink or an ink-blot was on a scroll
I just wrote me a new 'mot' but now it's gone
'Cause those suckers knew that I hate
To recognize that every time I'm writin' it's gone

Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-a
Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-ee-hee-hee-hee
Potholes in my lawn

I've found that it's not wise
To leave my garden untended 'cause eyes
Has now pardoned all laws of privacy
Even paws are after my writer, see
I pursue that everyone's sayin'
What to do when suckers are preyin'
Upon my well-guarded spreadsheets
Oh why, hell does it send up fleets
Of evil-doers through the big hole
To get to evil-doers who dig holes
Which leaves my lawn with lawn-chew
I think I'd better plant traces to give clues
Or better yet call 9-1-1
And when they get here I inform them I'm the Plug One
Offer up a chair and let them realize the reason
For concern of the Soul
'Cause we've come down with a case of potholes

DOVE:
Access to her code
Lovestruck Dove is Dove's mode
Took a look, dropped my books
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Breakfast was our greeting
Yogurt to verse is what I fed
Slipped a note, rocked my yacht
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Jenny, only thought about Jenny
But didn't think about Derwin
The Jimmy who's only a virgin
Steady we go, Jenifa led
Plug and a tune was freedom well said
So what's the fix, oh Jenifa
Can a brother the soul get swingin'?
POS:
The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the breaks, found her shape
Jenifa, oh Jenny
You might also likeTranscripts showed more than flirt
'I love daisies' read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Marvelous
Shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for Pos
Found a house, aroused my joust
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like Dan I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried 'kick it'
Posdnuos was in
Jenny, only thought about Jimmy
But asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin?
She said 'Let's try it in the bathroom'
But 'Dnuos is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did Dan
And came back wrapped in Saran
DOVE:
Positions, muscles flexed
Dove was lost in a Ghana hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Notions soothed the mood
Dove was lost in De La heaven
Screwed Plug Two, did the do
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Jenny teased my homeboy Granny
In fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool
Did her thing while I plugged once
Hope she don't fall fat nine months
From now, I'll tell you what
Trugoy ain't ready
POS:
Warned out was my cater
My new dis was three days later
The door turned blue, you guess who
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Advance to the radio
Teddy persuaded us to turn off the light
Wanted me to rhyme while she
Wrapped me up in a ball of twine
No more, I dispatched
Was it Jimmy had met his match
Or could it be the realisation
All girls owned a Jenny
For normal health I had fought
A valuable lesson she had taught
Don't flaunt that the candy is good
Unless you came with plentyEmbed
Greetings, girl, and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squished
Freeze a frame about moods the same
Which we can continue right behind the bush
You'll stay with me, I know this
And not because of all my earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

I know I'll love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself
As the chosen one for speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
They name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true
I know I'll love you better

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand, we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say when transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing, and in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
I know you'll be close to me 'cause

I know I'll love you better

It's I again and the song that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'til we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we could meet Mr. Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you possess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how
I know I'll love you betterYou might also likeEmbed

Living in everyday is something
Something everyday like this is our livin'
Giving something sheer for the crowd is our major
Major to the crowd is to hear what we're givin'
No time to rest, we got work in the studio
Studio suppliers rest at no time
Showtime is enough when the Soul is performing
Performing is the Soul y'all, and it's showtime
Coping with dates in clubs, can't even lounge
Lounge with the homeboys how we are copin'
Scoping new material for Paul to plug high-pitched
High-pitched what Paul plugs in and still scopin'
Bearer of peaceful views to express peace
Peaceful expressions why we are bearers

Fear so much of what Pos is puttin'
Couldn't do better, the punks they don't try hard
Try hard enough, they don't, so they couldn't
No joke to what I do inside this field
This field to me is filed, there's no joke
So soak up the fact there's no part-time
Part-time rappers at, so soak
Taking in new ideals leads to new groups
New groups to better the Soul, I'm takin'
Wakin' from days and nights to do my best

Just here to do the same with no trick
Grab the Plug Two's live wire, my brother
And find that you've grabbed my pet boa constrict
Ringo's the garbage I'm hearing
Seek for the truth, my brother is tearing
No time to back-step, cause if you back-step
Look what you stepped in, you stepped in mess

Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two

Answering any other service
Prerogative praised positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my utility
After the battle they admit that I'm with it
Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with like
When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'
(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm)
(Mmm-hmm, yeah)

Flowing in file with a new style
Barrels are cleaned and loaded for salute
Chanters with the choice standing steady like my mouth
This paragraph preacher is now introduced
Drums are heard sounding off on each and every person
Vocal confetti is blown at top stage
Roses and violets aren't proper for throwing
When showing appreciation, why? This is a Daisy Age
Hands won't sweat cause there's no threat
Mic will stay dry while pitchin' so loose
Rhymes aren't fables but stable to be on time
Cause they're marketed and labeled sticker 'Posdnuos'
This pitch will fit with every consumer
Microphone loosed in cycles, start blooming
Profit and cost could never be lost

Dazed at the sight of a method
Dive beneath the depth of a never-ending verse
Gasping and swallowing every last letter
Vocalized liquid holds the quench of your thirst
Reasons for the rhythm is for causes unknown
Different individuals are dazzled with the showbiz
Auditions are gathered but the Soul would just rather
Hold a count at three and in the end leave it as it is
Flow to the sway of my do-re-mi
I'll fix lunatics who will hawk
Words are sent to the vents of humans
Then converted to a phrase called talk
Musical notes will send a new motto
Every last poem is recited at noon
Focus is set, let your polaroids click
As they capture the essence of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'

Vocal in doubt is an uplift
And real is the answer that I answer with
Dying yet live, what you must realize
That the tune that I present is surely not a gift
Different in style is definite
And style which I flaunt is sure legit
Now set aside, I say I hold pride
In performing this melodic misfit
So swing cause this pitcher is pitching
In sense JD Dove is now saying
All sing along to his favorite song
While the pocket transistors are playing
But least but not last I'm frightened
For the words that I reply hold doom
Life of the check can be stopped by accident
When you're tripping the wire of the Plug Tune

Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you, woah, oh, yeah

I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want (right)
The loving that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's inviting so visualize the verb

But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that

Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head
Trying to keep my pockets on stuffed, like deer heads

So mind your biz and walk away

My J-O's to stay fearin' of my G-O-D
Whether what may, meet me at the front door
See the pressure got a nigga knockin shit off his desk
'Cause of the stress I stack words make cats bruise they neck tissue
Stay pertinent to the issues
Cut your tag too close, display these verses tight, virtuals
Sort of like we supposed to, pantyhose raps you run
Stay dumb like black folks who boasts C's
Mostly fakin' it, to make it

I play low-key 'til it's time for you to know me
Stir my lime with light, drink it down slowly
Holy shit, now look what I get
A whole string of party people wanna run in my mix
In my world, they wanna fit like melanin in a tit
Jam tight, they ain't my fam, alright? They ain't my people
Them niggas screamin' fam 'til they rank measure equal
Then vote, without leavin' a note, and that was all she wrote
Arranged, produced, my slang's obtuse
But some distort, tellin' stories like Mother-the-Goose
My true fam's is David J back since with Vince Mason
We'll draw on three, leave that body for the tracin'
Ultimate high, like them drugs you be lacin'

Same old tubs, same old tables and same faults
Same crew and the same old train of thought

My guess, you need to head West (Who you foolin')
Thought we'd fall for your phonyness you're (Only foolin')
Yourself, thought you were down, it takes more than a smile
And a couple of pounds to be crew
Man, you bound to get your tail caught (Who you foolin')
Spreadin' yourself thin see you're (Only foolin')

And that sister K.D. Lang been sexin' without a man

Put in work for this game, it's not a game to me

Now we out to furnish properties we own
That's right, so cats might know we ain't home
My throne's threatened by fiends, try to do dirt
Play Tony Randall, have that ass cleaned
Unveiled I see your exhibition, y'all need to cover that
Fatherless styles, y'all really need to mother that
Same expose, different page
But when you see me in it it's the same old Dave

Y'all silly, you're just a civili', I'm a soldier
Troopin in this path 'til the death won us over
So if life is a party begin, to understand

Changin faces on the regular you're (Only foolin')

Like the keys to the ride and a pocket with a knot and it's
Holdin' they ground 'til they rot in it
Plottin' it, lockin' it down strong
'Cause it's nothin' wrong gettin' your bubblin' on sticker
But too much bubblin' can make you fizz quicker
So, watch your stack, keep your fam intact
And pay attention to the now, I'm clearin' the mess
While they stressin' back in the day, I'm at the front of the night
With my crew shinin' light on the—

You can do whatever you want
Whatever you like, it's your own life
So let me be to do what I want
To do what I like, 'cause this is my life
You can do whatever you want
Whatever you like, it's your own life
So let me be to do what I want
To do what I like, 'cause this is my life
Now, we're on top of this, like a typical bed position
Peepin' your view, got your whole crew wishin' and waitin'
Makin' dollars out of ten dime pieces
Who be sippin' out the glass suckin' on the lime pieces included
In my pieces I pen the good livin'
And even when we're stressin' from in the hood livin'
At least we're livin' and there ain't no hell in that
Give me a yell in that, and go—

I wanna see the world ten times over
Dive off cliffs and land on opportunities unthinkable
You sinkin' straight to the bottom while I float in parades
That St. Patty couldn't put up
All my niggas tryin' to build, then throw your wood up
Design life like PNB gears, so stand clear for the blast off
Last off my chest, peace to Dave West
Live your life to the fullest

You can do whatever you want
Whatever you like, it's your own life
So let me be to do what I want
To do what I like, 'cause this is my life
You can do what you want
What you like
Let me be what I want
What I like1Embed
"Turn that shit off man! What's wrong with you man?
You know we got a party man, get the other record!"
(Here we go)
"(Let it go!) Just one more time!"

It's the M-I-K, E oh to the D
I'm comin' exquisite and V.I.P
Tryin' to spread some love like roots on a tree
Stayin true to this vision in the Y2G
Two G's got em scratchin' it like the fleas
And Ad Rock got it locked like a crooked cop
Noooooowww; it's Ad Rock, y'all remember me
The guy ya bit ya style from off the TV
I score Mmmma-Zah-Ayy's all day, my essays are felt worldwide
We like four planets on the mic
Aligned arrays retired all in the days
Game (baby-baby) too blam for these lames
When I was nine, I played with slime
Got rhymes ga-lot, got rhymes ga-limes
I got a million like rhymes leavin' ya stung
I got my own crew called the nasal tongues!
Yo take a few of these b-boys and call me in the mornin' (okay)
Keep it on the crusty eye, bagel with some butterflies
Spit gritty like we in MCA's voice box
Y'all bull and my ox don't fit the mix

Now we'd like, to introduce to you, Ad Rock
Ad Rock in the house you don't stop!
It's the B-E-A-S-T-I-E B-O-Y-S with the most finesse
Don't mean to be crude, don't mean to be crass
But listen Guiliani you can kiss my ass (what?)
You heard my word, now Dove you play the preacher
Get on the mic if you love all the creatures
Well yeah I got these fishes swimmin' round my barracuda
Back in '82 I used to ride a street scooter
Called em cuter than pigtails, sales you keep em level, and
Smack you with a shovel and break your lifestyle (owww!)
Firm on the mic since my days of a child
Got a "License Too Ill" to flash to police
The only beast I huddles with the Beastie Boys
Bringin "Noise" like P.E. to your TV
Ayo this beat's barefoot and knock-kneed
Stripped to the rhyme!
And every line made from scratch
Attached like stripes to shell-toes
Thin spools that hold the herb
Mike what's the word? (WORD!)
It's like the ooh-la-la, ooh-ooh-la-la
Rhymin over old breaks like the Mardis Gras
Party people cross and bump they go ooh and they ahh
And Mike D and Ad Rock down with the De La
(Disc jock!) Get the people dancin' for real
(Disc jock!) Theater (jock!) holdin' mass appeal
(Disc jock!) You can't get enough still
So here's another dose for you to feel!
Put ya body in it!

Come on, squat
Come on, squat
Come on, squat
Come on, squat

I'm feelin' good, damn good, but also confused
This stuff from hip-hop that's bein' misused
It's desirin', acquirin', tryin' to be like Iverson
If it means backstabbin' and also conspirin'
Now, the people in the front, you do the bump bump
The people in the back, they're not the whack whack
The people in the middle, come on and wiggle wiggle
And the people on the side, we can all take a ride!
In my VW I done swung an ep' or two
The rear in my hatchback y'all know I scratched that
Here to haystack, keep it rosy in the Rolls
Skiddin' out to place my vote at the polls for Ad Rock
Well I'm the the toe tapper, yes the hand clapper
From the middle school like the educated rapper
I'm known as an occupational MC
You think I lose sleep if you sleep on me?!
(It's the rock solid, pilot, here to fly (ROCK!)
Reachin elevations too far for the eye (EYE!)
Miraculous beats over breaks in these packages
Seen (all over the globe) and all the types
Who thinks our joints is aight, here's a swab for ya ear
(to clean out ya lobe) and listen to a few views
From two crews spitti' for the art of it
We ain't takin over but damn sure takin part of it)
Started it ever since we minced meat
You Sloppy Joe's went and took a bit of the corn dog
Stay there! I'ma play there ('cause they pay there)
In the big old Santa Claus bag got discs and now we out
Signin' off, signin' off, our work is done
So come on party people
Have (have) have (have) have fun!
"(Let it go!) Just one more time!"Embed
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh yeah

It's a pity that you're so dirty
Worthy of some Southern hoes-pital
See we them Northern boys with knows and hows
NYC livin' ain't nothin' like it
See how me and my peeps fit, we jigsaw
Sometimes I play big saw to cut the deal
And we keepin' them bills paid with meals in the mouths of many
A noble job at Feni
Money ain't everything but everything makes me want it
But won't dishonor my name so the claim throwers
Act like game on the dice on the mic device
Stay above middle class for life
Not an easy task but I've grown to love it
Dub it to tape, why don't you whip a grin
While I speak to my mens about the world problems
And girl problems with no immediate way to solve em'
But I'm on the case

I make the best of the life I been giving
Making the most of the moment among the livin' and it feels good
Closer to being the man that I want to be
Do what I can cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Life, I keep asking
Am I worthy of you, of you
Am I worthy of you

Pull them quarters down
I got some things on these nine ounces to vamp, we on a mission y'all
Dug fresh dirt out the ground
Lookin' for the treasures in life
A bambino picket fence around the residence
I wore these shackels here for thirteen years
But the only real slaves is the ones we record on
We off all checks and God's blessin'
Tryin' to own a thousand island like we salad dressin'
Patience for the main course
Don't have me in position to remain boss
Cause the man next to the man above the exec
Don't give a damn if I papered yet
Sometimes it make me wanna go make a bet
I did away with knock em' and release some stress
By any means, these petty greens will only get me stuck in a box
Doin' a dick shot in Oz, jerkin' off in the J
But anyway I keep my head on

I make the best of the life I been giving
Making the most of the moment among the livin' and it feels good
Closer to being the man that I want to be
Do what I can cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Life, I keep asking
Am I worthy of you, of you
Am I worthy of you
I know people who tippy-toe through they own stompin' ground
Master not makin' a sound to stay safe
From the local star renaissance
And the response is usually the same
Wishin' like it used to be
Nothin' in that life is new to me
We roll like eyes on a ghetto girl
Brushin' off some no-man cause she's his ghetto pearl
We into livin' beyond not livin' fads
Me and my comrads became dads young
Try to have fun amongst responsibility
Like fillin' these accounts full
Got caught up at a party in Bull's
Sometimes gotta have the nerve to say some rhymes
Because some minds take offense
Try to make ya life tense but we still here
Still gainin' the love, still standin' above most

I make the best of the life I been giving
Making the most of the moment among the livin' and it feels good
Closer to being the man that I want to be
Do what I can cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Now I keep asking
Am I worthy of you, of you
Am I worthy of you
I make the best of the life I been giving
Making the most of the moment among the livin' and it feels good
Closer to being the man that I want to be
Do what I can cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Life, I keep asking
Am I worthy of you, of you

Uncle Ricky...and De La...tell y'all a grown up story
Kids - Okay

I remember when Mama spoke of the birds and
The east side kept me off the curb and
Betsy Ross was sufferin from the scaredy cat
Till my man Ricky brought the remedy for that

I massage your mink, coat
Then part your leg's rope
And stroke so hard you'll start to smell smoke

Want friiiies?
Chicken, vegetable, fried rice
And I'm tryin to  you to go
Fast subtraction, grab some
"Oh don't stop nasty black man"

Man that action had me coughin up cars, keys, and cash
Just to sniff a fat rabbit I would give my very last

(When nature calls)
You know them boys will come runnin

This what we do for love (do for love)
This what we do for love (for love)
This what we do for love
You ain't lyin
I 9-5 it, more like 12-12
Can't get the thought off (sex)
From off my mental shelf

I'm like Bruce Lee
Beatin up the cootchie profusely
My tomboy chicks that act a little too butchy
Recieve this (uh)
When my semen ceases
They'll be screamin out, "We love bein the female species"

Hello?
Veronica, it's Dove
Uh, I think you got the wrong number
What?
Veronica, your baby's crying
Yo, chill
Baby?
Whatever yo, later

For the past two summers I been sizin up Veronica
Southern belle, I heard she blow notes like a harmonica
Yarmulkes couldn't satisfy her spendin fetishes
She was all about gettin the head like she was lettuces
Yah, them types be actin like they ain't sleazy

Like this uptown chick playin opposite of easy
Delighted, the honey fly difficult, couldn't knife it
Tiiight
Seen the imprint on honey's private
Now she's love sick
Ruler Rick scoress agaaaaain

Sex present itself like trophies I'm out to win
And it's easier to claim through the fame I've obtained
Her mommy was a liar, she's so ashamed


Well, I got this rude boy Jamaican honey at the rest home
Complete with yellow hair and Cinderella dress on
"What happen"
Been around, stuck her till she poppin bout
"Hey take your blood clot finger off me bottom"
Anyway, another dime I met one time
I'm kiiind, chick in the world, butt fine
And her, structure pumpin, told her
Gotcha mumblin bout
"Slow down, what you tryin to rupture somethin?"

I don't bug out, I chill
Never copped a feel
But these pretty ass girls come and flaunt in the grill
Big ass eyes, with the matchin big ass thighs
Asked her if she spare a moment to exchange some lies
"But you got a girlfriend"

Yah trick, so do you
And I heard there's no preference in what gender ya do

So stop playin so squeaky clean
And let the dirty side see me later
So we can play 'let's wake the neighbours'

So stuck on the love you rearranging behaviors
Second episode, and you returnin oral favors
Buyin up groceries
Searchin for hosiery
Holdin hands publicly
And now you supposed to be
Mr. and Mrs. huh, lovin and kisses huh?
But while you away is when the milkman'll visit her
Dear to the heart, we dearly depart the fallen
So skip the games ma, I stay tuned to the calling

Because I'm headin' eastbound
Tired of the merry go round and around
And everybody's talkin' bout you're so funny
But they still tellin' lies to me
I got the trees in my backyard
And it's hard for them to tell a lie to me
And who's the foot? I'm the foot, but who's steppin'

You know where I'm steppin'
Skirts play wit it cause I'm slick like that
I'm the greatest MC in the world!
You gots to gimme gimme mine 'cause I'm heavy when I weigh it

The avenue like her catwalk
Struck a bit to the gunplay, that housing street
Looks to die for, ask that chalk man for yo' hand
Spend it, you live to show

This is dedicated to all those hardcore acts
Yeah, you know them brothers that we used to look up to that fell the fuck off
And now, they doing all that R&B sh– (crocker!)
You mean Rhythm and Blues?
No! Rap and Bullsh...

Connection A, click, what?
My dick, chick
I smack a fish if you thinks
My connection ain't thick, dick
Headed like a punk whip
I travel miles with a rhythmic limp
I rock an Afro
In '83, gee, yo
And spray the sheen so I get a Soul Glow
I play the corner tough
And me and Mase pull puffs on a blunt

Givin' high-five is what I want
So I puff a blunt, I don't front
I get spliffed, get a stiff
Then I go hump a stunt
Like a pimp pro
(Nah, man, a super ho)
That's cool cause I'm still an Afro, bro
Yeah, I'm live for my life is hectic
Every hour, every minute, every second
I keep a level head and stay down to earth
Cause I've been an Afro since birth

My breath never smells wack
I eat the watermelon Tic-Tac
Before I kiss myself, I always jump back
(Yo, gee, this track is stack)
(And you know that)

I do three flips
When a punk flip on my duke lifts
But I flex more strength when I'm asleep
On the other side with his main tapes
Make her dry her face, buy her gold earlocks
But I may, she flocks round me like a donut
She got sprinkles but I bite my way out
More brothers come about, try to scheme slick
But the Native Tongue's thick
Lick 'em real good, like a real hood should
But the fly tape let the car speakers shake
I ran a cop down, I smile a frown with a but
Show gold teeth, cause I ain't a vegetarian
Not scared of beef, sport a feather like Chief
Got a scribble pad, you can get these gonads
Cause I'm big-willed, won't arf like a seal
Cause connection with the Afro is real
I be the gift of gab, but be a bro with a diss
Because it's tough to bluff a cab
No wonder Melle Mel is 'Rah!'
I play a tape of the son of La-Di-Da
My cousin Rilo sells blow, a G a day
Keeps his kids hooray, a size nine and half
I kicks my tricks, is to live for Island
I mug a mug vic, but I's cool, I self
With the quickness, I talk the true slang
Show no pit to those who don't understand

The Maseo got tailed with the big bail
I busted loose but now the blue goose is on my tail
I seen the ghetto go lower than it is
(He don't care, cause his nigga's selling crack to the kids)
My jeans are brand new, with twelve more
In the closet with my silk, and velour
My 45 pack thick, draw quick
If a nigga starts some shibidibidit
My crib is uptown, downtown, L.I
And another crib in Queens
I munch some cornbread, Boar's Head
My favorite pork chops and
A plate of collard greens
I chill with Shymel, Akeem, Jaheed
And the Rastafarians'll be the crown in
And the Poppa
But the connections are still a high-five

Hey, how are you doin'? Sorry you can't get through

"I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo"

How'd they get my name and number?
Then I stop and think and wonder

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enters the new

Or should I say a flock 'cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves and flaunt a nut that's doggy as a doe
But it's not the mood to hear the tales of limousines and pails of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, "Yo, black, just play me the tape"
But at the show, the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks be so wick-wick-whack, situations like this, I now hate
They give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask, "Was it def?"
And with the straightest face I be like, "Hell yes"
I slip them the digits to papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL, but yet I know when they call, they get

Hey, how you doin'? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you?
Hey, how are you doin'? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you?

Party at the dug-out on Dixon Ave, haven't been to a jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles 'stead piles and piles of demo tapes by the miles
All I wanna do is cut on the deck crowd, but edition up here by the mile to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One moseys in and I be like, "Yo G, Pos does all the producing"

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny, so I make like a bunny, jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
'Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin' fly guy
Try to get my back, they force like Luke Sky'
Me, myself, and I go through this act daily and rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge, some jackal always nails me, no matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like, "Yo, I got a tape to play you back at the hotel"
I be like, "Oh, swell"
Unveil the numeric code that dials my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone, she'll answer the phone
And with the quickness, she'll recite like a poem
"Hey, you done did the right thing, dialed up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing a tune to Tru instead of frontin' on the speak
So no problemo, just play your demo, and at the end, it's break out time
Please, oh, please, don't press rewind 'cause I'll just lay it down the line"

Hey, how you doing? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you?
Hey, how you doing? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and we'll get back to you?
Peace

Yo, what's up, man? This is Ronald Master down with the Fish Tank Posse, man, you know, man
So you know, you can just hook me up, Tru
You know I got this fly new jam called "Swimming In the Fish Tank"
You know we gon' rock it, man, you know what I'm saying
But I just need your help, Prince Paul gave me your number, you know, man, you just gotta do that for me
Got this fly bass line, got these fly trombones in it, man, so just hook me up, man, just look out, alright, man?
Call me back at 557-2223, alright, man?
Just look out, alright? Look out for a brother, man4Embed
Ah! What a beautiful day in the concrete jungle. I think I'll go down to Calliope and just be a fucking dickhead!

Damn, I feel good today. I look forward to going in and just beating the shit out of somebody and taking their money. What a fucking great job I have

I wonder why I feel so good. Could it be the music? Could it be my breakfast? Or could it just be the fact that I just hate everybody. Damn it, it has to be that
Life is grand, life is great. I need myself a real cheap date. Some woman I can take to McDonald's, spend a dollar twenty-five on and have, like, the best time of your life with afterwards. Life is too good to believe sometimes. But we all can't have it the way I do. So to all you suckers out there, kiss off. All right? Bye bye

Stomp you out like roaches, pullin on my coattail
Like some horses pullin coaches, WHOA your roller coasters
It's hotter than the temperature that's cookin in your toasters
While the heat'll put you deep into hypnosis

And it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...
I remember your face, I remember your way

I remember you now
Part of my existence
I remember your face
You came in and got me
All in a day
Yeah, all in a day
I remember your lips
Do you remember the taste?
Remember family names
Your child, my child, our child
Whitley and Dwayne
Different to my world now
Remember the ways
You gripped my hips so tight now?
Slow up the pace
Maybe erase, don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place

How could I forget?
A ballad was born upon a demo of a fly love song
Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it
Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit
The right amount of soul with a parallel amount of grit
But the archer couldn't see the target of departure
Gave in your pink slip and called it quits
It's understood you would
Label me the mate who wronged you
Cause I kept wanting to feature
With them other females on they songs too
Your words spoken in mono for monogamy
Telling me I had to go cause I chose
Stereo for stereo typical male biology
And now I'm left setting traps
For you to fall in for me again
Who hates you to tell me
"Slow up the pace, maybe erase, don't…"

Slow up the pace
Maybe erase, don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...
Our last trip to Vegas had me feeling like we had a chance
But chance just showed up at the wedding
I guess I didn't read the heading
"Forgivin' won't erase the bitter past"
But I ain't up for kissing ass
I bought you everything your pretty feet could fit in
Put you behind the finest steering wheels
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit, you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger

I remember you now (Accountability is major)
A part of what I did then
Remember your face
Just don't let me trip over memory lane
Cause time can't be replaced
And I don't want to stay

Cause, oh, it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's so dah-dah-dee-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah
It's so easy to fall
In dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah
Remember your way

When I
First heard
Criminal Minded
I was in...
Damn, where was I?
Seventh grade
Battlin' this other emcee
Smokin' a blunt and drinkin' a 40 down lower east side with my niggas
I have no idea where I was, it was so long ago
I was on my way to a family reunion in a car on the Long Island Expressway when I heard it
Roosevelt...Projects
I was in...
I was outside of church when I was really little
And I was doing the Wop with this girl
Red Alert played one of the songs on the radio
It was so long ago
Yo Merce, what's up, this is Hanson
Man, I want you to peep that out
Yo, kid... I was at this party
This hype party, when I heard
KRS' Criminal Minded. I'll call you back, peace
All right!

To cover twelve inches of funk

Specializing in cleansing like the hits of Ella Fitz'

Don't even try to toss bleach, I'm too dark and
Major more soul than James' "Escape-Ism"
De La Soul is here to stay like racism
Hatchet know and I'mma put the pillow off the bed
As I lurk up on your thoughts while phones on your head
Riff a tech pro, flex sue, running you the links
Scout weather, pouring rain outta duck's survive links
And if one winks for pink slips, the slips are short
Dull-minded as sperm, to give out for the souls I report
I sport too fly for the forty-ounce drinker
I sport too fly for a forty-ounce thinker
A fresh linen scent so sniffer on the two-inch
A talker of the verb without weed influence
So stick to your Naughty by Natures and your Kane
'Cause graffiti that I based upon the wax is insane

Grand groove, I wish I had the flavor bid
Give me six bottles of beer, I take the seventh one free
I got the chandelier, kick, constructed by my man
Little elf, big four gets the zootie for the self
Long island living, what, twelve o'clock dawn
Jiggy-not see me so I trip straight to your porches
Mr. Partymaker puts the boogers in your bottle
Straw it and drink, what, bees gotta be's
'Cause I snort the crazy-crazies
Man, I kick the franken-style, dig the bolts in my neck
Wreck, ship, boat, rock
Heavy metal grooves ain't the infinite
Here I hips to the hops
I'm looking for the words in the faces of a prince
That brother been down ever since soaked cheese
And motor go smiling
Hey, how ya doin'
Now, meet in front of Big Lou's fighting
Hey, y'all reminisce, six streets, little miles
Straight to my avenue
(aaaah... aaaggh)
Six streets, went miles straight to my avenue
I'm headed for the bigger E, for the bitter OE, not me
Here's my Malibu, child, here's my Malibu
Buckshot honeys, dig a gun and go aaaahhhhh...2Embed

Bitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck
If I ain't gettin proper respect
I don't care if you rap, I still spit in your grill
I don't give a fuck, never have, never will
If it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin to die
I ain't tryin to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky
Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time
My niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes
Hundred or more, in front of the store, waitin to bubble
Brand new nine, and an eight in a bubble
I put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set
Niggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh)
Cause the P gonna squeeze 'til no slugs is left (what)
You know I'm good with a hundred of 'dro, gun and an O
You think your shit butter? Hop in front of this toast

Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool
And I hate cops, cause most y'all was dicks in school
No pussy gettin niggas tryin to cuff the God
Play Sheek out in the yard, but that shit too hard
My dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong
What y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song
Check my car, I don't care, I don't play fair
Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew
Why I don't yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin to you
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye?
I'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die
From rappin or tellin some cat to reach for the sky
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga

Streets help niggas; niggas don't help the streets
Y'all use beats for help; we help the beats
Who want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P?
If I say so myself, it's a wonderful three
Be in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox

Me the Security? Protectin my body? I let my shotty guard
Put chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol
Make niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got em noddin off
And take casket naps, fuck that
You shoulda never let this bastard rap
All I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel
No parents, tell from my horror's no morals
Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance
So you dyin? It's no problem, no lyin
Drag's fire; so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em
Drag done ate your food
Like I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up
Drag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up
Drag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well

I come to you hungry and tired, you give me food and let me sleep
I come to you weak, you give me strength, and that's deep
You call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
Only askin' that I keep the focus in between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect, but you'd like me to try
Unlike the Devil, who just wants me to lie 'til I die
Lord, why is it that I go through so much pain?
All I saw was black, all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's you who knows
You showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that, when you asked for this story
I put it together, to do our dogs some good
Our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way, but I hid
And I remember once, you held me close, but I slid
There was somethin' that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I could be what you wanted me to be
And I think I've seen it, 'cause I don't feel the same
Matter of fact, I know I've seen it, I can feel the change
And it's strange, almost got me beatin' down your door
But I've never known love like this before
It's a wonderful feelin' to get away from the pain
And up under the ceilin', I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real, so I wipe away the tear, it's on
And I almost lost faith when you took my man
Monty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan
And I fear that what I'm sayin' won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good, 'cause I really didn't expect to live long
So, if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die, but, please, Lord, treat him rightYou might also like17Embed

I thought more money would solve 'em

Than Frank Lucas did before the boys got 'em
Now the shit done changed
How I'm feelin'? the shit look strange
I realize that shit ain't the same
'Cause at the end of the day this shit ain't a game

Ran to the hood, took a trip to Hell
Deal when I should, that's why all my shit sell
Always know I could, so I did well

Take it back to hood shit bulletproof and biscuits
Chips all for hustle and grams go from bricks
And whips for templates, we switch while we movin all of this weight
'til we screamin all of us hate

Nothin ever change cause we still in the field
Niggas try to front but the game's too real
We don't give a fuck bout the way you feel

 (verse 1)
Girls are my profession and obsession, I place nothing above them
To me they're not possessions I really truly love them
Short ones, tall ones, big ones, small ones
Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall ones
Yo, I love them all, especially the cuties
The ones with the smooth complexion and shapely booties
With the type of bodies that'll make you say "Oh Boy" ya
But baby if you're ugly, I ain't got nothing for ya
I'm not conceited, I'm convinced that I've been naturally blessed
To be desired when naked and irresistible when dressed
And with that, brings that, breaks down resistance
Of me to a cutie, I bag them for instance
I seen a cutie with a bootie, wiggling just like Jell-O
Me being a player, I approached and said "Hello"
But she didn't hear me, so I tapped her softly
She turned around screaming on me "Back up off me"
I said damn, there is no need for hostility
I'm a mellow type of fellow but still with tranquility
She said "I recognize that all of y'all are the same
After only one thing, and I'm not simp for the game"
I said "Come on now sweetheart, do I look like a Player"
She said "Of course not...sike"
But for the sake of argument let me know the deal
I want to ask you
You might also like(DMX singing)
Are you for real?
Are you really for real
Is this love I feel
The way you make me feel
 (Verse 2)
I'm as real as it gets
My name is not James Brown, but I could leave you in a "Cold Sweat"
And I bet, no ifs, ands or maybes
When I finish I'm a have you saying "Do Me Baby"
She said "Alright, I'ma give you a try"
Because she said "I think you're kind of fly and my type of guy"
She said her name is Crystal and kept a pistol on her
And she said if I ever cheated, believe I'd be a goner
So I played the perfect gentleman every time I was with her
And when I wasn't with her I was gone to get her
And when I wasn't going to get her, she was come to get me
And when she wasn't coming to get me, she was with me
So for awhile, everything was smooth
I waited and contemplated my next move
My instincts told me that the time was right
For us to get together for a magical night
So I called her, I said "Hello" she said "Hey, hold on
I already know what you have to say"
(DMX singing as if he was Crystal)
Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
Because I'm not too sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
For I don't know how I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I
 (Verse 3)
Hold on sweetheart, just chill, relax
You're telling me the answer and I didn't even ask
Don't you think, that we should be alone?
This isn't the type of thing to talk about over the phone
(DMX singing)
Why don't you come over and go with me
Come on over to my place
Where we can talk about it face to face, why don't ya
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
So we can discuss the terms of picking up the pace
She said "I thought about it, and I think that you're right
But my parents are home so it won't be tonight
But umm why don't you come over tomorrow at 8
My parents leave at 7:30 and won't be back until late"
I said bet, let me go and get set
Tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget
So the next day around 7:54
I fixed up like 6 times and then headed for the door
And when I stepped outside, I was asked where I was going
By detectives with .9 millimeters that was showing
I said "To me girls house", they said "No you aren't"
I said "Why not" they said "Because you a have warrant"
I said "That's impossible, how could that be?"
That said "It's right here, robbery, first degree"
Well, anyway, to make a long story short
I ended up in Valhalla going to court
So I called Crystal that night around 8
I said it's just a mix up and blamed it on fate
She told me that she loved me, I promise to wait
She said I'll see you at 4, at your next court date
Despite being locked up, things weren't bad
I still had my girl and for that I was glad
She always came to visit, didn't mind the hike
And every night I wrote her letters telling her things like
(DMX singing)
I can't fool myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say "I love you"
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop

 (Verse 4)
Days turn into weeks, weeks into months
Today's the 25th and I've only got mail..once
What has happened to my love life?
Oh do I feel like I've been stabbed into the back with a knife
I tried to believe, I said "She loves me, she does"
But deep down, I knew what the scoop really was
See Jody has my girl, and now she was gone
Just thinking about it had me singing every love song
I'm saying to myself, how could she do me wrong?
I said it's not her fault, I was away for too long
I thought I had a girlfriend, but now I know better
She told me that she wrote me but I never got the letter
And every time I tried to call her, nobody was home
And since I had to call collect she put a block on the phone
She told me she would visit, but damn I haven't seen her
You wanna know why, because Jody is in between her
Legs and getting busy, he even ate the coochie
Yo, I bought her everything from Fendi to Gucci
But Jody had something better, he didn't even have to sweat her
And if he doesn't have her by now, he's gonna get her
(DMX singing)
Caught in the middle I don't know what to do
What can you do when your girl is untrue
There's another man (another man)
In my life (in my life)
Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)
 (Verse 5)
Beating my time, another man...was lovin mine
I was upset, but there was other things on my mind
I would start trial soon, I was facing a lot of time
And on the day of trial, I was never for awhile
But when they said "Not guilty"
I stepped with a smile
Back to freedom, freedom on the streets again
But I had to go and see what was up with my friend
So I called her, just to make sure she was home
I said "Hello" and a man's voice answered the phone
I was confused, at first I didn't know what to do
He said "It's Jody, and what is it to you?"
So I hung up the receiver, picked up my gun and
Straight for Crystal's crib, I started running
Murder, murder, my finger's on the trigger
Murder, murder, I'm a murder this nigga
But then I thought, why should I do him
He wouldn't have the pussy if she didn't give it to him
I thought about killing him, I thought about it twice and
Nah, because it wouldn't be nice
But for the sake of curiosity I had to go and see Crystal
And I asked, why did it have to be me
I knocked on the door and just like before and
I heard another man's voice play me and couldn't take it anymore
The door opened up and Jody walked my vexed
He looked me up and down and said "I guess you're X"
Now here comes Crystal, yelling and fussing
Hollering and screaming, shouting and cussing
She looked at me inside and got quite in the hall
She said "When did you get home, and why didn't you call"
I turned around to leave, she said "Please don't go"
I said "You used to be my girl but you ain't nothing but a Ho
I understand because I'm a man, but there's no way I could stay"
(DMX singing)

And fly away...(away)

Uh, uh
Boom, boom, boom, open the door, atf
To late to send my girl downstairs to say he left
To the basement, go through the replacement door
Come up in my neighbor's yard, wit' a taste for war
You know I laced the four, wit' the hallows
Crack the safe, got the bottles
Whatchu want me to do?
Beep carlos!
Two houses over by the tall black fence
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this
There go a priest, yo, get in, you drive
What the f**k you doin nigga?
Tryin to stay alive
Cops on every corner, I lay back and try to cruise by
Who the f**k could'a snitched? must'a been a new guy
Damn, in back on our ass
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast
Tryin' to pull up on the side, but I'm packin' to blast
Tryin' to take the niggas heads off, f**k crackin' the glass
Hey, look out, (bark), damn
Came so close, you almost hit that bitch
Like you said nigga, almost
Shit, the cops hit her, and I know they ain't gon' leave her
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather
(breathing sounds)
Drop it on the floor, boom
Got it through the door, peddle to the floor, an office line
Death is in the air, and I don't know if it's mine
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is
And all I can think of is what about my kids
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more clips
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
Run through the fire, pull a gun from my boot out
Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear
I'm goin' out fast and the last thing I hear is
Boom, boom, boom, open the door, atfYou might also likeEmbed

Layin niggas out in fightin' pits and fuckin' hoodrats
Where's my fuckin' hood at?
I flip on niggas like snitches
Rip on niggas like bitches
Then pour niggas in ditches
They ain't found half the bodies that a nigga caught
Or should I say a nigga bought
Cause ain't nothing like getting' paid for, a nigga sport
Killed for what a nigga thought
But that's just how shit be
I know that one day they gon' try that shit wit me
But just as long as I'm on top of shit
I ain't stoppin shit
And ain't a motherfucker droppin' shit
Sat shorty down and told him how much his peeps missed him
Boom, one shot through his respiratory system
Kissed him good night, put him to bed
Put four mo to the head, so he know he understood what I said
Red was all over the place, it didn't look good
But I did what a crook would, searched the crib and took goods
And every night it's the stress
That makes me put another nigga to rest

In the name of Jesus, let us pray
Father, please walk with us through the bad times, as well as the good
May we be heard and understood, from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get our breakthrough, however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls and lay our fears to rest
For there's no way we could live for Jesus, when we're living in the flesh
So I pray that you will allow our spirits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, chapter two, versе fifteen
"Do not love the world or anything in the world," and wе know what that means
But listen
We know that distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin'
But that doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord, you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men to respect their ladies
But lately, so many of us have gone astray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please, bring us back home
And instill in us the Word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to
Yet, we receive so little
Because this time in our spiritual warfare
We're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the anointing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise, our prayers sincere
Our heads to the sky, you will diminish our fears
In Jesus' mighty name, we are brave, amenYou might also like3Embed

You pray a predator choose, I fared better than many
Y'all fear some career gun-slangin' youngsters
Coulda went to war, probably wouldn't have overcome it
I coulda been still bitter now, 'cause there's no middle ground
Locked up juveniles make grown men doubt
Made me wanna get myself knocked in jail just to get you inside
Can't even wait 'til you get out to air you out
As a teen, it's just a few things I cared about

You look in my eyes, you see my throne
As many times I tried to talk to you, explain to you
See it didn't mean a thing to you
Love you, but right now I wanna bite you
I wanna give you a hug, but I might bite you
Be a man about it, we can admit when we're wrong
Come on, get off that kid shit you on
If you'd have paid attention, you'd have saw it coming
But you a man lookin' through the eyes of a woman
Always gon' love your mama (Always), we just drifted apart
And my kids, y'all my heart
And you got more brothers and sisters
Because I got more kids, and hey, it's just what it is
You the oldest, I known you longer, but I don't love them less
Had to get that off my chest
And I don't know what you thought about my use of drugs
But it taught you enough to not use them drugs
When you were a kid, you play with toys, okay
But you a man, put them toys away
What I'm saying is stop thinkin' like a child
'Cause what if it's when I'm gone (Damn)
That you gotta realize you're wrong? (Damn)

The homie just like the Coby, scratching with no riff
And you’ll find out how I’m living cause I’m gift is mad swift
Using lips or clips leaving motherfuckers stiff
Move so many key (kis) my first name is Lock, last is Smith
If a nigga ever gets up the nerve to really want to be the herb
With the stick, he gets kicked to the curb
From the dark like a blackout, here to act out
Bring a full pack out, and blow your motherfuckin back out
Shouldn’t have put the contract out, on yourself
Or be an ass nigga, just like the last nigga
So take this blast nigga, to where you know you going
Which will probably be hell, see you there, still flowing
The game don’t stop, it goes on and on
Some shit I done might not been right, but I ain’t never been wrong
I’m too strong, and you couldn’t pay a sucker to win
Or against this black motherfucker again
Yo, this sin is what I thrive on and live by
Don’t have my ends and you force me to relive my
Other life, as an uncontrollable savage
Killing niggas over a little cabbage, because I just can’t have it
Reach out and grab it, and I rip your arm off
At the shoulder and beat your head with it cause I’m colder than the Arctic
So I write nothing but frozen rhymes
Only eat frozen foods, but I can cook frozen minds
Run it to bear the mark of the beast, I be the spark of the East
That shit you talk, in the dark it’ll cease
Slide out like grease, cause I’m slick like that
What’s up with your man, sucking my dick like that?
Riding rough is how we do things, it’s a crew thing
And swinging on my nuts cause more than likely cause yes they do hang
Banged ya up so bad you couldn’t get help from Maaco
Stuck into my grave like Dave out in Waco
So take yo, nondescript ass, bitch ass
To back where you came from, quick fast, or get trashed
Like the garbage, cause that’s just what yo style is
And I see y’all niggas really don’t know what wild is
Have you ever been through a fifth story window
Or shook my a jet black pit with some brindle
Got shot at, or got shot, nine slugs is hot
Go through that, and then you might be on my level…NOT
Yo give money some room, not, fuck it you heard my peeps
And they don’t usually say much, cause they just creep
So you know that your ass is ghost with your rep
So the thing is how you leaving, through the window or the stepsYou might also likeEmbed

Compton was the American dream. Sunny California with a palm tree in the front yard, the camper, the boat. Temptingly close to the Los Angeles ghetto in the 50's and 60's, it became "The Black American Dream." Open housing paved the way as middle-class blacks flooded into the city. Whites don't buy houses in Compton anymore. Now with 74% of the population, black power is the fact of life. From banks to bowling alleys. But the dream that many blacks thought they were buying has turned sour. Though the mayor and four out of five city councilmen are black, they have been unable to solve the problems of crime and growing welfare which is slowing turning suburban Compton into an extension of the black inner city. Crime is now as high as the ghetto. 47 homicides last year gave Compton one of the highest per capita rates in the country. Juvenile gang activity, muggings, small robberies make some blacks want to leaveYou might also like16Embed

But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would've cared more
That's my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know

You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out

I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in

What these bitches want from a nigga?

On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you get at me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?

Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit91Embed
It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, "No speak-a la ingles"
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives?
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note

What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground (If I had a million...)
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
In disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny, money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbin'-*** snakes with friendly grins

Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends

I'd make the world suck my **** without a condom on while I'm on the john (I would set my troubles free)
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough 'cause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks (If I had a million dollars)
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough *** for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bull**** (If I had a million dollars)
Tellin' me to be positive, how am I 'posed to be positive
When I don't see **** positive? You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about **** around me, **** I see
(If I had a million dollars) You know what I'm sayin'? Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city
(You could share my wealth with me) Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though
(If I had a million dollars) you know what I'm sayin'? I'm just fed up
That's my word (I could set my troubles free
If I had a million dollars)1Embed
Woah, uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping 'em and, like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er…

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
"Hi, Marshall!"
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
'Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an afghan
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck

'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

Somebody let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shooting up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck

Meet Eddie, 23 years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going (I'm going fucking insane), he decides to rob a liquor store (I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more, homes). But on his way in he has a sudden change of heart (Shit is mine), and suddenly (I gotta do this) his conscience comes into play (I gotta do this).

Alright, stop (Uh?), now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence
(Who are you?) I'm your mo{therfuckin'} conscience!
That's nonsense! Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs (Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Bump that, do that {shit}! Hit that lick!
Can you afford to blow this hit, are you that rich?
Why'd you care if you scare her to death? Are you that chick?
Do you really think she gives {a fuck} if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)
Not over this lick (Stop!), drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow all these voices
These voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow all these

Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play.

Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her? She's passed out
It's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how
Then pick this chicken up, get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch in her mom and dad's house
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest (Doobiest)
D'you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Bump that, drop her off, ring the door bell then bail

These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow all these voices
These voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow

Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man.
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Start breathin', man? You just caught your wife cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off
Forget gettin' divorced, cut this chicken's head off!
Wait, what if there's a good explanation for this?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his {dick}?
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna grab her?
Kick her out the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you, you little m{otherfucker}!) Huh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
{Aw, fuck it,} what am I sayin'?
{Do 'em both, Grady! Where's your gun at?}Embed

Hi, kids! Do you like Primus? (Yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Oh?)
Try 'cid and get messed up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve, I felt like a caged elf
Who stayed to himself in one space, chasing his tail
Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off
Kissed 'em and said, "I ain't know silicone was supposed to be this soft!"
I'm 'bout to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass
Faster than the fat man who sat down too fast
Come here, lady! "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!"
I don't give a damn, Dre sent me to tick the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Damn)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler, and told him to change the grade on the paper (Now)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Served the bartender, then walked out with the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more **** than I do (What?)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing **** and name it after her (Here, mom)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ****"
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of Kool-Aid, dare me to drive? (Go ahead!)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll **** anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and tap myself in the head
'Till I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Ask him if he bought a porno mag to see my ad

Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile—let's go!
(Marshall! Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)

You're 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, "Holy bat syllables!"
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rapping and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to busting a sweat
People stepping over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, for sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothing but clowns down here
But we ain't fucking around round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business

So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away
Until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone!
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh3Embed
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round  the outside, 'round the outside
Two  trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside‚ 'round the outside

Shady's  back‚ tell a friend
Guess  who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess  who's back‚ guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady‚ I'm chopped liver
Well,  if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the Winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, "Attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking "this shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
20,000,000 other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

I got a friend of mine, named 50 Cent I signed
This shit's official now, the deal is finished and it's time
To get down to this business, let's go get these nicks and dimes
So hurry up and cop G-Unit shit before it's gone
Its like a goldmine for my man to take nine
And bounce right back, gotta be like Michael Myers
This shit must be a sign, these labels must be blind
Columbia, I know this must be fucking with they mind
They know they 'bout to cry cause they missed out, but I
Know how to get the dough cause Dre gave me a business mind
I said in my line, I hit 'em with the nine
I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber (Ha!)

I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start frontin'
I just call Banks up when I need to pop somethin'

Without no closure, so before I leave
Yeah, I just want to take the time out to basically say
Rest In Peace to Deshaun Holton, that's my heart man
Dr. Dre, for giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me; to get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine, Interscope, Aftermath
Everybody in the whole Shady staff
Everybody who’s basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenberg, Tracy McNew
You know I love you guy, I couldn't do it all without you
D12, Ca$his
You're gonna be a beast when you get out there man
Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me

There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just "How far will this go?"
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t, can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

Holy Toledo, it’s Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me "Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I’ll deep throat,"
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we’re gonna see, bro
Who was a fantasy, I don’t mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or Paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
'Cause I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I’m off my fucking meds, but I’m on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Krueger
They can’t even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I’m gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cause...

I guess for him to stop is impossible
He just picked up another prostitute in the parking lot of the hospital
And beat her over the head mercilessly and left her for dead
He thought she was, 'cause otherwise he would never have left
Miraculously, she survived the attack
Even after his accuracy after he hacked the pussy with an axe
What are the odds that she'd be back?
He grabbed his encyclopedia off of the top of his fucking CD rack
Hit her with that then he threw her into the TV, ah!
I'm not playing, Rihanna, where'd you get the VD at?
Motherfuck the media! I'm reading ya something strictly from me to ya
Straight off the paper and this one's a freebie Jack
Let me add my two cents, of course I side with Chris Brown
I'd beat a bitch down too if she gave my dick an itch, now
It's just ridiculous how much this kind of sit-ow-
Ation can make her stink, how much gangster shit can he dish out?

Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotized and I forgot ya
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael'd like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I’m as cold as a motherfucking icicle, I'm a nut
I ain't nuttin’ nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut

I guess this is the most dramatic I’ve been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers

This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
(He can’t say whore!) Of course he can, man he just saw her fanny
Then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties

This is music to be murdered by

Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically

And bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!

I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'mma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin

Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of adderall and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological

I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball

Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single

I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's thе curse of the—, it's the cursе of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album song I was spazzing the fuck out on
And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still poking my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fucking tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drownEmbed
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze
One little taste, it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)

I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But what if nobody shows? Panic mode
'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
The press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note, just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

What's going on?

What's happening, it's been so long, what's going on
And what's going wrong? The good old days are gone
You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man
You invented a scam even you don't understand
You rig the enigma, can't figure it out
You change the route, now you're in doubt
You use to cut class, smoked grass, still passed
Figured you was all that but that ain't last
The times is harder, the drugs is heavier
You say whatever, the more, the merrier
Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes
Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes
No more good times, no more time
Too far to find, you're almost blind
You can't see what spot that the trap is in
(Hey bruh!) What's happening!
You had it mapped out, your plans get torn
You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone
You said you quit, stated your word is bond
(Hey bro) what's going on?

My neighborhood don't look so good
I'll find a way out, yeah, I would if I could
But the government is doing a project
So I live in the projects
Where we fight for elbow room to the doom
Try to live long but you die too soon
I might not be alive to see 25
Taught at ten to make money and strive
I sold tapes at school and made some ends
Met alot of skins and even made some friends
Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run with
Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun with
But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test
But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress
And then shake hands like a man
'Cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand
But you had a one on one fight with drugs
When we ain't cool no more, we bust slugs
Clip after clip, until one of us is gone
(Hey bruh) what's going on?


The crime rate in New York State elevate
A city filled with hate, more deaths accumulate
Drug wars daily, a lot of blood spilled
Kids on the playground shot down and killed
Nobody wants to live on the first floor no more
'Cause stray bullets explore
We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely
And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be
Rubbed out in a quest for clout
The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out
Half of the projects is dead or locked up
Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up
Human abortion create distortions
And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when
Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born
(Hey bruh) What's going on?

Sip the juice, I got enough to go around
And the thought takes place Uptown
I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk
And then taught to hawk New York
I go to Queens for queens, then get the crew from Brooklyn
Make money in Manhattan and never been tooken
Go Uptown in The Bronx to Boogie Down
Get Strong on the Island, recoup and lay around
Time to build my juice back up
Props stack up, suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Shakin' 'em up, wakin' 'em up
Breakin' 'em up, rakin' 'em up
Standin' on shaky ground too close to the edge
Let's see if I Know the Ledge

Corner's triflin' 'cause shorty's here
I get cock-D liftin' forties of beer
Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
If I get revenge, then they rest in peace
Somebody gotta suffer, I just might spare one
And give a brother a fair one
Stay alert and on P's, and I do work with these like Hercules
Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw
'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall
Smooth, but I move like an army
Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
Puttin' brothers to rest like Eliot Ness
'Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't the place for innocent bystanders to stand
Nothing's gonna stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino, kill like De Niro
Black Gambino, die like a hero
Livin' on shaky grounds, too close to the edge
Let's see if I Know the Ledge

No remorse when a life is lost
I paid my dues, paid the cost
And my pockets are still fat
Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat
Even if my crew is steep, I'm one deep
I attract attention, people like to peep
So come say hi to the bad guy
Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die
'Cause I get loose and I got troops, and crazy juice
In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini
Hang out with Smith and Wess', don't try to play me
I'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat
But no warnin' shot, my gun is warm a lot
When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear
Areas in fear 'cause this here's severe
Livin' life too close to the edge
Hopin' that I Know the Ledge

A brand new morn', no time to yawn
Shower's on, power's on
Late for school, I catch the train
Girls sip the style and whisper my name
I push up like an exercise
Check they intellect and inspect the thighs
Select the best one, pull her to the side
Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
Read her my résumé, she know already? Cool
Just meet me after school
We can moan and groan until your moms come home
And you'll be callin' me Al "Dope" Capone
Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose
Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice
'Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety
'Cause a lot of niggas hate me

Sprayed with automatics, they wet me up
In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge

By the time you start getting money, my money gon' be more

You couldn't walk and step in my shoes, I'm solid as Gold
Back in the bowl, shit on you no , piss on you no 
Rip off your pockets, I'm gutter, go back in your asshole
The bigger the pot get, the drama it come with the money
The trips, the fame, the luxury whips
You talking that rich talk, I cooked up with a pitchfork
Lord forgive me for my sins these niggas need chalk
Your career already dead before you get on
Study my mixtapes, write about my fancy wardrobe
I embrace niggas, I made you a killa
Dope boy superior, Bloody green interior
As the plot thickens you niggas get more serious
Where your comfort come from
Your mom your dad your homies
They lied to ya you barely survivin'
Championship too you ain't coming back alive
The day I stop using Autotune thats when its gone die
Until then I create melodies thats influenced by promethazine
I was chasing bricks before I chased the dream
Plotting on a scheme
I smell the fake I smell the phony I smell the thieves

No mercy is facing two life sentences, plus forty
Which is psychological breakdown to the base
And causes a slow death or suffocation, and to steal your faith
No mercy is the systematical system programmed agenda at all costs
By any means necessary to kill, steal, and destroy you

Cause I'm honest, I didn't, when you, they put you on the MTV -uh, what was it-, the top 10 best rappers, I don't know what the number was, I was like 'why is Future on that list?'
Is that, is that, I might've mistaken, I might've read it wrong. I might've seen a one before the five. Is that a fifteen-carat diamond ring?

In his mouth he had like thirty plus karats
Big ratchets, smoke cigars like a Bogart classic
Told niggas if he die, he want a glass casket
Parents died when he was five years old
Made his way inside the US with Colombian Gold
A fake name in the passport
Benetton luggage, one sister, pretty thing, light skin
Niggas'll body over her like fuck it
With a scar by her left eye
Her brother Alex was extremely close, he sold coats and minks
Had trays put in toilets and sinks
Loved to roller skate, '99 did time up in Rahway
Came home blown, the thorough kings and soldiers
Never gave a fuck about that MC beef in Queens
Alex, he was a rich nigga
He had close to ten bodies under his belt
His man did the last one and got murdered himself
Took him a while to get his head together
Alex, one day, out in LA
Made a call in New York
Told his man Oc, "God it's goin' down, fly the whole team in for support"
Remember that Ray shit that Jamie Foxx played? That was my shit
I never got paid, they got rich off a stolen script
In '98 I seen Charles on the Cali strip
Showed him the copyrights, his life in the real flick
In braille, he read it in no time
Hit me with his math, said I'll give you some more lines
Real talk, stand up dude
Said, "How you like Jamie Foxx to replay you?"
He said "Yeah, that's cool, but
Under one circumstance
You think he can borrow my walk, flip my talk and my hands?"
I said "Sure, why not? He can imitate anything
Trust me, this young boy hot"
Shook his hand then I bounced in the limo
Grabbed my cell, bit my cigar, then rolled down the window
Contact Stony Brook and Roberts
Told them we got an intent letter, yo, Ray-Ray signed it
Now we can move on and shoot this live shit
With mad options, Paramount and DreamWorks, we shop it

I go and get ten mil' and blow it on the independent market
But anyway, down in P.F. Changs
I had a meeting with this rich investor
Said he'll throw twenty million on the kid's film only if he chose the cast

I got a ill Gotti Gigante connect
Wise guys that kill Bulotti, catching bodies, earnin' respect
The waiter came in a dropped off the shrimp fried rice he ordered
I said thanks as he poured my water
Then out came the veggie rolls, sesame chicken and mint tea
Rice wine had me wanting to pee
Said, "Excuse me I'll be right back, pardon me"

But we can play this right, if we shuffle the cards
I've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke
I run and help you with your bags upstairs
I was scoping you out, today you was late, to leave by 8
With no time to be at work at 9
She'll be back by 6, son pissed you off, I know
When I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit
But still, you was looking mad cute to me
With your lips poked out, being rude to me
You're still sexy, luscious, and all them words
Only girl in the building with a full length fur
Had no choice to raise and press up, explain how I feel
It's only your love I want the best of

I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

I had a dream, yo, I seen you on the laundry mat
Folding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet
So you passed me a Bounce, one fell when I bend down
And got up, you start tonguing me down
Butterflies ran across my stomach
Didn't wanna put the fire out, cuz God damn, I love it
Moved the basket out the way, cleared the table
Laid you down, my mouth slid past your navel
Your feet, had knocked over the Clorox bleach
Held my head closer to you when my tongue got deep
I'm saying we both of those, this how I feel
If you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal
But ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes
Somewhere inside, I know you feel the same
It's alright though, you look like, you know how to get it
Here take my keys, come upstairs in a minute
All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

Let's stop faking, let's just go get naked
No more discussion, we can get to kiss and hugging
My premonition, told me I got what you're missing
So let's stop playing, baby girl, that's all I'm saying

All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

So I mean after over 25 years in the game
Man you got over a dozen albums
I mean what do you feel like, or how do you feel like
The game has changed from '93 'til now in your life

Man the game changed 'cause it's a new wave
It's a new wave for children that's up in the game
You know music is different
Radio is different
You know it ain't the same
Like if we would have come out with C.R.E.A.M. right now we never would have gotten played
Because all this would have blocked it
You know I mean even though it would have been dope
But it's like, there's so much other stuff that's out
There's like millions of rappers now
You know what I mean, back then we had to fight for our spot
We had to rhyme for it, you know what I mean
Like now you just go on the computer
And you can do anything and you gonna get views
You know what I mean, even if it's super whack
You might get like 5 million views off of super whack
Just something you doing stupid
You know what I mean so that's the difference
Back then it was like yo this is footwork
You know what I mean you gotta move the albumYou might also likeEmbed

DJ Spinz Fuck Nigga
Dun Deal on the Track

My main bitch, her anklet
‘Bout the same size of a ankle monitor
If the bitch violate one time I'ma put her ass on probation
I'ma give her two scratches
She's a fuckin' good woman, I'mma give her a life
I'ma walk by shinin' with a bitch
Aye, say I had enough in my life
I got eighty chains, I got a hundred rings
And a nigga can’t take my ice
Caught a murder charge, but I beat the shit
‘Cause a nigga tried to take my life
I’m a millionaire, but I’m a country boy
And my right hand man got a Tonka toy
I sell, charge, I’m servin’ boy
Major saver, I’m the golden boy
Intercept the pack like Lawyer Milloy
Poppin’ and poppin’ and poppin’ the shit
Talkin’ that shit, now you shot in the head
Brick Squad niggas don’t shoot in the leg
Shouts to our fallen, I ball till I fall, and
The neighbors don’t talk ‘cause the neighbors are scared
A white girl, a black girl, a hell of a mix
Rollin’ up kush while they suckin’ my dick
On my team, it’s a tag-team
All my niggas get money
If you get tired, then tag in, then me and your freak’ll start fuckin'
Got two choppers, it’s a tag team
Four bad bitches and it’s all to me
Had to break into like ten houses to ride on these 9x17s
Oops, my fault, that’s your team’s line
I ain’t have time, I was grindin’ real hard
People goin’ crazy, and my mama goin’ crazy but belive it or not, bitch, I gotta thank the Lord
Ballin’ so hard when I came out of jail
Now I'mma get a scene now when the doors up
Sippin’ on lean ‘til I throw up
What you want to be when you grow up?

I used to trap on the corner but that was decades ago
I was high as a cloud, and that was seconds ago
I had the game in the lock, a couple records ago
And I ain't never trust nobody, I was checkin the door
And if you spend a lil' bit mo', then your necklace a glow
He see me textin her phone, and now he chokin a ho
But he keep talkin bout a gangster he provokin a ho
I gave my dentist a 50 just for my trophies to show
I look like Pablo Escobar the way I'm holdin the dro
I feel like Boston George, I got so many bales from the plug
I got a suite apartment wit an apartment under the rug
And every drank in my 'frigerator filled up with mud

I don't know bout nobody else, but I'm servin
And as long as these bags come in, I'm gone serve em
Niggas say they ain't getting money but I'm workin
I'm riding with so much dope that I'm nervous
If the police try to pull up on me, I'm gone swerve em
You ain't never seen so many guns on one person
Dump truck, two trucks came on one Thursday
You need to switch up the shit you doing just ain't workin

They got me feeling Nino couple mill in the safe
But when he snitched at the end it was a slap in the face
I need a bitch like Keyshia, shoot you middle of the day
And Pookie smoked, why the fuck G Money put some trust in a J
$30,000 worth narcotics, wrapped in some tape
I spend $130,000 dollar's just on my drapes
I got a coke model, super-model feedin' me grapes
And you can keep the money nigga, cause you paid me too late
And you ain't comin with me nigga, you tryna ride in the way
You just a spy, telling lies, tryna look at our place

The difference between a pimp and a street nigga dog

Hop right off the stage then i'm back to making plays
I'm just living like a mother fucking villain kicking pimping
All these bitches fucking with it cause they know the mob winning
I'm just saying what i'm saying and I ain't playing
She looking at ma pants I got the mofucking best
I keep up off this weed I can't see you through these ray-bans

And I know i'm doing wrong every night

Cat in the bowl he just whipping he just whipping
Trap jumping like a drive-through serving popeye's chicken

I lost my daddy last year, I couldn't even cry
'Cause it's so hard to shed a tear, he didn't even try
The only person in the world I could fully trust
Was my older brother Vic, that's just how it was
Top in the trunk, this for Bankroll and Slim Dunk
I miss that girl Beasley, she was a real one
I had an artist that I treated like my own son
Gave him the shirt off my back and my own gun
R.I.P. to Shawty Lo, Mister Don Don
It's been rainin' so long, when the sun comin'?
I'm drop top but put the top up when the storm comin'
Sometimes I think about my past, it make me start tripping
I was gifted with a talent that was God-given
But I was so hard-headed I would not listen
Sometimes I sit and I reflect about that cold prison
And doin' pull-ups with a nigga got a life sentence
They gave my nigga Grant life, he only gained on me
Five years later, how we in the same room?
You go to jail, that's when you see who really love you
I don't think nobody love me like my auntie Jean do
R.I.P my auntie Jean and uncle Goat too
How you gon' judge me? You don't know what I been through
I think these killers need a hug, I need a hug too
You send a slug, I'll send a slug, you know how thugs do
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too
I'm just a work in progress, I'm not even through
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too
I'm just a work in progress, I'm not even through

So many cousins at my house, I didn't have nowhere to sleep
Didn't notice I was poor till I walked down the street
Rather have holes in my shoes than have no shoes on my feet

On every beat I go honey-baked ham, I'm a beast
If it's beef, leave you shiftless, laying on the street
Is it hot in this mothafuckin' booth or is it me?
Me and Jazze Pha go way back like Jazz and T
Smoking weed in a leaf, bitches sweat me like I'm Keith
There's a very strong smell coming out the VIP
I'ma do it for the hood, I'm a product of the streets
We gon' put you up on game, all on the count of three

You know, you know, you know, you know what it is

I had one foot out and I had one foot in
And I ain't gonna look back if I get one more chance
And it's one thing that a nigga must understand
That tomorrow's not promised, this is your last dance
And I'ma leave my past with this one line
Try to live your life one day at a time (it's Gucci)

Now our bills anything
Then why I'm still hurting then?
My cousin said, "it's not a house Gucci
So why the fuck it got a curtain then?"
I applied for a job once
Really went with the workin'
But soon as I got the work in
It seemed niggas started hatin'
I wasn't good ridin' skateboards

If I ever get this drop I'ma start lickin' shots

You can gamble with your life like a lady at the slots
You can plot 'til you pop and your clock get stopped
You were flexin' what you got, now your head got a dot
You're the nigga in the paper that they're readin' about
Police still ain't connected the dots
Drug  cause I left a nina at the house
Take me to the safe cause I'm cleanin' it out
Hundred bricks what I've been dreamin' about
Slap you with the , see the blood and the snot

So this is the end of the story

Start selling weed for my brother, the age was eleven
Thirty off a hundred dollars he working the shipments
Seventh grade Christmas time, momma gave me a fifty
I spent that fifty with the dope man, he gave me two fifties
I owed a fifty but I trapped and I paid him so quickly
I had them dimes so big junkies callin' me biggie
I moved out, paying rent was such a good feeling
I hit a lick, thirty grand fell out of the ceiling
I’m in Savannah and my nigga like king of the city
In Alabama with them hammers they plotting to get me
These suckers tried to take my life on a couple occasions
Been grinding hard, thirty years, never took a vacation
And ever since seventeen, been stuck on probation
I chased a nigga, stabbed his ass now they calling me Jason
I fell out with my homeboy, I swear it was crazy
And we don't really know each other, but having a baby
I travelled all around the world been plenty of places
I'm Gucci, trashbag cash got plenty of faces
In Sun Valley, trapping hard like back in the Eighties
I leave with eighty, spend at least thirty grand in the station
I lost my nigga Dunk and no one will ever replace him
In Gucci's eyes he will always be one of the greatest
I lost my nigga Dunkin and no one will ever replace him
In Gucci's eyes he will always be one of the greatest

Rah! I'ma hit a mothafucka with the pound, pound, pound, pound
It's the Pound Syndrome
Good God the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound
Un-unbelievable Pound Syndrome
Can you, can you, ca-can you believe it?
The Pound, the-the-the-the-the
The pound, the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound

If you're looking for trouble then you found it, the new album
Of two-thousand-and-fifteen, I'm too violent
This shit seems like I'm cooped out with lucid dreams
I'm a new route for these emcee's
This is a drought that's coming
I'm about to sprout to start a new style's full of envy
I need to cool down what is in me
Everything I had bottled up pukes out when the pen bleeds
You drown from a 16, who's doubtin' the sick steeze?
I could spit a wild verse without taking a breath
Then crowd surf, who's helping this kid breathe?
The worlds against me so I gotta come harder than the average
Think smarter than the masses
Everybody's on the move, ain't no time to get caught up in the traffic
When shit goes down I got the heart of an assassin
This here's harder than my last shit
Gotta do it now, no luck in tomorrow if it crashes
If I do die before I awake, I don't think too many will feel sorrow for my ashes
With this song I've frozen time, don't skip this, don't rewind
The throne is mine, close your eyes as I provoke the mind
This was bound to happen before I wrote the lines
And it's so divine the way my influence multiplied
It's like I created a cult inside this rap industry
Please don't look so surprised
I'm at the top, I ain't throwing down a rope to climb, come on

Now may I kick a little flow for y’all
That’s slow and raw
For niggas who thinking the west coast fell off
But first, I’d like to give a little toast to all
Who’s souls was lost up in the rap flows in all (Gee)
Back to my original topic
Fuck the bullshit you should be getting with Hopsin
On that real rap shit man forget the imposters
Y’all destroyed hip hop - Good! (Mission accomplished)
Now I’ma make them regret this shit
Bringing back all the elements
Making these fellas swell up
And tell them that fucking hell is hit
I got to focus though
And come down on all my zoning's yo
Because I’m prone to blow
And destroy all my lyric chromosomes
I told you folks that it’s over
So go and roll up your soldiers
And be up out this bitch like hocus pocus
I’m so ferocious I had the potion but no one noticed
And now I’m about to blow up even bigger than my nose is

I’d like to bust another verse if I may
The mess I made, make rappers want to catch my fade
I’m just not sane, all y’all affect my brain
So don’t be running up trying to put me in headlocks mayne
It’s like I pin 'em like a poster, get 'em and then roast 'em
When it comes to this verbal abuses, do not approach him
I toast 'em, bury them in an oasis
Then write a book on how I did it like OJ did (Stupid stupid)
I’m that new nigga all the kids gonna look up to
With a middle finger in the sky screaming “Fuck school”
You don’t want your child bumping Hop? Nigga fuck you
Who’s a better dad? You or me? Let your son choose
Girl, why you acting so passionate?
You smiling at me like I was attracted to fat women
Shit, go dance your ass up in the cut with your big butt
Come to think about it, never mind I could use a nut

Play this shit up in the club, watch what her booty do
I ain’t got to fuck with all the high tech shit
I keep the kitchen grimy cooking up my next hit
I guess it’s how I was raised, and now I get paid
To go and write some bullshit a couple hours a day
I just pop a tune on and the music will move me
My message is deeper than this shit if you listen closely
Yo, I got a habit for smashing faggots
In fact I’ma dashing rapping savage
Assassin who has a passion
To just see 'em, read 'em, eat 'em
Beat 'em, flee 'em then feed 'em to muselina
I seem to be the most heated speaker
I’ll defeat your leader
Freak your diva then freaking leave her
Hopsin, he a demon
Y’all knowing he a beast (what!)
How the fuck am I supposed to act?
The west coast is back! (Westside!)
Break it down (Down down down down…)

Please welcome O'Shea Jackson, better known as Ice Cube!
How you doin'?
 How you doin'?

Good to see you!
Well known that the Crips and the Bloods are allegedly coming together
Yeah, you've been a lot in the media lately than other rappers we'd mentioned earlier, Cube, that uhm...
You know? You have been labelled a lot of things
What do you say to the people when they accuse you of being anti-Semitic (Fuck 'em!), uh, anti-Korean (Fuck 'em!), and basically a perpetrator of violence because of your lyrics?
It's probably the reason why they say that it's because some of the lyrics were...
Aimed at the women, bitches and hoes, and all that
I wanna talk a little bit about that, too
Because we saw the parents' discussion about this last time and.. (Yeah!)
–So and brothers, uhm... folks walkin' around, totin' guns, uhm...
All that kinda stuff, do you think that sometimes those images and those lyrics...
Help white folks justify their continual racism against us, or continue racism against us? (nah!)

I-I speak...in a perspective as uh... brothers on...
What we need to do is look in the mirror
I-I, I do want the white community to understand our community more...
And see what's going on, and see what- what, uh...the things they've done to us in the past...
Are still affectin' us now... mentally, you know?
And... the reason I said it's because, I mean everything I said about, uh, uhm... you know?
Everything I said on records before the riots, you know? Uhh... (ahem!)
Anything you want to know about the riots...
Was in the records before the riots! All you had to do was go...
To the Ice Cube library and, and, and...

You know? I've given warnings...

So in other words, it's almost like a... war-warning or prophecy?

I-I've, I've given...
I've given so many warnings on what's going to happen
If we don't get these, uh...
These, these things straight in our lives, the clashes the-then, you know?
Armageddon is-is-is near! Eh-heh! 

This here...

It's a set-up, but the bank wants me out
Or the L.A.P.D. will smoke me out
This adjustable rate, it choked me out
They gave me a loan, and I had no clout
They gave me a house, for me and my spouse
Called my momma and my aunt
Y'all should re-finance
I let 'em dance with the devil
Dig their own grave and I gave them the shovel
Fuck, my daddy built that house
And when he got drunk, he almost killed that house

Who's the mack? Is it some brother in a big hat
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?
Rolling in a fucked-up Lincoln
Leaning to the side so it looks like he's sinking
Into that leopard interior
This nigga think every girl's inferior
To his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung
As she's selling more butt and don't even get a cut of the money
His name is Sonny and he know the play
And hope to god that he don't find a runaway
That's looking to become a star
He'll have your ass in and out of every car
With every Ron and Rick, sucking every John's dick
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked
You don't like it but you still call him hunk
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk
You wanna leave, but Sonny started talking fast
And it make you wanna go and sell more ass
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that
Now ask yourself, who's the mack?

Who's the mack? It is that fool that wanna pump the gas

He start macking and macking and you sucking
Quick to say I'm down on my luck, and
You give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way
Then you see his sorry ass the next day
Are you the one getting played like a sucka?
Or do you say, "Get a job, motherfucka"?
Every day, the story gets better
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-ass sweater
He claims he wants to get something to eat
But every day you find yourself getting beat
He get your money and he run across the street
Don't look both ways 'cause he's in a daze
And almost get his ass hit for the crack
Now ask yourself, who's the mack?

Who's the Mack? Is it that nigga in the club
Asking "have you ever been in a hot tub?"
I know the game, so I watch it unfold
When I see a boy pinned to your earlobe
He's talking shit and you crack a smile
When he tell you that he can go buck wild
For a girl like you and make it feel good
You know it's drama, but it sound real good
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging
The pussy so he can keep bragging
He say, "I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?"
You wanna do it but you feeling like a H-O-E
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over
Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back
Now ask yourself, who's the mack?
Macking is the game and everybody's playing
And as long as you believe what they saying
Consider them a M-A-C-K and with no delay
They are gonna get all the play
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your mama
It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a
Mack in my own right when it comes to rhyme and rap
Cause all I do is kick facts
Unlike Iceberg Slim
And all of them be claimin' be P-I-M-P
No, I'm not going out that way
I'm just a straight up N-I-double-G-A
Next time, you get over on a fool
And you did the shit like real smooth
Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts
And ask yourself, "Who's the Mack?"

Drop a old school beat

Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder
What's the date and time, it don't matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers, I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into, this girl named Carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala
She said what's up, yeah, what's the deal?
Check the hairdo, of course it ain't real
Then I looked down, she was fat in the front
I asked how long, "Well, about seven months"
Oh, how time flies when you're having fun
She said "Yeah but the damage is done
Where you been?" "On a little vacation
Oh by the way, congratulations
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue!"
Then she said "The lucky man is you," I dropped my brew
And everything looked fuzzy
Not a baby by you, the neighborhood hussy
She said "Yeah, remember that date?"
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said "Damn, are you sure it's mine?
'Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times"
She said "That day, no I wasn't whoring
Your ass is mine," that's when the sweat started pouring
'Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about giving up the money
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy
Naw 'cause then I'd really get faded
That's murder one 'cause it was premeditated
So what I'ma do, I don't have a clue
How many months left, damn only two
I'm gettin faded
You might also like
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...")
No cigar, G

Ay yo, homey, man, I'm getting faded

It's crazy 'cause before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her
See the booty and the front was all in place
But the girl had the pitbull face
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
Oh lord god forbid
My homies see me at the motel
'Cause those fools would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
And hold your big fat butt steady
'Cause yo, ho, I got the paper bag ready
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing
That I'm a hate myself in the morning
I got drunk to help me forget
Yo another day another hit, shit
I'm gettin faded
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...")
Ay yo, you know what time it is
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in" "Whoa yeah")

Nine months later she's ready to drop the load
And everybody in the hood already knows
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me
You know Ice Cube can't be having that, G
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up, they won't shut up
I'm gettin fed up, bitch
'Cause I know you're tryin' to break me
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me
I'm a buff that duff and hoot
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is getting kinda major
The baby came out, damn it was a lifesaver
Looking like my next-door neighbor
She said it was mine, it was her best guess
But let's check the results of the blood test
I started smiling yeah 'cause it read negative
Damn, why did I let her live?
After that I should've got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no I just told the ho who laid me
Excuse me bitch it's a switch
You can't fade me
Naw baby, not this way
Yo, you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger
I don't fall for the okey-doke
And before I fall for the okey-doke, I let the pistol smoke
Now sing it
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...")
Ha ha, yeah baby, you can't fade me
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in" "Whoa yeah")
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...")
Nah, unfadeable baby, yo
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in" "Whoa yeah")
I ain't never got gaffled like that, I used to do the gafflin'
McDonald's is my spot (What you used to do?)
Jack them motherfuckers for them Nissan trucks
Right in the drive-thru.  "Nigga, get your motherfuckin' food, leave it in the car, nigga, get out."  Straight jackin'4Embed
Fucking around in a crap game
Niggas think I'm soft cause now I'm in the rap game
And I don't hang out as much, bang out dope cuts
Standing on stage and I'm grabbing my nuts
But when it comes to getting in a circle
I'm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple
Looking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke
When deuce-deuce hit the floor yo
Now which of ya wanna fade the twenty?
I'm turnin your fat pockets skinny
Ah yeah I'm shaking the ivory
And boom it's like they die for me
Fool you can get loud, get mad, hit the joint
But don't forget my point
There it is yo
I put my Nike on the bet so it won't slide
Money gone cause I'm never hitting deuce-five
I'm never hitting four-trey no way
You wanna leave but come on ho stay
Nigga fever that’ll work
Poppa needs brand-new shoes and a sweatshirt
Fool you can't even fuck with that
And now that I'm winning I gots to get my gat
Cause I see your homies starting to look
And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks
And I'm feeling like a baller
Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller
Now you wanna go and scheme
Punk niggas like you just love to triple-team
So I pick up my money and start walking
Cause now I let the gat start talking
Now since ya'll lost you wanna go out like a sucker

Drivin down the two-lane highway
It's all bad, thinkin bout shit I never had
Pass through the W.S. (neighbor-hood)
Knowin' I can do my best in Westwood
Cut off by a white BM, driven by a yuppie
He sticks up his finger like, "Fuck me"
Now I gotta to follow him HOME, with my CHROME
Send him to the Twilight ZONE, it's ON
Niggas say I'm gone cause I'm fuckin with the rich
(say what?) but they all full of bitch (yeah)
Don't need a snitch, so I'm rollin solo
In a straight bucket, no it ain't a low-low
He pulls up to a seven bedroom, eight bath
Oh yeah! He's got to feel the wrath
Pistola to the neck, devil turn off the Westec(?)
And when you're rollin have mo' respect (bitch)

Or perhaps can I run your name through the mud?
I mean, are you giving up the nappy dugout?"
She said, "No," "Well then, get the fuck out!
'Cause I know where the hoes be fiendin'
Plus your fat ass got my six-deuce leanin'"
Bust a U on the avenue
Why, oh, why, it ain't shit to do
Bumping Sir Jinx's latest mix
And you thought that shit played out in '86
Looking for my dogs
Looked up in the mirror, being followed by the hogs
One time's on my motherfucking line
Why the fuck the swine had to get behind a nigga like me?
They must think it's a G
They both walk up with the G-L-O-C

Found an empty can of Old Gold
Came around and put my ass in a choke hold
Fucked around and broke my pager
Then they hit a nigga with a Taser
The motherfucking pigs was trying to hurt me
I fell to the ground and said, "Lord, have mercy!"
They hit me in the face, y'all
But to them, it ain't nothin' but (just a friendly game of baseball)

Streets dried up, used to think it would last
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past
They tried to blast me for sellin' a boulder
Now I got my ass in Minnesota
Got my own crew, it's on brand new
Damn, what can I do?

Tadow

Already done stack me half a mill ticket
Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz
Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome
Police are tappin' my mobile phone
I'm almost home
Gettin' excited, indicted
Spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest
And everything I own got repossessed
Now take a look at the dust
And I'm happy cuz I only got 36 months
Never picked up a book
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew
And see, what can I do?

Tadow
(Now it was on from dusk to dawn
And everything jumped)

Fucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo'
Back in LA, and I'm bailin' in the dough
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch
So where to work at, and niggas smirk at
Me say ain't nuttin' poppin from here to the LB
What you tell me?
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe
Cuz, they sent in the troops
Even though I got muscle, that ain't my hustle
Takin' niggas' shit in a tussle
No skills to pay the bills
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflation
No college degree, just a dumb ass G
(Yeah, you, nigga), who me?
I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess
"Have you ever been convicted of a felony?" Yes
Took some advice from my Uncle Fester

Incredible young nigga, you can't believe I'm just one nigga
God damn i've gotten bigger
Intellect superior
Walk in a room and make the whole interior, inferior
If you look me in my eyes
You might fuck around and lose control
Of your mind body and your soul, grab ahold
Undisputed on the microphone, whatchu think
If you wink, i'll make you ich think
Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter
Shotgun enema, this ain't no cinema
All praises due to the creator
--for this man here, that can't no nigga stand near--
True, inventor of the W
Whatchu wanna do, i got the red and the blue
Show me one nigga dedicated to raps
I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps
Record company death traps settin' decoys
Just to pimp young b-boys
With a cup full of yak, studio contact
Maniac with a contract
Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble
About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level
Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in

Lench Mob ain't nothin' but tramps
For hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin' music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in, bitch
'Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Gimme the nappy and make me happy
The ho said, "Pappy, could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?"
I said, "Yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex"
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb, son
And it came out sort of like confetti

"At the bottom of our news tonight, there's been a new animal aimed in the direction of falling off the face of the Earth. Yes, young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest, and the newest, creatures added to the endangered species list. As of now, no efforts have been made to preserve the Blacks. When asked why, a top law official adds, 'Because they make good game hunting'"
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

Peace? Hahaha, don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga
How the fuck do you figure
That I can say "Peace" and the gunshots will cease?
Every cop killing goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored, they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a nigga's neck
Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And "Fuck tha Police" in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside

You wanna free Africa? I'll stare at ya
Cuz we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over ki's
Of cocaine, it was plain and simple
The 9mm went (buck) to the temple
(Buck, buck, buck) was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can, yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel off my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out "Ice Cube, sucka"
The shotgun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
"When I got a sawed-off, bodies are hauled off"
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside

Standing in the middle of war, the minute we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
Ebony can't see to the light side
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin’ from the corner
Same applies to a Ph.D
Who's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin’
Who the fuck are they foolin’?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin’ brown
That's a fact, got a fear of the bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Yeah Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!2Embed

They're saying questions about us fearing, white people fearing, you know, what will the black folks do and stuff, we should be running down the streets, screaming and ranting and raving cause when you look at the statistics, Who is the one dying? From the policemen? From the KKK? From the skinheads?

What scares us is I think we hear violence

What is he saying that you have a problem with? And why is it when a black man stands up to speak for his people, and all the people stand up to speak for their people, there's no problem with it?
But you saying he said "black", he said "Jew"
When people talk, they talk like that
But why is it, when a black man stands up to speak for his people, you feel so threatened? Everybody's paranoid?
And you talk about black segregation? We live in Harlem and we live in Watts. We live in Bedford–Stuyvesant. That's a form of segregation. We walk through Bensonhurst. We get killed. So what are you talking about?1Embed
Speaking as a Black man from America, which is a racist society, no matter how much you hear it talk about democracy, it's as racist as South Africa or as racist as Portugal, or as racist as any other racialist society on this earth. The only difference between it and South-Africa: South-Africa preaches separation and practices separation; America preaches integration and practices segregation. This is the only difference. They don't practice what they preach, whereas South-Africa preaches and practices the same thing. I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands, even if he's wrong, than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil

I don't agree with him because I'm not a follower of Muhammad myself. I think that all people have been mistreated in some form or another, but I don't agree with him; I don't follow Muhammad. I don't think anyone should follow one man; I think they should follow their own conscience. I think the main problem of most negroes is that they feel sorry for themselves, and I think this keeps them back much more than they would be if they didn't feel so sorry for themselves
If Martin Luther King, Roy Wilkins or any of these compromising negroes who say exactly what the white man wants to hear is interviewed anywhere in the country, you don't get anybody to offset what they say. But whenever a black man stands up and says something that white people don't like, then the first thing that white man does is run around and try and find somebody to say something to offset what has just been said. This is natural, but it is done

You know what I think? I just think you've given up. (Given up on what?) On the ideal of an integrated America, the dream of Martin Luther King, I think you've given up. This is not, I'm not trying to be a smart alec, I'm telling you honestly that I think you've given up

You know, it's interesting how white folks sit here thinking that I have a reason to lie to you, as though you are so powerful, and you are so wonderful, and I am so ashamed of my words, that I have to twist and turn. Please. You're not dealing with that kind of man. You're dealing with a man who means what he says and says what he means. Now listenYou might also like1Embed

Far from an overnight achiever
Cole is like the leader of the new niggas
To tell the truth, I’m only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of y'all niggas get lapped
I sit back and reflect on the rap game, I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain’t know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out the 'Ville, "I gotta go there”
Boy don’t you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers 'cause this life ain’t fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain’t there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain’t there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shawty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it ‘fore she even made the bed
Damn I’m no good, but damn it’s so good
I’m picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I’m up in that V-gina
Type of chick that only dress in something that’s designer

Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, "Mama, go to sleep"
She tell me "Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed"
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, "Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, "blaow, blaow!", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, "Don't forget me"
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell

All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world

My thoughts are racing all the time
There is no reason or no rhyme
I'm trapped inside myself
A newborn baby has two primary modes of communication
Laughter, which says, "I love this"
Or crying, which says, "This frightens me, I'm in pain"
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely
At the bottom of the hourglass
Lies sand that represents the past
In which all of my demons rest

On your mattress where they gave me that
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back
While they relax, I stay in tip-top shape
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks, flip-flops
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks
Game tight like Ziploc
Half-Black, other half white like Kid Rock
Try to tell it to a cizz-op
Thought it would work, it did not
He told me "Nigga stizz-op, you know you is not"
Wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked
Fuck, this is for hip-hop, gassed up like a quick stop
They lit a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot
Even if you squatted over volcanoes, niggas your shit not
I'm raw, but I kid not
Your shit flop, I give props to the legends
Praise God but I give not to the reverends
Lookin' up to the heavens like
"Where did all my blessings go?" You chase a dream
But then you stop, guess you'll never know
I got a show for you to watch, here's an episode, professional
Set to blow any minute now, many women smile
Look the lights and the action, and the cameras be callin'
You niggas got to log in, bitch, you fantasy ballin'
I snuck up like I planned to be, this ain’t random, we called it
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that Twitter shit
Thought I get a deal and head straight to the dealership
But looking at my deal I probably can't afford benefits
Medical, dental shit, left but I always came
Back like a rent-a-whip, dirty ass game
Dog, I could run a kennel with all these bitch niggas
Who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with
Me, I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'
Start talking that "we" shit, I pause Nintendo on 'em (hahaha!)
Start talking that beef shit, I turn to kimbo on em'

Damn, broke as a bad joke

It's sad though, I'm tired of being broke as shit
I'm seeing other niggas ball and I'm like 0 for 6
Ayy, man, I just graduated, good old college degree
Shit, my niggas drug dealing see more dollars than me
I know my calling, it's in my blood to do this music thing
Won't be that illest nigga that you never knew his name
I'm looking at these fake A&R's like, "You a lame
That boy a genius and you ain't even listen, man, you insane"
But you'll see though, just what the hell a nigga 'bout to be though
So give me one year then play this back like TiVo

"Up" is something that I can't give
Won’t see me disappear like the old Aunt Viv'

I gotta focus on my flow and get some dough, man, shit
No dollars got me actin' like I got no damn sense
But peace to my broham's and to my ex-lady

'Cause girl we go back like a throwback Celtic, Jersey
Regardless of where God lead us
Just know that I was Martin and you was my Gina, uh

No more thinking rewind, I'm more fast forward
Less rear-view mirror and more dashboard
I'm visualizin' cash and stamps on a passport
That CLS with a full tank of gas for it
Cop my mom a whip, nigga, and she ain't even ask for it
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers

DJ OnPoint, J. Cole8Embed
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the story of a young man who left everyone and everything he loved to chase his dream. A lil' nigga from North Carolina, Fayetnam to be exact. Packed up all his shit and moved to the big city of dreams, where he ain't know a motherfuckin' soul, and he ain't have a motherfuckin' thing, just a dollar and a dream.
This mixtape is provided partly in part by, Dreamville Records. Straight out the Ville where anything's possible. All-terrain music, that's Carolina's finest boy. And by any means, when ain't shit handed to you, you gotta take it. Without further ado ladies and gentlemen I proudly present to you, J. Cole, The Come Up.You might also like5Embed
Yeah
You ever prayed for something your whole life?
I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing
I mean, you know it’s coming
You have faith and all that
But sometimes
Sometimes you second guess yourself
That’s human nature I suppose, second guessing
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups
Seems like it gives you more losses than wins
But do you stand tall and be bold
Or do you fold?
Do you believe?
See, me, I came a long way
Way too far for me to stop now
Not that I would stop anyways, but
I’m so close, I can feel it
Can you feel it?

Hoping tonight doesn't end in the hospital
Working things out like that shit was abdominals
Then I just cruise, Mission Impossible
Like a white vacation
Man, I swear sometimes life's amazing
Sit back in the nighttime, at the right time
And you know the young boy mind is racing (Okay)
White suburbs to the all-black ghettos
Top to the bottom, first to the last levels
To the last lights in the dead night, like, woah now
Slow down, put his foot on the gas pedal (Skrrt!)

Got that bass and I got that treble

Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)

But there's always— that's all, that's all, baby (Uh, uh)

This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Bimmers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Daydreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama, forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas is starving
Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snid-ow the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clid-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those

'Cause y'all ain't fucking with me, the ironies are
At all costs, better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles, it's a vicious cycle

And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
Now in the game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well— hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine

It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff"
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga, whattup?"

I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)

Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
But had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down
Stay focused, I'm trying to concentrate
But it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached ("Whattup Bleek?") and I paused
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
Yeah, you done came up (uhh), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (uhh), now it's yo' time to shine (yeah)
Time to change up, no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So 'til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga, we Lex movers, V-12 pushers
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, "And what?"
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer (woo!)
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennessy
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me
And my aunt saying I need 50, not 60/40
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby
Your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold, nigga, perfect your role, geah
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine (geah, geah)
I done came up (came up), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (game up), now it's yo' time to shine
Time to change up (change up), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's yo' time to shine
Time to change up, no more second in line
Yeah, yeah

I know I shouldn’t of did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm... (fallin')

Uhh, said where I would stop before I even started
When I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like:
"Sorry, God, I lied, but give me one more try" (try)
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is
Can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night, see how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?
But there's a price for overdoing it
Doing it this big'll put you on the map, stick-up kids is out to tax
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
Damn...

Now you (fallin'), right into they lap
Fallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen
Damn, you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino
You seen what that last run did to De Niro in Heat
Can't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards
Now your tumbling is humbling, you're falling, you're mumbling
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming (fallin')
Now let's pray that arm candy
That you left your ex for stay down and come in handy
'Cause come January it gets cold, when the letters start to slow
And your commissary's low and lawyers screams appeal
Only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil
Damn, gravity's ill...

It's inevitable (but ya) fallin'

And you can't get up
All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on 'em
And the women that you left for this heifer
Got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach
You're sick about what your life is becoming (fallin')
But your use-to's, has-beens, ragging bad about all the new dudes
Talking tough on the YouTube 'bout what you used to do
But that's old school to the new crew
They doing numbers like Sudoku
They're the new you, and it's damn near inevitable
They'll experience déja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive
Run and you'll never escape, so just fall from grace
Damn...
I know I shouldn’t of did that

'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming

They can take me
Now that I found the places that you

Without you I got nothing to lose
Deeper than words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy

They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

It's the hard knock life for us

Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, "Still, y'all don't know me."
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?

Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us

Welcome to Jay Z's poetry reading
Halt, who goes there?
Do this, do this {*does poetry snaps, audience follows*}
It was the winter
It was cold
It was the cold winter
Welcome ladies and gentleman once again
As if we never left
It's MTV Unplugged
I'll be your host this evening
I go by a couple of names
People call me a lot of names, couple to my face you know
Sometimes they call me Jay Z
Sometimes they call me Jigga
Sometimes they call me Young Hov
Iceberg, tonight I'm
(H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A)
You gotta love that
(H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A)
I got the most incredible Roots band with me tonight y'all

To let them know what ya boy look like when ya boy in that Roadster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging labels for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks

Hov is back, life stories told through rap
They acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back selling their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
That's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game: the two things that's great

We gonna go through a couple of things tonight
We gon' go—We gon' party, of course
Gonna be some emotional songs
We're gon' take it all the way back for y'all
Then we gon' keep it in the truest essence of hip hop
The battle!
We gotta keep it in the battle, right, y'all?
Y'all ready for that?
Alright

The takeover, the break's over, homie
God MC! Me! (Jay-Hova)
Hey, lil' soldier, you ain't ready for war
R-O-C too strong for y'all
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test
Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest
You bringing them boys to men, how them boys gon' win?
This is grown man B-I-, get you rolled in the triage, bi-atch
Your reach ain't long enough, dunny
Your peeps ain't strong enough, uh-uh
Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet the navy
Sure, we will kidnap your babies, spit at your lady
We bring knife to fistfight, kill the grammar
We kill you itty-bitty ants with a sledgehammer
Don't let me do it to em, dunny, 'cause I overdo it
So he won't confuse it with "just rap music"

I don't care if you Mobb Deep, I hold triggers to crews
You little *—*, I got money stacks bigger than you
When I was pushing weight, back in '88
You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya
Then you dropped "Shook Ones," switched your demeanour
Well, we don't believe you, you need more people
Roc-A-Fella, students of the game, we passed the class
'Cause nobody can read you dudes like we do
Don't let em gas you, like, "Jigga is ass, and won't clap you"
Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole
Oh no, you're not on my level; get your brakes tweaked
I sold what your whole album sold in my first week
You guys don't want it with Hov

But along with celebrity
Comes 'bout 70 shots to your frame, homie
You's a (Laaaame!)
Naww, you's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads
Went from Nasty Nas to "Esco's trash"
Had a spark when you started, but now, you're just garbage
Fell from "Top Ten" to "not mentioned at all"
To your bodyguard's "Oochie Wally"'s verse better than yours
Matter of fact, you had the worst flow on the whole entire song
But I know: the sun don't shine if son don't shine
That's why your (Laaaame!) career's come to an end
It's only so long fake thugs can pretend
Homie, you ain't live it; you witnessed it from your folks' pad
You scribbled it in your notepad, created your life
I showed you your first TEC, on tour with Large Professor
Then, I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice; you was using it wrong
You made it a hot line; I made it a hot song
And you ain't get a coin, homie, you was getting plugged then
I know who I paid, God: Serchlite Publishing
Use your (Braaaain!)
You said you've been in this ten
I've been in it five—smarten up, Nas
Four albums in ten years, homie? I can divide
That's one every... hmm, two; two of them things was due
One was (Ehhhh), the other was Illmatic
That's a one-hot-album-every-ten-year average
And that's so (Laaaame!)
Homie, switch up your flow
Your shit is garbage—what, you tryna kick knowledge?
You cats gonna learn to respect the king
Don't be the next contestant on that Unplugged screen
Because you-know...

Whistling when you walk (Y'all hear me)
Your kind is hard to find
Darling, I'm glad you're mine
I hear the people talk (I hear y'all)
Whistling when you walk (Y'all hear me)
Your kind is hard to find
Darling, I'm glad you're mine

Y'all niggas should twist up sumthin
Real real real tight right here
Zone out wit' ya boy
If you don't smoke, grab you something to drink
Mix it up right
If you don't smoke or drink
Man, just light up an inscense
Fuck it
Close ya eyes... Vibe wit' a nigga
I want y'all to really hear me

I speak through music, I reach you dudes
We can get deeper in the dirt than cleat shoes
I refuse to lose
I peep you creeps three months in advance
I see right through ya, judas
The man that I am and damn you don't know
The harder you go at me the harder I flow
Let's do this
I'm just a mirror reflectin' your image
The minute you switch up your face I pick up the pace
There's nothin' to it
Pull hammers from my waist
We can clap at this amateur pace
If that's what's crackin'
Or we can play this on "All Madden"
Can you even fathom not havin' a fear in the world
I'm cool in my afterlife
If I'm readin' these chapters right
Please what have you, I breeze through Matthews
Bleed if I have to, you cowards die a thousand deaths
Fake fucks face-down on your housing steps
Are y'all even gettin' this message?
I ain't bein' aggressive
But if you testin' my life then, shit, I gotta answer
Gotta cut off the cancer, young'n, pull your pants up
You gettin' too big for ya britches
You fuckin' wit' a dude that did it wit' digits
Breathing's a privilege
Don't you know when you're defeated?
Won't you though? Throw in the towel
I'm better with vowels
I'm a man of principles; damn-near invincible
In my own mind now that my soul's aligned
I didn't know before now my role's defined:
Take hold and control what's mine
Come and get me!
Come and take my life, you comin' wit me
Come and try to take me for granted
I'll take you off this planet
Dammit, man this is the gift from God
This ain't happenstance
And your arms are too short to box
Plus we knuckle up unorthodox
You can't take me off my grind, get off my cock
Whatchu thought? It's the Roc
I hear the—
I hear the—
I hear the—
Back in the mix of the scuffle
Since '86 I was sick with the hustle (Woo!)
Get a couple of chicks to touch you (Woo!)
Feather-weight fucker dont ever hate on the brothers
Heh-heh
Thought I was playin' but you niggas'll stop now
I ain't gotta sell another record in my life
The Blueprint 2, baby! (Mm-hmm)
See y'all in November (Oh shit!)
I hear the people talk (C'mon)
Yes sir and when you walk (C'mon)
Your kind is hard to find
Darling, I'm—Embed

Yeah keep it best man
Nah nah you don't sing yet man
Sing now!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us!
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
(I love you)

From standing on the corners boppin'
To driving some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For dropping some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock fleeing the murder scene
You know me well...
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all know me to fail? Nuh uh
Where all my brother with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mama rub on your hips, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of the homie Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, y'all Volume 2, y'all niggas get ready
Sing!

Oh

I keep you fresher than the next chick
No need for you to ever sweat the next chick
With speed, I make the best chick see the exit indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, no driver
You got your own 2001 to ride in
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving, shit, the first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
Have more chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still pounding in my after life
Laughing, my thing is tight
Let me hear y'all

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends will tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah,​​
Tell the freaks to find a man of their own

Ok
Alright
Hey
This song right there
Was off the first album I ever made
It's called Reasonable Doubt
Also was fortunate enough to be blessed by the presence of
The Queen of, just the Queen man
I wanna say R&B, I wanna say hip hop
Her name is Ms Mary J. Blige
Mary!
Let me get all the way up beside you girl
You ready?
(What I'm ready)
I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
I just had to test y'all

I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter
Y'all can't fade me, chrome stocks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Player's is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any player intervening with the sound of my money machining
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best player's that done it
Six digits and running, y'all dudes don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Mary!

I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
(Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are
(Jay Z baby)
Baby one day you'll be a star

Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching four lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
While I play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
Until legs spread like germs
I got extensive with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Cause you can't knock the hustle
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
(Talk to em Mary)
Cause that's the way you're making me feel
(They feel you, they feel you)
I'm just trying to live right
(Why wouldn't you)
I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Yo, lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I got to hot your crew
I got to, let you dudes know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though (me)
Slick like a gato, ya boy Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
(Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what)
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, Pa you're too eager
You ain't having it
Oh good me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a player eating
Alright
I'm taking out this time
(Let me buy you one)
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
(That's right, Jay Z baby)
Baby one day you'll be a star

But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
(Let's go all the way uptown)
Cause that's the way you're making me feel
(We in Harlem now, let's go to the Bronx on em)
I'm just trying to get mine I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Motherfuckers wanna act loco

Faggots wanna talk to po-po's, smoke 'em like coco
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshit, Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin' shocked when the fool hit
Oh, hey ma, how you? Know niggas wanna buy you
But see, me? I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight, get the K-Y Jelly
All night, get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side 'til you say, "Jay-Z, you're too much for me."

See how I was flowin' on my last cassette?
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin' a TEC, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Niggas hatin' and shit 'cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick, and now you
Actin' raw, but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your ho, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me 'cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimp—what a tragedy!
She want us to end 'cause I fucked her friend
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again

Got a vendetta even though I been better
Left him in the cold with a thin sweater
Rap niggas on Prozac get the bozack
Niggas threw two at me, I threw four back, hold that
Let the dough stack
Way before Biggs had the gold Ac', Dame had the Lex black
Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that
And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at
I suggest that niggas invest in a vest
When I come through with the Glock, jet-black
You niggas step back
I'm the best at, you know I ain't no apprentice to this
Me and my niggas, we invented the shit
I came into the business with this
The Originator, none greater, Jaz-O, finish this shit!

Heavyweight's light work for me
For the time in this motherfucker ain't nobody hurtin' me

Who the fuck got a VS
Fuckin' BM's on the road
When you had to be in bed at the PM
Need the info, Jaz on the C-N-N
Forever touchin', my work is beginnin', you’re endin'

Ugh, I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

So I gotta make the song cry

Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though you know I gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We should've been together having Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
Now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view because you held no punches
Still, I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
I'm somewhere in a small town, locking the mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside, you know I'm so sick, right?

On repeat, the CD of BIG's "Me and My Chick"
Watching Bonnie and Clyde, pretending to be that sh—
Empty gun in your hand, saying, "Let me see that clip"
Shopping sprees, pull out that Visa quick
You know I got very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V-dot-6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped
Or rather, mines, I don't know what made me leave that sh—
Made me speed that quick; let me see... that's it
It was the cheese, helping chickens get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now, they saying they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then, I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
Then it got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you, you, you, you
Can't see it coming down my eyes

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home that you got a special friend
So what was oh-so-special, then?
You have given away without getting at me
That's your fault! How many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga living was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Look, I'm a man with pride, you don't do sh— like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had just like that
I was flirting with them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I mourn forever
Man, I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever

This song right here is for real, for all the hustlers, right?
Had a girlfriend...
And, uh... he started off
Their whole relationship started off, you know...
He did what he had to do for them, you know what I mean?
But along the way, he got lost
Fast cars, fast money, you know the lifestyle
Trust me, he's right here
Alright
Do believe it, on the real son
Ugh, yeah

Can't see it coming down my eyes
But I gotta make the song cry

But none of y'all muh'fuckers could fool with me

Hat cocked, can't see his eyes—who could it be?
With that new, blue Yankee on—who but me?
Niggas shipped two million, then I blew the three
Then I skated the four 'fore I went on tour
I came back and it's plain: Y'all niggas ain't rappin' the same
Fuck the flow—y'all jackin' our slang
I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrows, tryna wild out
The game is ours—we'll never foul out
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out
Throw your hands up—niggas, bitches, busters
Hustlers, fuck that! (Throw they hands up) C'mon!

Who ever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?
Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
Duckin' the plain cops, pushin' endo and 'caine
At the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain
First album, niggas love me 'cause they thought I was poor
Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more
Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin' raw
Skully tilted, pants saggin', damn near touchin' the floor
And I come with doo-rags to your so-called awards
T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all
Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path
A&R's had me feelin' like Moss in the draft
So I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt
Get your CD's out, let's go, song for song
I'm the illest nigga doin it 'til y'all prove me wrong
Do you believe?
It's Hova the God, uhh, uhh, uhh..You might also like2Embed
Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD
If you like me you reading the credits right now
If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter
I want you to put all your windows down
Zone out, buckle up, let's go

Hello it's Hova; that's right young'un the wait is over
The new millennium is upon us, the album is here
Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear
Rappers with no relation:
There's "Seven Degrees of Separation" and I'm Kevin Bacon
This is the murderer's version
Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
Hova the God, I should be rapping with a turban
Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
Mike Jordan of rap, outside Jay working
Now watch how quickly I drop 50
I don't like playing, niggas can't stick me
Niggas can not jam me, niggas can't get me
Slimmy at the Rucker wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take em out the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe? It's Hova the God

Makes you think about the people in your life
Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here
He'd say, "Jay, what's it about? What's life about?
If you don't go through as a man's a man"
He'd say, "Suck it up, take the fall, do the time
That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are"
How many years you been around this thing of ours?
Commission, 125 years
What's it about?
It's about rules, parameters
You take the beating for the friend you don't lay down
You don't betray who you are, what you are
You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
They don't roar, they don't rap
You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them
You was born to be something I wasn't even supposed to be.. humble
Okay so you humble me now, what you got?
You got a war, you got global war
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now
There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings
There's no feelings for this game
So.. five, ten years from now
You're gonna wish there was American Commission
Five, ten years from now
They're gonna miss Jay-Z
OKAY, I'M RELOADED!You might also like3Embed

Ladies and gentlemen
Thanks for coming out this evening
Hold on
Taking requests in an hour
But for now forreal
Honestly wanna thank everybody in this building for coming out having fun with us
I might do it again, I had a whole bunch of fun
Let me just find out if I can do it again don't move
No don't move I'm not gonna leave
She said I was gonna leaveEmbed
Ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
I appreciate that
Uh

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch

I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks

Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy

Got yourself—yourself—yourself—yourself
Chyeah

I got myself a gun
Uh-oh! Geah, geah
Yeah, I got myself a gun
Brooklyn, stand up
I got myself a gun

But really, I don't need the heat (Nah)
Your heart pump project Kool-Aid, you're sweet (Nigga)
I don't gotta two-way, you gays
This is not beef, this is rap, homie; I don't have a scratch on me
You feel Jay soft, rip Jay off
Damn, I'm only worth over a hundred million
Look, I got beef with, like, a hundred children
Niggas with pink suits (Faggot) tryna get cute (Ha)
You a little out of line homie, don't let the nine, homie
Put you out your mind, homie, just rhyme, homie
Kick your little lies, I kick my real facts
Like you sneaking out the back of that Source Soundlab, ha (Pew!)
We wasn't chasing you (Nah), we had a taping, too
We came through to do our one-two thing (Check, what's up)
It wasn't a Roc-A-Fella come-through thing
'Cause if it was on like that, I would come through Queens
With Queens niggas—you know how I do
Look, I got more shooters in Queensbridge than you (Tah)
Niggas'll tie you up on the Colosseum roof
And open beer bottles off the boy chipped tooth (Ping!)
Look here

Had to buy your chain back last time you got robbed (Goddamn)
The nerve of this coward nigga, oh my God
And I don't rap rumors or innuendos
I bring it to you live, lift up your window
Let the public peek in, see your dirty laundry
Y'all don't want me to continue, ho!

Super ugly (Nigga!)
I don't give a fuck

All I really know is your ho wants to be with me
And she ain't playing
And what I'm saying (She creeps, she creeps)
With me and sleeps between the sheets
Me and the boy A.I. got more in common
Than just balling and rhyming—get it? More in Carmen
I came in your Bentley backseat (Damn)
Skeeted in your Jeep (Woo)
Left condoms on your baby-seat (Woo)
Here, nigga—the gloves is off, the love is done
It's whatever, whenever, however, nigga (One!)
And since you infatuated with saying that gay shit: (Faggot)
Bitch, you was kissing my dick when you was kissing that bitch! (Oh)
Nasty shit, you thought I was boning Renette
You calling Carm' a hundred times, I was boning her neck
You got a baby by the broad, you can't disown her yet
When does your lies end? When does the truth begin?
When does reality set in, or does it not matter?
Gotta hurt: I'm your baby mama's favorite rapper (Haha)
And ask your current girl, she know what's up
Holla at a real nigga! Jigga! (I don't give a fuck!)
All I really know is your ho wants to be with me
And she ain't playing
And what I'm saying (She creeps with me)
And sleeps between the sheets

"That's all right. These things gotta happen every five years or so. Ten years. Helps to get rid of the bad blood. It's been ten years since the last one."16Embed

The theme song to The Sopranos
Plays in the key of life on my mental piano
Got a strange way of seeing life, like
I'm Stevie Wonder with beads under the do-rag
Intuition is there, even when my vision's impaired, yeah
Knowing I can go just switching a spare
On the highway of life, nigga, it's sharp in my sight, oh!
Keen senses ever since I was a teen on the benches
Every time somebody like Ennis was mentioned
I would turn green—me, being in the trenches
Him, living adventurous, not worrying about expenditures
I'm braving temperatures below zero, no hero
No father figure; you gotta pardon a nigga
But I'm starving, my niggas, and the weight loss in my figure
Is starting to darken my heart, 'bout to get to my liver
Watch it, my niggas; I'm trying to be calm but I'm gon' get richer
Through any means with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture
Never read the Qu'ran or Islamic scriptures
Only Psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas
Tattooed, so I carry on like I'm nonreligious
Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures
Niggas say it's the dawn, but I'm superstitious
Shit is as dark as it's been, nothing has gone as you predicted
I move with biscuits, stop the heart of niggas acting too suspicious
This is food for thought—you do the dishes!You might also like14Embed

I'm not a one girl's guy (Real talk for you, peep game)
And they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie (We don't lie, man)
And the girls respect me for it (You gotta respect that)
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be opened (I mean, never say never)
But right now, it's just too many fine ladies out there (Too many ladies, hah)
To choose one from
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour (Woo)

Who you lovin'? Who you wanna be huggin', huh?
Who you with? Who you wanna be fuckin'?
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in laymen's terms, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Now all she does is homework, I give her in-house tutorin'
In and out, I'm movin' through her student body union
And she call me professor, say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, "At this rate, ma, you'll never graduate"
She said, "I ain't no fool, I'll make it up in summer school"

Huh? Who you lovin'? Who you wanna be fuckin'?
Who said what? Why you trippin', girl? Why is you fussin'?
Got this model-slash-actress-slash-part-time waitress
Spend her whole day, she hanging 'round with part-time haters
All they do is dish dirt and put her up on my latest
Itinerary, but since I tend to vary, see
I tend to carry more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
Tend to hurries, in ten places at once (Woo)
Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind, girl, and not your heart
And some day, I'll slow down, but for now, I get around
Like the late Makaveli or Pirelli twenty-inches
Or Caine and O-Dog, stick up tape from Menace
You tell 'em chicks if they must know my business
I'm tryin' girls out
Just tryin' girls out
Put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

I'm lookin' for a Southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
Chanel under the Louis, Gucci over her booty
Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
Pretty, witty, girly, worldly
One who likes to party, but come home early
Light, kinda dark, short, sorta tall
Slim, kinda thick, I swear I love 'em all
She can cook the coke and got hook-up on the license
But she can get you first-class seats for coach prices
Isn't this great? My flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds

I'm tryin' girls out
Just tryin' girls out
Put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya

I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie
And the girls respect me for it
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be opened
But right now, it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from
I'm tryin' girls out (Waitin' patiently)
Just tryin' girls out (Until I find the one for me)10Embed
Turn the camera at me
See what the public-
See what y'all did to rappers?
They scared to be theyself
You know what I'm saying?
Niggas don't think that people
Gonna accept them as theyself

That's what people don't understand about me
That I could make so many albums and just keep going
How the fuck you do that?
Because it's me, It's really me
I'm just talking what I go through
Whatever it is, be it good
I might say the worst shit
In the world, but it's me
But then you saying shit
That make people in the hood do crime
You're gonna do it
'cause you want to do it
But then you don't help them
You saying that you sell drugs
That you've got a gun
This, that, that
My rhymes are not
"Yo, nigga, it's all good."
You know what I'm saying?
More so now
You toned it down
For whatever...
Yeah, the evil
The bad side of...
Yeah. "There's heaven
And then there's hell, niggas
One day you're cruisin'
In the 7
The next day
Your alibis ain't matchin' up
Bullshit catchin' up
You hit with the rico
They repo that vehicle
Shit was all good just a week ago
About to start snitchin' ain't you?
Ready to start bitchin' ain't you?
I forgive you, I forgive you
Hustlin' just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars
Honeys that shake
They ass in bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers
Carriers of mac-millers
East Coast bodiers
West Coast cap peelers
Little monkey niggas
Turned gorillas

A man I worked for had one of the biggest in New York

Your gangster is not defined (Your gangster is not defined)
Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist
But more how your genes stand up to their expectations
"Never forgetting where we came from"
Your gangster, your gangster
Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch
But rather how many rocks you move while owning watch
Gangsters, hustlers, republicans and democrats, pimps and hoes
Conservatives, labour
The seller, the buyer, the product, the producer
"See you are what you are in this world"
The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern the gangsterment
Gangsterment, gangsterment
Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws
And create brand new words, gangster mentality
Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white
Mastered by the black, and absorbed by the fiends
Taxed by the governmentality, governmentality (Governmentality)
Charted by Forbes, if you believe in JAY-Z
Then you too can be a gangster (Then you too can be a gangster)
By any means necessary, by owning that dream
I mean it's a long walk to freedom
But, while deep, deep, deep inside the bush
The war on terror screams, damn it feels good
Damn it feels good to be a gangster, haha
To be a gangster, swagger is not a must, it's a liability
A cliché, a bad suit, cut the bullshit (Cut the bullshit)
You know if it wasn't for this, there would be no that

Deliver me from my enemies, oh God

Look: Mind state of a gangster from the 40s
Meets the business mind of Motown's Berry Gordy
Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry, my jewelry's so gaudy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauris
America, meet the gangster, Shawn Corey
"Hey, Young World," wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes, and you can pretend you're mе
I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennеdys
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed Black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence
As the incense burn
And the turntables turn and that Al Green plays
I see my mother's afro
As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's
And my papa just left the house
In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm her nerves
As I observe, this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store, we can never be sure
So all we can do is pray

Because of your strength
While I walked upon thee
For God is my defense

As I head to my homeroom
I observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground
I hear a car go, "Vroom"
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle
I ask, "Why you laugh?" They say, "You're too little"
"One day, you'll understand when you become a man
About things you have to get you"
Fast-forward, freeze-frame on my pistol
Fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
Around here, it's the shit that you just do
I just left school
The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had their guns drawn, screaming, "Just move!" ("Don't move!")
"Or is there something else you suggest we can do?"
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like, "Huh?"
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt, he calls paying dues
Now, when the rules is blurred—
As they is and were—what am I to do?
But pray? Pray the Lord forgive me
Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through
Pray
Deliver me in thy righteousness
And cause me to escape
And climb thine air unto me
Save me thine Lord (pray for me!)

Geah... Anywhere there's oppression
The drug profession flourishes like beverages, refreshing
Ahh! Sweet taste of sin
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg
What came first? Moving chickens or the egg?
This is why I be so fresh
I'm tryna beat life 'cause I can't cheat death
Treat shame with shamelessness
Aim stainlesses at anuses
You know the game this is?
Move coke like Pepsi, don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
I'm not an angel, I'm sure
But every night before I lay, I drop my knees to the floor
And I pray

The name shall endure forever
The name shall be continued as long as the sun
Pray for me!
Men shall be blessed in Him
All nations shall call Him blessed
In Your name, I pray
Pray for me!
Lord bless usEmbed

This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Bimmers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I’m just a lazy boy
Day dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

(American dreamin’)
(I'm just American dreamin')
(American dreamin')

Uh, uhhhh!
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
It's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No!
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus, I’m in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, it’s all in the stars
Like Tony La Russa on how you play your Cards
'Cause y’all ain't fucking with me! The ironies are
At all costs better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles it’s a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins

Step one in this process: scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince them that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow 'cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine

I'm just saying (Woo!), baby, I'm just saying

Like a mama, you birth me; Brooklyn, you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley
They said you'd murk me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hеllo, Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'ma call hеr? Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you
'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much, I bought extra
So much so that dinner's now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul

Hello, Brooklyn, how you doing?
Where you going? Can I come too?
And If I can, I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my cars, and drive me crazy
Wherever you going, baby girl, just take me

And when I said Jay-Z, she say, "It's the Roc!"
And I'ma leave it like this—like this, like that
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Have you seen her?
And when she tell you something, you better believe her
She told me she like my New Orleans demeanor
And so, I said, "Goodbye, Katrina"

And "Hello, Brooklyn!" Buh-baby, you are
The sweetest sight eyes could see
I said, "Hello, Brooklyn!" Buh-baby
I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said, "Hello, Brooklyn!" Buh-buh-baby, you are (Woo!)

And I say, "Hello, Brooklyn!"
Brooklyn, you crazy; look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth, walking 'round, behaving—
All demented; black hoodies and Timberland-ed
Always scheming—"You see the gleam on that nigga's pendant?"
(Hello, Brooklyn) You bad influence, look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you (Haha), look at my attitude
It says my life's too real, check out my ice grill
Baby, I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville
But my Bed's in the Stuy, though I'll lie flat in your bush
'Til we smoke a C.I., "What up" to the boy, B.I.?
You know I handle B-I, I don't half-step on the 'caine
Ask the dreads 'bout I, how you gwaan 'so?

Iller than Albee Square Mall back in the 9-0

So in a couple years, baby, I'ma bring you some Nets (Woo!)

Hello, Brooklyn, how you doing? (Yeah)
Where you going? Can I come too?

You could be my lady, and have my baby

Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back
Liver bad, he wouldn't live long, that snatched my dad back
Guidance? I never had that, streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all
Burnt it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at
Flash back, not having much, not having that
Had to get some challah bread so you can holla back and
Holla at my Jewish lawyer to enjoy the fruit of letting my cash stack
And just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Own boss, own your masters, slaves
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon' feed we?
If I need it, I'ma get it however, God help me

And I don't need no hook for this shit

I'm so fa sho', it's no façade
"Stay outta trouble," Mama said as Mama sighed
Her fear, her youngest son be a victim of homicide
But I gotta get you outta here momma, or I'ma die
Inside
And either way, you lose me, Mama, so let loose of me
I got the rein, our direction will soon change
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game
Hustle 'caine, hustle clothes, or hustle music
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick
Skinny nigga, toothpick, but, but I do lift
Weight like I'm using 'roids

I cannot so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearing thе coast up
Tight coupes like I'm wearing thе roadster
For any coupe, bear-hugging the holster

Hov', alright al-right
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
Once again it's the life

So I make no apologies, crooked policies
So a G a nigga gotta be
We playing for property, no Monopoly
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me
They say the child shall lead
So I take it far as I can and then we shall see
Shall we dance with the devil for a beat
I pray to God I ain't got two left feet
Do the hustle put keys in the street
Then I'm ballroom dancing
Ke-ke'in in the suite
Sweet, BB's on the feet
TV's in the seat, ene-mies on the creep

Uh, uh, uh

She likes me
She fiends for me nightly
She leans for me
Morning, she rush for my touch
This is about lust
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her
My presence is a must- must- must-
Bonita Applebum, I gotta put you on
If I didn't when we cutting, the feeling'll be too strong
In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams
That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing
That Black Rain will take away your pain
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein
Now that feelin' got you tripping
You don't wanna feel no different
This here lust has got you itching
Nose wide open and it's dripping (eh, eh, eh, eh)

Like Louboutins with the red bottoms
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em
Like every color Giuseppe's, your guilty pleasure is me
It's so much fun, you shun therapy
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting
Shopping's like copping, you constantly need it
I'm never around, you constantly seek it
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps
I keep trying to remind you to keep telling yourself
Now your conscience is interfering, like "Better yourself!"
Like you better get help
But when that medicine's felt
We're back together, don't ever leave me
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me
My China White, 'til we D.O.A

When the world got too much and you pleaded with me
Who helped you immediately? How speedy of me!
How could you deny me so vehemently?
Now your body is shaking, trying to free it of me
And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me
Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the D!

Break out the red lights, welcome to the party life
Welcome to the 70's... sweeeet!

Ordered some Patreezy, while talking to this breezy
Brushing off my three-piece, I make this look too easy
So tall and lanky, my suit, it should thank me
I make it look good to be this hood, Meyer Lansky
Mixed with Lucky Lefty, gangster effortlessly
Papa was a rolling stone, it's in my an-ces-try
I'm in a whole 'nother league, niggas never catch me
And I sport fly shit, I should win the ESPY

Hahahah... Baby I said 'I-I sport, fly shit
I should win the ESPY'

Ain't nothing wrong with that, that's my biiitch!

So all you niggas fall back, I'll split ya wiiig

Head into the party life
You can stall out or ball out
(Is you rolling, rolling, rolling?)
Make a choice
(​​​​​​​​Heading-heading to the party life)
It's so gangster, baby

Sipping on my vino got me cooler than Pacino
And De Niro put together my real life is like Casino
They should pay me for some B-roll
Taking G-strolls through the ghee-tto
When rap-pap-pap-pid fire's just a necessary evil
Hola Ho-vi-to, cooler than ze-ro
Be-low, fresh one blade, no chemo
Art with no easel, please it's no equal
Your boy's Off the Wall these other niggas is Tito
Damn! Ay baby I said I'm
I'm "Off the Wall" I'm like a young Michael Jackson
These other niggas is Tito
Shout out to Randy, hehehehe
Real talk !

I'ma just let this ride out
I might let it ride out for like seven minutes
You can groove to it, whatever
Get your two step - AOWWW!
Guru, turn the lights down
Let's keep it smooth
This that shit you roll up, like a lil' tight J to
Sip your lil' wine, whatever your vice is y'know
Whatever you like to do
Get into your comfort zone baby, get into yo' comfort zone

Head into the party life
I don't even want it to stop though, f'real though

Step into my bedroom, I, call it the red room
'Cau-cause it gets hot hot hot hot...

Ugh, ugh, yessir!
Just the sound of his voice is a hit
Hehe
Y'all niggas got me really confused out there
I make "Big Pimpin'" or"Give It 2 Me," one of those, y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought-provoking shit, y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one
Follow!

When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block, then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged, then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
"That's him!"—I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount
'Cause I been doing this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada baggin' up at the Ramada
Table full of powder, A/C broke
'Bout to take another shower, on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the fight
You might see me anywhere, a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no sixes on Sprees

They're all actors
Lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themselves
Don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures
It's mostly backwards
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song, you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa!
This ain't B.R., no
It's S.C., CEO, the next Lyor
No, the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel—go!
Ugh, take off the cuffs, unlock the gate
It's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate
The '07 Ice Cube, B. Sig' so rude
Tell a trick, get these nuts, eat dick like food
Now see if I care if this verse get aired
Even if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah
I'm so raunchy, bitch, get off me
Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me

I missed the part when it stopped being 'bout Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit?
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Are you saying what I'm spitting is worse than these celebretantes showin' they kitten? You kidding?
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me

Let that bitch breathe!

I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
'Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big
I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with, with
Shit, let that bitch breathe!
I'm way too important to be talking about extorting
Asking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin
Broad daylight I'll off your on-switch
You're not too bright, goodnight, long kiss
Bye bye, my reply... "BLAH, BLAH"
Blast burner, then pass burner to Ty-Ty

How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu?
Hold up, let me move my bowels
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys

Apartment at the Trump I only slept in once

Even if I fell I'll land on a bunch of money
Y'all ain't got nothing for me

Nas, let that bitch breathe!

Success, McLaren, women staring
My villain appearance
Sacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello
Camaro driven, I climax from paper
Then ask: "Why is life worth living?"
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den

Uhh, said where I would stop before I even started
When I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like:
"Sorry, God, I lied, but give me one more try" (try)
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is
Can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night, see how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?
But there's a price for overdoing it
Doing it this big'll put you on the map, stick-up kids is out to tax

Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on 'em
And the women that you left for this heifer
Got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach
You're sick about what your life is becoming (fallin')
But your use-to's, has-beens, ragging bad about all the new dudes
Talking tough on the YouTube 'bout what you used to do
But that's old school to the new crew

They'll experience déja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive

So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home, you understand?
So, and they'll do— you know
Once you memorize a sentence, it's like an exercise
Y'all niggas can't be serious right now
I'm the all-time heavyweight champion of flowers
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now
Best flow, most consistent, realest stories
Most charisma
I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter
Holla

I jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring
That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter, 'round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me Hova
I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds, so when the nerds asleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death
I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (Run), pull up in a drop (Pull up)
Push up on my money (Push up), I'm in great shape, dunny (Woo)
I keep jacks jumping, thirty-six sets
Like a personal trainer, I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats, all-white trainers
The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina, Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
The fifth a deadlift
If niggas don't wanna get shot, then y'all niggas better squat
I drop your set for rep
No need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet

I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me
Talked to me rudely 'cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black and living a movie, not living by rules
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews

Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

I keep it realer than most I know you're feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill in dip
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a trick, and then you die
But for now, love, we live life, the chiller wrist
Since diapers, had nothing to livе for like them lifers but
Making surе everybody get a slice of the pie we dice up
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit the world with some game that'll light ya life up
If every player in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint
If y'all brothers ain't talking 'bout large money, come on money

Even if it ain't sunny, hey, I ain't complaining
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40, hydroplaning, what, shorty?
(Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining
Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living, the ill street blues got you hunger painin'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, they still singing, fools
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal with
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as it gets
'95 South I burnt downs in 96
When I was doin my thing, I hit those cats on the hill with bricks
Ain't nothin changed, cats still ridin them chrome things
Oh yeah, maybe we got a couple more stones in the rings
And we don't have to talk in code when the phone rings, we own things

Fill the glass way to the top till I wet my knuckles
Y'all stay consumed with rumors here
I keep your girl on the bloomers while you scream on the answering machine
"Pick up, I know you're there!"
I can't believe y'all so emotional
And mad at me because I'm doin what I'm supposed to do
Stacking G's, I'm beyond your rumors, I'm a player
Macking V's in the tropic where the only topic is daiquiris
With the hot chick rocking a 2-piece with double C's
Estimate the glasses alone, cost her 2 G's
The dread dude stopped by, introduced me to new trees
I told him it's stress back in New York, I need it to release
We start to zoning, me and this chick on the island, unplug the phone and
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke then I leave that stuff alone, man
It got me going, again

I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set

"Man I worked for one of the biggest companies in New York City
He didn't own his own company
White man owned it, so they owned him
Nobody owns me though."

(Your gangster is not defined)
Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist, but more how your genes stand up to their expectations
"Never forgetting where we came from."
(Your gangster, your gangster)
Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch
But rather how many rocks you move while owning the watch
(Gangsters, hustlers, republicans, democrats, pimps and hoes)
Conservatives, labour
The seller, the buyer, the product, the producer
"See you are what you are in this world."
The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern the gangsterment
(Gangsterment, gangsterment)
Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws
And create brand new words, gangster mentality
(Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white
Mastered by the black, and absorbed by the fiends
Taxed by the governmentality, governmentality (governmentality)
Charted by Forbes, if you believe in JAY-Z
Then you too can be a gangster) then you too can be a gangster
By any means necessary, by owning that dream
I mean it's a long walk to freedom
But, while deep, deep, deep inside the bush
(The war on terror screams, damn it feels good)
Damn it feels good to be a gangster, haha
(To be a gangster, swagger is not a must, it's a liability

Wassup?
Hahaaa
Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?
I was in the streets the other day, I had a homie come through and he ask me
Say "Yo! Everybody listen to you, everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?"
I told him "Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty"
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go

I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy
From the city where them young niggas die skinny
Keep work on deck if you need any
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me!
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready
Feels like I was born for this
If not, at least I'll die for it
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it
The big question is what can I do for the youth?
Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth

"I'm a hustler!" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
Real or fake y'all, we gon' see tonight
And I think I know the way, follow me
"I got hustle!" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
"I'm a hustler!"

I did the impossible, I made it out
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast
Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on
Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on
Stuntin in traffic like "This my car"
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far
Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her
Just ball around, you know, buy her some things
Lovin every minute of it, still breakin chains


Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture
Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional
Same picture, see it one of three ways
Let it marinate, it might take a few days
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence
So I shouldn't say nothin? Get a moment of silence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense
Words to live by, took it out of context
They say your past is your present and your present is your cash
So I look forward to the future
Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have
Partly cloudy so I need a forecast
Where's the weatherman at when you need him?
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him

To it from another dream
I sat up alone in my palace
Drenched in both sweat
My blood shut eyes were exposed by the sun raze
And being that I was alone
I was all exposed to myself
The silence that was going in my head
As I stepped out on the city
Chico there was a time when nobody believed in me
I always knew to look above it
And now, I'm looking above them
I want them to know about the struggle
The hussle
And what to they know about adversities anyways
Ye, I come from the slums, but so what?
I could repeat it to you a hundred times if I want
I could write it in a letter
But nothing will let you know I'm Jefe
More than my cold silence

I can't help that we're the greatest
It's what they put us here for
And like that

And when we hit up the club, you know them broads coming through
I told her hit up her girl, tell them that they can come too

Bitches they screaming, I can hear bitches calling

Want me fall on my face

Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

Why you can't recognize my stride?
Always gotta minimize my pride
Always gon' criticize my moods
I can't make one mistake, it's no room
Feelin' like I gotta leave real soon
I'ma say, "Namaste," and just bloom
But for now, let you run away from the truths
Since you can do anything you want to, anyway, uh
Know some things I ain't supposed to know
It's way deeper than just bein' emotional
Some things you just couldn't keep on the low
Now I'm free, by the truth, I can't be controlled, no more
Nothin' like I used to be back before
Know it must hurt for you to see me evolve
Why you gotta kick me down on all fours?
Why you can't stand to see me stand tall?
Tell me why we got a war?
Why we gotta fight? Why we always gotta spar for?
Why the cops always gotta get called?
Why you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?
I guess some things will never change
Locked in the cycle, tryna break the chains
Handcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins

Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose, foes
Keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar

Now
If I ain't know no better
I could have been sucked right up into the setup
But I kept my head up
And every time I fell I would get up
See I don't need no nines and Berettas
I kill with the lines and the letters with the verbs and the nouns
Just a kid trying get his sound heard around
Jump into cyphers and keep the old timers astounded
They said he was the best in the surroundance
Cause everyone around him was drownin'
In the fair one, no one son could pound him
With the lyrics, you pray you hear it
They say his bad hood couldn’t match his good spirit
And one day his mom and dad will be cheerin' to his grammy nomination
And proclamation to his world domination
Inauguration into greatness
From making rations to cakin'
2 AM and he be up like attic
He's an addict, alarm clock pop, he back at it
Barely got any sleep
But, he gotta eat
Cause ain't shit cheap and his soul/sole torned out of feet
He got dreams, but don't plan on sleeping until he reach 'em
Until you out feastin', paying houses where you sleep in
Until his album ready and his fans get it leaking just for sneak peaks and
Until then, his home is the booth
He spittin' to the plaque it's poof off his tooth
Like Hocus Pocus
Or word he's too focused
You should quote it
His goal is the denial that he wrote it
Flowin' like oceans and menstruals
Ink from the pen, lies within my credentials
They told me that I could be mental
But mommma always said that I was special
Haters tell me I should stop
My enemies tryin' see me in the box
So the streets tell me to cop a Glock and pop it
But something down deep tells me I'm the next prophet
Like the new Muhammad or the new Marcus Garvey
Or probably, it makes sense why I'm so heavily guarded
Wait, no, please restart it
I'm heavenly guarded, it's the golden child and for a while
God been looking down with a smile
Watchin' me prosper
Attackin' with the raps and then conquer
The junior Frank Sinatra, rapping out the Opera
You should spectate in the booth with a suit and binoculars

Fake MC's get their reps ruined
Young villain hop up on the track then the track doomed
Click-clack-boom, resurrecting boom-bap from the tombs
Raps dope like crack in cocoons
Back in this mood, back on the move
It's the motherfucking real, nigga chill act cool
Pay respect to the cat Drew
And I'm way too blessed to be throwing shots at you

My nigga it's gon' cost you, try not to lose your soul
To the rims, hoes, and gold
'Cause once the devil grab hold, that nigga ain't letting go
And I'm far from religious, I just know right and wrong
I know how to write these songs, I know how to light these bongs
I know how to rip thongs and I'm pretty good at beer pong
Nigga, I'm so crazy, nigga I'm loco
Gassed up like Sunoco, press the pedal through the floor
Bitch we out the door, vroom vroom, skrrt
Bitch love don't live here no more
Cause her weave look faker than her Louie bag
Weak chick I tried to bag, had the nerve to turn me down
Heard this song and turned around, now she want me to unzip her pants
But I'm gone, bitch missed her chance

I got sick of class, started making classics
Now all I really do is get the grass lit and bust asses
I'm sure to blow like bust acid
Puff, assist like Maravich, a true Maverick
And I average above average on an average day
Doing bad shit bet you still can’t pass this
And his teacher still pass him
Though they adolescents be addin' rappin' sessions over addin' lessons
Like fuck trigonometry, I’m trying to multiply monopolies
Subtract some homies then divide the cheese
Divide legs just to isosceles so my eyes can see through the E
Shit on you hypotheses
Hypocrisy after essence like apostrophes
You can’t stand here unless you pay a posture fee
Part the cheese, head out the spot and leave
A pile of G's for apology

Aight, fuck that, word word
Lord Finnesse, Jayo
It's been my jail since a day old, but they know
Yeah this ones for the ladies
Who be tryna have my baby

Ayo, word to my mother, two things I never do
Is leave the crib without some rubbers or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get a brother caught up in a sticky situation
Missing menstruation cycles
They all psycho ask Michael
Before you give her dough for billie jeans and them nice clothes
Like woah don't let them trap you on the tight rope
Spike holes in the condom to form a zygote
Overnight, ask Kwon, he know what it's like
He wore a hat but it exploded twice
But fuck a bad bitch I do this rap shit and put it over life
On the coldest nights son shine like a solar strike
And I swear I got the weirdest cases
Pipe chicks in the weirdest places from rooftops to staircases
Like get a load of their faces
Face it, if you fear, hate it, you get put into this clear space

I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'

Your girl got gas too, she let me tackle for a dutch and a Snapple
Unless you decide to put on shackles
I’m that dude, fuck values, pump up the volume
All up in the cut, no alcohol, just mad boos
Tryin to find a pad to bring her back to like a tadpole
I'm that folk, got bad chicks that I feel bad for
Bruising to they back bones, lickin' up my cock tip

I see you sitting on the top, in your better phase
Say, how it feel it feel to be the best and the most paid?
How it feel to be the most praised?
Known to blow the most Haze
Known to have chicks who go both ways and still down to blow J
Remember from rags to riches, being mad ambitious
Screaming "Fuck love" cause you was always mad at bitches
When getting money was the fucking motto
From the place they put potatoes on their nozzles just to silence hollows
Shit, you probably went passed that, probably still chiefing blunts
As a matter of fact, you probably don't even pass that
You probably in the back of a black bach, splitting down the dutch
With a dime chick in the tail flap, but her head is up
I see where the hoes at, but where the bros at?
Call ? and Powers, hey, where's your iPhone 44 at?
Or did you end up like most cats who split a lot of cheese together?
The more cheddar, the more better, ya'll won't be friends forever
And I know it's probably killing you softly, pardon me
Thinking you can handle all of your problems costly
No matter what the cost be, you're quick to try and buy it off
Everything is win-win, you know you can't afford a loss
But blowing up was always the main dream
So I can't get mad if you're flowing in the mainstream
But you knew from now that it'll be this hard
Shit, you learned to trick broads when your dick got hard
And if you can do that, ain't shit should be stopping you
Anything is possible and any obstacle should be hoppable
And now you living where it's tropical, you got the most shade
A letter to my future, sincerely, your broke days
Motherfuck them broke days
Most praise to the motherfucking most paid

How the fuck they gon' talk about me?

You talkin' bout peace, should I talk about war?
You talkin' bout a nigga 'bout a body gotta ride or drive
Or when I catch you, beat you, I just hop up in your Maserati

Certified nigga, I ain't talkin' bout bars
And def come in threes, I ain't talkin' 'bout four
The best come with me, they ain't resting in peace
I'm STD's on your MPC
They envy me, you're the big pet peeve
A lot of rap niggas don't interest me
 press press keys on a nigga had 'em be the itos on Belvita cheese, eggs on my rita
With a chicken noodle soup and a Solo on the side
Pull up on a ride, in the morning when I rhyme
With a mouth cat busy ever dreams of a Drizzy with Cassie and Nicki tryna go at a Minaj
Never scared of death, I don't know why I'm alive
Let her take risks I don't know when I'ma die
Tethered to the booth like I know went over top
And I never been a snitch, I don't know a lot of cops
Cop cars on the block for had the block all blocked off and I blocked more
Mama had a baby and the baby head popped off when the block niggas chopped off on the block, pause
Open up your eyeballs, get a good look
You looking at a nigga that was in a good book
In the rap game, everybody sound the same, with ya lame ass songs with a really good hook
I cook crack on the stove and sell it to a nigga that was jealous of the shit that I was yellin' on a beat that he's probably feelin' so he caught feelings had to drill him in the street
Kill him with the rhythm, put the pistol in his  hit him, get him, and then kill him in the middle of the east

I prayed to God, and promised if he made me rich
Then I'ma stay true to myself (Buck, buck, buck)
But fuck it, I lied, and now I just stare in the mirror
Like what did I do to myself? (Brruck, buck, buck, buck)
I think the old me died
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
All the damn promises, I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied

I told my girl I'll give her the world
Whatever she want, consider it done
Soon as I'm rich, I'll buy you a crib
And get you a whip, whatever you want
Promise my niggas, "I'll give you a million
A couple of cars just so you can stunt"
Then I got famous, blew up my head
And fuck what I said, my nigga, I'm gone
Hop out the foreign and jump in the stretch
Life is a bitch, I fucked her to death
And how do I feel? I'm somewhat depressed
I'll probably get killed, but fuck it, I'm blessed
Nigga, I'm rich, I'm done with the stress
Now I got drip, and blood niggas sweat
They love when I trip, they want me in debt
Go choke on a dick and cut me a check
All of these meds done got me a fever
I wanted a chain but got me a Visa
I came in the game, just proppin' my feet up
You niggas is strange, you follow the leader
And me and my pistol like Martin and Gina
We plot on you niggas, I'm probably a schemer
I'm easy to hate, I'm harder to love
You say you don't trust me, I wouldn't either, woah
(I wouldn't either, woah)
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated (Buck, buck, buck)
I locked myself in the room to hide all my demons (Buck, buck, buck)
I told my uncle to give me a loan 'cause I really needed it
"Soon as I'm on, I promise I'll pay you in full"
But (Buck, buck) I didn't mean it

Back when a nigga was jobless, tryna get by
Plottin' on shootin' myself (Brruh, buck, buck)
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry

I just put some gold Dayton's on my fuckin' Benzo
Hit the switches, told your bitch, "Come fuck me 'cause I said so"
They say, "Joyner, you done changed, you done lost your mental
You blew up and all that humble shit went out the window"
I ain't the same, I used to be different
They say that I changed, well, maybe you right
Maybe them pills the doctor prescribed me
Got me wantin' to kill, and maybe I might
Maybe my family upset 'cause I made it
'Cause no one expected that I would be famous
And just 'cause we blood don't mean we're related
I'm threatin' the plug, I'm not with the fake shit, I'm not with the— (I'm not with the—)
Grandma told me, "Tone it down," I said, "Bitch, I'm older now"
I ate at my auntie house, she think that I owe her now
Cashed my check, got paid again, make you's think I'm Oprah now
Took my girl to H&M, she told me, "It's over now" (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck)
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated (Buck, buck, buck)

Riding with the riders, with the mileage on the pilot
Couple bottles and some models and some condoms we be wildin'
Choppers in the closet, for the watchers who be plottin'
Watch me burn this shit down, like Sodom and Gomorrah
My mama and father had some problems but regardless
It was obvious, I would be a fucking monster and a goblin
Killers move in silence but gorillas move with violence
And my niggas move with choppers, and maracas, and Obama’s
And the time here, lamas and the tommy guns
Tomorrow never promised but I'm promising your time is up
Line em' up, Eeny, meeny, miny, grab a shawty, every body fuck
Heard your bitch a hottie but she prolly, well not prolly, fuck
Stopping out you soul until body jump, copy cut
Semi colon, space point, comma what? I'm a nut
Wave strong enough to fucking stop a truck
Smack you with a hockey puck, rip your fucking pockets off your Hollister

Climbing through your windows with a hollow pipe, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ninja blades, twin razors and an army knife, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ski mask rubber gloves, cutting all the lights, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Vest on, suited up like an armored knight, I can't wait for tomorrow night

Yo, I try and, I try and tell these niggas man
They not, they not fucking with me man, I, you know what I mean?
I've been doing this shit since I was like 9, 10, you know what I mean?

Joyner the puppet master, I'm stabbing your lung and fracture your back
Till your nuts will crack in your sack to your fucking bladder
Funny how now suddenly everyone's a bunch of rappers
They just a bunch of band wagon hopping faggot maggots
Got magic racket, hacky sack it's in my khaki jackets
A cream colored hat to match it with it after taxes
These little hoes know my name they ain't have to ask it
The rap assassin, I'm action Jackson the cash attack a freakaziod
Frankenstein, eat the boy, follow me on Twitter catch me at the BET award
Looks can be deceiving I'm the daemon in your ouija board
Sneaking through your basement I be creeping and I never make a freaking noise

What do you see in Juice WRLD?
Like, talk about the talent that you see from him
You just brought him out on stage in front of all these people
I see you said he is like the best freestyler alive
He like
He like that 2009 or 2000, he probably like the 2006, maybe 2006 to 2009 Lil Wayne
He that, he that nigga
And then they seen him do the, uh
He'll do another version of the song freestyle
He did like three, three, four songs
Over one beat
All freestyle, like which one we like?
Yeah, man, just let me know, I'ma text you
Aight, bet
For sure, guys
I fuck with you, bro
Pleasure's mine, bro
Nice to meet y'all, bro
Aight, bro, aight, bro
Be blessed, bro
Yeah, you too, bro
Congratulations on your...
Yo, shoutout to Juice too, man
Like, yo, he, that kid was so talented, man
He like, his, his freestyle he did on Westwood
Where he rapped for an hour, like what the fuck?
And to be so young
He like mastered that so fucking quickly
Yeah
It's really sad man, that, that
Like his potential was so off the charts

Period
You know who the best freestyler I've ever seen is?
Yeah?
Juice WRLD
Juice, yeah
Have you ever seen his freestyles?
Yeah
They're, they're so, they're never-ending
He can do it for like an hour
Ju-ice, yeah
And he makes total sense the entire time
And is actually really, like good, like intricate flow patterns
He, like to me, he was the best freestyler I've ever seen
And he was like the best hitmak- he was like
I really feel like he was the most talented, eh, like songwriter in music
If, I can't imagine there just goin' in there and doin' one-
Juice did that, my friend, Benny worked with Juice
Yeah
And he would say, he would go in the booth
Go three minutes over the beat, and it be a hit
And then he said, "Okay, another one"
And then he'd go three minutes over the beat
And it be a different hit
Shit
And then he'd be like, "Just pick whatever version you want"
He would tell Benny to cut it up?
No, not even cut it up, just like pick
Like, which hit do you want?
He freestyled- the whole song is freestyled
Ugh
Hits
Ugh
Like smash hits
How, how, how?
I sit in my room for six months and write a verse
This guy goes in there and it's four minutes and it's a smash
I think, like, what
What Juice was to our generation, bro
And the impact that he had on us is what Biggie did for New York, for real
Like, I really think, um
What he had, that like, that Biggie, Pac effect

At the end of the day, I still thank God for everything that, you know, He's put in front of me
But this materialistic money stuff don't really mean nothin', like, you know my relationship is good, I got money, but there's still other issues to talk about other than heartbreak (Right)
You've got anxiety, you've got substance abuse, you've got, you know, and it's a lot of issues in the world to talk about
I don't know, music is just a beautiful thing, like I love myself so much, as far as the way I make music, the way God made me, the way God wired me to do the things that I do, and to change the world the way that I can
I think you're an agent of change, I think you're touchin' in a way this generation that very few, if no one else, can
Before I get up out of here, I wanna tell you that you can do anything you put your mind to, period
As long as you work hard, give it your all and don't listen to what anybody got to say, it's your world, you can do what you want, on bro, period

Right down to the wire
(Chi-town, what's goin' on?)
Even through the fire

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How can you console my mom or give her light support
When you're telling her her son on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where B.I.G. and 2Pac died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...

All they heard was I was in an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire (Woo!)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)
For a chance to be with you (When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said)

Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I'm still standing better than I ever did

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive

"We don't care what people say"
Drug dealin' just to get by

"We don't care what people say"
Hey Kanye, this is your cousin Kim
I just wanted to call ya and congratulate you on this CD, it's hot!
Especially that song “Drug Dealing”
You know, I've been a social worker for 10 years
I've been paying people's lights, rents, mortgage
You talkin' 'bout people paying shine on $6.55 an hour;
People can't pay their rent for $6.55 an hour
So, it just... It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through
You know, and people are human
They wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do
The other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax
A lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in
The toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care- Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in
So, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work, 'cause you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance. ('til it get sky high)
So you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth;
You have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation, then you get paid on the job
So, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids.... You know, and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that, I mean like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know
Tryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it...
That they try to send their kids to school...
That they try to make a difference

I fuck twice your girlfriend probly told you we can't fuck
No, she lying
Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
You abusing the game you defiant
Disobedient student need attention
Have parent conference I'll be there, Just let me know what classroom you in my son
I am Dwyane Wade of recording
You more like Kobe Bryant with no endorsements
That's like Shaq at the freethrow, pointless
I'm equivalent to a Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues
I suppose I handle the rock well
I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll
The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench
Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics
My team something like the retro Celtics
Which means consecutive championships
Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent
To the way I do a verse he handle the ball
The same way I handle it with no pen
I call Jay Rock when I wanna dish it off
He bang like Vince Carter when he first saw NBA Court
Alley oop the court let him do what he want
Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports
How bout football?
I run the game like Walter Payton back 1984
I'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning
Play the field like Ray Buchanan
When I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary
Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry
Hip-hop cops on me, I dodge 'em like Barry
Sanders
John Madden hold your commentary
Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion
Should I keep going?
Aw fuck it let me keep going
I'mma do it like the '97 T Owens
Not the ‘07 T Owens
T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin
Y'all need to work on y'all defense
I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend
Maneuver like Warrick Dunn
I'm just having a little fun have some with me
Let's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey
One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza
MVP of LA, call the doctor
I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something
It’s about time for halftime reporting
I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand
You ain’t nice till you play all positions
Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend
I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in
You might say, "ouch"
Just let me score one time
Dribble my balls to the floor one time
I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan
I am the Jeff Gordon of recording
I am Tony Hawk if I was skateboarding
I am Michael Irv before the coke snortin'
Aw fuck it I’m what’s ever important
After this you gon applaud him
If not, fuck it, I’m blood-sportin'
Homie, I’m blood sport

They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?
(Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em)
Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, "Fuck the world" with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop

Now you got a body
But what I love most is how you put
Put your lips on top of me
You gots to be the baddest bitch I've ever seen in my life
Wait!
Your girl look better than you
You know what that means, I'm done with you
Bye!

Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm
Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm
Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and they're looking at the charm
I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back
And the heat lay right, right, right under that
Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat
That's the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, I'm a stand up guy
I'mma pump my fist, I'mma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy
Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money
With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me
Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
100 carat, nigga I'm the golden child
Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial
Wow, I'm amazed by how you niggas talk about you're married to the game, ain't took a vow
I'll fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up
Now, I'm on some other shit, we ain't on the same page
You ain't sticking to the script
Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
Shoot up your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat
Blood or crip, I don't give a fuck bout none of that
All of y'all can get it, homeboy, it's more than rap
Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap
I rap like I got angels on my back
God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit
I don't write it
Off the top like a psychic
I kick, lyrics like Jet Li
Which produce money to put your boy on the beach
Shit, sand in my feet
Tell me what the fuck you know bout me

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves

To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah

I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep
'Cause everytime y'all come around
Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah

Keep all that

What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
You don’t have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion76Embed
I welcome y'all to boot camp
Training Day
Fasten your seatbelts

Who shot ya, I don't know but you're best to call a doctor
Make sure them rookie medical surgeons can oper-rate on you
Pistol whip break the face on you, shit I does it my way like Sinatra
Let them infrared's Dalmatian dot ya
Scope'll spot ya, move wrong and I got ya
Through my vision like perennial
Creepin' to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as I tippy-toe
The tip I owe is through your window pane, I'm insane
One shot could leave 'em senseless, Marlon Wayans
Psychiatrist can't restrain the mind of a sick patient
Spray everything, not a single bullet wasted
Be patient, you gon' be meeting mad links
Put 'em in the basement
BET, I'm strapped with TNT
Follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh
That's what they say when they see me in your coupe
Sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop
You tried to play big and say "gimmie the loot"
Tables turned, now the people saying "please don't shoot"
Get out the way, lady, and try to make it to safety
Cause I doubt that my shit is on safety
Spray niggas, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
Ride shotgun, 745 Maybe
That's Maybach for you dumb motherfuckers
I'm wise like my pops but I'm young, motherfucker
I'm the one, motherfucker, bust around hustlers
You want it? They could serve you, butler
Excuse me Ma, I ain't going for your lover
So when I fuck you, the same time I'm like "fuck you"
You're better off looking for your next sucker
Money talks, I thought you heard Chris Tucker
I ball as if I play for the Rucker
Black Widow, keep something under my pillow to buck ya
He talk about it and when the fifth touch ya, no confession, no Usher, for real
Your whole spot is a movie like Blockbuster
If I want you imma bring it to your block, busta
And make it clap, no I'm not spliff star and busta
In fact, my niggas is linemen the way they rush ya
I keep it street from Compton to Russia
Rhyme technique is something like none other
It's warfare, choke if you scared, go buy a flashlight and pray under your covers
I slaughter niggas, one hand bang, Vince Carter niggas
Young boy I'm a father figure to kids who's minds is bigger
And they pops still sprung off the hardest liquor, I'm young
Please move in orderly fashion
For the love of money and crime I got a passion
Blow your body and spine whenever I'm blastin'
Makeover your whole face, you look like a Jackson
Any one, pick one

It's K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Who say West Coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop?
I'm 'bout to give you a prime example

Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?
Where my nickels and dimes at?
.45's Mac 10's and nines at?
9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat
If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
You wanna die? I can help you
Put the rap beef aside and  the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised
I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime
Mike Jordan in his heyday
Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines
I'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred
Uncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas
Grandpa moved to Mississippi
I really can't tell if dude missed me
Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe
More reason why my heart cold
Prior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio
We tryna do songs, but they ain't listen
They just kick down the door as if they have permission
Why you had to do that for?
I wish Pro Tools was on record
Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something
No assumptions, I know I'm nice
I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass
Not Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan
Chokin' the mic, releasing my frustration
Rather do that before I catch court cases
Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin'
Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
K. Dot's in my colon
That nigga, Colon Powell
Modern day war victim
Oh, I'm foul, come join my coalition
No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
Feel relentless, new apprentice
King of, comprehension
No competition
Compton's back, pump your fist like this and that
No sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts
You're a disgrace to this rap business
Just a one-man office, you need assistance
Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors
I am a senseless thug, with book smarts
And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question
We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession
Gave you the rhyme scheme before your English education
Exclamation, put it in quotes
I say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag
The flow, the artist development
Am I who gave you the growth?
You didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed
The sun shine, and now king me
The rapper's rapper, the MC's MC

Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga, oh)
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
And we don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right, but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

That’s what it said to me
But the place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I’m off track like Dale Earnhardt
My liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio, I wanna tell him, nah

That’s what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you

Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer33Embed
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
I'm inspired, so get inspired

And so he said "Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
And when niggas holla, "What's up?" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me?
Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you" (Sometimes)

Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

And so she said "Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, "Hi, Daddy"?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even though you get violent and put your hands on me?"
Sometimes
We hurt people that love us, love people that
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love90Embed

Parkin' my UFO somewhere that you don't know
Welcome to the C4, you see one, you see four
Bombs in my peak hold, bombs over Baghdad
Son you niggas, you can never say I was a bad dad
Run you nigga like a marathon
This is when Vietnam meets the Babylon
Bring it to yo front porch, tanks on your grass lines
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, jumpin' from the foul line
In order to see the king, you gotta swim through the ponds

I'm still lost in my own zone in the living room
Like I'm dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
Patron shots I consume taking the pain away
Each sip bring me closer to my doom
Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind
Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time
It's passing away, the world decides, it ain't what it used to be
Everything I love don't mean what it used to mean
For example spitting a 16
No thrills, feeling numb like i'm of Thorazine
It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing
Now I'm just trying to trap cream
Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow
What you can do today, that's my new motto
With that said, I roll out the bed
Hit the showers, it's time to get this bread, now make dollars

I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
Cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
So me without one is like I'm dated
I'd be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored
I'm one of the best of my Homo Sapiens
One of the best of God's creations
He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
I know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, I can feel you hating
Serving mc's like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
Half of these niggas ain't half of me
Half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain
Ten years in my career, pray to God that I don't blow up my brains Lord, I'm here
Great Depression, I don't know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost so much
(?) Usher
Either way i'm caught up in materialistic
Anything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it
Getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
No matter the crime rate I still remain content
Moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
Then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
(Holla) - x4

With my voice on the beat, I'm the voice of the streets
From my head to the feet, I'm bad to the bone
Nigga, I won't stop, 'till I'm add to the throne
Dog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit
Call me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse

Trapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island
I was a drug dealer, but now I'm a wild spitter
Nigga, I'm more iller, call me a hospital
You got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga
I spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga
Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch
I'm the reason these niggas be handcuffin' them quick
I'm the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us
See them in the streets, these niggas don't be saying nothing
But keep on talking, you ain't ready for beef
Jay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets
I can't help it, the hood flow through my blood
This gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug
Everybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas
Wrong place, wrong time, that's how you get clapped nigga
Raised in the projects, money my object
They standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them
You'll get shot walking through my section
Now you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school
Everyday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing
Shit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class up in the Gardens
Money over bitches, nigga i'm heartless
Money over bitch niggas, rich is my target

We're far from good, not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top down, screamin', "We don't give a fuck"
Drink my forty-ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
'Cause the kids just ain't alright

Oh shit, nigga
Somethin' 'bout to happen
Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty keys under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it

Welcome to vigilante, '80s, so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you gettin' fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travelin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula, draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips, and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the '90s
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga

Until one day, he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right?
When he pled the Fifth, man, it was on, matter fact, she gone
Matter fact, Tyrone was on speed dial, so when she got home
It was going down, she go

I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?

I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to
Smile at least once in a while

Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumpin' "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yellin' at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough, don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give it all to her daddy, but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothin' really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she makin' ends meet

Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs, he'd compromise
To no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where

And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve-bunk on tour
She suddenly realize she'll never escape the allure
Of a Black man, white man needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner's redemption, that sounds foolish
And you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fuckin' reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song, mmm
My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it

Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressin', my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours, sendin' me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in

Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I like to start it out from the bottom and build with you
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with you
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it and don't call me lyrical
'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet?
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard," probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me gettin' what I deserve
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He probably be out of work, laid back, while he
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

Church is definitely on the move and now we done took it up to the cathedral
'Cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
We out here rotating under the five P's
Proper preparation prevents poor performance, You know what I'm talking 'bout?
Doing my thing 'cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
From the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
Church is definitely on the move and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gon' expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Exercise your ism, and don't depend on no one else
Cathedral, church, ism72Embed

I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body—

All my niggas listen, listen to this:

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: "Fuck niggas"
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive1.3KEmbed
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6th

Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping?
If what I write down don't collect this very moment
Then I'm on it, no question
In the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet
This is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo
Track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
"I thought you had a show?" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting
Two-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck hip-hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover Dam, water, sherm
Contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
You'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing
But lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga, "Front me, let me put it on the strip"
Then give it back when I think about the consequence
Shit...

R.O.T.C—Right On Time Conscience10Embed
See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here

I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards
Stomping on em' like a Kappa
Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
So where do I go now
Swear there is no-nothing after
I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC
And you don't want to get caught in the rapture
I would probably burn your whole colony
Chew you up then spit you out
You nothing but a Polla Seed
Follow hood policies
Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be
You never seen a killer til' you seen one on side of me
That green on the side of me
Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like a sodomy
Fuck them bitches properly
I do it
I do it, done it, run it like I grown legs by the hundreds
My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
Bummy, NEVER
Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bomb on whoever
Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
I steered right through your fan base every time
Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways
I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave

He got it on lock like a Low Jack
Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where y'all came from
Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker
Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
On sight motherfucker, sight motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
When I go pop, pop
Open up, close shop like a retail spot
Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
Bitch that's no lie, let the truth be told
K Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up

Sit still, and close your eyes (Smoke to it)
What's behind the other door, oh
No more silence (No more silence)
Don't kill this thing we got called love (Don't shoot)
Just searching for the perfect shot

When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

I used to write rhymes, all day and all night
While you were playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscious only knew whats half tight
At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
This is a dog's fight, my nigga
The soundtrack to life, my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
That's because that's these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers
The good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome
Where is the love?

Give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud

Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
Manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be

Eating your leftovers and raw meat

Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently, all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free

Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with

Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly

Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you

The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga

Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
(Pause)
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi
Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
Bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
See, loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga

Smart people makin' horrible decisions, you know?
Rich nigga, gettin' my dick sucked after the show

Runnin' in stores, kickin' in doors, nigga, give me my glory

Rap money good, but I'm still pumpin' gas through the hood
Droppin' off plates to the fam' like Thanksgivin'
Got the baby snipers standin' on that murk business, yeah, slidin' for Yak
They ready for whatever
I always knew that everything would get better
And it sho' got greater later
All the game came from the elders like hand-me-downs
Me and my brothers wearin' hand-me-downs
Now I'm givin' game back to the old heads
And the respect come first, yeah, you know?
Can't be better than the OGs, you gotta get it somewhere

If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let's say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you

You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in them county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shootin' niggas, blood on the highway
Crossеs on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take evеrything that I ask for
Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showin' a pattern for certain
I think it's white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did forty-three shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way
Put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love
Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped off the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love
Catch us, you know I'm gon' rack up
I need the advance and the equity to match up
The engineer dead if the drive don't back up
These words come of God, you could never outrap us
Nowadays, gotta walk cautious, ayy
Nowadays, I'm a new prophet, ayy
Game dead, no autopsy, ayy
City girl with they new hobby, ayy
Catch a body, put the Prada in the ta-da
Nigga 'bout to get some pussy, give me five (Give me five)
Gun dirty, got the thirty in the purse, purse
Tight bitch, put a perky in her salad

I never seen my niggas bust down faces
Them niggas not tasteless
I only had one chance, I ain't even waste it
Been down on my luck
Been down on my luck when I fa-a-all
I gotta get up
I gotta get back up and ba-a-a-all
R.I.P., under my people
I'm proud of my people, I'm proud of my dawgs
My ex got a beamer, she want me to see it
I still ain't gon' see it, like, okay
I love when they ratchet, I don't do her Patek
I still do the watches the old way
She think I'm conceited, I'm thinkin' 'bout cheatin'
I don't do the flowers or roleplay
Now, how can I fold lookin' at twenty million
This money don't come with a probate

Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up

I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
'Cause day and night

He's all alone through the day and night

He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

I mean, I did, but like, fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
You gon' love me, man

They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

For the love in the core, love in the core
Some people bore me, so fucking boring
Smurk on my face, I'm all smiles
No matter the case, I'll be okay

I got some bad news this mornin'
Which in turn made my day

Lord help me out
Save my soul, need to find a new route
I don't even hear what other niggas talking 'bout
Call me a hipster as long as you're a listener
Label me what you like
I'm close to my victory, dozed in the fight
When I open my eyes somehow seeing night
Beyond tryna see what being rich feel like
Six-figure checks for my mom for peace
Everybody wanna stick on me like leech
Take my blood, give fake love
'Til I turned them down, now I'm the one who changed, bruh?
Ask why I don't call
'Cause when I was starving, you wasn't at all
Around, now I gotta shut shit down
Be a man, pick friends, all selective now
You're cool, you're cool, fuck you
And to the bitch that—oh yeah, fuck you too
Tried to shine, now everyone knows
Yeah, Kid Cudi slipped up and loved them hoes
We all make mistakes, yes
No worries, I just kill a bitch with success
While she at home stressed out eating ice cream
I'm at the Grammys living out a nice dream
No bitch on arm
Just my words and my stoner charm
And my dimples deep, I smile at peace
'Cause I went out and got what most y'all seek
Now I'm the one you meet
Who throws you the peace sign, missed not one step
And this is just the first step
God walks with me, but I'm still vexed

Listen good, I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself continuously
Then I won't be afraid, no, no

When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo

Am I someone whom you may love, or enemy?
Am I speaking for you and yours, or someone else?

Traveled out an igloo
Cold-cold world wasn't fit for me at all
Look at where I stand at, tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizzalls
Mute motherfuckers back home, quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me, I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floating in my mind, no sail
Ahoy, ahoy

Listen good, I don't need nobody
This is, what you feel, are the sounds of insanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
No, I won't be afraid, hey, hey

Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone
Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too
This is the story of the Man on the MoonYou might also like26Embed

And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed, indeed, just what I need
How I feel, upon a time, so recent in time, made me sad
When I recollect how it used to be
Like David and Goliath, kinda like me
And the Devil tryna rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no-no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in Hell

No need to run, your fate would follow
You should know, not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward
It's a goal, a simple code, I stay on the grind to the 25th hour
And I know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within

He had one older sister
Two older brothers
And a single-parent mother who
Worked her ass off, did the best she could
There was nothing they could tell him
Let the boy know he wasn't worthless
Even though he was in the same home
He had felt alone, his pet gerbil passed on

He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie's baby boy
He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie’s baby boy

By the time he was eleven
His father had left him
White church, sitting in the front row
All-white casket closed, he won't see him no more
He tried to disguise himself
Made sure that no one could tell
That in his soul, there's a wide-open hole
Something scarred him, so he can't let him go
He won't

He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie's baby boy

Here's the style that I say I sorta brought along
Straight from the Island called Long, but we call it Strong
God Body, by God and George, I think I've got it
Funky as the Doo Doo Man, outside MC's were noddin'
Don't even bite my style, relax, be different
Pick up your pen but forget bombin', that option's senseless
I'm despicable but not lickable, you can't lick this
Try it Hops, you'll catch mops with the quickness
I got a sickness, called one-two-and-mic-check
And rippin' wreck and gettin' notice and all that

Stay tuned you coon as I wreck it for the Boogie Man

Now, just to blow this up like I intended
Straight from the Kausin' Much Damage will I send it
I recommend hittin just fittin just fine then throw it up
Vocals for locals, the whole nine, I'm blowin' up
The birthstone kid, I got it goin' on
Every time I throw it on, allied strength is what I'm growin' on
I kick styles like maybe this one or that one
Whichever which I bust, it's got to be a fat one
Like Walter Hudson, my rhymes is thick, son
So, when you pick one, man, I'm gonna lick one
God style, hard with no smile
'Cause I profile, for the ignorant child
And when I bust off, homeboy with no heso' I just bust at
Point blank range, y'all think I ain't livin' strange?
I got this soul thing caught up in a head swing
I'm on the mic with the Gods, and I'm, soulflexin'

Straight from the flock with skills
Pizzazz your whole cipher Subroc builds, as is
As I jazz it up I grease your okey-dokey then
Yup, I do the hokey pokey let my soul bend up
Grown to be sixty-five inch
Short to swing, this hood sport is the cinch
Indeed I rap, ghetto folk'll snatch your soul intact
Now, slap your head up, bob and catch stiff neck MC selekta
The addict to this funk thing
And it sticks to you dramatic like static cling, for granted
Laps for years, I avoid troubled traps
Help me out the hole, to the brother I'll give double daps
Cuttin' that old haps, to the straightening comb
Maybe, twine the knots, I'll have the nappy dome
Sent to the home, crankin' with electric bass drag
Kick 'em big, but won't brag, I was hittin' into a rag
I don't slack, so won't you let it off? (Let it off!)
Can the MC selekta set it off? (Set it off!)
Suffer the {?} you can't, my style is ambiguous
Rockin' it 24/7, clock is broken tickless
Broke up yup I'm on, the uppity uppity note
I can rock styles that move, a party a party boat
With clout no doubt I gots to boom the boom
From Onyx my man, to Zev X my physical
Yes, I'm braggin like a wagon wheel I roll
I have my cake and eat it too, and lick the bowl
I'm soulflexin'

Some do slump punks but up jumps the Boogie Man
I got a natural coppertone, tan and plus
Eight hundred coats of gold in my glands

"Once upon a time there was a little boy
Who lived in the deep, dark jungles of Africa
His name was Little Sambo"
(Uh-oh, ZL's X-ercisin' his right to be hostile)
They always try to say that coon is me for some reason
(I don't understand, man)
You don't understand?!
(No, I don't know)

My temper, temper's up to like tenward
Switched up with thoughts that I recommend
My nest is flood but thicker is blood
Plus, still some stay stud like sticks in the mud
Ibuprofen from new kids keep me from flippin' daily
Yet, I constantly slip into thinkin' kinda loony
In my logo you see us?
Whoever said that coon was me?

Oh, no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!

Subroc, etched the fuzz of what once was
In eighty-deca, the joke's on cuz
Those on top of my head stand seven thick
Hairs that even if I wanted to I couldn't pick
Pigment, is this a defect in birth?
Or more an example of the richness on Earth?
Lips and eyes dominant traits of our race
Does not take up 95 percent of one's face
But still I see, in the back two or three
Ignorant punks pointing at me

Oh, no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!

Uh, oh no! (Who me?!)

Yo, I begs your pardon
But have you ever seen this brother walkin' 'round here anywhere?
That must be missing person
Have you ever saw his face on a milk carton? (Oh, no!)
Tricky tricky, must be part of the "Gas Face" series
The same one who started black cat bad luck theories
Yeah, he done it, this place, he runs it
And I'm guilty, Alcatraz till four hundred
Judge ye not the unjudged is where he slipped
The real guilty is filthy, he gypped Egypt
Blew the nose right off the Sphynx, now when he inks
Ugly as when our hair kinks, we thinks
Then zap goes the nap, now I gots good hair
If that's good hair, then bad's a hood's hair
Comb-twisted dome, braided or faded
The first man played it and now we hate it?
Robbed of our culture, true indeed I bear witness
And recommend this mental fitness
So get this loaded toolie and point it at a ghoul, G
Then ask him: "Who you callin' moolie?"

Oh, no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!
Uh, oh no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!

 Ah man, damn, man
Yo, they wanna call me a monkey, a coon, a jiggaboo
A boogie man, yo Bert! Yo! Bert!
 Um, what is it?
 Yo G, they wanna call me all these names
 Aha, I know what we can do
 What can we do?
 We'll ask someone out there to find (Little Sambo)

 Okay, pick up a crayon... (Who me?)
No, them (Oh, us?) Yes

Yeah, check it out check it out
Check it, buss it, peep it, check it
I'm on the low like a sneaky ass (white) nigga
X the unseen comin’ like the night nigga
So start panicking I'mma crack this Heinekin
Suckas is froze like mannequin so no shenanigan, bucko
I'm rugged like stone face to stucco
So fuck it! The mic is in my knuckles so I keeps my fist full of profits
My grip is on my pistol in pocket
Niggas be blowin’ but be annoyin' like whistle rockets
This one goes out to all you suckas: you don't know me
I never O.D. on my diet of codeine and OE
X embezzling fat checks and cash is okay
Fucking with the system like a rash but I don't say out loud
I read my hit list while I check shit
A nigga never lived to hear me diss him on no record
The month's up
I watched the pussy bleed for seven days
The body autopsy said he was killed in seven ways
Nowadays tell me what lady don't get it
Listen to BLS you just might catch radio edit

Niggas screamin' battle who steps to me? (None!)
To all you fakers, it’s time to meet your maker
Raps incarceration of a threat to population
Blowing MCs in a yardless, heartless center isolation raise a rattle
With recreational mental meditation
World War Three, it’s me
So man your battle station
The reaper lyrics are way beyond the limits of human endurance (Yeah!)
The rapper called star shot down for insurance (Bang!)
I keep the ugly rhymes in the cellar of my cranium
Where no one can see them or hear cries for freedom
Chopped up raw thoughts the only thing I feed 'em
Release the beats from the cellar when I need ’em
Dwell underground like C.H.U.D., love letters
Wrinkled paper bags, ink, and blood
I gotta slay ways of jealous I defeat
Dodge bullets blue sparks flowing off the fuckin concrete
Even if it's not your beef you are stressed cause bullets go homeless
And homeless need a place to rest
So where's your heaven and hell G?
Because your Marcus Wellby will not be able to sew
That hole in your chest and back
Often looks like a car, it's kitted
Piped and tinted, and also painted triple black (Ding!)
Sad songs to your savior to sacrifice your soul to prayers failed (Sorry)
Cause God moved like a snail so death prevails
You’re deader than a doornail

I used to get dressed for y'all, now I don't do that no more, I'm sorry. It's a new day, I don't have the energy
Anybody got a joke?
Ok so, these are brand new songs that very few people have heard, very much about, you know, what I've been going trough and what I've been learning -- a lot of wonderful life lessons, you know, that aren't easy to come by but you're very blessed after you realize why you had to go trough what you had to go trough
It's just very important that you really listen to the words, you know, and if you have a hard time to hear what I'm saying please just raise your hand, you know, or something, object! You guys ready in there? (All set) Ok
And you know, it's real interesting because I used to be a performer, and I really don't consider myself a performer so much anymore. I'm really just... I'm sharing, you know, more or less the music that I've been given. But if I stop, if I start, if I... you know... feel like saying, "Baby, baby, baby" for eighteen bars -- whatever, you know? I just... I do that
So You guys are cool?  Ok I'm talking to people in my head too. It's alright though. Let's just warm up a little bit. I'm just gonna finish sucking on my lozenger
Okay, so this particular song is called "Mr. Intentional." We'll see. We all tuned up now? Let's just warm up a little bitYou might also likeEmbed

Everybody knows that they guilty

Everybody knows that they guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now

Time to get free, or give yourselves up now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time

Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
Conformin' our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin' our tape recorders
From hearin' like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate, worse than Sodom
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits
Truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been, programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision
Apallin', callin' religious
Some program on television
How can, dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhDs in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors in past delusion
Now who you choosin'?
The head, or the tail
The bloodshed of the male
Or confidence in the tale
Conferences is Yale
Discussin' doctrines of Baal
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail
His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin' me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still, dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong, in true enemies defeat
Destitute in a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in
There's no escapin' when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores
Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no admission
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan
What's goin' on, what's a priority to you
By what authority do to you
The majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters, check the verses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand

Yo, remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Yo, yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen
Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(Put them up, put them up)

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Uh-uh, come again (Yeah)
Hey, yo-yo, come again

Class!
Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this—you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(She poetic)
She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?94Embed

Where other people stop, I accelerate
People say they're gonna do shit and they don't do it
I'm going all the way with it
The ultimate rock and roll sacrifice is death
When I die I don't die, my soul goes on
It's another invention
A bottle of death is exciting
Why do I wanna get old and be nothing?
Why do I want to be a poor human being?
I wanna do what I wanna do
And get everything done as quick as I gotta do it
And get the fuck out of there, go on
And then I can accelerate into the next life
And still leave my blood here
To be the blood of rock and roll and still be here
I'll never go away
But when I'm dead I will become stronger on Earth
And I'll become more powerful in the next life
There is no death
If I kill myself that doesn't solve the mission at all
The mission goes on and on and on
And people are so fucking stupid they don't understand that
They don't understand
They think "Yo, okay, you're gonna kill yourself, well that's stupid" Well you're fucking wrong
You're stupid for getting fucking old and boring and ignorant
Just like people on the jury that convicted me
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be part of your fucking boring world
I wanna do what I wanna do
When I wanna end my life I'm gonna fucking end it
And I'm gonna be more powerful for it
And, and, all you people who say what I'm doing is wrong
You're just so fucking insecure
That you don't have the fucking balls to do it
You wanna say you're bad
But you don't really wanna fucking be bad
You just wanna pretend you are
Well I'm really gonna fucking do it
And that's what separates the real rock and roll underground
From the people who wanna just be pretend
You know bands
They come along and follow what I do and imitate what I do

Take 'em to church

Momma don't cry
I know papa gone away
Grandpa gone and grandma ain't coming home today
But
Don't worry cause your son’s still the one
Though I'm under the gun I'm aiming for the sun
Dwayne Micheal Jr, born that
But I changed my name to Wayne
And nigga I ain't goin back
I'm kinda little but I figured I’d be bigger if I sold crack
So I sold that
OG’s from the block told me "Youngin hold that"
So I held dat
Got on front street and then I fell back
Became well at cookin it til it smell flat
Vaseline it up and ship it out in gel packs
I failed at what the teacher used to yell about
Junior High was prison
High school was the bail out
But my momma knew her baby boy was fresher
Than a baby bottom in new Pampers on campus

Few leaves left the sole tree standing
Just as quick as the wind blew they went too

Where their bodies shouldn’t sleep
I probably shouldn’t speak like that

Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side

And even though I’m not an artist this is where I draw the line
We don’t feel none of you niggas
Y'all some fuckin porcupines
I still got residue all on my dinner plates
Real niggas in my inner circle
None of my checks come late, I ain’t having that, I give em curfews
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress
Surprise yo ass like a baby… taking his first steps
I’m too good for just any bad bitch
Smoke like I’ve been kissing dragons
That milk carton show her missing panties
That pussy felt like a hidden valley
Thank God that I’m so gifted
I wouldn’t return a single gift
But all good things must come to an end
Like this blunt burning my fingertips

For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Day dreamin'!

What the fuck is poppin'
Baby I'm what's hoppin-a

Shhh...

But I ain't scared, oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'
Now when I walk past, you might see an extra shadow
Angels on my shoulders are usin' me for a battle
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil
I even fought the demons as a semen
Yes I was brought there, cursed ever since my day of birth
Got a Heaven-sent flow, though it's Hell on Earth
So, with that in mind, I don't live for Prada
I'm trying to stack and mack, and got stigmata
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes, when I flow, they say the southern Big's popped up
They tell me "don't get murked, or get locked up"
But I'm from Holly Grove, I can't give the block up (Holly Grove)
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck
I'ma ride with my Glocks up
You already know

(Bring it home mang)
I'm hitch hikin' on the highway of life
You might see me on the side of the road
(Who knew this nigga could sing?)
I asked the Lord to be my coat and umbrella
'Cause outside it's rainin' cold
It's so cold
It's so cold
It's so cold (America)
It's so cold
I say, Miss America, Land of the Free
You ain't never do nothing for a brotha like me
You sold me a dream of 40 acres and a mule
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had into a pool
You get up on the news, lying about how the levy's broke
Now Weezy lost 2 Jags, and spitta's Chevy broke
Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions
You took everything we had, Uncle Sam, you Satan fan

Shit, I'm in the south where we living in mud puddles
Shit is a drug struggle when you niggas upping prices
I hug the Glock like a turn buckle
Can't get stop by the vices, no license
Rolling like dices on the streets
Where the odds is high
Where the crime is life
And the life is time, and the time is jail
And in the jail you stressin
The judge probably hit me with an algebraic expression
But I get away free like Ocean's Eleven
And I motion the metal, like a pro-fe-ssional
And when I'm rolling especially, like a pimp suppose to
Watch how you sit down somethings in that sofa
If she with me, you know that something's in that ho bra
She's a foreigner so she say coca
I get broke off and they get brok-er
They like so what, i'm like so when?
We going know then how the turn in turn out
Cause we going shoot back till the burners burn out
Till the burning burn down every house the block hold
I'm hollering at you niggas with every shot the Glock hold
You can't see me there's a thousand blind folds
And my mind state is put a thousand on top of those
Chea, I do school and do lunch at Pappadeaux's
They want beef I turn that to that to sloppy joes
Copy cats brrrrrrat, copy those
Had a strong relationship with expensive clothes
This stuntin shit is extensive and intense
Like pulling up in something Americans can't invent
Chea, I make them fall back, they gotta indent
Like a paragraph, the first sentence, shit
I'm way smarter man, I'm more gifted
Straight from the womb to pro, prolific
I'm so, I'm so so, I'm so lifted
High in the sky, me and pops taking pictures
That’s my vision, until my vision is vivid

I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital — Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like C-Y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil' intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission

Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

And I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'

Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin

Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

So sick, need a doc, yes
A creature, monster like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the toc, when I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock, "Give me a sec"
In the middle of the war where my enemy at
I'm running this shit like Eric Bieniemy back
Cause every time I hit a track, I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out, "Where the sympathy at?"
I attack before you begin to react
I'm from the dirt where the Beatles and John Lennon be at
And now these niggas looking yellow like a penalty flag
It's Weezy baby with this hustle 'til infinity, yeah

See, a gangsta like myself? I get that paper and pussy
Then I went and make that pussy bring that paper straight to me, bitch!
You lookin' at a real pimp—ask my old hoes (Yeah)
And they'll tell you, no remote, I control hoes
I'm a whole load—give you that game, mama
If he ain't payin', then he shouldn't be playin’—I’m sayin'
Broke niggas only make jokes, nigga (Ha)
I make more then I can fit in this quote, nigga—
Unquote—come sun-soak with me, bitch
Fly you down here and put you on some South Beach shit (Yeah)
And if you smile at my bitch, I make her smile back (Back)
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”

Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at (Uh-huh), where the cash at (Geah)
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Check, yo, look)
See, that other chick asked that—she said, "Where the cash at?" Rem’ said, "Where the paper, plastic, product, and where the stash at?
Where the keys to the whip and the crib, and where’s the address of—
That bitch that be hidin' shit in her ass-crack?"
Niggas I'm fuckin' call me “baby,” like I'm related to Weezy
Some of 'em call me “R-uh”; none of them call me easy
Found out I'm fuckin' her man—now this bird is callin' me, screamin'
Chicken, wait—bitches I be fryin', they just call me greasy
See, I know he got a main, but I'm cool being the other one
'Cause he can't get tight when he hear I piped another one
I don’t fall in love with them—cum and then I'm done with them
Most they get from me is wet pussy and some bubblegum, but—
This one dude had me laughin' (Haha)
If it's just one thing I can't stand, it's a baggy Magnum
Would've thought somebody threw me a camera the way I caught a flashback
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”

Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at

Hit a boy up, pipe his ass up

Deep in her throat, she want the Boat, all in her guts
Fuckin’ up racks, with the gang, ain’t no switchin’
All of these nats, on my gang, bitch we fishin’
Spendin’ these racks, on my chain, they got willin’

Feelin' like goin' might as well been a Gemini
Fuck a bad bitch in the back of the seminar
Walk around real Royal with it like an Indian
Nigga want beef, no money? Please come again
I don’t understand no bands, I give no beef
Nigga you a clown I can tell cause’ her asscheeks
Bro them smokin big pounds like a sea brief
Talkin’ real slow because the carrots in a nigga teeth
I don’t give a fuck what they sayin if it ain’t guap
Nigga, hate boat, I ain’t even at the top spot
One call, niggas on your head like a dreadlock
Crack through the deadlock, fuckin’ like it’s wet lock
Young money bedrock
Bad bitch freckles on her face like a carrot top (Aye!)
Get your head chopped
Niggas walk around mad? Must be adopted
Opposite of emo, still a hot topic
Cop it, drop it, went out, I rocked it
I’m in the Bentley coupe, swerve like I lost it
I got a check for two million, I flossed it
Didn’t take my diamonds off, jumped in the moshpit
I’m with lil set in the hood, I feel safer
I used to fuck dirty bitches out the Mayfair
Ten chocolate hoes and ten vanilla wafers
Ten unannounced the mixed sprees, scorin’ tho
Put em’ on Molly, got these bitches hoein’
Put em’ on Molly, got these bitches goin’
Put em’ on Molly, get that hoe away
She blowin’ up my phone, asking’ where I’m goin’
Ask her choice of drugs, she say “Coke”
Now this shit snortin’, scorin’ like I’m Jordan
They say “where you been?” Nah, where I’m goin’?
Been in that cut like a bomb, but I’m still here
I watched the game but my vision is still clear
Look in the mirror, my neck, chandelier
Oh, I got a slut, she don’t want to leave
Take care of her fees and she gon’ go HAM
Make sure she ain’t hot like NBA JAM
She can’t be on fire, I read about it in the Esquire
That’s how you bring down the empire
Make sure she clean before she get hired
Fuck her from the back and then she get fired
Fuck that, I’m back in this bitch and I’m here to stay
They didn’t give me credit for my shit
So I get my credit another way
I’m writing this shit for your favourite rapper
Gettin shit gone like a street trapper
They found out it’s me, that’s a knee slapper
Stop doubting me, I get shit done
Stop doubting me, I’m the jump starter
Raise up the guap like a Kickstarter
I want to touch on the Stallion
I just need a second, I’ll hit from the back, boy I know it’s a blessing
Just made a confession, I didn’t mean to do it
But I get into it, I’m really intuitive
All of the moves that I make they be lucrative
I will not liquidate
I’m with this black bitch, thick like a milkshake
Clap like a earthquake
Stop with the rapping, just do it for earths sake
I’m in my bag like a crawfish plate
Stick to the money that shit be my soulmate
Posted with the gang on the block at the home base
I’m gettin head, that shit straight like a front lace

I—I've seen, uh, well, I’ve seen failure a few times
More recently than before actually, you know
It's quite interesting how much more complicated things get when you become, quote-unquote, "Rich and famous"
I say—I say "quote-unquote" because, you know, one man's rich to the next can be a step from poverty
And it’s hard to explain that when you're so narrow-minded, seeing the world with two eyes shut
And I realize that, you know, some people can't feel what they haven't seen
So, there's no point in me trying to explain my troubles, huh
It's not that I don't think that anyone cares
But, I think, like, it's up to me to fix or deal with them, you know?
I kinda look at everything, like, "Well, no matter what, I mean, it could be worse, you know?"
Like, okay, say, say if I lost a finger, I’d be like, "Well, I still have nine"
Or—or even, like, when someone broke into my house I felt like, "Well, I’m certain they needed it more than I did, these things are replaceable, you know?"
It kinda just helps with stress levels to think that way, you know?
Kinda like, uh, "It could be worse, oh, well"
Easier said than done, I'm sure, huh
But, failure?
Oh, man, failure, that took time to understand, you know?
Like, failure doesn’t mean defeat, more so, like, "Try again, shit—shit, try even harder"
Revise your steps and rewrite your future
Failure to me isn't, like, always a negative thing, more so, more so, like, just a way to relook at things

No mistakin’ if I am there, well aware you are always mine
And still you seem so surprised, always gon' be mine

I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away, you drive me crazy, ah

Seven out of seven days I'm needin' you
You bring life to the party
(Ooh, ah-ha, ooh, ah-ha-ha)
Good love feels like butterflies suffocatin' your insides, oh

But I'll be gone, before you wake
Old memories, they start to fade
You'll always get a prayer from me back home
You'll always get love, even when you're dead wrong

Kimmy Blanco, What's up baby?
CT got your back, you know what it is
Shout out to the whole Tri-State
Shout out to all the websites, shout out to all the blogs
Shout out to all the radio stations
Most of all, shout out to the streets

It was love at first sight, everthing was right
I didn't know, him had another life with a kid and wife
And he bought me a ring and he bought us both the same cars
What started out as a simple love affair
Ended with someone inside an electric chair
And the same man that she was in love with's now in love with me
I didn't mean to hurt her, could've been somebody's mom
But she took his heart when, she pulled out that gun
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station

I can't imagine what I'd do if I was in her show
'Cause if he did this to me, I'd probably kill him too
'Cause if he played me for a fool, I'd probably lose my cool
And reach for my firearm
I wish she didn't lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what she was thinking
But I know what she was feeling
And now he's no longer around
I didn't mean to hurt him, could've been somebody's son
But she took his heart when, she pulled out that gun
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
But hear me now

I never thought she'd do it
I never thought she'd do it
I never thought she'd do it
Oh gosh
Why ever do she do it?
Why ever do she do it?
Why ever do she do it?
Why do she pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger? Boom!
And end this, end this life so soon
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger, boom
Now what you gon' do? Me say, what you gon' do?
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam
Me say one man down, oh god
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam
Me say one man down
Now you are a criminal, criminal, criminal
Yes you are a criminal, criminal, criminal
Yes now somebody hold the gun, whilst she run out of town
Before it be another: one man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?

Marciano bra got the titties sittin' right
JT had a sexy track, but it's gon take Lil' Kim to bring sexy back
It's me the trendsetter, 24/7 Star sweater

And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian

Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend

After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck

Can y'all hear me out there?
(And we want everyone in this motherfucker to get up out their seat)
Ladies and gentlemen, without further adieu
(It's our time)
I'd like to introduce to you, my bitch

Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap
I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats
Trying to take my crown, I ain't letting that go down
I cop the four pound and go the whole twelve rounds, yeah
You broke hoes need to throw in the towel
Life's a wheel of fortune and y'all can't buy a vowel
Who me? That's none of your concern
Like ashes in the urn, more money to burn
Damn my ass is firm, stay away from germs
Pussy flawless, get wetter than worms
If you only knew like Aaliyah
How your man be hawking me and stalking me
When he fucking you he see me
Every crack vial or record he sell I get a piecey
Easy, believe me, my words is credible
Ask Nat Cole huh, I'm unforgettable
Don't let the QB get a hold of your guy
Sex him well, get him high, he might fuck around and die

Guys, we seem to be approaching another ship...

What?

Impossible!
How far?

32 kilometers...
Shit... HQ this is pilot Quentin Thomas, accompanied by my first man in charge of infantry William Kai of the Aquarius 3, come in, over...
HQ here. What is it, Thomas?

My program has just informed me and my partner of another ship that’s now 31 kilometers out...

Did you just say another ship?

Yeah, that's what he said!
Another fuckin' ship in the middle of space, man!!

I’ve gathered information from the ship’s motherboard...

Engage the ship!
What?!

Copy!
I’m receiving audio embedded in the ship’s distress signal...

Man—
Why white people always gotta go investigating shit, man?!

Shut up Kai—Thalia, playback message!

You got it...
This is Captain Christopher Smith of the Aquarius 1—the year is 2093—time unknown. The entire crew is dead, and I fear these are my last hours. Whatever you do, do not come knocking—
Aw, hell nah—we gotta get the fuck outta here man!!
HQ, engagement is a no go!

Okay, so what do you think life was like before the fall? I mean we've seen pictures of open land as far as the eye can see and oceans incomprehensible in size that our grandparents would do their best to describe it. I just can't imagine life anywhere but inside a space station. I mean the simple concept of a sky doesn't even fully register...
We do have fields on the Babel station and also—

Yeah, yeah—but that's all synthetic. I mean we're heading to this planet right? That we call "Paradise," because we hope it can sustain life. Why?
Because we'll eventually run out of resources...
Exactly! I mean what if we got there and it's exactly as the data predicted: beautiful, lush—then we destroy it just like we did Earth? There's only 5 million human beings left in the universe. I mean, it's weird to think about the fact that in 2065 the last footprint was left on Earth before ascending to Babel.
Man, what's your point?

The point is, 30 ships have traveled in deep space looking for a planet like this. Damn near all of them return home without any luck! Some of them didn't return at all. I guess my fear isn't that we won't find Paradise: it's that we'll create purgatory...You might also like2Embed

What?

Back then, people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness. Shit we took for granted was obvious; water, food supply. It's insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise. I dunno, I guess that's what I'm looking for...

Then, on the second half, uh, that's where, you know you really get into, uh, just the mental state of a hungry emcee, you know, releasing his first album.

So for me, it was like showing you what can come from the same household. You can go left, or you can go right. I think a lot of people go that traditional route, when you're raised around- um, these things that can touch you. In a negative way, I think. For me I just saw it as a very positive, and decided to do my best not to go down the same route as a lot of my family members, unfortunately. Uh, so this is basically just the story of possibility. Uh, of what can come, and what can happen and my rendition, if you will, of stop the violence, you know, it's also sort of an homage to KRS-One as well, that's why I threw his vocals in there. Um, but yeah, I just wanted people to know what happens where I come from in Maryland, as beautiful as a place it is, its also a dark place, and I think that's everywhere you go in the world. Um, you know, me not going down that route that my brothers did, hence the title "Gang Related," um, and yeah, that's itYou might also likeEmbed


It's weird, even now, recording this for Spotify and the listeners now, like, I-I love Spotify, I've been using Spo- this is where I find all my samples and to think that there's somebody out there, listening to me talk to them, and they want to know about my album; it's very surreal. That's what I believe encompasses, uh, the song, where at least with the song it encompasses, so um... Yeah, just about my travels; from A to B, here to there, and everywhere in between. It was originally going to be called "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," but I went with "Metropolis," the neo-city of the-of the world, if you will, it's definitely filled with my cinematic inspiration, uh, and you can hear it, so yeah, yeah, enjoy itYou might also likeEmbed
It opens up with a skit, and I love Wu-Tang Clan, so I always loved their skits, so it's basically about the first time I ever heard gunshots outside of my window as a little boy. And then it opens up, "Outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin', and the police they rushin', go to my head like concussion" And I'm about fifteen years old at that time, and the gunshots, I still hear them every now and then throughout my life and I'm wondering, I always used to wonder "What caused that shootout?" Why did I hear his? What was it? So I kind of created the fictitious tale of something that was, in fact, a true event. So that goes in, when you first hear me rapping I'm laying in bed at fifteen years old and all the things racing through my mind, from the eviction notice on my door, you know, just being on food stamps and welfare and not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow and just, all the wonders. And then the beat changes up and I actually fall asleep. So this is my inner-most subconscious thoughts that I didn't even realize at the time, at fifteen years old, but now, you know, at twenty-four and looking back, reminiscing, I know that those are the things that are on my mind, because growing up in that situation, no matter what, um, the only time I was special, the only time I was anybody was when I was asleep. When I was asleep I was a famous basketball player, baseball player, I was a rapper/artist, I was a singer, I was an actor, I was dancer, I was an astronaut, but when I woke up I was just a boy from a broken home, and that- that was very hard to swallow
Even touching upon the lines about the television and feeling like that family, you know growing up on The Cosby's  and Family Matters, and you know, that was the closest thing I had to a real family. Once the television program turned off, or our electricity turned off, I snapped back to reality. Um, I didn't end it on a bright note, because there's people out there that feel that same way, so I wanted them to know that I'm with them. And I'm there, and I was there, and I understand, so...You might also like1Embed

This song first came along when uh.. When 6ix, me and 6ix were in the studio, uh, at No I.D.'s spot and.. uh he just did the sample, y'know? He had it.. and I loved it and I couldn't identify it at first. I felt like I knew what it was, but I could not exactly identify it, uh.. and it ended up being this song that um.. No I.D. had sampled for Kanye West's "Bound". And I think it's so incredible how you can sample, y'know.. you give something to ten different producers or rappers and you'll get ten different things and, and, we got something different with this one and for this.. song I wanted it to be extremely musical and beautiful and.. y'know.. it's a very very raw hip-hop album, but.. I wanted to kinda mess people up when they first heard it, um and yeah. So it's just kinda talking about the state of hip-hop and not just hip-hop but music as well and where I see myself and kind of where I fit in to it.. um.. before really beginning to tell my story on the next recordYou might also likeEmbed

Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)
You know my steelo, busting shots like free throws
The young bandido, cutting records like they was kilos, ha
Is it a blessing that I'm messing with girls
That wanna undress in the back of my car, or is it just 'cause I'm a star?
Or is it just 'cause I'm a star?
Five-foot-seven, look like she fell from heaven
With an ass hotter than the devil, please call a reverend
She was black and asian, part Hispanic and part amazing
Women they feen' us, merely because we are the keenest
My heart only has one love like Serena and Venus
You know I am the meanest genius with the biggest (hey!)
See, baby girl, I know you got some problems
Just know I'm here to solve 'em, revolve 'em, cock 'em back and dissolve 'em
I swear I take care of all em' but you gotta trust it
Love it, open your heart before you lust it, now bust it, what

Just another day living in the hood

I would like to make an announcement
To everybody that said I wouldn't amount to anything
In the lines of music
I told you, what did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you?
Cause I told you
Mmhmm
And when did I tell you?
A long time ago
And what did I say?
What happened when I told you?
Exactly what just happened

I love to jump up on the track so poetic
But the champagne I'm sipping got me spitting moetic
The second I aim, I dead it
Now give me the credit
'Cause I envision myself living in wealth
Breakfast at Tiffany's
Lunch at Louis V's
Now excuse me please
I got dinner plans overseas
Killin' with ease

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
La-la-la, la-la, la-la-la

Cruisin' through the borderlands, catch a vibe
Fatherhood my hustle, nowadays I'm makin' music on the side
I confide in the page, weed smoke fill the air like sage
Thirty-two my age, I spot a couple grays
Feel my blood pressure raise
No longer are the days of my childhood
My priority nowadays is makin' sure my wife and my child good
Steppin' to me, I wish you would
Lord of the Rings, my bling shine like Elijah Wood (Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, the lows be low, but the highs be good
Beneath the sheets like an Isley would
I pick up the mic, oh my God, he good
Retired and came back just like they thought he would (Uh-uh)
Feel it and face 'em (Uh-uh)
I'm tryna face it (Uh-uh), the rest is basic, uh (Uh-uh)
Ayo, I want you to play this (Uh-uh) and vibe in the ride (Uh-uh)
I'm finally happy with the man (Uh-uh) on the inside
Full of pride (Uh-uh), full of fear
Been a decade, but I'm here, seein' clear
Different motivations, no longer the people that's up in my ear (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I woke up early on my born day like Nasir in '94 (Ah-ah-ah)
Three-hundred-sixty-five behind me now, plus one more
My physical frame made it beyond what they said it would
My debut album did better than Reddit said it would
Made it out the trap, but I got my gat, yeah, that's a fact
I'm runnin' it back, like, "What's up?"
From the cover of XXL to my moment of clarity (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
As I excel at Madison Square, I swear
The rap game will split your shit like an affair
Prepare for the worst
And this business shit can get grimy, got 'em all behind me
Come now, don't try me, 'cause I'm me, the God
Study bitches like I'm abroad
This is dad music, pick up the pen and know how to use it (Ah-ah-ah)
Plenty responsibility in me, know how to use it
Appreciative for what I got, 'cause people could lose it
Take these lyrics and use it (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Take the heart on my sleeve and transfuse it
I'm bleeding as you listen to what I'm reading (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No longer needing approval and feeding into the vision of the public
I'm above it, used to do it how they did it
'Cause I thought that's how you did it, now I do it 'cause I love it

Depression, anxiety got ahold of me
'Cause people say they want the older me
Well, I'm thirty, this the oldest me
Behold it's me, the piece of shit that's not good enough
Not black enough, not hood enough
Not rich enough, not poor enough
My heart has poured enough
I been beaten and battered, my confidence shattered
Been broken and tattered
I'm constantly second guеssin' if my profession is worth it on my mental state
Writin' this from a dark placе with humility and grace
Peace, love, and positivity was my nativity
But not when socials are in my vicinity
I'm not runnin' from the internet
My god, I was at its birth, I've been a vet
Goin' berserk like Peter down in Initech, yo, ayy
It's deeper than the surface, I'm searchin' for purpose
I'm tired of searchin' for Logic on Google on purpose just to read that I'm worthless
I remember makin' music alone, just a pen and a microphone
But nowadays it's hard to get in the zone
Writin' rhymes was easy before the fame
Now I'm constantly overthinkin' every line, it's a shame
Rap used to fill me with joy, now it's nothin' but pain
I'm stuck in the game, tryna get back from where I came
I write this letter for the person who's listenin'
Fed up and tired of people dismissin' 'em, I'm with you
I been through what you been through
And no amount of money can take away the feelin' of insecurity
Only through maturity can we overcome
Feel like I've been overrun, feel like it's over, I'm done
Whoever told you success gon' make you happy? You been lied to
All of my dreams came true but I bleed and cry too
Never been perfect, I failed every time I tried to
Feelin' hated and underappreciated
Every time I look in the mirror, I wonder, "Why you?"
Shit, I'd love to end this on some positive shit
Hit you with punchlines instead of some derogative shit
But it's okay to be sad sometimes and tired of shit, I guess

Unless they have another thing beyond money, which is called status

In having this thing, and that thing, and the other thing, and having a swimming pool
A, uh, Ferrari, uh, certain kind of clothes and uh, certain kind of house
And so on, and so on, and so on
And we think, uh, we need all that
Because we haven't asked ourselves whether that was what we really wanted
They all think they gotta have this, they gotta have that
And uh, they don't really want it

A hundred miles and running, come on and catch me if you can
Fuck the radio, we do this shit for the fans
Flow sicker than Covid, got 'em throwing up their hands
Black and white like a reservoir dog
Twitch money, I'm the pog
Your shit flawed, ripping through the city of God
When it comes to my pinky ring, it's vintage 80's
I'm the lord of the bling, I can't fuck with you peasants so it's more for the king
Industry too fake, we too real, they don't trust us (First rule)
We see through y'all like Ghostbusters
Got my deal and I moved to LA, that's the west side story
Logic known for staying positive like dads on Maury
A curly headed kid who finally met the world quarry
Everything you talkin' 'bout is straight irrelevant
I'm Korben Dallas, you Ruby Rhod in the Fifth Element
I once was a diamond in the rough

Living in mansions, we used to be hood dwellers

On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders, but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filming this walking project building
Now there's hoes selling holes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest, I'm sitting in my room
As I'm looking out the face, something to write about
I still got some damage from fighting the White House

Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain, slow-motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tip-toe 'round, creeping

You, you, you, you, you, you

All in together, the weather is better than ever
I hope it never ends, I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend that it's
Better than it's ever been
Lie to ourselves

And it's fine if they fell

Said everything's gonna be o-o-okay, just don't breathe the air

He just sits, and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero, they don't love him no more
There's a blast, every time a ten hit's the floor
His gift, for not fighting another man's war
And if they can get their hands on the mask
That he had wore on his face
They can put somebody else in his place, to restore
The state, the illusion that it's safe
The faith, that being a slave is so great
As gas fills the room
And rockets destroy everything around him
He stands to find himself surrounded
By thousands of soldiers that he once trained
To never miss their targets, heartless
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion

Pleased to make your acquaintance, salutations

Till you woozy, let the lyrics subdue you
Massage and soothe you, move you, till conscience lose you
Lu now rules you, do what Lu do and you'll do beautiful

From behind, or in between us

That, mixed with a little bit of pimp and a little bit of mack
And a little bit of limp, and a whole lotta gangsta lean

This ain't my shit, this our shit
Look around what you build and that's great and shape
And you should look inside how you feel
You look and sound like you trill, you look inside for that feel
Or just look and sound how I look and sound
'Cause I look and sound like I kill niggas
And you just gon' have to believe
And babe, I'm 'bout to go to work so these niggas gon' have to leave
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?

She don't want no soft nigga, she just don't want no false nigga
Daddy can be a gangsta, just can't be no lost nigga
If you a senior, be a senior
Don't be runnin' 'round like some frosh niggas
Snapback is great, but you're 'bout to graduate
Take your hat off nigga
Tiger did 'cause Tiger could
But if Tiger couldn't then Tiger wouldn't
That's a billion dollars off golf, nigga
She my fast money, my cash money, take a loss with her
And let's move slow and make a million dollars off cough syrup

I just wanna be here alone, alone

Got an empire, I'm the emperor
Like the cat were, I'll be faster
You're tryin' to add syrup, just to slow me down
But I blow 'em down, like I'm half-were
That's wolf-man, you got a full house
I got a full moon, then I pull out

Lend me your chips, what they took now

And check your shoulder, cause I'll be over

Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective
Chapter 3: Gravy
---Download Complete--- Hmmm looks like I'll be heading upstairs.
The cab stinks. The stale intensity of so many burned out digital cigar cores left to decay on the floor. The acid graffiti. It doesn't fit.
Not fit transport for somebody "Going Upstairs" as they say. We all say that. Some champagne and classical music would be nice.
Maybe a chauffeur would give the trip up top a fancier sentiment. I mean the best of us should travel with a little more class and dignity.
This is like being in a port-o-potty with thrusters. A couple coughs. A well aimed spit. Yeah thats how the "Best Of Us" do it, precisely.
Up through the clouds. Directly into the Moon. We pass through it. It's only a meter thick. So warm. So fake. Color is still wrong to me.
The cab slows to a halt. Border patrol scans the ID tags. All clear. One step down. Disinfection nozzles spray the cab down. Missed a spot.
Step three is up next. Blindness. Total sensory disconnect. 3 seconds. 3 weeks. It's all the same in "non-sense." Helpless. Out of touch.

NH is Downstairs. Can't see it from here. Shit I wouldn't wanna see it either. Most these folks never have. Never will. Where's my devil?
Birthing out of Non-sense mode is always a mellow moment. Has to be or the shock would give you a heart attack. Wish I could smoke here.
Man would you look at that. The real Sun. Son of a bitch. My devil approaches. His name is 11. Mid level manager at a pill manufacturer.
I don't believe him. He's not my devil. Too many questions. He's just checking me out. He knows I know. He changes to his real voice.
All this espionage. Games. The real voice isn't really right either. Neither are the eyes. All tests. The "air" is thick with nano-machines
It's like wading in a pool of thin water. It's what moves things here. A seamless, all encompassing soup of nano-machines & information.
A spoonful of this stuff would sell for millions back Downstairs if we had real sunlight to keep it alive that is. What'd he say???!!!

Adults are responsible for teaching children how to observe the ways of their ancestors. In fact, God insists that adults talk to their children when they sit at home and when they walk along the road. When they lie down, and when they get up. In other words, God is saying, "Don't mess up the children". African American families are being driven further and further apart from each other, to the extent their children, particularly those living in urban neighborhoods, are growing up without the benefit of having adults in whom they can confide. Consequently, African-American cultural values are at risk of being lost, like teaching children to respect their elders and saying "thank you" or "no thank you" and other forms of common courtesy.

Before daybreak there were none
And as it broke there was one
From moon to sun, it goes on and on
The winter battle was won
The summer children were born
And so the story goes on and on
Come on woman in your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are green
From here to eternity
Become a woman in your own time
Far, far, far from the virgin vine
Rise on out from the dead leaves
Come back to me
Oh, she sings her favorite song
Left with tears and dreams, it goes and then on

Standing in line for the new one
Not the black, but the blue one
And I don't even know what it do, son
But Steve Jobs said that it's too fun
Fun in abundance what I need
It's cold out here, put my arms in the sleeves
I'll probably lose my place if I leave
But I really need to pee
If I do it right here they'll see
Makes you wonder, how do snipers
Marathon bikers
Next time: diapers
They say it has all new features
Faster processors and much better speakers
Great for kids, a necessity for teachers
For work or home
A revolutionary way of being alone
I mean, should we really get a loan?
Hey what's the matter, just tell it to your phone
Cupertino heart with Chinese parts
Built by the poor, but designed by the smart
They opening the door so you go
On your mark, get ready, set, buy

But it still ends with a die

From the iClouds, right into the great Wi-Fi

Good thing that God accept cash
Maybe buy my way up out His wrath

Won't discriminate – I’m getting all eight

Built by the poor and designed by the smart
On your mark, get set, cop ‘em!
Imagine a life that revolves around shoppin’
Conspicuous consumption
That means it serves no other function
But to show off to someone, or others
Who only try to show off to you – look at your fellow loyal customers
Isn't harmony great?
Look at all these friends that marketing makes
How many fries can these arteries take?
I'll give McDonald's a little help here
I think they should expand into healthcare
And then you'll have all ends covered
Even make caskets, have it all umbrella'd
Can you make the corporation fear me?
"Couldn't hear your order, can you speak less clearly?"

I get my energy from my inner G

So tell my enemies that they can't injure me
I know that irritates, you have my sympathies
Well you should protest, yeah you should picket me
I'm on a losing strike, I'm on a winning streak
I'm out in left field, I'm speaking mentally
But that's a better place than where the benches be
I'm feeling really good, me and my different beat
Me and my different drummer; he play the timpanis
See that's what got me here, you hearing me
Me on my "black man in the future" shit, call me Billy Dee
See I'm just forward looking, that's how I really see
See while you Valentines, I'm thinking Christmas trees

What am I driving at, I'm trying to drive it home
I'm in the drivers seat, but you can ride along
It's never cyclops, it's never I alone
I'm telling your story wherever I perform
Now if they looking for me, you tell 'em I've gone

Great American Rap, resurrect...
Rest in peace, Young F
'Porting live from the set
Uh
'Porting live from the set, yeah!

First off, say "Peace" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile, suicide bombers
And prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils
They got to, just to stay awake
On the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels, and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism, and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine-stripper mad dash
A friend request, follow, and a hashtag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
'Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillac

Live from the other side, what you see?
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
'Porting live from the other side, what you hear?
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way

And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
'Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death
Live from the other side, what you see?
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
'Porting live from the other side, what you hear?
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way

An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central, an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for "Thriller"
But the U.S. Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege, vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the mid-ler
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…
Live from the other side, what you see?
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
'Porting live from the other side, what you hear?
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way

Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners
Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty
Be it Englewood or Egypt, Bedstuy or Baghdad
Syria or Liberia, the west bank or the west side of Chicago
Where food and liquor stores still occupy the block
While police and community watchmen justify why they shot
Emmit Till and Malice Green, Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin
Better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton
Or whatever they sellin’ in your food desert
Cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed
On the Fox evening news while we sing the blues
The New Jim Crow caged bird sings
Cause he’s tired of occupying his misery and of our marching
He wanna fly to a higher consciousness
But his school on academic probation
They gave him medicine, diagnosed him with a felony and mental retardation
So he refuses to cease the firin’, nobody’s hirin’
In Illinois, 67 is the new age when you retirin’
Class lines have blurred, those who used to have, have not
Pensions bein’ snatched
Those who never have keep their hands stretched
Social services being cut
Sterilization clinics giving out pills to numb the womb
Young girls referring to their vaginas as tombs
Thinkin’ protests are temporary and trendy
Well rock a t-shirt and carry a poster
And two weeks later it’s back to normal
But they say times are changin’
The revolution is becoming second nature, causes are combining
People carrying torches, hope burning from their hands
Attaching explosive devices ‘cause they keep stealing their lands
In the name of freedom
Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners4Embed

From the cocaine and the kilos?
Aiight nigga, we know
Aiight nigga, we know
Can we get a break
From the strippers on the p-ole?
Aiight nigga, we know
Okay nigga, we know

Hey shawty, ain’t no future in no gang bang
And ain’t no manhood in no bang bang
Ain’t no honor cleaning interstates inside a chain gang
Know some rap niggas put that shit inside your mainframe
Pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing
'Raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain
Get yourself a Camry, "nigga said a Camry?"
Watch that hoe depreciate and then you’ll understand me
It’s called being fiscally responsible
Don’t let these lying images up in hip-hop here conquer you
The TV’s not your father, fool, that video’s not your mama
Try your best to be a man and your worst to be a monster

Treat no liar, ital, iyah

I know you’re sayin’, “Lupe rappin’ ‘bout the same shit”
Well, that’s ‘cause ain’t shit changed, bitch

Cause I would hate for you to misrepresent

And by this far I ain’t shocked, upset, or appalled
I’m ashamed, bitch
I can’t listen if you ain’t sayin’ shit
And recognize all this emptiness is dangerous
Ain’t buildin’ up they confidence, we teachin’ ‘em that they ain’t shit
If they ain’t got the latest that they saw on someone famous
Mercy of the Lord on this double-edged sword
Instead of askin’ where the hoes is
Maybe maybe may we have some roses

May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth then, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the downpressed

And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world
Called the president a terrorist
Corporate sponsors like, how the fuck you gon’ embarrass us?
Ain’t my fault, I was just repeatin’ this
Professor Emeritus from America
But my tone was like an Afghani kid without a home
Blew that bitch up with a drone
An Iraqi with no daddy, Palestinian throwing stones
The fuck you think they call him? I’mma leave that all alone
Cause this, the focus on this new shit is that hopeless
Place that I was born into systematic brokeness
Took that downpression and developed it to dopeness
It’s that great American rap-rap ferocious
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world

"Good afternoon, Class of 2010. My name is Jerome Weinberg (ha ha). I'm running for Class President this year, because I believe I can bring positive things to the student body (Wow). My opponent, as you might have already heard, is Mac Miller (Cheah). Now... I know, he's the rapper, he gets all the ladies (Damn right) and he's that popular guy, but do you really want somebody running your school that smokes that much marijuana? Is that safe for your environment here at school? I've been in the bathroom and seen him lighting those Dutch Masters in the stall and that is not cool. So vote for me and not for weed. Thank you.

I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
(Let's go) Check it out
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
(One time, one time) I know you gotta feel this (Your boy Mac)
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
(Let's go)

I pull my hoodie down and take a look around
Sounds that shook a town, man, it feel good to smile
So I shouldn't frown when the night is lookin' down
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the smoothest crook around?
Takin' some dollars and makin' away from Impalas
Shakin' the Jakes 'cause they chasin' the face of a robber
Actin' goofy, absolutely
'Cause my passion suits me, so blast the tunes, please
I see the world with four eyes, hip-hop tour guide
Hear the war cries, rap or die
Wanna get signed, drive a four-door ride
Be more fly, 'til then I'll just soar by with a wave
I'm a bat in the cave
Sit back in the shade when I'm passin' the haze
Misbehave, I'm a trouble-makin' teenager
 to please haters
Seat taker, three-term mayor
Gettin' re-elected just three terms later, uh
I've seen greater days, so let the haters play their game
Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey
The ace of spades can make it's way to save the day
But from the start a club of heart was diamond
Now I'm in Zion flyin' through the skyline
The game on my back, I got five spines
Black cat with nine lives, time flies by
So I got one life to lose it, but how will I use it? Uh
I put it all in the music, 'cause y'all pussy
Fold away before they hand you cards
Broke-ass rapper, now you dancin' with the stars
I'm handlin' these bars like a simple situation
Bassin' on them cats who don't fit in the equation
Patience is a virtue, but fuck it, I want it now
Get my record deal ready, get Diddy up on the dial
Hello. what's up, Puffy? I'm on my grind and hungry
Throw me to the people, they gon' love me, trust me, ha
'Cause these older cats is gettin' a little rusty
It's time for a change like Barack said
And I don't care, hip-hop is not dead
Spit hot lead, but none of these haters get shot dead
They don't bother me, I'll even play 'em for my wife
Kick back, have a laugh while you complain about your life
Grr, you hate Mac and you say you gon' fight
It's all good, bro, you entertainment for tonight
Like I'ma be mad you hatin' 'cause I'm white
Do a lot of cryin', lettin' pain out on the mic
'Cause overall I'm iller than most of y'all, y'all pussy
Never ever goin' for it all, you scared of a little risky coachin' call
What happened? I thought you was a know-it-all?
I stay smokin' well, haze got a potent smell
It take me back to kickin' raps back in show-and-tell
I wanted to show people, all of my bro's peoples
Have a dude come up like "Yo, I know people"
The need for Dead Presidents, this dough evil
So lethal, police'll always try to beat you
Seat you down, try and have you run your mouth
Bring your mother out, "Look what your son is now," haha
See, my mom, she know her son is well
The youngest child, she been through it for a while
9-1-1 on the dial with a smile
'Cause I'm wild, foul child style, haha
Too focused on my grind to ever catch an "F"
My heart in it, down eight with five seconds left
I want the best, won't settle for nothin' less
And I always stay dressed in somethin' fresh
So keep your head on straight and show respect to the game
And that's what this beat messaged my brainYou might also like4Embed

When I was just a little one (Uh-huh), I did sit still once
My cousins used to call me Hit-N-Run
I learned a lot from my homies and a lot from my fam
All my, all my peoples really made me who I am (Yup)
My grandma passed, I was savin' her a dance
I didn’t understand why I never got the chance (Why'd you take her?)
But if it's anything she taught me, never give up
My enemies is waitin’ for a slip-up (Nope)
So when I'm down, I get up (Get up)
Clock is tickin', it's either rap shit or a spot in prison (Uh-uh)

Seats is fillin' up, better find a chair (Find a chair)
Sugar-sweet rhymes from the finest pears
And a lot comin' for me 'cause the grind is there (Uh-huh)
Well, I just had a little piece of mind to share
Face-up on Times Square, it look fine there (Chyeah)

If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin’ of it (And that’s the way it go down)

In a theater near you (The motherfuckin' Jukebox), I’ll be comin' soon (Class Clown comin' soon)
In a theater near you, I'll be comin’ soon (But I'ma get back up into the second verse for y'all)

Aight, what?
There's a lot of speculation on my future as it is
Am I for real or just a can on the computer for the kids? (Uh-huh)
Not a damn thing right now is buzzin' in the biz
In Pittsburgh, "Well, he nothin' next to Wiz"
I address the class with class, a class act, oh
That's Mac, only 'bout the facts
Rap gettin' littered on, I'm pickin' up the trash
And this track gettin' shitted on, spittin' out the ass

Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectatin' 'til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an all-star, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini, speedin', you a golf cart
California dreams, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed

So for ya single, sing a lil' jingle
Then you can stack chips like Pringles (Haha)
It ain't hard, it's easy, it's magic
Dance, do a backflip, make some cool ad-libs (Yeah!)
Once you see that check that you like, say "Fuck it"
And go back to blessin' the mics
It's hip-hop forever, but it's stressin' to fight
And money makes it easier to rest here at night
Hatin' on Soulja Boy? It shouldn't happen
Look at him laughin' (Haha), he know he ain't that good at rappin'
You can hate but it ain't gon' solve shit (Solve shit)
Hip-hop's the culture, it's gon' evolve quick

And big ups to everybody who spit it from the heart (Heart)
You do it for the real and you live for the art (Art)
Sayin', "Hip-hop's dead" is gettin' played out
Everybody just lookin' on how to get they name out
Some shit to dance with? That's what's up too

Young black intelligent, this is not a first
But it feels like it's curse and it weighs like a elephant
Heavy on my mind, 'cause I feel so irrelevant
Heavy on my heart, it's like I'm smart for the hell of it
Heavy on my soul, it's our stroll through the 'ville again
Stranded on this island, feel like I'm Gilligan
Friends got jailed and then they got bailed
Stress that I'm under, I just wonder when they kill again
Please understand that I'm living in the concrete
Jungle where I stumble is the crumble under my feet
In the building lobby, see my man Bobby
Puffing on a joint that's the point where our eyes meet
Asked what's the weight on the books in my knapsack
He's so amused, I'm confused why he asked that
Then I understand the motive and the plan
He's trying to be the man while I stand getting laughed at
Dudes got jokes but very little hopes
That's why they trying to bring me down like a halfback
But I got balanced, my moms made a promise
If I get the grades, I'll be praised like Thomas
Clarence; but I don't know if law's in my future
Cops in the war and they'll sure try to shoot ya
All I wanna do is get a B in geometry
Lose my virginity and live my life drama free; sing

But I'll be free - but I'll be free
So why be I? why be I?

Young Black...

Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your dreams
A dime for your goals and a quarter in your jeans
Trying to make a dollar outta forty-one cents
Caught up in the barbed wire, shorty on the fence
I can be a knife-packing, gun-toting hooligan
But I can't decide so I'm on my way to school again
On my way to duel again, me against the world
But all I can think about is me against a girl
Youthful exuberance, busting at the seams
Look at all the other kids cussing at the deans
Looking at all the other kids cutting 8th period
But I'm on a team and my coach won't hear of it
He's well aware of it, I ain't getting pinched
Y'all dummies go ahead I ain’t getting benched
Whole lot of right and a little bit of wrong
And everything you've worked for? Gone
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I? - why be I?
Why be me? - why be me?
If I fly - if I fly
They gon' see -  they gon' see
I might die - I might die
But I'll be free - but I'll be free
So why be I? why be I?

In this state of emergency and sense of urgency
Just how young is young?
Cause the youth be not youth for long
Young society might be afraid of you
But you continue to be you
We are you, so we feel you
For that those that see you
We salute you
Continue to find like minds, brah
Design your inside, concentration, desire
Dedication, inspiration, perspiration
Is the hard work
Doesn't guarantee anything
But without it, you don't stand a chance

Eh yo, I got to watch my back as I travel through
Rockaway and Livonia, Picken Avenue
Belmont, New Lot, Stone and Saratoga
I just wanna slice the piece and maybe have a soda
But if I try to rock this leather and this nameplate
Like my man Nate I can meet the same fate
He in the wheelchair, knife in the spine man
My friends like: "yo come on, we'll be fine man"
But see this black suede Puma's with the gold stripe
Are hot of the press and yes it's a cold night
The type of night when all coasts seem suspicious
I know we ain't no bitches but these streets are vicious
Bus stops, alleyways and them side blocks
It's the few spots you can wind up in a pine box
Last car of the A train, it ain't sane
Play around, you lay around in great pain
And now the kid ensure like weight gains
Tell me why would you wanna die for a fake chain?
Shit, why you wanna die for a real one?
Cause real bullets they kill when they fly from a real gun
Man I'm a err on the side of caution
Because this stuff my moms bought was a small fortune
For this great advice you gone thank me thoroughly

Being I'm a only child and moms keeps a steady job
I stay fresh to death and yes they ready to rob
These suede Wallabees got 'em on the cheap friend
And my sheepskin same color as a wheat thin
These Cazal frames really are a rare color
But I'm not ready to die like hair color
All I want to do is impress the ladies
Cause this be the eighties and it's wild over here brother
Walk lightly or end up in a fight see
Unless you wanna lose that there, hold it tightly
Since grade school, been fresh from the start dawg
And that makes me a target like a dartboard
So I gotta stay on point like church shoes
And the first rule's watch out for the worst dudes
One false move and moms have to bury me
Try to make it through this maze, Frankie Beverly
Universal ghetto survivors

I first learned what a labyrinth is
In AP class with all the talented kids
This game had a ball and your goal was to get it home
And if it fell in the hole, then you did it wrong
Man, my hood be sort of the same
You can get robbed in the bus, on court or the train
Yup, I'm already stressed, please don't worry me
Labyrinth, this here maze, Frankie Beverly

Being broke in the hood is a curse
Hit the Ave, you know how to fix it

I see these kids, they might wanna jump me
But I'm not gonna show 'em I'm scared
I just know I'mma find me a way out

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
("Hey!")
I'd like to thank you all for joining us this evening
Let me know if y'all with me, y'all
("Hey!")
Just a couple of things I wanna say

I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase:
With more rhymes than there's ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one: Supervillian
He wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor, chillin'
Ready and willin' to inadvertently foil that
Plan of any rhymer, whiner or spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows?
Nobody knows the trouble I see
From the MPV fly dirty tailin' the bubble eye thirty
For the record; this is some shit I just thought of, y'all
Science fiction that's not admissible ("Hey!") in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-D
The only reason I seek to stop—to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks Lex Luthor up in Green Haven
Since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven
Misbehavin' rap stars need Listamint
Call me Mista Bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell—("Hey!")
—tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
'Bout to stop the violence right after these last of three
Shots from the black bat got me at headlock
Holdin' on to sanity, by strands of that dreadlock
She told me, "Get off," I said, "Bitch!
Let me set this shit off so I can get rich right quick"
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga, come out and rock this nation like ("Hey!") ox defacin'
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In this world's strangest, most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife Kinder is in All My Children
Plottin' and it sure to pay ends
With some real mature womens, and some more of they friends ("Hey!")
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of Big Bambú, with natural glue
Who grip necks of Becks to triple X?
He just came in 4-D: Follow the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh, snap!
It seems you walked into a trap, through rap
Zoinks!
This place is filled with pretender willies
One false move, and get broke off like end of Phillies
True believers
Ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh-uh-
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin' off two gages with my cape on wrong
Son, it's on, remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad... Status: Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me, y'all! ("Hey!")
National and geographic down to the titty-bar
Rep Monster Island City, y'all!
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettlin' bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them
Meddlin' kids!

Doom, are you awake?

Yes, but what do you want?

You fool, it's a miracle that you didn't kill Costez as well as yourself. So, before you cause greater harm—

Get out of here! This is just a minor disappointment. I shall overcome it

The failure of DOOM's experiment did not end his tragedy
For a few days later, his bandages were removed

There. Aah! How horrible, that face

What have I done to myself? My face is...hideous! He made me hurry my experiment! Now I must hide my face from all mankind. But he will pay. Oh, how he will pay!

So after his face was ruined, he just seemed to disappear

Why did DOOM threaten just to—

From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete-sword in your hand

More rhymin', pure diamond, tore hymen, poor timing
Raw lining, Paul Simon touring, I'm in
Boring typing, snoring pipe when hyper than four hypemen
Excited writing, trifling times ten
Long stay, songs play, gone haywire, wrong way
On the interstate, integrate all day
It's just a small phase, that's what them all say
Then fall prey in a mini-mall hallway
Meant to be sold, not told to friendly enemies
Remember these intentionally, empathy please
Silent moment, violent prone atonement
Miles a minute on a microphone, own rent, loan spent
No debt, has bet, fast get, cash jet
Master McSmash, Asterix stashed it last
Not least, pass the pot of hot grease
Geese shot, not easily spotted plot, cease snot release
Hold your insulting tongue and mark his words well
Or end up to the curb and shocked by third rail
Get the message by bird mail or turds flail
Villain man, best nerd male you heard wail
An absurd tale of books, nooks and crannies
Before she look, he have his fancy hooks in them granny panties
Or plan B, when in Rome, go back home
And get real dome from a well-known crack gnome
He talk to himself when he need someone to hate on
The black McCain campaign, negative debate-a-thon
Gone wrong on the song
Who's zooming who? Knew it was you, DOOM, all along

What's the hero, who's the villain?
Dead or livin, killed or killin, who the fuck should remain chillin?
(Doom) Webster says, wicked and evil, but yo who's Webster?
Nihilation and outcast, equals freedom that's so fast
Culture in chains, that be the rolls villain plays
All these are just metaphors, they describe symbols in folklore
But who knows why it's like this?
Hero? Hit or old miss? Maybe it's all good
Really of God, but who should, determine the real
Evil, what's the deal
Fools rush in, they don't know the yin, from the yang
And are ashamed to deviate, or act sane
From the norm, they are slaves, forced to conform
To really find your essence, take this as a lesson
Break away from the rest of them
Get from the form ending, like the villain in the song
Find truth, who determines wrong
From right, without a fistfight
Different from day than from night {Operation... Doomsday}
It's just a simple play on words
Delete all these punks ass herbs
Who's the hero, what's the villain?
The question still remains chillin

Who you think I am, but who you want me to be?

When I rock, jock niggas in shellshock
Don’t watch the birdie, watch the clock go tick-tock
I rip shop, I make your girl’s bottom lip drop
Yo, word to the truckers at the pit stop, I’m hip hop
I hold heat, never forget what niggas told me
They showed me other emcees trying to fold me
They owe me, yo, plus them niggas mad slow, G
I got my “Get U Now,” so I’m coming with my homie
Here’s the plan: stick ‘em up, I enter
Through the window, stoop down so we can’t see our crescendo
Pass the indo.  Yo, he used to be our friend though
Yeah, but that’s the reason I don’t really like to lend dough

From the corner, cylindrical triangle hat says “Dunce,” lyrics precise
Like forensical science, leave you entangled for months
Trying to figure who done it, you fronted, got your shit stunted
Didn’t have to be that way.  Some saw the light coming and they shunned it
For the wickedness of those who despise life and worship death
Be a savage, match shit eye-for-eye, tooth-for-tooth, breath-for-breath
In the last days of the countdown, shit is just that drastic
Write journals like Hebrew prophets, study math like an Aztec

The Lobster’s.  I suggest I should dress proper
Copped a buzz, I copped a Dutch, I got a lot of love
With no strings attached

Rhymes, rhymes, rhymes, we got plenty
Dimes, dimes, dimes, too many
Sparked up and chat, you keep counting
I do my thing, jealous niggas keep doubting
Rock ‘n’ roll, lock ‘n’ load
Emcees out for pots of gold, we stop ‘em cold
In their tracks and take all their chipseses
All their DATs, all their bullshit mixeses
Give ‘em credit?  Nah, dead it.  We just
Flip the callisthenic, toss the Andy Pettitte to set it
We grand-slamming and never bystanding
And pussy emcees we abandon
Flew in from Monsta Island just to rag shit with jet lag
With brothers specialized in ways how us not to get bagged
Egads!  I bring confusion like roll call
To emcees so-called, hoes be like, “Yup, I told y’all”
So socialize.  My bio show I dip, dip, dive
Memorize like Iomega zip drive
Go to the bar to drink to get soberer, King Geedorah
Eat the head of a king cobra like Ginkoba

Kong in the cut like cold meat, I hold heat so sweet
Roll deep with no beef.  Those that doze deep
Closed sheets foes chose to speak with.  Reach over
To reload the reef, swift from feet to teeth, keep
Kongcrete parallel to body ‘til the next male
Shotties and hotties still waiting to exhale
Smell the bloodbath when slugs caught, slugs passed
In bloodsport, bugged laugh and bugged thoughts caught
Some eyes, make the K-Slash stagger like a Bocker drinking vodka
Hit note like Sinatra at a opera, drop a flocker
Orville Redenbacher, get you, got you, shot the two L’s
Without the proper for the album’s knocker, hit the liquor
Quicker than a quicker picker-upper girl and
Stick her, I leave more nuts than a Snicker, kick her
To the curb, punk a bitch, stomp a chick
For now call me Kong, Monsta Isle, Monsta Click (Blao!)
Loved not for who you think I am but who you

When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, your ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said "Darling, you was stupid though"

I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes

Emcees out, styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's

He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U
Throwing divine rules to come through
We will overcharge you
And won't feel remorse for shit
Except for once—
Once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits (damn)
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (Who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From niggas with fly names and I.D. questions

Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery, like Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Saw her with her drawers down, caught her
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula, 'dullah
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woolah with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44
Contemplate, meditate, dictate
I direct my direct fate, coming of late
Kurious, can I say, "Shit?"
Do it for Kadi Rock, do it for K.Nit
(RIP)
K-N-I-T, Sub R-O-C

By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame for still bagging 'em, too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys?
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ahk
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan man

And now I seek revenge on the one who forced me to hide behind this mask. Don't move you fools. Within my gauntlet is concealed a most effective weapon!

Why are you smiling?
You see

Now!

That's the end of Doom

I only wish we could be certain of that commissioner

Oh ya? I bet'chu we won't see him again until Doomsday. 
Get it? Doom-Doomsday!

Ya, we get it. Oh Brother!

It's a brand new day, got brand new bitches
Wrapping up chickens, I'm leaning, I feel like I'm fallin'
But really I'm trippin'
Only wear Bally's when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsay
Like I'm a chemist, treat em like dentist
You showing your benjis on Instagram flexing
Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you cause I know its depressing
Must think its a salad the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin' through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
I'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
If a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin' the strap
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin' in my lap

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin' (brrrt-brrrrt)

Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting

They cook it, they whippin', they slavin'
I ride 'round the city screaming "Mama we made it!"
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle

Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle
I'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient
My diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I movin' to Cali
I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
So much gas you'll need a ventilator
My house so big got marijuana acres
Pots and the pans, Quavo the baker, molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'(brrrt-brrrrt)

And all of that, you know, um
We could all stand for goin' under a lil' construction

Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run
For a body - now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'mma put you on
It's all messed up somebody snitchin on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now just stay low
Once in a blue I check to see how you're doin
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin to find who they lookin for but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers, to get they thug on but oh well
Son they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
Oh you heard who did what, no I don't know who did shit!
So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin crazy
From windows, I see lights flashin and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures - you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up your sheet so everybody's pointin fingers
And lyin, aiyyo son, the pressure's risin

The temperature's rising, and it's not surprising (x4)
What up black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops with wings on your back
That snitch nigga - gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide somewhere along the lines your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminisce on how I used to pick you up in the Ac
Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin who snitched it got me losin lots of sleep
At night, you know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops cause that shit ain't right
Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn - why the situation go down like dat?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a - couple of years 'fore we see you around
Butt 'til then maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin for someone to blame
They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out, cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver - me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em
But still...

As a young black teen, every day, I deal
With the pressure and mixed up is how I feel
I walk the streets with a fuck you attitude
And when it comes to my peoples, you ain't half as rude
Follow the crowd or be a leader, take your pick
Now I'm smokin' Buddha, Phillie blunt style
A frustrated and confused young juvenile
Singin' the project blues, so I choose
To take a piece of the action
But my sober state of mind won't let it happen
So 24/7 is the number one stresser
Dealin' with the peer pressure

Most don't understand how it is
In the world of today growin' up as a young black teen
I used to dream, of bein' an architect
Easier said than done, believe me it's hard to get
Out of the projects, without forgettin' where you came from
My parents told me from day one
Finish school and avoid all obstacles
But my environment makes it so impossible
For instance, build a strong social life (Uh-huh)
Without messin' up, still tryin' to live right
Like in junior high, I used to wonder why
Certain females went out with certain guys

Then one day, it all dawned on me, yo
You gotta be down and have it goin' on, see?
I wasn't down with the mainstream or should I say their team, huh
Now I'm gettin' steam
Gotta find a way to get accepted by my peers
So now I'm sippin' on beers
Buyin' new gear, nothin' but the best
Forget Levi's, strictly Polo and Guess
But how would I make the cash?
It gotta be easy and it gotta be fast
Thinkin' to myself "Does that make me lesser?"
Just, dealin' with the peer pressure

Around my way there's a kid that most don't understand
How he lives, is it negative or positive?
He has a grade A average
But when he's on the streets with his friends, he's a savage
A freshman in high school, daily attendant
He never got in trouble, never did he get suspended
Good little Kenny, who would believe?
He dropped out of school to start to smoke weed
I saw the signs but I didn't pay attention
Because he got offended every time that I would mention
The drinkin', the smokin', the low school grades
And sleepin' in class, laid back with his black shades
Nowadays, you catch Kenny hangin' in the hallways
With his crew, findin' more ways
To break out of school and hit the block and get buckwild
Stay out of the way of a mad child
'Cause he's a product of hell
Kenny never fell but he's gonna fall overall
So let's take a trip to the ghetto
Where Kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man, so
He pulled the trigger and the suicide note read:
"I'm glad it's finally over and I'm finally dead
And no more do I have to feel lesser
Or deal with the peer pressure"

To call for it, don't play with my gun, it go off
Inside of your head, oops, niggas be dead

I show you how to do songs, then after that
Show you how to do them contracts and get yours

Cereal in the white box, with powdered milk too
My moms couldn't buy me the shoes I want
We put lay-away on shit that only cost a few bucks
At school, they had Shell Toes, I had Olympians
With the weak ass velcro, looking ridiculous
I knew, way back then, we had to step it up
Cause waiting for the bus in the snow wasn't us
Me and Hav' took the train from Manhattan to Coney
Every day and night, just so we can get our songs done
We had guns, weed, and a couple of fourties
If we got lucky on the way, we could jook someone
We used to watch Video Music Box
And pray maybe one day, we could get a shot

Would they jump in front of me, when them cameras flash

Mobb Deep up in this motherfucker, bring yo' ass in here
Hey yo check it out son, check it out like this

I keep a hammer on my waist 'cause ain't no steppin' to this
Hey yo don't let you be a problem that I'm fiendin' to fix
You peep the grin on my face that mean I'm creepin' on somethin'
Whether a bad bitch, or a nigga that stole somethin'
Call me a old school cat wit aiyyoung mentality
I live by the day and I go out for family
I don't understand language if it ain't talkin' money
From the era walkin' 'round with knots lookin' bummy
Certain bitches knew the code so they went with the flow
And let you know they wanted fifty-four elevens from the door
We cut school, cooked caine, took traum' to the brain
And though a nigga had it, still hopped the fuckin' train
Look back and laugh but ain't shit funny still
My little brother took his life, forever I'm stuck with a ice grill
Got friends with chemical imbalances
And when the love get tough, believe me it's challengin'

You go out for me, I'm goin' out for you
Tough love (tough love)
It's the crew for one, and one for the crew (yeah)

Tough love (tough love)

Bust slugs (bust slugs)

It was one of those days you could smell it was 'bout to rain

Just me and my dun, smokin' the weed
That's when the floor phone rung, "who could this be?" (get back)
"What's good?"
"Yo dun, I got some very bad news"
"Yo who this?"
"Lil' BG from Springfield, and Franny Lou"
"Okay, talk to me"
"Now to make a long story short, Yvesh got bodied at
Precious' party"
"You lyin'"
"That's word to our dead, hear what I said
Now meet me at the rest it's time for get back"
"I'm there"
Dropped off my dun at the Vann's, at Yorke College
Can't believe they killed my man 'Vesh
Why not flip?  somebody gotta pay for this
And we know who did it man it's time for that shit
Go around they way and spray them clips
And watch niggas lay down like naked chicks

You go out for me, I'm goin' out for you

And from birth I was a hustler, no talk I'm buckin ya
No matter if a dime bitch, my nigga bitch ain't fuckin her
Loyalty to the click, forever Mobb 'til I die BITCH
(BEOTCH) Open my casket wide
So you can see how fly, nigga from N.Y. do it
Nigga front on me, and die, so why do it
I swear, feel like I've been here before, my first dealings went raw
And tried to convert it to cash that's pure {*WHOO.. KID*}
We gettin money niggas fingers behind triggers, that go without sayin
Block ain't affiliated we sprayin
And anybody that you see, gettin past us payin
On some "Quiet Storm" shit, motherfucker it's still rainin

To destroy beef, better tell your dawg sit down

Pullin grenade pins on the floor shootin
Murder a human, invadin my space
And do the slip like Thomas Crown, vacate the place
Take your bitch like, Tony Montana or Goldie
Swift with my talk like the serpent did Eve
When my niggas emerge, we intensify things
You can smell it in the air that's the shit, hittin the fan
Niggas gon' feel me when my thing bang
And we continue to party like eternal Sunday

Niggas jealous and hatin on me {"What can I do?"}
When they plottin and schemin on me, the hammer just keep it on me
Fuck the fame and glory {"What can I do?"}
When your shorty gets nasty and horny, she all over me kid
You locked down, doin a bid {"What can I do?"}
With a nigga, tryin to take food off of my plate
And you know I got a kid {"What can I do?"}
When my stomach touchin, ribs showin
You off in the corner glowin {"What can I do?"}
Nothin else, but to take what's yours, convert it to mines
From the cash to the shine {"What can I do?"}
When shit is so fucked up, can't tell wrong from right
Right from wrong {"What can I do?"}
When they say, life is short, to you it's the cash
Todday it's seemin long {"What can I do?"}
Now I try to keep a positive look, my motto to jux
But can't seem to stay focused {"What can I do?"}
They say, an unoccupied mind's the devil's playground
So I sat and wrote this, to kill time {"What can I do?"}

It's not my fault, it's just the game we in
And when you violate codes {"What can I do?"}

Just relax, take out the clip, fix that shit
Put the clip back and keep goin {"What can I do?"}

Yo, it be a buck-fifty, your chance of runnin' is ifitty
Slugs that leave niggas drugged like a chick slipped the Mickey
I'm so on the low, it'd take a Navy Seal to get me
When I surface, if not chips, the vengeance the purpose
On your team I'll pull the curtain, a beautiful hurtin'
'Til my eyes see the blood, that mean the creep start workin'
Niggas never learnin', let they eyes keep lurkin'
Have ya janitor pumpin' your X5 murkin'
Skid marks the street, heart skips a beat
Beef? Nigga, overcook that meat!
Get no sleep, only rest is in between the blink
My life story was written in blood, permanent ink
Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that 'cause forever I be needin' 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes never repeatin' 'em
Some love me, some hate me, bitches in the head beatin' 'em
Niggas wanna ride by the crib all slow
We clap, motherfucker! Want a real rap show?
Fiends are rushin' when the MAC blow, dead in my castle
And in the blink, watch how quick life pass you

What's wrong with motherfuckers? When will they ever learn?
Keep playin' with that fire, and that ass is gettin' burned
Fuckin' with semi-auto's, one foot is in the grave

But wait! You don't think I live a pop life now?
'Cause hey! You could get popped right now
Me don't play, I keep a gun around my way
'Cause I'm a fuckin' drama king like my nigga Kay Slay
Sex, drugs, money and murder all day

Don't even trip, IMD the set I claim
Infamous Mobb Deep, nigga, ready to bang

All they had was your picture at the funeral
No caskets, you bastards be missin'
My jewels, my whip, my rims we bitchin'
My guns be the heat that'll make you blister
My mens, my Timbs'll stomp you niggas
No shit, no clip, don't fuck with us
It's no problem, I bring it to the best of them
From the old to the new and the rest of them
No love, just slugs for ya body, dunn!

Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
Here come the D's, time to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?
Nine pound, we rocked it
'96, strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send .22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one-time

Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better to concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up, you better dead her
I told you, shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind control you, double-edge blow you
In the B-I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
International, you local
Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world and evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop

Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
P.O.W. niggas is found M.I.A.
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long 'cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet is kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb when they see us
I tell you what, black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four-pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds (Nigga)
Live up to my words, if I got beef, niggas comin' in herds (Nigga)
We flush through, your clique get purged (Word up)31Embed
Fresh out the motherfuckin' pack

Special deliver, sendin' shots through your Ac' Vigor
My Infamous Mobb get on they job
The truth gets revealed like we W Fard
Some shiesty New York niggas thirsty for cheddar
You shinin'? You get your jewels taken with your Hill sweater
Keepin' these rap fans like crack fiends
Until we re-up and put more Infamous up on the rap scene
Mix the coke rhymes with beats just like baking soda
Albums is G-packs selling across foreign waters
My Mobb picks is like dime bricks
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit
Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top, kid
And once we all on top, ain't no stoppin' it
I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam
Stupid, a hundred niggas form around me
Like forcefield, pull out and use the gun like shield
The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the hill
Beware of quiet niggas laying in the cut (For what?)
Patiently watching, waiting for a come-up
Get your spot took, we rob land like white man
Plans to overthrow your whole shit while shakin' your hand (Motherfucker)

Start to sticking, strongarm robbery and icepicking
It's sneak vicking, it's cold outside
I think it's past time for me to grab the clapper and take mines
You follow what I'm saying? It's like leading the blind
Trying to voice a clear picture of this life of crime
You slow learners'll understand in due time

Our love combines to form a science, what is this?
I bust her cherry, took her virginity in '91 (Word)
Now that she's open, everybody want to tap somethin'
Go get your own, don't make me have to fuckin' clap somethin'
I love my shorty more than life, now ain't that somethin'?
To love you, Dainy, more than livin' itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up, they tell me, "Put her back on the shelf"
They say, "Yo, P! She only wants you for one thing — that's your wealth"
But I don't pay attention, 'cause she's my baby, the Dainy
You know she drive me crazy, she's my number one lady
Met her back in '89, now she's 22, actin' like she 40 (Word)
She said "All I need is a man to support me
Besides, you from the 41st side of things (Uhh)
And Queensbridge niggas be actin' like they kings
Pushin' Lexuses, wearin' fat diamond rings"
My cellular phone reigns supreme, international, think rational
The 12th Street crew — move back when we come through!

Tommy Hil' was my nigga, and others couldn't figure
How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor
Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said a Brinks is comin' through, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Of motherfuckers, who ain't goin' out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
"Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers"
Diesel drove the the Bimmer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's actin' bolo, tryin' to say he the Boss
I said shut the fuck up! (Nahmean?) The kid is out with the loot sack (Word)

Threw them shits up in the trunk, now we up out here
Got back to the mansion to divvy up the paper
Helly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not! And Guess was hot, so guess what? (What?)
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut!
When you play with crime, sometimes it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceivin' to the eye
The end situation could leave your ass fried (Yo, a-yo)
That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by
(Yo, bring that Dainy home)

My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now, Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip, I thought the bitch was a fuckin' warlock
The more she started givin' me, the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew, then she started gettin' jealous
Steamed 'cause I spent more C.R.E.A.M. with the fellas
"Fuck them niggas! Spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy"
Then I thought to myself, "Yo, this trick is right!"
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggas started riffin', "Why you trickin'? Yo, this shit must stop!"
Moms like "You need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day"
But never that, I got the shakes so I need that
Son call me stressed out, I just be that
But when it comes to Henn Rock, dunn, I need that
She's my shorty for life, so fuck the feedback
I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's lost its brain
I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain

To all the brothers who ain't here
Pour a little somethin' on the floor
Time to get a little bent, do our thing
Word up! The 41st side of Queens gettin' bent, know what I mean?
It's an everyday thing
Henny got my mind in a headlock, Dainy got me goin' crazy
Dainy take me away, Dainy take me away28Embed

Yo, son, word is bond, dunn
Sometimes, I wish I had three different faces
I'm goin' to court for three cases in three places
One in Queens, Manhattan, one in Brooklyn
The way things is lookin', I'ma see central bookings
Facin' three 3-to-9's is mad time
After ran concurrent for assault and 2-9's
I gotta maintain, 'cause stress on the brain
Can lead to a motherfuckin' suicide thang
And plus my probation, a ill violation
How the fuck did I get in this tight situation?
I'm goin' all out, you know? Moves I never fake
And fuck the jake! They can catch me at my wake
And if I die, burn a bag of blade
Put the lye in the air, sometimes I just don't care

Son, I got plans, power movements, get on some rude shit
I keep livin' like this, I might lose it
My man's comin' home from doin' long-ass bids
What up, Kiko? I ain't seen your ass since we was kids
It's all strange; my niggas locked down thinkin' long range
And see their names in the Daily News, third page
They sent a kite to my nigga Killa
It only took one sword to put seven holes in his squealer
A 3-to-9 spendin' most of his time inside the bing
Reclined, and still came home with his shineYou might also like13Embed

Shit is real, kid, word up! (Know what I'm sayin'?)
(Shit is definitely real, boy!)
Yeah! We tryna get this loot any way, man!

A-yo, Queens get the money, long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle where the guns go blast!
The fool retaliated, so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now, who the fuck you think is livin' to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said, "Queens niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine, kid, stay outta my way"
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
But can't stop 'til I'm eatin' off a platinum plate
Po-po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever, but they can't deflate me
'Cause havin' cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to have no money to live with
I pause, step back, look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love, it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helpin' ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, plus a cellular

To the death of me, come and test me
Trust me, nigga can't touch me if he snuffed me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, 'cause I'mma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born wit' it, I'm gettin' on wit' it
And I'mma have it 'til I'm fuckin' dead and gone wit' it!
'Cause I'm a what?! Composer of hardcore, a lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, 'cause I'm a wild motherfucker!
You know I flow, you know my steelo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my P.O
Jump out my hooptie
Pass my gat and my lucci to my shorty, in case my P.O. try to troop me
To the Island, and if I start wildin'
Flippin' on niggas walkin' around with the nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped, see?
Back to Queens, pumpin' the fiends, makin' more C.R.E.A.M
Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya! Pull out my fo'-fo' and bust ya!

Yo, ain't no time for fakin' jax
'Cause brothers that fake jax get laid on they backs
The streets is real, can't roll without steel
I feel how I feel 'cause I was born to kill
Do what I gotta to eat a decent meal, brothers is starvin'
Don't try to find a job, son, it's all about robbin'
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown, dude!
Off the map, 'cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealin', only mess with shorties that's appealin'
I'm frontin' on the world once I start 4-wheelin'
'Cause back on the 41st Side, we do it right
Sippin' E&J, gettin' bent all night
Yo, who that?! I never seen him in my whole life
Step to his business 'cause it's only right
Po-po ain't around, so I grab my pound
Money retaliated, so I hit the ground
My life is on the line, gotta hold my projects down
Can't see myself gettin' bodied by a clown
Ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest, now he's layin' man down
Jetted up from under the benches, I started hearin' sirens
I stopped firin', to cut ass like a diamond
Jetted to the crib piece, what a relief
Stashed the heat, then proceeded to peep
Out the window, called my son, "Yo, son, we got beef!"
But no question, money had a problem so I solved him
I got my mind on a stick-up, now it's time to get paid
Thinkin' of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Gimme yours or get laid!
Give up the goods or get sprayed!

I got lots of love, for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them outta-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up!
Caught up in the crossfire, get theyself hurt up
While I be sippin' gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th Street, my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real, but you nameless
First of all, slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nothin' to play with
No jokes, no games, kid
For years, I been doin' the same shit
Just, drinkin' liquor, doin' bids
Extortin' crack heads, and stickin' up the stick-up kids!26Embed
You know what I'm sayin'?
I wanna say what's up to my man Louie — you know he's still here
Drop this one for you, you know?
And for those who don't know — The 41st Side

I keep it real, pack steel like my man YG
When a fool try to play me, wet him up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy, kid
Ran? I never did
Forever wildin', that's how we live up in the 'Bridge
You just sit scared
Cock back the Gat, then hit a nigga like a bid
25? Nah, kid, you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell, niggas is trife!
It's the semi-auto, you can bring it on, yo
I'm pullin' out, strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick, the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique, and get vic!
I'm on some bullshit, that's how I was raised, G
Each level is a stage
Have you slidin' down blazin', pools of alcohol
Walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this, you gonna take a fall
The Infamous Queensbridge — we on the scene, kid!
Creepin' on those who caught sleepin' — don't ever do that
I run with two MAC's, and plus my crew backs my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Dainy
Obey me, or get sprayed with the sweeper
'Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters and big heaters
Blow you three times, leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you, I know how to fix you
Pretty-boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue!
Word to my unborn — you get scolded, old and molded
When I get bent, you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get 'cross
Put you right on your back, take it to the source
No doubt, I'm stuck and I can't get out of this lifestyle
The 41st Side — get bent, run wild!
The 41st Side, too, you know how we do
Violate, motherfucker, I'mma see you
With the Linden, it's the start of your endin'
Settin' it again and again!

Let me start from the beginnin', at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav? Situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya
And leave your corpse for the cops to discover
While I be pimpin' in the Range Rover, all jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryna knock me and lock me
But I be on the low sippin' Asti Spumante
Niggas tried to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack — it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep lettin' them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm outta town, one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours, and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps? I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children, make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile, but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus, the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket, hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter-soft leather upholstery
But mostly, keep the gat closely 'cause niggas wanna toast me

A-yo, I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences

So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, 'cause everythin' is real
Cuz, I wanna chill, laid up in a Jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly, with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught, dead up in New York
My brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost, never found again, my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last restin' place'll be a ditch, kid!
No one can stop me — try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me? You're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably

500 SL green, '95 nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor-made ostrich, Chanel for my woman friend
Murderin', numbers on your head while I'm burglarin'
Shank is servin' 'em
What's up to all my niggas swervin' in New York metropolis
The 'Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watchin' us
Mad man, my sanity is goin' like a hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced tryna bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you
Niggas who could've killed you is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar movin' on your weak production
Pumpin' corruption in the third world, we just bustin'!

Hold up and analyze — the wild cats sling cracks, they swing in Ac's
The new routines be my eyes
Blacks playin' corners, glancin' all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane, right?
Word, yo, I wanna get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front, you go
Sip beers — the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin and Queensbridge — we robbin' niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale, but the real, we still kill!

Living like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothing changed but the clothes that my money bring
I'm Making figures that I never thought was possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of Tec-xuses and the Mac-uras
Kid you'll get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been trying to blow for years
Getting bent off Moët, spending a G on beers
Living life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet
Til the coke oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you looking, you can find me rising to the top
I'm a classic, approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic
Im trying to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team died

While the rest still living steady telling me lies

Now, '94 to '95, innocent without crime...
(Drop that shit) Yeah, yeah, check it out
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24-7, mac 11 is my people
So why do you wanna end your little life like this?
Cause now you've bump heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive
The last night, damn right, I ain't tryin' to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond
Check it out, now
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you
Check it out, Check it out, Check it out, now
Check it out, Check it out, Check it out, now
Check it out, Check it out, Check it out, now

Fuck where you're at kid, it's where you're from
Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'm a test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way you beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30, Cause I'm -
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you
Straight up and down, Imma let you know now
You feel the gunshot bloaw from the Red Eye style
Now pass the owl and let me roll the method
Shit’s hectic while I’m cested, where’s the mic? Let me wreck it, check it
My rugged rhyme, lyrical design hit your spine
Every time that the Red Eye shine
Blinds the naked eye cause they can’t see through
The smoked screen behind the scene stands the Red Eye crew
Now it’s true, my spiritual comes through my physical
Both connected by the method, therefore I’m lyrical
So what you gonna down I come to pursue
With my Tec 22 and infra red on you?
For real, my laser beam likes to see when I squeeze
I’m like a sniper when I strike you, steady busting from trees
MCs, you know my steez, I’m living trifle with the rifle
Punks I make them stifle feed they ass to my disciples

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I trying to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shortie's out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that one eighteen tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
And it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack macs
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and I need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze...You might also like1Embed
It's just another day, drowning my troubles with a forty
That's when I got the call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, "Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower"
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
Cause this bitch ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
So we take the gats for precautions
Plus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental
I put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity to reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs then froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, "Eyes open cause it might go down"
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see, we
Jetted thru Marcy cause D's ain't bagging me
Word Son, they got us on the run, dun, see yo
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
The trife life got me livin' like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt so
What can kill you is what you don't know

OK check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the Bridge
You ain't really sweating it, cause little do you know
The niggas in the Bridge be setting it
You thought you was safe and tried to walk the back streets without heat
On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck
The side where if you come through fronting, kid you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide, no days
Son get the heat, cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo if that nigga front, yo hit him!)
Aight bet, so just hold me down
While I cock back the long three-pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprised
"What's goin' on?", as I reply
"Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide"
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that we're juxing, if you got what we like you gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making cheese by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessey, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me but never ever find shit
It's the every day, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, move ki's
But all the bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger if the drama appears
Cause a nigga's worst enemy is fear
So yo....
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
The trife life got me thinkin' like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt so
What can kill you is what you don't know
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
The trife life got me thinkin' like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt so

Look here see, Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal
Found the body dead in the isles
Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad
Guess they'll never play it again Sam
Damn that was my jam, now she's on the lam
She made it out with 200 grand, what a scam
While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
"He said one glance is all it took ya, she's a real looker
They say her old mans a bootlegger
Transporting in any weather and at this rate we'll never get her"
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's getting me tight
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party, "What are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang."
It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said "See you later."
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck
Behind the street lamp was a silhouette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke, says, "The devil got you guys by the throat
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
That's the reason why Eric B. is not president."

She says, "Walk this way, I'll tell you a children's story."
We hit the bodega got her a few 40's
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy
The truth came out as we got to her suave house
Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said, "It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady?" She says, "Bill Gates."
What are ya born '77 or '78?
She says, "Nah it goes way to an earlier date
Slave times," claims the slaves said rhymes
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive
Who? "Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave
The Bronx.", now she shows me the cash
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt
She said Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc
Ah-ha!
Ah-ha!

Listen up sweetheart now we gettin somewhere
As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air
But before she dropped the money bag on the floor and died
She said if you really love me I'll come back alive7Embed

Life
I wonder.. will it take me under?
I don't know
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked
Evidently, it's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing ya clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"

If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be: Paradise life, relaxing
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six-digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa!
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land

You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait! I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit!
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!

Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip from the paparazzi
Still playing numbers you can't stop me
Still wearing bundles, and spark weed

Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef
So lead by example or get trampled

And now, ladies and gentlemen and boxing fans joining us around the world.  IT'S SHOWTIME!
Verse 1:
Spirit of the streets
Walks in the ring
From Brownsville to spar fit
To boxing king
Man or machine, an animal
Physical strength and intelligence
But that type of intellect
Y'all respect
To connect those punches
Still as a kid he stole lunches
To mak'in millions and the hundreds
Chaotic conscience
The rage, the stage, the grander
Had to endorse slander
Took it like a man
Cause the mighty stand alone
In the bigger ring hole
The penitentiary
Barbed wire and stone was amp up
They locked a champ up
Even my brains in handcuff
The robin hood, seasonal santa
And y'all give him nothin to begin with
Dilapidated buildings
The drug epidemics
Historical stories
Pain, love and glory
Mike Tyson
Never see another like him

Designer jewels and diamond
A modern day Jack Johnson
Flying private jets and fully protect'in
Automized with ladies Godiva complexions
Lots of sex'in
Hung with a lot of stars
Learned a lot of lessons
Between dead homies and best friends
And getting domed out in stretch Benz
Educated from the hood and pestilence
The dead presidents don't see your pockets
You just gett'in
You got a full court press for them
Benjamins, I've seen money be the death of men

Only the strong survive

Acknowledgements: first off I wanna thank God
And I wanna thank everybody for helping me out with this
Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1

January 28, 1968
Born into this world, William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch, Long Island
Scientific rhyming invented a new style when
He met with Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene 1986, with clap to this
'87 dropped a classic disc
The facts is the tracklist was like full
The vocals, the beats, according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative
This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock
Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearing Kurtis Blow saying
"It can't get better than this"
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits
From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan Smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap
18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre
Supreme, Rap and the 50 that don't rap
Fort Greene, Queens, Strong Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn
With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote
"Smack me and I smack you back"
Sounded like the answer to the "I Ain't No Joke" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzing from Wyandanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot
At sixteen when I met Freddie Foxxx
Toting burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How has Rakim's flow made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one
Before similar voices were King Sun
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, son was watching him, mesmerized
Respect, not jocking him, was so amazing, besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

Yo, my man was regulatin' on niggas he used to thug with
Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin'
Drivin' they cars, robbin connects
Drivin' his Lex, keys was movin'
Young don, now they know they weakness
They never seen it comin'
Son was on some real take over the streets shit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin' now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?

Dudes be, comin' from bids thinkin shit is different
'Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin' my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin' real loves stories like
Caesar and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
'Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin' to later hours, only
Fuckin' with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you
We converse on the state of hip hop
We share the same views and feelings
He sling 'caine, crib costin' 2 million
He plan to leave the streets forever
But niggas that wanted him left him
Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell himYou might also likeEmbed
I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey
A mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out

I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things
Kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks
Missionaries pass out papers that read "Love God"
I see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thug's face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro
Sixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where it sets at
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his asthma's flarin'
Smokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin'
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
I give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years
I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion

I pass 'em to my niggas, come on (Uh-huh)

Zoom, from outer space he comes
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin' they gums, do he be clappin' and shootin' guys?
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized?
What is his race, nation, or creed?
Is he Arabic, Black, Latin, Asian? They read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy
September '73, up in these wild streets
Fuckin' these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (Goddamn)

Only way you die if it's meant to be

Like we came to fix the sink, my kind of war
Death angels coming for you
Spirit horse runnin' from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2
Paramedics fightin' for you, who's gon' win?
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine?
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake
Walk by your casket, spit in your face

Pardon but I gotta question of life now
Look at the nigga next to you right now
Is he real, fake or scared?
Do it like this, niggas, right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now let's say it all together, let the ceremony start
"I shall stay real, stay true, stay holdin' figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never cooperate with the law
Never snake me, I'll always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death, I swear"
I swear that's how we pledge allegiance to the alliance
Of underworlds, killers and thugs, though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green (Uh-huh)
And pass it around, just pass it around
Now tell me, what y'all smokin'?
What kinda heat y'all holdin'?
Well, is your creep move potent?

Uh, you know
I still run with that, that blood of a slave, boilin' in my veins
It's just hot, until a nigga can't take it no more
Blood of a slave, heart of a King, turn my voice up

Ayo, the brother's Stillmatic
I crawled up out of that grave, wipin' the dirt, cleanin' my shirt
They thought I'd make another Illmatic
But it's always forward I'm movin'
Never backwards, stupid, here's another classic
C-notes is fallin' from the sky, by now the credits roll
They're starrin' Nas, executive poet, produced, directed by
The Kid slash Escobar, narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to survive
The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin' the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin', soft in the background
Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door, all of us poor
I learned the difference 'tween the snitches
The real ones, and who's soft, and the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumpin' from roofs
Shotguns pumpin', made it through my youth
Walkin' very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walkin' through the hot desert searchin' to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning, nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in The Matrix
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan, it's the rap–repo man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real
Professional stick-up kids dreamin' for mils
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From Crips to Pirus, this is survival

We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, cooling off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level
It's not unusual
To see photos of dead homies funerals
Aluminum foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigga's paid, ancestry of slaves
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, wear Timbs on every scene

Do I mean it like a slave master, nigga?
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes
Take off the bracelets
Savage when broke, smoke sour diesel, need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Thought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a gross sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peeping us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreaming of
Between cutting hard coke with new razors slicing my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringing us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistakes, trying to get it like Medellin

My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain't just rapping for fame
I got my old homie's half-sister father asking for chains
Yep, I give the cash up, this paper don't matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They calling it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You'll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let's keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are

The white power structure of today is just as much interested in perpetuating slavery
As the white power structure was 100 years ago
Only now they use modern methods of doing so
And, uh…

White folks made up nigga and don't want me to say it
Ain't that a bitch?
You made it up, you shouldn't have made it up!
You done fucked up, you shouldn't have made up nigga
And you made up a song to go with it
Please don't make me sing the song
Eenie meenie minie
You know the god damn song I'm talking about
And you change the words when you see black folks

This is my opening scripture - I've been preparing this album
My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satan's bombarding me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not Bathing Apes
But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty
This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defending Vick, and free that nigga T.I.P
I'd take the grave or a bid
Then let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's going to church
Plants packs on the man that's going to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruiting all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar a racist

Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

Ten truck, pineapple vodka, then I spray choppers
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me
 then paged me, boy  suits with Adam Stacy
Cigar like Dick Tracy, it's dark I get spacey
Alcohol and laced weed, that was part of my '80s
Them Cartier consigliere's,  me
Canary  in my pink 
Liz Taylor tried to  me
'cause I keep it green like the other side of Bill Bixby (Don't stop)
When he gets mean, think fast 'fore I blast hoes like Grassy Knoll
Went from scraggly old clothes
To the illest fashion of realest rappin'

What up, kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came, you should have slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flipping, talking 'bout he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove, one what? (One love)

One love, one love, one love, one love, one love

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurting something, word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'mma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wilding on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your ma duke's loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home he'll play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad
For the weekend, hittin L's while I'm sleeping
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but shorty doo-wop
Rolling two phillies together in the Bridge, we called 'em oo-wops
He said "Nas, niggas caught me busting off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black trey-deuce"
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was 'sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the Mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'm ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love, one love

Oh, One Love, means keepin' it real
For the brothers that's locked down
Keep that one love
For the brothers out in the East
Keep that one love
For all the brothers uptown
Keep that one love
For all the brothers in jail
Keep that one love
One love means keepin' it real
One Love, One Love
One love means keepin' it real4Embed
Visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 percenters
But somethin' musta got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some rest in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough, so
Until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers, will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go

You gotta get the ground beneath your feet partner
Get the wind behind your back
Ride the blades of Glory if you got to
Otherwise you ain't shit
You might as well be (?) your damn self

I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels, and rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now I think about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of saying "fuck tomorrow"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Times is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
I Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage


Yea, you know the flavor, Nas and AZ on the remix joint
This is another explosion from the Arsenal

You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

Whose world is this?

Everybody's not gon’ get you but keep going
I be cruising 40,000 feet like I'm a Boeing
Doubting me, they said I would have no longevity
Instead I'm steadily repping these fundamentals
I assemble these sentences
’Cause someone said that I've been unadventurous
I've been uninterested, learning life is what matters
Chill, I'm the humble bragger
I could son a rapper, every one of you rappers
Vámonos, I be running you rappers
Adios, I don't see none of you rappers
All of y'all under me rappers
I need to golf, need a day to relax
Get a massage, Al Jarreau on the track
Al Jarreau of rap, made the Mets hat
More famous than Strawberry, y'all know this already

Here's our symphony
A measure by measure, a pleasure of harmony, melody

I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strapped
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' match, from craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace, God!) Peace, God! Now the shit is explained

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God
Check the prognosis — is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin' — some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say "Peace!"
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

Success pays for niggas that wanna kill us
My best days is memories with my niggas

I’m fly till I die, my S Dome’s my propeller
And come to California for the women and the weather
But it ain't no tellin' what these boys don't sell ya
And last year I was considered a failure, but this year I'm gettin' money by the millions
Bitch nigga remember what I tried to tell ya, I tried to tell ya, I tried to tell ya that

Somewhere in between us it's attraction and I see that
You make me wanna make you tat my name up on your cleavage

Black .40 was my pillow, every night I go to sleep
Grown niggas treat me like they OG
Holdin' on to every word that the tiny loc speaks
I had a vision that nobody else could see
Sold my shit to D-Mac, a little less than 10 Gs
Brought my grocery bag of cash back to Blacc Sam
He matched a nigga, next day we went to Sam Ash
We bought a Pro Tools and a microphone
Studio was far from plush but them lights was on

Was a charismatic nigga, I don't play as much

School pictures crackin' smiles, now my face is stuck
Shell shocked to see how much they really hated us
Couldn't keep a kind heart, get yo' hatred up
Streets smarts, nigga, get yo information up
Watching Belly, smokin blunts, take Jamaican puffs
One day I'ma have a house and car like Jamaican cuz
Credits roll, back to stress pound breakin' up
Had to fight before we hustled, and it made us tough
Early '90s, neighbor's rooster used to wake us up
Mama had a bucket and a shack but we ain't make a fuss

We still them same niggas that we used to be
Blacc Sam in that sedan in the coupe is me
Hundred thousand for the car so the roof was free
While I'm in it flashback on how it used to be
Wildin', nigga, can't relax, it was the youth of me
That make a smoker buy the bullets for a shooting spree
Found myself, same time family losing me
But all that violence from the past is what produced a G
All the real L.A. niggas know the truth is me
No hotline, homie, I could tell your future free
Get on your Marathon 'til you bruise ya feet
Or run the streets 'til the reverend write ya eulogy
Fishbowl in the six with all my jewelry
'Cause I heard my haters is supposed to be shooting me
I'll never let a broke bitch influence me
Slauson Ave, getting money and the proof is me

'Cause I tell everybody all the time
Own your masters, own your catalog
Can't none of these niggas say they own their masters and their catalog
If they do, they're lying to you
Or they gon' say own some of it or they gon' buy it back
All that is bullshit
Just had to get our little thing together
We picked up distribution
Now we're strong, now we're legit, naw'mean
And we're a force to be reckoned with right now, word up11Embed
Turn me up some
Nips! Let's hustle

Thug! Sip on Actavis

Told me, "Past the blunt, you always tryna neck this shit

Bitches pullin' up we like a hundred somethin' thick
Dice game crackin', threw a hundred licks
Now a nigga gotta talk my shit
When I was lookin' for a pot to piss
Posted on the block with all my Crips
Thought a hundred racks was gettin' rich
Risk a hundred years to hit a lick
They said it take patience to get rich
But I always knew one day I would do it big, then I did

Look, picture me rollin', tippin' my chaueffer
Niggas look jealous, you gotta control it
Reachin' my quota, mixin' my soda
Feeling connected to God, tryna' get closer
Steppin' on roaches
Me and my locsters
Just tryna get over, tryna not get swallowed by locusts
Tryna' to stay focus, kinda like Moses
Like somebody chose us, this weight on my shoulder
I feel these emotions, but still I keep going
A pen to a poet
I been through the motions
I’m feeling heroic
But life is a dice game
And they dare you to blow it
You might get a stripe man, but that ain't gon' pay for the strollers
It's never enough to console her
Telling your daddy's a soldier
She needs you right now in this moment
Not dead on your back pushing roses
To me I'm just carving this sculpture
Fine-tuning my approaches
Doubling back as a owner
The moment of truth is upon us
Call the promoters

Black Sam would tell me, "poke your chest out, nigga"
I could die today I've made the set proud, nigga
And I could fly away, but I respect vows, nigga
Used to always say I'd make the whole world feel this
Now I'm on the tour around the whole world, nigga
Paparazzi waitin' at my hotel, nigga
Smokin' while I'm drivin' that's with no L's, nigga

Princess cut diamonds up in your grill, nigga
Now smile in every camera and show you're a trill nigga
You feed 'em what you want cause that's your kill, nigga

You shellshocked, but ain't no tears involved
Accept it all, that's how the world revolve
Every 12 months you live another year you ball
Hindsight, it's 20-20 that was really God
Cause lookin' back it' ain't no reason why we ain't get caught
Mission after mission, we was trippin'
Me and Baby Bolt Da Fatts in Lil Killa Dave's kitchen
Police in the front, pistols in the court
When it hit the fan you get to find out who you are
Nervous as a bitch, was sweat drippin' down my palms
And think through it, thug, you got to stay calm

I don't stress out, nigga
Poke my chest out, nigga
Weight on my shoulder, bring the best out, nigga
Get it right or you get left out, nigga

Almost didn't make it cause the set foul, nigga
Shit'll chip you quicker than the West now, nigga
Lock you up in cages, how it went down, nigga
Ship you out of town, you need to pen pal, nigga
Plenty times I've felt like this the end now, nigga

From around the way, they know my name
They know how I get down and play
Around the hood, I afford dangles all day
And make my cheese check traps in every way
The mind I'm in when I'm coming through spinning
In it to win it, tryna make a million by dinner
Like my nigga the set dribble off the bg
You know the block, Ricky hot, shots pop
Niggas getting off them rocks
I won't say the name but niggas holding down the block
Nigga, my cast, I dropped out of class
Wasn't paying no attention, I wasn't listening
I was thinking of the plots with me and my henchmen
Let's go out on the block and try to get it hot
I really don't, keep it cool, keep it cold
Under rocks 'cause I'm not trying to be trapped
Deep in the country or the peninentery, you telling me
Used to have to work under my hood or under my tongue
Our kids are ready, I felt wrong
I wonder why, I made all my dollars fucking other cousinsYou might also likeEmbed

Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib

Girl, why you think it's a hole in your mouth?
And don't try to flip the question, I don't go down south
But I could, show you the bounce
I could show you how to flip that ounce
Tuck it in your purse and cover your blouse
Set up shop, bring the work up in your house
Really show you what this hustle about
That's if you game for it
You in the club, what you came for?
To meet a baller with a car and get all your drinks paid for?
You and your girlfriend with your French tip
And the MAC lipstick, and the black Baby Phat fit
Knowin' that your ass and tits
Is enough to have most niggas blind about the cash they spent
But not Nipsey, you can't knock Nip's hustle
Convince you I love until I got a limp muscle
I flip ruffles until my chips double

And stay all off and in between 'em
Cough when you hit the green, huh

Relationships, is full of headaches and heartbreaks

You sold me a dream when you said you’d take me off of the block
I never aksed but you offered a lot
So I ate it all up cuz I liked the way you hit my spot
And like a bitch I caught feelings for you
Wanted to marry you, probably have a baby or two
And that’s my word

But hol' up
I’m feelin' you too but slow up
You said it's a dream I sold you but so what?
With so much, time invested with yo' ex, it’s
Hard to trust you, regardless of the
Way, you make me feel when we chill undercover
Still, I'm 'bout buildin' not tryna' fill up rubbers
When I tell you the real, you just tell me you love me
And that you hate me for the same reason you want me
Say you jealous of the blunts and the block and the bitches

But how you think I keep O's in the sofa
How you think we blow smoke when we rollin'
Stay fresh, gold on my chest, not stolen
I gotta grind, a lot a mind, got a lot a time
I was preoccupied, you not satisfied
You emotional, I was tryna' stroke a hoe
It was physical, but you don't feel it's thru
Look what I did to you, keep a wet pillow boo
Makin' love to your man, close yo' eyes, think of who
And it's cool, we just leave it like that
Cuz if it's mines and I let it go, it's comin' right back

Shank costs a kilo, girls look Creole
Smokin' on the good, sippin' on the Cliquot

Yeah, yeah
Listen, look

I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on the block, blue collar wasn’t me
My momma put me out when I was left up in the streets
But I ain't mad at it 'cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the Fuck tha Police
When Johnnys pick you up and drop you off down the street
They say I’m too street
I paint pictures on these beats
When all they ever seem to hear is R.S.C
We all we got, like C.M.B
Same legend, different letters, you'll be R.I.P
If you go against we, and that's on me
Stick a fruit punch nigga make him bleed, Icee
I'm something like a stunna, tell him get like me
Yellow gold chain, blue chucks, white tee
You do what you can, me — I does what I please
And fuck with Jay Rock, blue and red make green
So holla at ya boy, cause I'll be OT
I'm prolly on stage, finna light up my weed
Remember back in '03, when it was just me
Rolling on Slauson, on a chromed Alpines
Grown man, money, I was just a young teen
50 Cent and Dr. Dre on the television screen
But now look at me, your boy gettin' cheese
I deserve every blessing for the struggle I seen

On more chrome than ever every time I ride by
MACs and Berettas tell you niggas no lie
From a hood so hot, it's heat waves in the sky
Remember, every day was like the Fourth of July
At war, so you had to keep your pistol in your ride
Lean low, kush smoke in the sky
Watchin’ out for blue cars driven by white guys
Now it’s like, white clouds with blue skies
Dumpin' out the blunt through the roof of my ride
European grille with the letters inside

I'm so fast and everybody is slow
I'm so strong I can pick anybody up
I will throw you down and I will give you a pop
He farts a lot and plus drools a lot and he's sleeping a lot

You don't kill me like that!
My name is Cross
I am the boss
I'm a vicious bowler
I wear a Polo – with the horse on it
I'm on it! I'm on it!
And I pop a wheelie
If somebody speeds me I hit 'em!

One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now every day we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs
This shit here must stop, like "Freeze!"
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's
And that's a no-no

[Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly

And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man

Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers

Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion

And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop
Yeah, tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes they get evicted
I'm dealing wit Queens in my castle—ain't worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the projects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond; at the exit with a sign saying "We'll rap for food"
My face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex
'Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax error
Bring the terror to your dome like PE
Prone to finish this out cause this be a freestyle

Now who them boys that be having the crunk every occasion?

Peep what I say
Everyday the sun sets just like clockwork
To put the Glock to work
And putting the body to standstills
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss, niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling
Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
Still yet they tend to flex, like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing, no-no, not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit, we done a bunch of shit

Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things

Operating under the crooked American system too long
OutKast, pronounced outcast
Adjective meaning homeless, or unaccepted in society
But let's look deeper than that
Are you an OutKast?
If you understand and feel the basic principles and
Fundamental truths contained within this music, you probably are
If you think it's all about pimpin' hoes and slamming Cadillac do's
You probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker
Or maybe just don't understand
An OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
He is looked at differently
He is not accepted because of his clothes, his hair
His occupation, his beliefs or his skin color
Now look at yourself, are you an OutKast?  I know I am
As a matter of fact, fuck being anything else
It's only so much time left in this crazy world
Wake up niggas and realize what's going on around you
Poisoning of the food and water
Tampering of cigarettes
Disease engineering control over your life
Take back your existence or die like a punk
This is Big Rube, sayin' right on to the real, and death to the fakers

Love looks like you

Love feels like this
What does love smell like?

Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

Stank love

Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get every drip drop on my tongue

Up and down it seems to go

My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming its own individual entity
With its own lusts, its own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nerves
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of pleasure we both bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of the persona, making love after making love
'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia

Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya, playa
I'm dickin' the ho down — never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty — that was shawty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her, though — maybe she had to work?
I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck — I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too"
She said she understood and everythin' was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a fuckin' poster

Three in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights

In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite of all the bullshit
We on our back, starin' at the stars above (Aww, man)
Talkin' bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)
I said, "What you wanna be?" She said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong (Man)
I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show
That I would one day see her standin' in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school

Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the fuck is going on

Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'
From niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her
Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done
"Who said good folks is not supposed to die?"

The sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won
Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing, making a path on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds

I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? "Yeah, yeah, she chillin'"
We should be at The Dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?
Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me

If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first

That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac, my heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, sees a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A-five, fo', a-three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one (Yeah)
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening on Christmas day

Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, the 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down for theirs

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening on Christmas day

All the players came from far and wideEmbed
I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like, "Yeah, nigga, right"
But you gave me your number anyway, you were on the talcum
Powder—how's about them oranges?
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a Mission Impo–ssible
We were both the same age, but I
Suppose, wasn't on the same page, but in
The same book of life, so I'd page you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head, I'm thinking, "Cool"
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley
If your hometown would be Heaven or Hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore, hard to tell
You'd drop me off by the Dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
"Now, are these niggas in this house up to something?
Selling crack, sack by sack, so they could function?"
W-W-Well, yes and no
Yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement, then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone, and everybody yelled, "Ho!"
Meanwhile, the video starts playing
BET, college radio, and a van
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in they ear—you know what I'm saying, but
I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip-flip with the roam-roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home, but
When I got home, I never did
By the time I did, heard that you'd had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur who replied, "See you later"
When he got the good news—that's life, shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque, but I'm living with my Pop-Pop
So I got a Glock and a LoJack
Yeah, kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much, 'cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more; follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you, tell me, then I'll double back
But keep in mind: At the time, "Keep it real" was the phrase
Silly when said now, but those were the days
When Spring Break and Daytona
And Freakniks made you wanna
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South, but that ain't a Kodak
Moment; on went myself and Big Bo—
Well, you knew hm as "'Twan"
That's right—you were around before this shit begun
Well 'Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like Jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some 'gnac
Girls used to say, "Y'all talk funny. Y'all from the islands?"
And I'd laugh, and they'd just keep smiling
"No, I'm from Atlanta, baby; he from Savannah—maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down; hey, we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes"
She's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants
Fifteen-love, fit like glove
Description is like fifteen doves
In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose—agree?
Enough about me—how's about you? How's the lil' kid?
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note; now—
That note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see, I'd balled out, and 'fore I'd fall out
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg, I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor, staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
Yes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread, never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas
And macaroni niggas: "impastas"
So, on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now, you know her as Erykah "On & On" Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone, "Why you—
Do that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed"
The song wasn't about me, and that ain't my name
Were young, in love; in short, we had fun
No regrets, no abortion, had a son
By the name of "Seven"
And he's five; by the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six
You do the 'rithmetic, me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded; we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start
To when "luxury transportation" meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays' mama
Or her daddy let her borrow the Benz, because she smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up, you trick it out
You give it rims, you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got
(*music fades*)

"And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go, knowing, the whole summer, that's all you could think about. Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up, you need a jump, like you need and you want to grow, and you change all the time. So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer—the next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more. You wanted something bigger and better."
"So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?"
"Right... right, so now you want a Cadillac..."35Embed

One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my **** rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now, every day, we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals
Had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, **** here must stop
Like, "Freeze!" We making the crowd move, but we not making no G’s, and that's a no-no

Check it, a-one-two, a-one
"Two dope, dope in the Cadillac," they call us
Went from "Player's Ball" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
**** say, "Mother-mo that playin’," they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"OutKast, yeah, them ****, they making big noise"
Over a million sold to this day; ****, they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all player-haters can bite me

Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bi**** to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill, boy, because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, f****, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting nig*** into the tеmple they call their body
Now еverybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They **** a different **** every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

Whatever that¹s worth 360

Now i be the rational national
Ever present international
Spy wit the third eye against the conquer and divide
Now wit three of me i can run a country
Make apocalypse quit do mad shit on the side
I go on wit my bad self if i had four of myself

'cause the black is back and it's bound to sell
Picture us coolin' out on the fourth of July
And if you heard we were celebrating that's a world-wide lie
Yo Chuck, the fat generals man
Trying to pull a 226 on you g'
Yo man, show 'em what you got
This style seems wild
Wait before you treat me like a stepchild
Let me tell you why they got me on file
'Cause I give you what you lack
Come right and exact
Our status is the saddest
So I care where you at, black
And at home I got a call from Tony Rome
The FBI was tappin' my telephone
I never live alone
I never walk alone
My posse's always ready, and they're waitin' in my zone
Although I live the life that of a resident
But I be knowin' the scheme that of the president
Tappin' my phone whose crews abused
I stand accused of doing harm
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
C'mon C'mon louder etc...

Both King and X they got ridda' both
A story untold, true, but unknown
Professor Griff knows...
"Yo, I ain't no toast"
And not the braggin' or boastin' and plus
It ain't no secret why they're tappin' my phone, although
I can't keep it a secret
So I decided to kick it, yo
And yes it weighs a ton
I say it once again
I'm called the enemy - I'll never be a friend
Of those with closed minds, don't know I'm rapid
The way that I rap it
Is makin' 'em tap it, yeah
Never servin 'em well, 'cause I'm an un-Tom
It's no secret at all
Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Cold holdin' the load
The burden breakin' the mold
I ain't lyin' denyin', 'cause they're checkin' my code
Am I buggin' 'cause they're buggin' my phone - for information
No tellin' who's sellin' out - power buildin' the nation so...
Joinin' the set, the point blank target
Every brothers inside - so least not, you forget, no
Takin' the blame is not a waste, here taste
A bit of the song so you can never be wrong
Just a bit of advice, 'cause we be payin' the price
'Cause every brother mans life
Is like swingin' the dice, right?
Here it is, once again this is
The brother to brother
The Terminator, the cutter
Goin' on an' on - leave alone the grown
Get it straight in '88, an' I'll troop it to demonstrate
The posse always ready - 98 at 98
My posse come quick, because my posse got velocity
Tappin' my phone, they never leave me alone
I'm even lethal when I'm unarmed
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
'Cause the D is for dangerous
You can come and get some of this
I teach and speak
So when its spoke, it's no joke
The voice of choice
The place shakes with bass
Called one for the treble
The rhythm is the rebel
Here's a funky rhyme that they're tappin' on
Just thinkin' I'm breakin' the beats I'm rappin' on

All they tell us is lies
And when I say it they get alarmed

No disrespect to the rap heroes
The late, great Otis
But notice, and know this
In this time, here's a part time rhyme

Respect to you two heroes
But trickle-down got us less than zero
Respect, last I checked
Prison industrial complex, no swagger
Millions, billions, trillions, whips wheelin'
Is a million miles to what people's feelin', no gas
Try a little compassion, 2012 fashion
Style your insides, we outside
Fasten a broken seat belt, unemployed rid to Hell
SMDH, OMG, no, LOL

Have you forgotten? Latinos and Blacks
Pickin' electronic cotton, no Stax
16.2 percent is depression inside a recession
Spend money and time on hair and how we dressin'
Losin' homes, holmes, these stats be on smartphones
Don't need new slang to express the pain
Of what's really goin' on in the real game of life and now what?
Please discuss with no education
Knowledge, forty-five years of fucked up health

Rest in beats from Heavy D to Eazy-E
The Notorious B.I.G., we have lost so many
Still wonder in my Adidas why Jam Master Jay had to die
And Lisa Left Eye
Off top no rehearsal R.I.B.  salute
Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal, my man...
Still in shock at the loss of Afeni and Pac
His spirit lives on, it won't ever stop
Scott La Rock, heard a dope story about him from the Blastmaster
Out west RIB Mac Dre and The Jacka
When we die it plants new seeds
For new Big Bank Hanks
And new MC Breed's, remember?
And the Sean P's that spit that raw
J Dilla got all the beatmakers still in awe
I'm not a pimp but Pimp C forever, UGK
Rest In Beats is the way that we say
Salute!

Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song

Now we lost some other things
Besides just life and hip hop
We lost brick and mortar record stores
And really dope diverse tours
R.I.B. Rest In Beats
Original flavor and more
We lost the art of everyone being in the same studio
Rest In Beats
The love of the art now dipped in the dough
We lost real flows to mumbles and memes
We've seen the loss of ideas that we were kings and queens
Where are the groups? Too many going solo
We lost street teams and promo, to YouTube and Vevo
Man, I miss the time when you really had to rhyme
When lines weren't reduced to ghetto, studio and crime
For all that we lost, still the essence is preserved
Through beats, sound stages, dope energy and words
"Everybody listen to this!"

Rest In Beats!
Never cared how doves cry til I heard you die
Now I wanna forget and God knows I've tried
I wished you heaven, I hope that you heard me
We were undisputed there was no controversy
Tired of the changes that life seems to bring
Never feared for silence, the dead still sing
And we can celebrate by dancing in the streets
Your music, your legacy, Rest In Beats!
I'm sick of the scenario man I'm buggin' out
So let's go, let's get loud, let's shout
Nothing but love, yes the good die young
Forever finds a way, your songs will be sung
September now, always got me thinking of you
Remembering the hard times you helped me through
It wasn't your move, but the way you moved me
Your music, your legacy, Rest In Beats!

Question is, uh, can you get it out?
Spoke!
Stay woke
Gun culture silenced
Stop the violence made all the brilliant silent
World ain’t gonna fix itself
World ain’t gonna change itself
Run your mouth
Don’t be dumb
But bump them gums
I know that the insecure be sure that their adversaries
End up shootin’ them guns
Dumb shit rises to the top
Ain’t got shit to say
Shut the words
Makin’ action stop

Ain’t playin’

If you have fear in your heart, don't fret just get out the way

Signed, sealed, delivered it's yours
I pour it on the breaks, till it break laws
Givin' the gabbin', so the brothers be havin' it
Or else the five fingers of dope'll be grabbin' it
Wit' no complaints, givin' uppin' I ain't
On the mike, like Karl Malone in the paint
Why rip a rapper, when he flow like water
I rather rush a television reporter
The frauds that tried to front
Watch ya back, stop pullin' those little stunts
Assault and battery, cause I snatched the battery
Off his back, the TV pack
Why pop the rhyme on a rhymer when I kick it
I'd rather spend my time, spittin' on a bigot
Who pumped the pimp that fed the fiends
He got jumped by the brothers in Fort Green
They slapped the mack, that kept us back
Sucker suckin' the hood like Drac
So if ya draggin' us down with the wack attitude
Get up, lookout, get out the way

Cause f-a-l-l-i-n, never applied
To this brother that tried
To let ya know, the folk of the American joke
That kept us broke
Now I'm ready to rap, strong fax I swing
Like Bo Jax, I'm never calm on a bomb track
60 percent three-fifths, constituted
Huh prostituted
Why I'm mad, cause it's written on the paper, right now
The mother fuckers bow
I kicked the lyric about the tricks of the trade
And the money made
Who got the money betcha bottom, dollar bill gonna find
Some rich old bloodline
But the blood is in the mud
Take the whack an attack it like a SCUD
To the patriotic hater that got paid off my people
I'm rude
Lookout, get out the way
Move!

Get out the way, move!

Now we gonna count it down again, y'all ready c'mon count it down

If you ain't with the program I'm set on, you're just going to get run over

Signed, and what I'm gettin' is mine
I bring the noise to town, so let's get down
I cranked the beats, tearin' up the streets and the park
And it ain't Mozart
Jack movin' out, cause the black movin' in, and its old
I said it in Who Stole The Soul?
But 92 brings an attitude, that say I don't give a DAMN!
About the old way
This is a new day
Tell Jack stay in the back
And all the other suckers that don't matter
You got somethin' to prove, scatter
Get out the way
Move!
That's right get out the way, move!
Move!
Get up look out c'mon move!
One more time we gonna count it down

Once again, this is it
Turn it up, here we go
But this time the rhyme's
Gonna ask who did the crime
Then let's get down to the nitty-gritty
I wanna know who
Picked Wilson's pocket
After he rocked it
Fact, he shocked it
Same kinda thing they threw at James (Brown)
And what they did to Redd was a shame
The bigger the Blacks get
The bigger the feds want
A piece of that ... booty
Intentional Rape System, like we ain't
Paid enough in this bitch, that's why I dissed them
I learned we earned, got no concern
Instead we burned, where the hell is our return?
Plain and simp, the system's a pimp
But I refuse to be a ho who stole the soul

Ain't, no, different than in South Africa
Over here they'll go after ya to steal your soul
Like over there they stole our gold
Yo, they say the Black don't know how to act (Who, me?)
Cause we're waitin' for the big payback
But we know it'll never come
That's why I say come and get some
Why when the Black moves in, Jack moves out
Come to stay Jack moves away
Ain't we all people?
How the hell can a color be no good to a neighborhood
Help, straighten me out
Cause my tribe gets a funny vibe
Sayin' I'm wrong for singin' a song
Without solutions
All the dancers answer questions
Try to be the best and...
Let everybody know before I blow
Cuz I wanna know what sucka stole the soul

Banned from many arenas
Word from the motherland
Has anybody seen her
Jack was nimble, Jack was quick
Got a question for Jack ask him

Where is it why'd you try to fool the Black
It wasn't you, but you pledge allegiance
To the red, white, and blue

PE 1998

If man is the father, the son is the center of the earth
In the middle of the universe, then why
Is this verse comin' six times rehearsed?
Don't freestyle much but I write 'em like such (Word)
Amongst the fiends controlled by the screens
What does it all mean, all this shit I'm seein'?
Human beings screaming vocal javelins
Signs of a local nigga unravelling (uh huh)
My wanderin' got my ass wondering
Where Christ is in all this crisis?
Hatin' Satan never knew what nice is
Check the papers while I bet on ices
More than your eye can see and ears can hear
Year by year all the sense disappears
Nonsense perseveres, prayers laced with fear
Beware, two triple O is near

It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin'
What is game? Who got game?
Where's the game in life, behind the game behind the game
I got game, she's got game
We got game, they got game, he got game
It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game if it ain't sayin' nothin'

White men in suits don't have to jump
Still a thousand and one ways to lose with his shoes
God takes care of old folks and fools
While the devil takes care of makin' all the rules
Folks don't even own themselves
Payin' mental rent to corporate presidents (My man, my man)
Ugh, one outta million residents
Bein' dissident, who ain't kissin' it
The politics of chains and whips
Got the sick missin' chips and all the championships
What's Love Got To Do with what you got
Don't let a win get to your head or a loss to your heart (Word)
Nonsense perseveres, prayers laced with fear
Beware, two triple O is near

It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin'
What is game? Who got game?
Where's the game in life, behind the game behind the game
I got game, she's got game
We got game, they got game, he got game
It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'

And a new world order is about to begin, y'knowhutI'msayin?
Now the question is - are you ready, for the real revolution
Which is the evolution of the mind?
If you seek then you shall find that we all come from the divine
You dig what I'm sayin?
Now if you take heed to the words of wisdom
That are written on the walls of life
Then universally, we will stand and divided we will fall
Because love conquers all, you understand what I'm sayin?
This is a call to all you sleepin souls
Wake up and take control of your own cipher
And be on the lookout for the spirit snipers
Tryin to steal your light, y'knowhutI'msayin?

No don't test me
Checks from the ass to the throne
Grown, I'ma do it my way
Oh, by the way, I don't play
So what you say about this lost and found
In lust but bound
To get the stacks from the last sex acts
Sack the Government tongue kissed the devils daughter
And sent native daughters to the slaughter
The last six chapters of an anti-nigga knock
Entitled life in the fast lane
Like death, in the last lane
I live, until the day I die
I live, until the day I cry
I'm dead, the day I lie
I'm not takin' pay off's and lay off's
Knockin' G's off from the tip off
Less academic callories
Hope to make a high price salary
I got 40 acres to comphiscate
I got a mule that can't wait to ???
On who gets paid
And who gets laid
And who gets saved
And who gets sprayed
By burnt pale faces, fiends in high places
Faces and faces chasin' traces and cases and cases of case suits
Gettin' loot in a two piece multi national corporation noose
Around the neck of his pops
Got locked and dropped by a dirty cop
Stop!

Yo, you gotta bust this
We want justice
From public enemy number one
To can't trust this

Because we're sick and fuckin' tired
Of being mistreated by the undefeated
Powers in the seat that can't be beat
Probably gone is the head that make clear to the feet
The two worlds are talkin', plus crooked walkin'
Blind to the fact that the enemy is stalking
For ways for days to search United States quiet
We're not a full power cause of racial riot

Who be talkin
Where they at
Where they at
Wicked wild
Feelin irie
Not sorry
Get it see it written down in a diary
Same say fuck all dat Political shit
But wanna get paid when
Their brains in the low grade
Nowhere to run/here they come come
Nowhere to run/here they come come
Nowhere to run/here they come come
Nowhere to run/here they come come
Nowhere to run/here they come come

I'm a fan first
I reverse another trick verse
To the point
Where I can rock dis funky joint
In the brain game, I'm keepin my head clear
In 33 years so what
I never had a beer
I don't know what I'm missin
I'm not dissin But I know I ain't ass kissin
Time to draw the line This time the rhyme
Got da good guy goin gettin da nine
Cause I know the hoody Got it good wit the hitman
Can I get a hitman Know I'm duckin nat quicksand
The funky automatic Handlin static
Sellin out I ain't good at it
When I got bumbed I'm gonna open up
Hitt em up stone to da bone
But it ain't gotta be like that
And thats that
Can u tell me yall...what
All in wit the law
They fall in
The great white hole where they
Be sellin their soul
Never get enough
They be talkin dat roughneck shit
Be comin they quit
Fuck dat blood iz thicker
Than water shit
That shit iz counterfeit
Devil go where da shoe fit
Black mans law iz raw like Africa
You violate
Were comin after ya
They're hereEmbed
Somebody in the house, say, "Yeah!"
"Yeah!"
If y'all really like to rock the funky beats, somebody in the house, say, "Hell yeah!"
"Hell yeah!"
I like that for the people up top, check this out:

"Order in the court"

Yo, I can't believe they got the P.E. in court before the judge on some nonsense
I got the S1s ready
Chuck, Flav, what's up?

Get caught, now in court 'cause I stole a beat
This is a sampling sport
But I'm giving it a new name, what you hear is mine
P.E., you know the time
Now, what in the heaven does a jury know about?
Hell, if I took it, but they just look at me
Like, "Hey, I'm on a mission, check it out, y'all: condition"
Ain't right, sittin' like dynamite
Goin' to blow you up, and it just might
Blow up the bench and
Judge, the courtroom, plus, I gotta mention
This court is dismissed
When I grab the mic
Yo, Flav...
You might also like
What is this?
What y'all think y'all doin', bringin' us to court for this time to say we're stealin' beats?
Y'all can't copyright no beats, man
Yo, Chuck, is they crazy man?

Get hyped, c'mon, we gotta
Gather around - gotcha
Mail from the courts and jail
Claims I stole the beats that I rail
Look at how I'm livin' like
And they're gonna check the mike, right? - Sike
C'mon, 'cause I'm livin' now, lower than low
What a sucker know
Found this mineral that I call a beat
Paid zero
Packed the load 'cause it's better than gold
People don't ask the price, 'cause it sold
They say that I sample
But they should sample this: my pit bull
We ain't goin' for this, they say that I stole this
Can I get a witness?
Understand where we're goin'
Then listen to this, plus my Roland
Comin' from down from below
Rebound, c'mon, boost up the stereo
Snakes in the morning
Wake up scared, afraid of my warning
They claim that I'm violent
Now I choose to be silent, can I get a witness?
Yo, Griff
Move the S1s out on the judge and the jury
Hold them hostage
Time for Terminator X to step in and show 'em that he's in effect, boy
Yeah, ha ha
Cold Medina, ha ha
Hey, yo, Terminator, don't hurt 'em, man
Hey, yo, Griff, hold them hostage, boy
..
Ignorance is at an all-time high
Yo, Chuck, I think they need to be educated
S1s, take a stand
Yo, Chuck, stand up to 'em
Kick it

C'mon, get wit' it
Something ain't right, I got to admit it
Made me mad when I was on tour
That I declared war on black radio
They say that I planned this
On the radio most of you will demand this
Won't be on a playlist
Bust the way that I say this: No sell out
Yeah
Hey, huh --yeah, fellas, do you we think we gonna sell out?
Nah, man
I said, "Do you think we gonna sell out?"
No!
That's 'cause we ain't caught
Yo, Flav, do you think we gonna sell out?
I know if we do, we get the hell out
Uh-huh - yo, Griff, you and the S1s, do you think we gonna sell out?
No, not in this damn time, my brother
Uh-huh, Terminator X, hey, do you think we gonna sell out?


You singers are spineless
As you sing your senseless songs to the mindless
Your general subject, love, is minimal
It's sex for profit
Scream that I sample
For example, Tom, you ran to the federal
Court in U.S. it don't mean you
Yeah, 'cause they fronted on you
The posse's ready, Terminator X, yes, he's ready
The S1Ws, Griff, are you ready?

They say that I stole this
I rebel with a raised fist, can we get a witness?

You're blind, baby
You're blind from the facts on who you are
'Cause you're watching that garbage
The woman makes the men all pause
And if you got a woman, she might make you forget yours
There's a five-letter word to describe her character
But her brain's being washed by an actor
And every real man that tries to approach
Come the closer he comes, he gets dissed like a roach

I don't think I can handle she goes channel to channel
Cold looking for that hero, she watch channel zero

I'm not going to lie and act like..
I have always thought.. all Hip-Hop or Rap was the world's greatest thing
But Public Enemy.. made me realized..
That all Rap is not the same
They made the world listen
They articulated the frustrations and anger
Of the Black Community, more importantly;
They changed the perception of what Hip-Hop could be
Chuck D said: that Rap was the CNN of the Black Community
And no one broadcasted louder.. than Public EnemyYou might also likeEmbed

As far as the public domain
National elections have been taking out of the public Brain
The publics insane, if the facts still remain the same
The bushes are dummer and dummer

Brothers and sisters, this is not a test
I've been asked by Public Enemy leader Chuck D to make this emergency
Announcement
The police in your cities, for all intents and purposes
Have declared open season on black people (hey yo check one two)
Public Enemy was driven into the underground by government forces
However a small resistance is forming
Both Terminator X and Chuck D have resurfaced
Leading a small mobile rebel unit, "The Valley of the Jeep Beats" (1-2-3-4-5-6)

Hard rhyme and the rebel is on the mic
One time, rhyme animal's on the mic
They're still keepin, youth asleep an'
We in the hood with heat and still beatin
And we back with the rap that packs the room
Black tracks with the rhythm that make you move
Can't hush the bumrush, we bust the sound
With these sonic bombs, feel the pressure all around
Raise the level I'm up again rhymin
Ridin on the devil since I began rhymin
Hell we bring back the meat that rap lacks
Cause like I said, we got sold down the river
And I ain't for these racist wars
A lie's fed by these TV whores
I know it's more to news fake the truth
We break through won't lose we move with Public Enemy

Now hip-hop was a gift that lifted up
Loved rap 'til the companies ripped it up
Now the soul is set, we've been had like jazz
If you down for change then they take your voice away
And then they tell you the best is white
Co-signed by a nigga that pimped the mic
Make the rule the view that the beef is cool
But what it do is fool the few fools who buy the feud
Keep the people all blind and dumb dancin
Never let a record that wreck become rampant
See the street copycat the crap rap and songs
Not knowin "There's a POISON Goin' On"
'Til the message revealed and I show
But you never get to hear it on the radio
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, fuck Jack!
Bust that, squeeze, rewind the shit, c'mon

"C'mon now!" DJ Lord
"Here we go again"
"C'mon now!" Guerilla Funk
(Hey yo check one..)

We move as a team to keep them demons out
Y'all know what I'm talkin about
See 'em used, abused, confused us into thinkin that
Bein ghetto mean the same as bein ignorant
And so we strive to rise and get by
No peace for the beast we police and shine the light
Culture vanish on the television pimpin those
On "Cribs" in a home that they never own
Damn! Tell me that once again
Radio and the video don't uplift
Take a stand be demandin all my freedom and my civil rights
Worldwide fight the plan and they genocide
Yes the road is long and hard
And when I'm gone you'll say I did my part
Keep gunnin, we the crew that never lose
On the ones and the motherfuckin twos, Public Enemy

Hey yo check one two
Yeah that's right, Flavor Flav takin you back to the next millineum
You know what I'm sayin? Always cold cold kille-enum
You know what I'm sayin? And I ain't playin

I got a secret weapon, you know what I'm sayin?

Land of the free but the skin I'm in identifies me
So the people around me energize me
Callin' all aboard this train ride
Talkin' 'bout raw hardcore, leavin' frauds on the outside
But the bad thing is anyone can ride the train
And the reason for that is cause we look the same
Lookin' all around at my so-called friend
Light skin to the brown, the black, here we go again
Homey over there knows Keith and but he be thiefin'
I don't trust him, rather bust 'em up
Out goes his hand and I cough
He once stole from me; yeah, I wanna cut it off
The black thing is a ride I call the nighttrain
It rides the good and the bad, we call the monkey trained
Trained to attack the black it's true
Cause some of them look just like you

Stayin' on the scene, sittin' on the train
See all the faces look about the same
There go the sellout who's takin' a ride like Cargo
Cause he deal the keys from Key Largo
Runnin' Nat narcotic, by George he got it
Takin' makin' the G erotic
And the fiends they scheme so he can put 'em down
But his method is wreck 'em, put 'em in tha ground
Got tha nerve as hell to yell brother man
He ain't black man cuz he ate his Pac Man
Known to murder his own, traitor on the phone
Ridin' the train, self-hater trained to sell pain
The master's toy, little boy
Hard to avoid he look wit' it but he null 'n' void
Cause he ridin' the train you think he down for the cause
Cause his face looks just like yours

On the nighttrain

More of the same insane who sayin' like flowin'
Like nighttrain, runnin' the pain of the black reign
You look, you laugh, you doubt and go out and I'm gone
But the bass goes on
To talk the talk, but walk the walk, the king of New York
Crack a lack attack the black to crack the back
Once again I test a friend with sincerity
Or consider him an enemy
Who am I to tell a lie
Rather push the Bush
Hope da cracker get crushed
I'm rollin' wit Rush
Leader of the bum rush
Russian I ain't spreadin' like paint
Lookin' at the put I got and its kickin'
But it ain't chicken but it's livin' for a city
So sick and tired
Of a scene buckwild, piled in a file
Senile or chile
They said it never been no worser than this
I'm on the nighttrain, they hope ya don't miss it
Give ya what they gotta give you just go
You musn't just put your trust in every brother yo
Some don't give a damn
Cause they the other man
Worse than a bomb
Posin' as Uncle Toms
Disgracin' the race and blowin' up the whole crew
With some of them lookin' just like you1Embed

For whom the bell tolls, is that the way the story goes
85% believing all the videos
God knows who controls the radios
Some people chose the road to be hoes
And so I rose in the middle of all the woes
And Def Jam negroes turnin' up their nose
There's one way in, no way out
No doubt the body count
Gettin' headz checkin' out

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down (x4)

Time to make life shine again like glass
You know I'm sayin'?
Gotta make it shine like glass

Outraged against the scene
Proofread the script
Flipped it back so I'm back in gang green
We interrupt this routine, I had a dream
The clean protein smacked the gangsta lean
Between the triple team, wiped 'em out like a drought
Damn, the rap's tetracycline
Them lips foretold these apocalypse
Everything had a shot and got hit with bullshit
Twisted politics tricks I couldn't get with
As one quits another nitwit hits
All the way crazy, shady
World turned upside down, I put it down
Why destroy what you love? Look around
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground, where the lost got found
Why it all come tumblin' down?
Why he and she gotta die, now how that sound?

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down (x4)

On and on to the break of dawn
Some the 100 meter dash, I'm the marathon
Been around a long time, but the rhyme the same
Sound remains insane, exchange the reign
Ain't that somethin'
Figure I smashed the pumpkin
So I parallel the brains of Cobain
Show no shame like the pain of Kane
Gettin' madd opposition, hip to the game
It's that gran' old PE ammo
Different time, different channel, funky piano
Here to witness get on up with a quickness
S1's in the house with the thickness that get this
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, attackin' they frat
Griff is back, got 5 on it Black
The track got X on the decks
Terminator's back cause a that is whack
On the 1 and 2, yeah, go Flavor
PE hit the road, gettin' set to explode
Fight the power for peace, can't forget the war mode
Overload, there she blows
Here we go, now you know
Damn another Alamo
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down (x4)Embed
Where the Flav? WTF
Payback music
Who the hell they be tellin' you?
What the F they be sellin' you?
Why the hell do you believe when you go where you leave?
W-T-F, W-T-F
W-T-F
What the fuck!?

I occupy this state of mind
Like I'm born a second time
The masses ask the question why
Them asses spend a life behind
On the M.I.C, the P.I.C
I'm against this prison industry
Where most of them look like me
Motherfuck the what, the Tea Party
They made you pay for education
And got no money, and got you waitin'
And tricks to keep the people fooled
And something in the food, my dude
About your future, and where you rank
And who you think, and who you thank
Behind the banks, and all those tanks
The New Whirl Odor is on the brink
A revolution stops the Feds
And count the homeless underfed
Sue the pharmaceutical off the meds
Leavin' people left for dead
Lookin' back 80 years instead
Simply blamed it on the reds
Pay close attention to what is said
But while you listen, you watch your head
You chase the money, you chase the fame
The human race is what they're playing
A game of life is what I'm sayin'
You split them up, you call 'em names
And at my age, if I can't teach
I shouldn't even open my mouth to speak
And talkin' loud and sayin' nothing
And frontin' like they doing somethin'
Feel the people, heal the people
Power goes out to the people
18 and 35 is grown
Can't afford to leave the home
Can't afford to buy a home
Can't afford to keep a home
Boarded up, foreclosed cribs
Based on what ya bank did
Yet see these guys advertise to poor for clothes
The doors are closed
They slam the doors on your nose
Who the hell is telling you?
What the hell they selling you?
And why the hell do you believe?
And where we headed when we leave?

From Barack Obama to Flavor Flav
We will both be a first 'til we get to our grave
I'm the first hype man in music, he's the first black President
He's the first black resident to ever become President
Free your mind, your ass will follow
Flavor Flav all the way to the Apollo
Freeport LI to LA
Throw a Frito Lay off the dock to the bay
You wanna know why a kid goes to school
And in his book-bag he carries a tool?
Because he's trying to be like his idols in the streets
Gang warfare to the raw fare
Don't even try to go up there
Penalties that you can't bear
You lose your sight, your ass can't hear
It weighs so much, it'll crush your life
Don't play with God, He gave you life
The last man standing, he holds to behold
His weight in stature, his weight in gold
What goes in your wash comes out in your rinse
Back down so tight that you call it condensed
Can't stand the pressure, can't stand the pain
My life is so dry, I wish it would rain
Just like The Temptations, not just the singing group
I'm here to tell you now so don't ignore the scoop
I've been in this rap game for 25 years
If we made the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
We deserve our cheers
To what we fought the power, to Who Stole the Soul?
Brothers Gonna Work It Out from the ground we hold
God says to man, "I'ma let you live"
God says to man, "I'ma let you live"
God says to man, "I'ma give you power
Not for the intent to misuse your power"
If you wanna dance, you gotta play the band
People die by other hands
The innocent, the Ku Klux Klan
Iraq, and Iran, and Afghanistan
They go to war, they don't come back
The note comes home, "Killed In Attack"
All the medals from Fort Bragg
Collected by a widow along with the flag
41-Gun salute, 4 jets in the air
Now that's going out of style
Your contribution was fear
What you reap is what you sow
A man got killed for what he know
If you wanna be an asshole and get a good wife
Stay the fuck offa Skype and don't believe the hype

The dead has arisen
My niggas still in prison, though
Til they free, none's forgiven
It's only one mission, it's only one magician
All-Star's in Houston this year, I'm still fishin'
The plug's playground where them hoes play around
Galleria, Mr. Trick Bag when I'm in town
That's the energy I'm missin'
A thousand drug dealers with the cruelest intentions
Vengeance is mine, says the Lord
Throwin' shots at niggas cause I'm bored and they whores (Pussy!)
I'm Kobe goin' for his sixth ring, while that church choir sing
I'mma lean 'til they crown me king of New Orleans
Now everybody so 80's, 90's-inspired
But none of you niggas 80's and 90's rhymin'
You laptop hot, just internet warm
Down-low for downloads don't get caught up in my storm (Don't do it)
Fuck nigga, you just internet porn
Now we don't gotta fake it no more, the line's drawn
I'm too much dope dealer for rap niggas
Too much closer to every trap nigga
I'm just preachin' facts, nigga
I'm more biased to the coke-dealin' Coupe drivers
And bad bitches steered wrong by they loose mamas
It's the wrath of the caine

Espera, ven aquí, who you wanna be? Drug Dealer? Demon? Rap nigga? You tryna save the culture? Ay Dios mío. You gotta pick one, daddy

Leave your conscience at the door
We done hid the monsters in the floor
I speak to the trap lords
And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards
I done been black balled 
And never gave a fuck ‘cause I’m Jack Frost
Of sellin’ that blast off
I’m on a crash course
Where talent meets timing
Christopher Wallace, Think Big, keep climbing
Reasonable doubt, drug era, keep climbing
I’m my brother’s keeper, Lord Willin’, keep grindin’
As a God amongst men
Rinsed drug money, I done paid for my sins
Books and the lawyers, I done paid for my friends
Still held back, I done paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late, great on me
Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now it’s murder was the case homie
I’m watching this three ring circus 
Old lions don’t roar, so the clowns ain’t nervous
Even you fools serve purpose 
Let ‘em run amuck until the king resurface
Then it’s off with your heads
Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you’re dead
They take samples of ‘em, I make examples of ‘em
It’s the thrill of the hunt, I keep my mantle covered
Ask ‘Ye who’s loyalty more realer
Ask P, who’s core’s a drug dealer
Me and Tim, it's coming, it’s gonna kill ‘em
The only great I ain’t made better was J. Dilla
Now we breaking new ground
Get ready for the placing of the crown
King Push nigga!

My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime I made in this life wasn't disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is life's ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park, Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem pole, what’s my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler

This is no meaningless attack, I gave you a chance
Matter of fact, yo, I ordered them to dance

They felt the wrath of my madness, I let them come into my house
It's called Latifah's Law, for the criminal to curse
And all the gentlemen know its rule: ladies first
Not the typical female that tends to
Fall victim to the evil that men do
Small puff, I call your bluff
I'm not mad, I just had enough of the ruff stuff

Kick from the pack 
Gimme a smile

Take an inspiration from the S.I.D
Thanks for the beat

And oh yeah, Sa'Buddah told me tell ya hi
She thinks you're sweet

Somebody in the house, gimme five, y'all

I love to see you and me say, “ho!”

"Run.. Dee.. Run.. D.. M.. C.."
"Here we go again!" -] Chuck D*}
"What's it all about?" (4X with stutter repeats)

Livin in the city - the crack the mack and all that
Easy does it, is it was it
The black or white that Friday night
In those racist places - let's get it right
Ah to the maximum, and keep askin 'um
When the city gonna fix where the BLACKS are from
And every day around the way another one got
Bucked in his head - from a gunshot
No chance in advance for the ambulance
Cause he was just another victim of the circumstance
A brother died, the mother cried, it was a pity
But that's how it goes down when you're livin in the city
{*Jam Master Jay cuts "What's it all about?" samples*}

Just a hard rock, call him a hard rock
In the metropolis there's no stoppin this
Can't agree with society poppin this
Disagree with the plea when they coppin it
Some men pretend the end will come soon
They gather what they can and them BOOM
You played yourself, you made your wealth;
The deal was dealt - now your health is in question
Three Card Molly, hoodlums - who are we?
Pollution, prostitution, In God We -
- need a solution, revolution, substitution
For the thing's that we're abusing
Pity the city, for the people livin out on the streets
Yo we homeless, the homeless need to eat
There's no progress for the rest
God bless for less

Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam
Couldn't wait to see, Jam Master jammin'
Couldn't wait to see, the Master jam

He's a one-man band, in his own right
Jam Master jams to the broad daylight
No instruments needed, just two record players
A stage, a crowd, and two rhyme sayers

Ingredients are here, so have no fear
Definitely defy the position is clear

You couldn't be late, hesitate to debate
Jam Master is here and you could not wait

The alert is red, this is what we said
The meaning of Master means he's ahead
The meaning of Jam is a recording
The records that he plays when the crowd's applauding

He adds a little soul, to rock 'n' roll
Every record that he touches, turns to gold
He's well conducted, self-instructed
His style's worthwhile, heavenly constructed

Mechanically inclined, and if you don't mind

He adds spice to your life, time after time

I think it's bout time, to heed the long lecture

We rock our rhymes for the Jam Master

Not the best, not the worst, cause my name is Run

 D's the Deuce
 And Jay's the Tre'

I'm the rapper of the year and this the year of the rap
And I'm never drinkin beer, it's champagne at the tap
And I'm cold makin money on a regular basis
Pullin out, knockin sucker MC faces
Travel 'round the world with my mind at ease
No Calvin Klein, just wearin Lee's
Got credit in countries I've never been
Cause the records I write are in the top ten
The top of the chart is where I stay
But I also chill, around the way
In Hollis, Queeens, is where I stop
On the streets with the beats is where I walk

When I perform, many hearts I warm
I'm better known, as the Quiet Storm
I don't talk too much but I got beef
When I kill MCs, I cause grief
Devastating mic control is my main goal
My name is Darryl, and his name is (Joe)
The Master of music his name is Jay
Leave us alone, and let us play
We give it up, and turn it loose
We're not like Dr. Seuss or Mother Goose
Sucker MC's like punks who are picking flowers
Go for yours, WE WENT FOR OURS!

 Rock all microphones
 Just for kicks

Sucker MC's I will be snuffin
In my pocket I'll keep on stuffin
When I say I'll beat em up I won't be bluffin
They can't beef cause that ain't nothin
But it don't matter, my pocket gets (fatter)

Well I'm the rapper with the mic, drive a Caddy not a bike
Drop a rhyme in your face, and you'll damn sure like
He's an MC with the rhyme know the day and the time
Never ever goin low, cause he only climb
(And Jay's the DJ with the) cut (move your arm) and your butt
So D take the mic, huh hah
Say what?  I will not stop, I will not quit
Because some at the top but I'm on the tip
That's as high on the top as you can get
And you best believe, I'll be on it
So before you decide, to try me out
I'm gonna let you all know what I'm all about
I'm a fresh MC, who's on his way
To be an MC with the most to say
And to all those out there, that don't know me
I go by the name of D. M. C
In the place to be, I will MC
The Master of the Ceremony 'cause it's easy to D
Control of the mic is so devastating
That all other rappers you will soon be hating
No matter what race, creed, or color
When we perform things don't (get duller!)

Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo

Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo

(It's never) old school, all brand new
So everybody catch, the boogaloo flu
It's not like a fever, not like a cold
The beats are clear, the rhymes are bold
So don't see a doctor, or see a nurse
Just listen to the music cause first things first

First of all, get off the wall
It's time to party, so have a ball
We slow it down, so get on up
Like a volcano, I'll erupt
I've got determination, bass and highs
I see real well cause I have four eyes
What you see (is what you get)
AND YOU AIN'T SEEN, NOTHING YET

The crowd so loud, they comin in flocks
And when we come on, the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock there's nothing soft (so)


We won't only rock the house, but we'll house the rock
We won't stroll but we'll roll straight to the top
We're Run-D.M.C., and Jay makes three

The baddest b-boys in his-to-ry

When I record it, you'll be rewarded
You know my song is great cause y'all all applaud it
Not P-C-P, or L-S-D
Just D.M.C. in the place to be

Cash on delivery like a C.O.D

Getter of girls, master of men

Lord of lyrics, duke of discussion
Ruler of rap and king at cold crushin'

And I'm DJ Run, commander-in-chief
Dictator, and hater of those that beef

Puller of people (controller of crowd)
Lingering lyrics (long) lastin' and LOUD

Droppin' MCs, with just one punch
'Cause it's the baddest of the bunch so call me Captain Crunch
Slayin MCs', make 'em walk the plank
(What's next?) Swappin' decks then I count my bank
Sophisticated sounds, not soft or sour
Servin' you suckers sellin' dreams in the shower
Rockin this party, hour after hour

He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace
His name is Jay, he's here to play, and win this race
He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D
Kind of tall yes y'all and he's down with me

I'm talked about because I turn it out
You cannot count this large amount
Of rhymes I got that rock this spot
'Cause I am def and you are NOT
If I was fake, I would not break
If the title's at stake, then I would take
?Paving? the title, will be taken
I'm for real, I'm not faking
Suckers are shiverin' and, dead shakin'
I think ya scared if I'm not mistaken
I gain respect and if I'm correct
They'll awe like a ball that I have check
If the shots they take have no effect
The punk tried to dunk, but he broke his neck
'Cause I rock harder and I, get farther
You wanna battle D, hey please, don't bother
To waste your time, messin' wit my rhyme
The only kick you get out of it is in the behind

Kings from Queens from Queens come Kings
We're Raising Hell like a class when the lunch bell rings
The king will be praised, and hell will be raised
S-suckers try to faze him but he won't be fazed

One day when I was chillin' in Kentucky Fried Chicken
Just mindin' my business, eatin' food and finger lickin'
This dude walked in lookin' strange and kind of funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didn't walk straight, kind of side-to-side
He asked this old lady, "Yo, yo, um, is this Kentucky Fried?"
The lady said "Yeah", smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order, small fry and Big Mac

Front row seat (In free), no pay

Here's a story of a guy, who used to be fly
He never would steal, he never would lie
The type of person money could not buy
Thought he be that way until the day he DIED!

MAAAAAAN, he met this girl, made his head swirl
To him she was worth more than diamonds 'n pearls
But she wasn't like all the other girls
Because she was only out, to crush his world!

He didn't care what his friends, had to say
'Cause he had to see the girl, everyday
He quit his work, his J-O-B
And he gotta lose his touch with his family

HEEEEEEE would lie for herrr, cold die for herrr
Did nothing in the world wouldn't try for herrr (yeah)
Get ill for herrr, he'd steal for herrr
There's nothing in the world he wouldn't DEAL for herrr

He sold his car, stole a VCR
So low on dough, he went and robbed a bar
He lost everything, he had nuttin to LOSE
For staying wit this girl, he was paying his dues
You might also like
Well he tried to leave, but the love was strong
He shouldn't have stayed with T'HER so long

Now What's Going On? He sings the sad song
What was right in his life, has now gone wrong
He said, I got to leave, for a day or two
But on the very next day he said, "I need you
I can't live without you, and you know this true
'cause my love for you just grew and grew"
So he took her home, she took him back
They made so much love, he caught a heart attack
She drove him to his grave, that's where he's at
AND THE GIRL THAT KILLED HIM IS A GIRL CALLED CRACKEmbed
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Def a-then it went this way
Took a test to become an MC
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
Dave cut the record down to the bone
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
And then we talkin autograph, and cheers and laugh
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath
But see ahh, ah that's the life, ah that I lead
And you sucker MC's is who I please
So take that and move back catch a heart attack
Because there's nothin in the world, that Run'll ever lack
I cold chill at a party in a b-boy stance
And rock on the mic and make the girls wanna dance
Fly like a Dove, that come from up above
I'm rockin' on the mic and you can call me Run-Love

I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see me cruisin' girls just a-move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride
It's on a, ah first come, first serve basis
Coolin' out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight
And for you sucker MC, you just ain't right
Because you're bitin' all your life, you're cheatin' on your wife
You're walkin' round town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin' on the ave, chillin with the crew

You try to bite lines, but rhymes are mine
Youse a sucker MC in a pair of Calvin Kleins
Comin' from the wackest, part of town
Tryin to rap up but you can't get down
You don't even know your English, your verb, or noun
You're just a sucker MC, you sad-faced clown
So D.M.C. and if you're ready
The people rockin' steady
You're drivin' big cars get your gas from Getty

I'm D.M.C., in the place to be
I go to St. John's University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after 12th grade I went straight to college
I'm light-skinned, I live in Queens
And I love eatin' chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill, I love the style
I'm an MC you know who's versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards
Got my name not numbers on my credit cards
I go Uptown, I come back home
With who? Me, myself, and my microphone
All my rhymes are sweet delight
So here's another one for y'all to bite
When I rhyme, I never quit
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it
'Cause it takes a lot, to entertain
And sucker MC's can be a pain
You can't rock a party with the hip in hop
You gotta let 'em know you'll never stop
The rhymes have to make a lot of sense
You got to know where to start when the beats commence11Embed

Tears fall, my kids call, 'This ain't me, it's his fault'
Oh shit no, we did this
A partnership with no room for forgiveness
I take the blame, take your aim
Shoot that shot, can't wait to claim
All of this, in Jesus name
Pray in church, they give you change
I feel your pain
Songs sung in the key of life, with no meaning right
Hopefully one day might come I'd see the light
Can't sleep at night
And I'm wondering who's fooling who?
I'm sure you know who's fucking me, cause I know who's been fucking you
We used to be inseparable, never thought that that day would come
Where I'd take that shit so serious, and you get so good at playing dumb, you got away with one
What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'

You had me I'll admit that, fell into the trap you set
Lookin' me in my eyes, lyin', killing me with that soaking wet
Wouldn't let me meet your connect
Scratching me all across my face
Says she loves the way it feels when I'm in it all the way
60 calls a day, wondering where the fuck I'm at
Wondering where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that
Now let's be honest, you got him with whom you made your promise
And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered, enjoying moments after
Plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives, are husbands reckless why?
Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry?
Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line
Better step aside, gotta tell me why?
I was everything, you was all I had
Now this is change, and then this change is bad
Make a note of that
What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do

Aww, yeah
Free at last, free at last
Thank the God Almighty, once again, I'm sucka free at last
Yo 'Face, I'm gonna take a little longer on this intro
So I can shine the spotlight on these roaches and rats
So let me say to you homies, there's a conspiracy to destroy all Black entrepenuaers, in hip hop, by rat niggas and law enforcement
So let me begin with rat number 1, in Houston, Bookman
Now this guy sued me, went on tv, to show off his pumpkin head and swollen eyes
And then the police filed assault on me, misdemeanor, offered me 6 months probation
I told them no, so they made it a felony, and told me it carries from 2 to 20
So the judge say "what are y'all offering Mr. Prince" and the DA, Badheart, who not even a prosecutor in the court room, but since he has his obsession with destroying me, he yells "10 years"
So I told my Lawyer, Ken Schafer, "You tell him to do it, or lets go to war"
So the war begun, and  the target number one was Bookman. And he told on everybody, Johnny binder, Harry Ole and even himself
I never saw a man sit and tell on himself, money fraud, tax evasion and then put the roach and the rat who is helping him, Binder and Harry Ole, in the grease
Now, I'm almost through, but the shit gets deeper
Because right about the time Bookman battleship is about to sink, and my case dismissed,  the DA Good-I mean-Bad Heart claims someone called his wife at home, and my name called on his caller ID
So I hired a man, investigator, got the number and it was a crooked phone, in my name
But a bogus address, and no other information
Now for y'all who know, I was born at night, but last night
So who knows who has access to DA's home and mobile number
Yo Face, there's a lot of racism in Harris County, DA office
That's out to destroy our black leaders
Yo Face, I smell a set up, from Schumaker
So drop some heat for my boy Roy Jones, who trains to your music
Earl, who stood like a soldier for my case
And Fred who told the truth
And to all my peeps who stood and rode with me from day 1
I'm still that nigga, raw with no cut
Yo face, you know the homie Little Pots is still doin 12 years behind this clown
So let's expose this snitch nigga, Lil Troy, paper work

Just waking up, I gotta thank God
Fired up a square—that's how my day starts
Early mornin' buzzin' got me lookin' at life
Outside, I see movin' pictures, look at the lights
It's just another Saturday it seems like
Got dressed and hit the corner with my team, right
Smoke it, roll it up and pass it around
Now I'm stoned and my ass is barely draggin' the ground
No sooner than I think they woulda thought of
A cop walks over, never saw him
"Excuse me, mister officer man, I wasn't tryna disrespect"
And started coughin' again
Eyes red as a bandana
And one time heavy on his antenna
At his request they sent a squad car
And then they put my Black ass behind bars

Just wanna pack up my bags, and get out of this hole
Can't believe they treat me so bad
Can't believe they actin' so cold
I just wanna leave this room
I'm still sitting on this concrete couch
Just waiting for the judge to say, that I'm gon' be free today, yeah

Old celly, so I'm battin' me a thousand
And plus I got a bottom bunk pass
Boss came in with his punk ass
Talkin' to a nigga like it's date time
Askin' where I'm from, I'm from H-town
Niggas askin' me what I'm in for
Nosy motherfuckers want some info
I tell him, "Dog, I ain't done shit
You know these redneck crackers think they run shit"
It's lights out, I tie my mat down
Chuck it on the rack and stretch my ass out

Gonna pack up my bags, and get out of this hole
Can't believe they treat me so bad
Can't believe they actin' so cold
I just wanna leave this room
I'm still sitting on this concrete couch
Just waiting for the judge to say, that I'm gon' be free today, yeah
It's court call in the halls
Strip a nigga down to his balls
Bare-butt naked in my tennis shoes
The nighttime sergeant want an interview
They push us out like livestock
"Ain't no talkin' while I'm talkin', this is my block"
I finally get to see me a judge
I'm a Black man, so she got a grudge
Old bitch full of race hate
And a nigga quick to represent the gray state
I ain't got a lawyer, I don't need one
Give me thirty days, you get three-one
I ain't tryna piss in a jug, bitch
Just because I'm Black, I get fucked with
I bet if I had been a white dude
I'd have never been arrested, look at Michael
And even if I swam like a fish, though
They still would've threw me in the Crisco
And fried a nigga's ass in some hot grease
I'm just tryna get my ass out the hot seat

Just wanna pack up my bags, and get out of this hole
Can't believe they treat me so bad
Can't believe they actin' so cold
I just wanna leave this room
I'm still sitting on this concrete couch
Just waiting for the judge to say, that I'm gon' be free today, yeah

Dope sold on the cut make our hands bleed
Fuck broke, it ain't an option, penitentiary
Or the grave is the only way we fall back
Do our time A.T.W then crawl back
To them streets where we come from, taught life
Look alive, little niggas better walk right
Real with it, quick trigger finger, gun play
I only know how to deal with these niggas one way
And someday I swear to God I'ma change that
But I can't 'cause them evil demons came back
And when I'm high y'all I can't explain
What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
'Cause mayne I've been a loyal dude, and you can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need to talk but there ain't no one to listen
Lost inside a mental exorcism, and wishing...

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast, living life against the grain
Just one time, I wanna clear my mind, the silence seems so loud
If I could, I would fly away and live my life beyond the gray clouds

I woke up from a dream feeling all good
Prayed for better days ahead but what was y'all doing?
Lost, stuck in a standstill waiting for a handout
Hustling for tennis shoe paper, never panned out
My sister trippin', got my grandmother stressing
'Cause she's only 17 and she's already pregnant
Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
B.G.'s is trippin', ain't nothing left to stop them
Uncle in jail, daddy dead and their mamas
Can't teach them how to be men; grow up being followers
The streets swallow them then life overpower them
Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
Crash tested, a dummy high volume
Only God can judge but y'all niggas is comical
90 percent of our future's off in prison
Prescription for my mental exorcism, and listen...

I don't wanna hear the preacher preach, that shit a lie
Plus he knowing how that evil be, but who am I
To judge a man when I see him try
FOX News tried to justify
It ain't no way that you can clarify
In cold blood our lil homies dying
Another sign of the times but it's terrifying
That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk
Get arrested go to jail go to court and get the fuck off
That shit is fucked off, we worried about the money lost
While the Klan's about to light another cross
I ain't denying it, I speak from intuition

If this is love I don't see it
Can't make me believe it
You a nice girl, and I'm a hood nigga on some street shit
And yeah, you know my weakness
Sucker for some love type
I come from them slums, girl, you come from a good life
I wonder what you see in me
I love weed and Hennessy
You barely doing happy hour, I ain't never seen you drink
And now that's leaving me to think, how I got so close to you
This was just a hit and split, that's what I supposed to do
But one thing let up to the next, I'm addicted to your sex
You addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect
That's what I get I guess, I can't commit, that's killing this
You gave me an ultimatum, I'm numb, I ain't feeling shit
Must not know who she dealing with, puddles on her pillow case
Tears, runny eyeline, lipstick smeared (Hey, are you okay?)
Disobey, you pay for that
Well, the love is gone, and she ain't made it back
Pray for that

I'm just sayin', a relationship should be 100-100
It can't be 50-50, right?
Right
Oh, you gon' think about it?
Yes, I'm gon' think about it

It was the day that hell had broke loose, demons in the sky with the {?}
Take over the heavens and burn it over
It's darker than the hearts of men, but I ain't scared cause I'm a soldier
I walk with my weapon across my shoulder
Refuse to live, yet impossible for me to say I'd rather die
Cause I'm a killer with the devil's eye (uh-huh)
I want the world to feel my heart, my heart, my set, my set
And these niggas who contested me regret that
Poisonin my own breed to terminate yo' offerin
And may they die young and never live to cause {?}
I'm just wrapped up inside a homicidal mindstate
Destined to outrun the time it takes to catch fate
The day that shall come, that thou shalt be done

Yeah, yeah

I thank the Lord, for every morning, he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining, there's a cloud in the sky
Lettin' me know, that at any moment, there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is, there still can be pain
Down the park, I hear the sirens, just a screamin' away
And then the inevitable happens, the end of them days
As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away)
I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash, it reminds me of the now and the past
I say me a prayer, cause eventually I'll stand in the path
Of the souls and dark roads that lead to rest

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone like you and me)
Take away their fears

And then a child is born
Bloody naked, clingin' to life
Unaware of his surroundings or if breathin' is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time, another mother, murders her kids
And the unbearable thought of this here just brings me to tears
It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls
And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself
But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I couldn't help
All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds ‘cause dealin’ with that
Would be the hardest thing, I’d ever have to do in my time
I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't climb
The stairway that you hear me singin' bout in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time
I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die
But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky
Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole

I see the beast when the dead die, relief when my head’s high
Hear the streets up ahead cry, when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye, 'fore the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table, the tale of the tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John Doe’s that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb, but I’m cool, I’m cool

Pulls out a gun and shoots down all the fiends
And Mr. Mr. Scarface went up the block again

Ahh yeah, hah

I don't give a damn about the chatter in the background
People get beat when they step this is Ak's town
If you don't know, I recommend you check
And ask them little suckas how many heads I put to rest
I play a game but the game ain't roulette
Slangin 'caine is the thang and I bet
That there's a lot of wannabe Scarfaces
I've heard the name in ninety-nine different places
I'm here to squash it all original will speak
Scarface coming hard from the streets
I left my cut, in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn
But go to prison on a murder rap, damn that
I refuse to be a visitor at state's camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war
And many want to know why I've slowed up
It's either that or get stucked
Cause laws get happy on a days
Say huh put you in a Front Page
But this butt ain't made for no caps, homie
This buck says 'Exit Only'
So I get in the wind but hey
A brother still sold a quarter everyday
I sat around for six months black
Waitin for the day to make a comeback

Rollin' around rubbing on my back
Shakin her down with the Bozack
I didn't have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just hug her
So I gave it up to the lady
And all she said was "Do me baby, Do me baby"
I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin' at my twelve gauge
The chip was gettin' loud I said I'm killin her
And all the while my man was hard and he steady drillin' her
I heard to step as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head
Who is it? (Fred) Who? Fred?
Who the hell is Fred, I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the hell was I do?, I got lucky
The girl packed a twenty-two
Hit him in his head, there she laid him
The pastor standin' by the door I sprayed him
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown Cadillac
It kinda messed me up at first
Cause the brother that drove that Caddy rode away in a hearse
I opened up fire on the ride G
Who I was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my back
Could this be the end of Mr. Brad?
I don't know what happened to the front
Well that's about the time the closet door it opened up
(On your ass trick!
I'll be damned if I go out like the last)
Heh, five-0's on my back, mane
They know me by the face, but they don't know my last name
Now I'm back on the case
Just call me Mr. ScarfaceEmbed
Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why..
His life was took at such an early age
A young brother who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
Til a real dealer showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn’t survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that’s the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again, cause he's in a grave
Hey yo, let's think about it, fellas
"My daddy was a dopeman, so I'mma be a dope dealer"
How will the family explain it?
"My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!"
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin fly messes me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his boy but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealer’s all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation’s got me guessin..
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die

It was crazy how it happened
Some people rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled "get an ambulance!"
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You shoulda seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence..
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up..
Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his boy on the stretcher..
But if he survives, I’m willin to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Come a grip, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by Worthing on Scott Street
School was lettin out
"Yo you ain’t gonna shoot yet?" "WATCH ME!"
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun..
.. he shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked Black's brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullen
His brother was just dazed in a shock, "Why you do it?"
"Why you shot his moms Dudes?"
"Hehehehehe.. hah i'm Going all out, G"
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, "Aiyyo J.D. homey"
Hung it up and rolled down Dacca
Headin for the person he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven hustlers all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the Acre
One brother died in the park in the paper
Things gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray
And a second to dieEmbed

Ahh, all right, all right you kids get in the bed I'll get the Arabian story book
*Happy babbling*
All right kids, you tucked in?
"Yeah"
Here we go

Once upon a time, not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behaving really, really good
There were three mean giants that came from the east
They were up to no good and some ugly beast
They lived in the forest where no one goes
And were evilly inflicted from their head to their toes
Everytime they came around they snatched a few humans up
Then eat their poor souls and throw their bones in a cup
For years and years the peasants lived in fear
But nothing could be done besides to pray, my dear
For the giants were rulin' and the peasants were not
And the little bit of happiness was now forgot
So three brave boys full of spunk and youth
Went on a mission trip to find the king of truth
For when he'd come, justice be done
None only as the most high ruler, son
None only as the most high ruler, son
None only as a hoe's high ruler, son
Hit it!
You might also likeSo the story is, what is to come?
Will the peasants survive and justice be done?
Or will the giants continue to rule as one?
Well, nevertheless we'll see son
Story's begun

*Kid humming along the melody*
Heyo, imma stop right thereEmbed
Kit, where you goin'?
Sorry, Michael, it's Rick the Ruler, I have to go

Lights, camera, action, you're on
Get 'em Ricky D, what's wrong?
The crowd's gone
So help me out Kit cause this thief has to be caught
Radio the chief of police, get a report
Chief of police said "Welp
I'm sorry Ricky D cause I really can't help"
Ahh drats I think I'll take a long walk
Kit put your scan on all these rappers in New York
"But Michael's callin' me Rick, I have to go
If I get a word you'll definitely be the first to know"
Well all that night I felt really uptight
Hello?, "Rick, it's Vance Wright
Throw on your clothes, I found 'em, they're down town"
Word?, "Someone's havin' a concert and they're using your crown"
What?, you sure its mine?
"Yo Rick, I know the shape of it, come on"
You know your scratches? "Yeah, plus I got tape of it"
Get over my house quick, ride your motorcycle
Kit, Ricky Rick, pick up, forget old Michael
Well here came the DJ, trucks to say the least
"Ayo let me hear the tape," it's a complete masterpiece
Yelp, I guess it is, but this one bound to overtake
I heard a *honk honk*, that's Kit, so let's break
Here go my rap Kit
Analyze a hit, so Kit what's the scoop?
"Slick Rick, this one is it"

Well my tummy was growling while I was chilling in my seat
We stopped by McDonald's so I get something to eat
Skipped the line and the crowd started to break
"Hey yo, let me get a Big Mac and a strawberry shake"
Someone snatched me by my neck I thought I must be dead
Injected me with something, threw a bag over my head
I felt real weak, word, I couldn't even stand
I fell, next thing I was being thrust inside a van
Unconscious, who could be this shady?
When I awoke I was in a room with this lady
"So you're the boss, Rick Rick with all the clout?"
Uh-huh know why'm I tied up and what's this all about?
And this she left the room this was my one chance for hope
I used my watch lighter to burn away the rope
Then I's free, I's free, an alarm was alerted
I made a flying leap through the window and it hurted
Someone threw a knife, who could be this trife
So I ran and I ran cause I was petro' for my life
Stranded and raw I saw a phone not far
I radioed in to my supadelic car
Yo, what's with the concert, am I still in it to win it?
"Yes I'm in Manhattan and I'll be there in a minute
And oh, by the way, I re-listened to your hit, hey Rick"
What's the scoop? "Oh man, this one is it!"
Tight tight security - MAN, they was the softest
Came in with some cannons and bumrushed the office
Grabbed up the one who liked to front and pretend
No, I don't know who it is, some brother looking like a hen
"Let me go, let me go, please," you must be dusted
Hand cuffed this brother cause the thief could not be trusted
Grabbed up my money and my crown that's how I dissed 'em
I went on the mic, and DJ, man, I'm on the system
He warmed up the techniques to show he ain't soft
The crowd was up and this is how it started off

(Who, who, who is the top choice of them all?)

Yo Vance, cut, thanks a lot, who wanna die?
We up top, somewhat, forget me not
The class that I have won't last
Soon as I blast, from out the past, dash fast, and here at last
Vance Wright, no man can bring you this
And Ricky Rick, clean shot, cause I'm the king of this1Embed
Check this out, this Warren G, y'know I'm sayin'?
Chillin' with my man Slick Rick, you know?
And we gon' give you all a little tale about that jail stuff
You know? So Rick, why don't you run it, homie? (Yeah)

"In the slammer, kid!", "But I'm innocent!", Lord played witty
Wasn't havin' any pity, now in Razor Blade City
Cry, suppose the situation seen mad eyes of foes
Drives a Rolls, "Hey, yo, money, what size are those?"
Need to phone me to another sprang up, hm, to gang up
On this kid housin' the phone like he didn't know how to hang up
Would be hard, though, up to a minute or so and then yells, "Time on"
"And when you get your commissary, buy this and that or else I'm gonna"
Be on that ass and won't stay off, extort, fig I save, way off
Beaten to death, you ain't protectin' me, forgot today's my day off
Hold my head and drift the Sumo weight in knots and cars
Instead of sittin' here accumulatin' cuts and scars behind bars

When the lights got dim, it was time for the sock-up

If a riot jumped off, it's time for incision
Stickin' niggas here and stickin' niggas there
I turned around and looked and seen cops everywhere
Jackin' brothers up, slappin' brothers up
If you got blood on yo' clothes, lock up!
High-powered was the level, level fo'
Niggas sentenced to life and you can't be no hoe (biaatch!)
Or you get tooken with homies overlookin'

What fight? The nigga trip, C.O. the rest he might scared
But couldn't squeal, I's like, "Officer, that nigga right there"
Now, if he ain't get me his friend's will, needed a utensil
It turned out, I had to stab him in the eye wit a pencil
State of shock, he made a yell, I said, "Huh, what you want, traitor?"
"C.O. puts me in the bin", I'll say about a month later
Back in population, didn't matter that his friends tensed
The phone prints, the years added to the sentence
Still chillin' and all of that and I escaped when I didn't think
So, don't hit the sto' because they made a rape attempt
Thank goodness, failed, called out next, he wailed out
Here go the C.O., "Ricky Walters, pack up, you're bailed out"
The C.O. couldn't see the rape, the kid'll snitch mass figure
Fast trigger, you'll be back, you little bitch ass nigga
Au revoir, back to datin' sluts and stars

As a youth, each Sunday, Dawn went to Church and
Paid her respects and not to mention was a virgin
Kid pushed up, Dawn lettin' him
Since he made her laugh and all the other girls was sweatin' him
Then things started to move without pause
And a couple o'months later kid's pushin' for the drawers
Under pressure while exchangin' glances
Dawn finally gives in to the sexual advances
Although it was a mad high cost for her
Cuz' after the thrill was gone, so was the lust for her
Eventually he left her for another
Now feeling alone and betrayed by her lover
She cried--for no longer knew which way she headed
Once dreamed of actually wearing white at her wedding
And really being pure, now she thought she'd die without
Still she finds strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Without love...
Without love...
Without love...

Verse two of Dawn's life--the second segment
What could be worse than to now find out you're pregnant?
Poor Dawn couldn't sleep--laid awake
Not ready for a child and plus her mother's gonna break
And she doesn't know how she's gonna bring up the subject
Consequences of being used as an object
In church though time's runnin' thin
She decides to have the child because she doesn't want to sin
Props to the girl although ahead hard times;
It was Hell finishin' school and working part-time
Yet Dawn did it though her youth went to waste
Little help from the government, she got her own place
HARD for an independent woman and a kid
And as soon as she could get off the assistance, she did
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continue with her life without love...

While Dawn worked two jobs tryin' to meet ends

So when she got words she tried to slap out the taste in his mouth

Under stress, she takes two Bufferin
Son now tired of seein' his poor mother sufferin'
Starts to sell drugs though the cops did a raid
Guess who's in the mix, and being legal age
Could do time, please call her employer
To inform her that her son is gonna' need a lawyer
Never no good news, just more strife
Dawn barely havin' enough time to live her own life
Hears the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'
Now spends nine hours on the bus to go and see him
Here's the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'

So you get my point son, you just don't trust no bitch
You know what I'm sayin? (Okay, daddy, I understand your )
Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin?
(Okay, I get your point) Anyway, listen to this, check it out

1994, as the world gets trifer
I'm wondering, fuck I need a woman in my life for?
Ya know, cause it's like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the Fever, "What's going on, stranger?"
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That bitch wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
"Oh you tryna dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too
That type shit you ain't admitting"
Because, home girl, I grew out of it, you didn't
Anyway, dead outta order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that? "My ex" I said "Who?"
Believe she had the nerve to say "You can wear it too"
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new

Someone who would be true
Yes, I should find someone who would be true
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true, true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo..

Then I met Syb, sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like 'em
"What? Sweating you? Picture that, nerd.. please"
Anyway, the bitch had herpes!
You know, imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it 'less I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me? You worthless slut!
"Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to"
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
"Chris, wait," the bum bitch said
So loud 'til a mothafucka fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris? She putting up resistance
'til I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dispatch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes, I should find someone who would be true
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo
Oh gosh, Scooby Dooby Doo

Though happy I was free, the need for love was still in me
Got to the point like the need for it was killing me
Then I met shorty here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song "Go Away, Little Girl"
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
"That's because I had you pussy whipped royal"
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the bum bitch carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling, carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarassment to the Ruler as a person
"Gimme shorts" Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour
So when I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes, I should find someone who would be true
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true

We some of the dopest MC's out there
Now, eat that
OutKast and Ricky D — bitch, can you beat that?
Remember the time I laid them down to Teenage Love?
Now, see that
Just to sport a rhyme and break in new patterns like hymens
Shuckin' and jivin' was never the style
I'm gon' keep on being this lion
Spittin' that king shit, you cling shit
A tailor and a seamstress
Blue gators for you haters and the penis for all you beatches
Like an addiction 'cause I need it, hip-hop is that I fiend it
Like a junkie, show me your monkey, 'cause I sho' nuff like to beat it
Might just eat it just to skeet it
Fold you up like you was pleated
Like some slacks and, relaxin', be strollin' like Sir-Captain
See, I got a baby daughter, and I feed her with this rappin'
Not trappin', b-boy, but rappin', huh
Ye-yeah, yeah!
Not tryna claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What, kid? Diamond on the tooth — 2 grand
Tryna help raise our youth to men
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand

Seems everybody's open off the grammar
The white fox pink velvet suit, white cabana
Listen, baby girl, genius Rick ta..
Dreamboat, bitch, you shoulda been clicked picture
(Check her out) I don't know what you're tryin to figure out
Down South, barbecue ribs fly out a nigga mouth
And touchin' me The Chosen, for such a will opposin'
Me and Big Boi tryin' to give our children clothin'
Smokin' love, do we provide dope enough?
Even people unborn kid wide open off
The enginin' I'm sendin' in
Even make construction workers start actin kind of feminine (Hi!)
10%'ll blast this hit
From me and Big Boi who represent the OutKast clique
A jealous cat, lack the strength a badder fella had
Lady lookin' at me all stink, had to tell her that
Not tryna claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What, kid? Diamond on the tooth — 2 grand
Tryna help raise our youth to men

Help clean up this land

This is DJ EZ-Dicc
On WBallz
Right now, something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow-wow-wow
'Cause we gon' make it a little misty in here tonight
This is DJ EZ-Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

I have no love for hoes
That's somethin' that I learned in Tha Pound, so how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho?
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothin' else to do with it, pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?

With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth?
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger (Uh-huh)
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Snoop Doggy? I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it, 'cause you know I don't love it
Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 red, to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'
Just get on your knees, and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout (Woo)

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

I was getting money in the 80’s daily
Niggas like me don’t never quit
And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch
You got to tell ‘em what it is, don’t play with the game
I love it when you call a bitch out of her name
Don’t you dare try to save that ho
I know that you like her but you can’t wife her

Probably fuck a whole bunch of girls
Probably get a whole bunch of money, sho’ can you save some for me?

Don’t stop, fuck a cop for all the times I was jacked
Can’t say much now ‘cause I’m moving a crowd
I’m moving real weight, I mean hundreds of thous
Hundreds of pounds, green leaves

Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J
And not have to answer to nobody
I live my life like it's a party
So let's go cuz

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)

I got me a sweet
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police
You think you could smoke like me & Snoop, don't try to compete
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong

Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open

Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better
How long will I live? Eternal life and forever
And will I be the G that I was?
I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes, my son, my eyes are closed

Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Mama and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again, but anyway
I get fronted some ki's to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Mama a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
Just remember who changed your mind
'Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine
Indeed, agreed, proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want more
'Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really though (Check it out)
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izzel, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
'Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas 'cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war
Pops off, 'cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Mama, I'ma ride for you, Baby Boo

Today is today, last night was last night
As I leaned with my hand on my balls
I had to really check these bitches and tell 'em like this dog
You might also like(chorus)

Nina do this and Tina do that
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga them all my hood rats
Back in the days when I was on the block
At an early age man, I was on the cock
Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get ghost
(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-mama's house
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfuckin' press telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up 'cus she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and I paused
And I put my hand on my balls and said check this out, dog
(chorus)

I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fuckin with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fucked my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you a'int shit but dirt for dirt (biotch!)
(chorus x2)
(shoop)
This is a sexy bitch
{*Music fades out*}Embed
Hell yeah

Influenced by the doja
Blastin' at the rollers
Causin' company closures
Fuckin' over the soul, bitch
Your mom shoulda told ya I ain't nothin' nice
Snoop brought the boss

Soldier creeds with ice
And watch me boot up in the night

Bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it

Don't need foreplay, okay, obey
Everything that I say..

Recline your seat and turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet, rollin down the motherfuckin backstreets

Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier

Just another day in the motherfucking neighborhood
A pimp's waking up and he's feeling good
Versace to the flow
He didn't even mess with the Taylor made shit today y'all
Smelling good with his reptiles on for sure

I'm waking up in the morning, man I'm mourning; what's wrong?
My Nigga Corleone gone in my Zoning, but I'm boning, out to school
Cause I can't be late, cause they'll lock the gate
And it's damn near eight, that's when the bell ring
I'm a slide on in, and come right on in
And once I bail through the hallways, giving it up
Funky fresh stars and khakis, cool living it up
What up? - the same shit trying get paid and stay strong
Lunchtime, I make my way to get my grub on
Ten minutes to one, feeling good like I should for sure
Fourth period; walk through the door
I'm wreaking and smelling like endo
But still the day moves on to 2:44; one minute left to class
By Warren G, the Twins and Daz
Nate Dogg finna scoop us up in a blue drop top Brouham
I hear some bitches from Wilson wanna tag.. along
And get up, for the get-down
Word got around about the niggas from the Piddound
We keep the whores on point, to join on lit
And keep heat discreet, until the shit jump off
Well we're all from the side, so we won't ask why
So you best get high!

To the funkhouse, dunkhouse with the whole show
Niggas know how we go; from first 'til four we don't show
Lunch and then the last whore
It's getting dealt with some melt shit I guess
We smoke the Stress, cause my quest wasn't chronic yet
Little niggas growing up with my dogs
Cause we pack the hogs, exercise for my balls

Stacked bigger than I thought it would be
Me and the family, working on TV, get paid and fuck their enemy
Moving on up, like the Jeffersons but quicker
All we think about is finding ways to get richer
Hit you like some dodo, got you're begging for more
It's a trip, I'm serving on the solo
Low blow, I had you feeling me
I got some C-O-N-V-O for your community

I'm still in a fast lane state of mind
Time is impossible, for me to try to find
I'm out of school on the line
Hustling here and there, never show no fear
Hosted it up on a watch, I posted it up with a Glock
PCH in atlantic, is what you see just don't panic
It's me, Snoop rocks and when my homies get static
Got a pistol that blasts like a cannon
Look out for when we form at the wall, nigga where you standing?
Raise up, realize, street lights magnify
Life is giving; don't let it pass you by
I'm here and there with the bud, conversating with the drink
Shocked in my own zone, got time to think
Cause what would I be, if I wasn't who I am
Maybe dead or in jail, maybe time'll never tell
Approach me wrong and you will get chin checked
To disrespect my clique, and you will get dealt with
Uhh.. plain and simple, nevertheless with the best shit available
Test me now, let me see how brave you are
I'm scott free, so it's on like it used to be
D-O-G-G P-O-U-N-D G-C, for life, two times 'til I die
Oh why, Oh why, life is a challenge when you die?
What's the peak for me, is the cash and the strap
Since the 2-1-3 days been like that

Feeling very playish, ha.. I mean very plash
And the bitches saying: why shouldn't he?
Yeah he should; doing what he does and he does it good
He goes to work, yeah, he does it good
On pavement or dirt, checking the skirt
The story of a Pimp's Life, yeah baby
You gotta have the stomach for this shit, Hoo weeee
To fuck with this, the story of a Pimp's Life
Ohh yes baby, honey suckle to a berry
Got to check; the traps, got to check the dollars
Got a doctorate from the street called: Peace Mack of Diamond Net
A scholar with my niggas from the underground Embed

There’s a first time for everything
There’s a first time for everything
But don’t be afraid of what’s in the dark
Just open your eyes and see what’s in they heart
I remember the first time I left it up to you
But I learned from the first time to never trust in you

Ay yo, the first time ever I saw your face
I recall the case
Cut the grass now I see all the snakes
My lawyer man cake
Cause of you he’s been employed by the beef
And now it’s time to half court in the street
Falling asleep on your boy is not recommended
He felt the weapon in your chest because I’m well respected
So when you disrespect reflection then your health effected
I go harder than any demon that hell invented
I never felt threatened
By none of these industry motherfuckers
Cause they smucks and they blood suckers
You can come quicker than sideways or backwards
I always come straight up in your face
Your mistake is confusing me with a rapper
That interviews and a fashion
You assuming I’m passive
I’m really truly a master
Of lyrically moving masses
It’s true but if you attack us
I’m never the one to back off
Never the one to slack off
I’m making them take the mask off
It’s beautiful when I black out, it’s natural like disasters
My body is like a host for a ghost of the middle passage
You not imagining the noise you hear is laughter
They giggle behind your back you enacted your family matters
You read into what’s happening and kill it like an assassin
Looking for that applause when all you get is the clappin’
I’m serious about my craft don’t ever confuse the masses
By taking my outtakes and trying to repackage them
It’s never forgive action

You only get one chance to make a first impression
That’s why I always make sure I come the freshest
Whether I start or my words ending
I’m here to exercise my first amendment
Which gives you the right to get your verse played
I almost lost that after the third grade
Cause on the first and fifteen before I stayed
My team was the first to get paid
So why would you cross us in the first place
Unless you willing to catch a first case
You better all go on on your first date
To see if you can get past first base
This the first taste of what the pain gave me
You listen to the rumors you would think they played me
But they my juniors, my first babies
I only deal with presidents like the first lady
Who pay me on a first name basis
I don’t like you niggas I’m almost racist
That’s why I’m cursing the first person or cursing the first person who didn’t make my first purchase
But type my name in they word searches
Cause I kill the flow bring out the first hearses
And this will be the first crime you ever seen
But it’s cool cause there’s a first time for everything

Before the ink dried and the deal was finalized
And the money changed hands and the plan was monetized
We used to eat mcdonalds fries
Shop for economy size
Know when economists lie
We poor we trying to survive
Another stat-istic of a man with some kind of pride
I’m getting black listed like I’ve got a communist tie
Little did I know it was myself I was trying to find
Getting all kind of high
Crashing like vehicular homicide
But now I’m self employed and I’m chilling
I’m waking up with the millionaires
You looking for the building I’m still in there
Still in fear
Scared of the dark that don’t matter
When the lights come on the cockroaches scatter
Exposing the data
Yo get a load of these actors
They cloak and dagger
See how I broke they swagger
My spirit is rich
Yea the lyrics is sick
Get prepared lyricist of the year in this bitch

Look how love do, I'd practice the Art of War for you like Sun Tzu
Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do
If you black out and collapse, I want to help you to come to
Notice I haven't yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through and make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
You're everything, send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet music'll start, I want you to be the muse for my art
When people try to rip us apart, we gotta work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather
This is my wish list, what I want, not what I need, there's a difference
These days I'm learnin' that words got power, so I'ma be specific

I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks
As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he liked to do everything
He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family
His early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics
And the Fat Boys of the rap channel
Those were all the things I heard in the house
Even though I called it noise and banging
I know now, it is a accepted musical art form
I was a single parent, I raised my son on my own
His father had no influence on his decision
Towards the musical outlet or career he chose
You might also likeMy son had a mind of his own, even if his father was around
He would have turned to rap he loved music, he loved rap
At a point in my son's life he developed paranoia
About death and about the dying
We are living in a world of imperfect human beings
Where greed, jealousy and envy
Are manifested by what others have accomplished in life
My son was very very much aware of that
He appreciated his station in life on the directions
In which he was going or traveling
On the other hand there were others
Who I should use the hip hop phrase player hating
And I think that is what resulted in his paranoia
If I had to change anything in my son's life
That would have allowed him to be here today
I would have deterred him from a career in music
I'm aware that millions appreciate his music, millions loved his music
Be that it may if he hadn't chosen that lifestyle, that career
My son would be alive today
If I could sum up Christopher in one word the word would be generous
The thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
He was in a position to help, position to share
Position to give to others who needed, to others who wanted
To others appreciated the gifts that he gave2Embed

Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself (Oooh)
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it (Oh yeah)
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C-74, Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind a great steel gate (Oh no)
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

I remember back in time
(1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')

Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

Niggas in my faction don't like askin' questions
Strictly gun-testin', coke-measurin'
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin' fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig-piece, nigga deceased
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin'
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous, you're just a Licka Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh

Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nothin' left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this, I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore (say what?)
Told me meet 'em in the future later
They'll take me shoppin', buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin' Cristal 'til they piss the shit, uhh

Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (what was his name?), you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine?
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?

When you talk about... New York...
The first thing that comes to your mind is B.I.G., like...
That's the king! I don't think there's no other king out there
Nobody could take that, that, that crown from him right there!
The legacy of B.I.G. is something real deep, man
Go back to a bunch of roots, man, Notorious about family and keepin' it tight
That, that's one of the best that ever did it!
Represented what he represented, did what he did
Youkno'Imean?
He put Brooklyn on his back
He represented the hood, he represented New york City
Respect to my dude, man!

Let's say there are many times I looked,
and saw reflections of my son.
I argued sometimes, consulted;
I saw results, and said "Well done."
I thought of him constantly,
and silently asked "Why?"
I tried fervently,
and just cannot say goodbye.
I lived with visions twined and twisted,
passion so cold,
and withered thoughts, battered and shattered.
I dreamed dreams.
Cherished memories.
Housed friendship,
and promises that mattered.
In the end,
time is treasured;
But love for my son?
It's everlasting.Embed

True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, "There go Mase!", there go your cutie

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight? (Alright)
I'd like to welcome to the stage (Alright, alright)
The lyrically acclaimed (Woo), ha (Woo)
I like this young man
Because when he came out (Hahahaha), he came out with the phrase
"He went from ashy to classy," haha, I like that (Alright, alright)
So everybody in the house give a warm (Uh)
Round of applause for The Notorious B.I.G. (Ha)
The Notorious B.I.G, ladies and gentlemen, give it up for him, y'all (Uh)

A **** nevеr been as broke as me, I like that
Whеn I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pinstripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While **** flirt, I'm sewin' tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You wanna see the inside? Huh, I'll see ya later
Here come the drama, "Oh, that's that **** with the fake"
Blaow, "Why you punch me in my face?" Stay in your place
Play your position (Uh), here come my intuition (Uh-huh)
Go in this **** pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And **** clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with 'em, stole with 'em
I mean loyalty, **** bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch
'88 Oshkosh and blue and white Dunks, pass the blunt

Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go 'round
Plus I'm ****, **** ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in ****, **** packin'
Nickname Medina, made the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés, pass off a global
The only **** with a mobile, can't you see like Total?
Gettin' larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' **** with ****, real-life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on

After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Begin to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart
Break it down into sections, **** by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & **** like my **** was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustler's Prayer
"If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand"
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase "Sky's the limit"
See you chumps on top
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want

And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked, it all work

You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty

I remember we went to Tennessee
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Simone
Screamin, she fiendin' for the semen
Me bein' the man that I am
Took it to her condo pronto
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the chron' chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow
Satisfyin' all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? What?
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty

Ladies, my Mercedes
Hold fo' in the back, two if you're fat
Keep a gat 'cause cats try fi test me
They just fans like De Niro, Wesley
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin' on
Gardeur jeans look like they painted on
Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently
She like the way the dough fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal 'til she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's DeGenero
Dripped out, Iceberg apparel
Intro goes without speaking
Call me Cease 'cause I keep 'em, we can go freakin'
All weekend, so, roll in
Ain't it good that my Lex seats foldin'? Uhh

You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty

Now in my younger days when I used to sport a shag (Sport a shag)
I would go to school, carry lunch in a bag (In a bag)
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss (Get a kiss)
Always got mad when the class was dismissed (Was dismissed)
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stand, come to my desk
And help me with my problem for it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent or sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up promptly at three o'clock
But I was on the jock, yes indeedy, wrote graffiti on the bus (On the bus)
I'd carve her name then write a plus
With my name last (Last), on the looking glass (Glass)
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)

Now when I dream of fairytales, I think of me and Shelly
'Cause she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play love by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her nigga, but
All I could do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played Truth or Dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop the stride
'Cause I can't have no more of this passin' me by

And I must voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken (Chicken), chasing my tail like a doggie
She was like a star (Star), thinking I was like a fan (Fan)
Damn, she looked good (Good), down side: she had a man (Man)
He was a rooty-toot, he was a nincompoop
She told me, "Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop"
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass, I proved to be a better man
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her:
"My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I feel for you when I try
Or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you"
Signed "Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, P.S. Love Me Tender"
But the letter came back three days later: Return to Sender
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)

Be like that, it just be like that
Baby tell me why it's gotta be like that
(x4)

I wasn't sleepin I was creepin’, slidin', hidin'
I would like the girl behind me roll up a bad time thinkin'
Mentally sinkin’, presently brinkin’
Two decades and a half makin’ a path for mine to follow
The world is hollow, yet it's full of crap prepare to gamble
I give you a handful of chips and tips
For what's to come, I cried a ton of tears
Drunk a ton of beers, that's fun at first
But learned to persevere throughout the years
Kept my ears open, eyes scoping mouth locked
Don't rock the boat if you can't swim
Nobody may be there with the limb to lend
This is the end, still I can't explain the fact
Why the fuck shit gotta be like that?


Know what, I said it
Hear me clearin' over so severe and dreaded
That they need to be beheaded
Why? I'm readily, steadily stimulating and mutilating
All sloppily copied imitations, cause they irritatin'
So I'm intimitading them over the snare
With simply a stare
Bringin them turbulent terror
And they know this ‘cause they can feel it
He knew that it was mine still the sucker tried to steal it
So I had to reveal it, through provin’
That I am astonishing and fly
And by just blinking my eye
In a flash I flush out the face, layin' low-key
Trained eyes locate to focus on the phony
Mister sometime-homey, why he act like that
I thought he had my back
I thought he had our backs
But it was him who I should've never trusted
And not at least till he got his attitude adjusted
Or mouth busted for acting all dusted, but bust this
Now when I'm out I seek and thought out the whole scene
For all sinister types, sneaks that scheme
They come into my face, I send them tightmen home
When they be suffering from the double-agent syndrome
Why it gotta be like that?

Sometimes this world means everything to me
The inside is lovely to these eyes I see
And sometimes in my mind all I wanna do is cry
Highly up-set but nothing drops from my eye
Those drain out my skin cause I'm pissed from within
I see a situation now and all I do is grin
People think I'm high but I'm mentally travelling
Aging is your times cause life's unraveling
While I'm straddlin' walls up this fuckin' mic
I hate to be a pilot crashin' in a flight
People need to know about this thing called life
Cause if you see the light then life's alright
So can you dig it?


I jumps inside the jeep as I embark on my dark mission
Popped in my freestyle tapes, started reminiscing
About my little homie, who was raised in Wyoming, wanted to be famous
So he came to Californey on the microphony
He was super bad and what not
But he was the kinda fella to follow fads that was hot
He became too fascinated with that gang related flavor
That he modificated, rearranged his behavior
He hooked up quick with the influential slang
Gangsta-stroll, cornrolls; the whole shabbang
Braggin' and boastin, boastin' and braggin
How he mostly be hangin' with baby gees I was baggin'
Like why you tryin' to ride up on the bandwagon
Hopin' they'd hit him in the head, but he steady saggin'
Like he a hog
Creepin' through the smog
Smokin' on some indo sippin' on a cup of O-Dog
Like most who come to this West Coast society
Try to be because they think it's fly to be a menace
So what a relic way to end this
Got rolled up when he was strolling
On a Sunday at the Venice
Some niggas never listen they gotta learn their lesson
The hard way I'm guessin' yessin'
Deedy as I hit the Beady and make a right on Weston
Pops in my head the proverbial question

Wasn't a black prophet wasn't in it for the profit
Had a talk with Charlie Brown, he was like "yo man get off it"
It's a business
The record companies are quick to end the fantasy
Your trapped in and he tapped into my frequency
Now I'm frequently going
Over such and such ends that such and such owes
It's later for the fly girls and hoes
Cause in this capitalistic society money is all
Fuck continuing college, I was too small to play ball
So I grabbed the MIC device never thought about it twice
If you think this is a game nigga you better think twice...

Deep concentration from sunrise to eve
And even in my sleep sometimes

Free form, lyrical storms falling
From a cloudy brain
In my dream like state
Then I awake
To make these silly saps collapse
As I dilapidate the wack
When it comes to rhymes I'm kind of like a mack
I got these flows strollin up and down the track
So the dough I stack up in piles and piles
For my lyrical creation
Travel miles and miles
To reach my destination
Been through so many trials
And many tribulations
But I do this shit, I do this shit, I do this shit
For the people of my nation

I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get
Cause all I got was upset
When niggas used to be like
("What's up, fool?! Nigga, what's up?!")
And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all, I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face
Down the hall, I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering, "Why is everybody always pickin' on me?"
I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared
To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95, I must survive as a man on my own
Fuck around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown
I'm not tryin' to show, no macho is shown
But when it's on, when it's on, then it's on

There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta handle shit up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please, they got problems of their own
Down for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven
Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back up in high school, I played it cool
Just so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless colored figure and
As a victim I invented low-key
Till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it, I let the bullshit blow in the breeze
In other words, just debris

And now that I'm older, stress weighs on my shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but I told y'all

Will be a soldier and that's all I told ya

And that's all I sold ya
And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity

Rhyme is tricky, who ridin' with me
Who kinda miss me can kindly miss me, you kinda iffy
Don't know the history? I'm from the city of stop-and-frisk me
The cops is jiggy, they spot the blickey then try and get me
My pops a Willie, said "Give her fifty, she pop her kitty"
He Bad Boy and he Poppa really, it's not a Biggie
See my committee, block offici', it's not an ishy
Or I'm too lazy to cross roads, if not, I'm busy
It's not a mystery who shot Ricky, but where the difference
Between the tré and the dough boy, we bred different
So bear witness, this can leave you with head missing
If y'all can hear me, I guarantee you the feds listening
So I be spittin' in barcode, nothin' left in the tap, dog
And after the last call, the bar close
This my Cohiba, cigar blow
Even Tony Stark knows the tension is thick as Wallabee Clark soles
But did I mention I'm sick and gotta be hardcore
Hard-boiled, taking your base, that's what we ball for
Money over bimbos, that's what the Mob for
Rappers stuck in limbo 'cause they were settin' the bar low
Every time I rhyme on a track, it's like a convo
King, we put the nine to your back, it's like you Rondo
When it come to John, though, I'ma slaughter a John Doe
Drag him through a drive-thru like he ordered the combo
Hands on him, we wild style with the cans on him
Then come defeat, that's my beliefs and I stand on 'em
Give you the beats, no Doc Dre or brands on 'em
Some men want 'em, these verses hot and the fans want 'em
I'm from the school of them hard knocks with harder standards
I've been a hard rock before they added the Arm & Hammers
My meth bananas, bogus method, we call it bama
Gun on the camera so we can shoot them in panoramas
Na-nana-nana, I'm feelin' petty, but watch your manners
Use proper grammar so we could stop with the propaganda
No type of slander but tell them hoes, "I'm not your Santa"
Just want the body, nobody tryin' to pot-and-pan ya

Evangelist appear with seven candlesticks
Now the Qur'an is on my mantle
I meditate before I channel this
Energy from the North
I can put Loki on a cross
I snatch the hammer from Thor
Then knock Odin off his horse
I choke Hercules out with his own chains
My strong game in front of Clark Kent
I finger-fuck Lois Lane
At the same time I pick-pocket Bruce Wayne

Shake them niggas

Scary hours no money out, smash the Guinness Stout
Play the outfield, Lucille, switched cracks on shields
She's a rich fiend sacrifice her fam shift them niggas
To Queens
Guess jeans she charged thirty-five beans
Hit the cell phone, regulate with well known Tone
A Wally kingpin who also slam the strike edition
What up? Corleone smoke the bone, Tone phone me
What up? He tried to slang there, address him with chrome only
Grady with the gray beard, transporting for him
Rocking Nike Air, Rastafarian bird, piping that
Switchin Benzes, ten carat nigga with gold lenses
Fronting like he's sitting on a lump, he's sitting on junk
You wanna pull a heist, draw guns and robberies
You wanna rock rep, step in yellow Wallabies
Names arraigned, they're Century Fox, little Glocks
Them niggas with stocks, wheelyin'  blocks
Rich lifestyle, spoiled like an ordinary white child
But right now, Sun it still shine, shed light now
Breakdown, liquidate God, fucking grab the nickel plate

I remember sticking fiends at the one-six-ooh
When we was starving, ducking five-oh, paying 'em dues
Times is hard in the slums I'm from, they got us barred in
We warring and cage dodging, ripping and robbing
Got the NARC sabotaging, slipping cracks in
Your camouflaging, now you snitching on the squadron
That's something niggas can't pardon
City overrun by young gun with bad intention and Wu-Wear garment
So I see no need to mention, the potency
Of a sting from a killa bee, kicking the battery
Out the back of them wisecracks
Distorted for your get high, you hijack
These friendly skies ain't for you, they for me and mine
This the year of the grimy nigga, ragtime
Keep these niggas on the run, peep my Clan emblem
Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from

Catch us swimming with these sharks now, you rap villains
(I feel the same way you niggas feeling)
We feel the same way you feeling, let it be known (let it be known)
What the blood clot you niggas dealing, you crash dummies
Cash rules, still don't nothing move but the money

Aiyyo strongarm that kid right there with wavy hair
Billy Johnson snatched him out his whip in Times Square
Took his Pumas, nameplate, dude lost weight
Summer '88, started a fight, that can't wait
Ask Dorothy, same kid pussy up in Marcy
Blazing that Ted Rossi up in The Marquees
He lost like a hundred ounces, Jake rushed his houses
Had him on the porch, ass no trousers
This souped up, individual stuck, the new stuff
Same kid crying on the stand with Judge Kuffner
Kissed him with odd numbers three to nine style
Before he left he flashing his face like Denzel
Richard Dale took his Beaver, Un threw up all in his whip
Mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
His shape-up was all fucked up, Heze had me laughing
God you see how he was laid out in the grass
With dirt in his mouth, Slim woke him up told him he wild out
Blood leaking from his teeth he smiled like he gummed out
Big bolo, stacking his shit, financed a Volvo
He copped his shit from a small coffee shop in SoHo
He still pussy, he sell his dust up on the Lower East
Posing like he rapping out...3Embed

I was dashing through the hood
Eighteens with the whip smoke gray
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh
Smokin' all the way (Hahaha)
With my all-star team
Bitches see our shine
Yo, son, we gotta make that cream
Whether raps or nicks and dimes
They call me Rollie, watch me poly with the wide body Dinali
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey
I swarm like paparazzi
She popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block me
Sippin' on rum, Bacardi got me toxy
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti
Snatch the cream, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giulianni
Like I'm still coppin' big eighths from papi
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky
Kamikaze, might karate lock ya head
Like a natty dread, then pour myself Calarasi
Professionally trained, I aim for your artery
I give the autographs but charge for photography
Not hardly kid, you awkward Godbody
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wally's
Spark the broccoli, spaz off this ghetto opery
Or catch the hot seat, you're batty bwoy without ya posse

Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?
While the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
Tainted the fabric of an empire, was torn apart
Brought to a halt from a front full assault
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results
They say the swordsman sift electrical volts
The audience go nuts with loose screws and bolts
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
It was layin' in the zip drive from chest five

Slept on this hazardous enterprise
Hit from the back from a long range attack in disguise
Weeks of captivity became months
Those who were holdin' it down now hold a pump
Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin' niggas wanna eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin' wider circles of destructions
So we attack with the cannon blazing
From the terrifyin' to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But their bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear peace in my voice?
Or that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus
The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style

To critic what I write, that's my muh'fucking word
Blah blah blah, like N'Sync
Kiss that ass bye bye bye knahmsayin'? I ain't playin'
Many shall come, few chose to stay exact
Track after track I'm fightin' for survival
Before me I see hills and mountains then sway
The words got 'em moving, the crow is like the ocean
I walk water holdin' y'all suspended with the vocal
What's the total people that came to see the gods?
I gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
Potency, high-level content
Side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
All ages, streets to cages, split faces
Shoutin' nuff love to the peeps from Miami
We live from Pulaski, it's Fred Glassy

This is grown man talkin', coward I'll split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, swiftly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a brutal fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

I got my uzi back
You, dudes, is wack, face it, the Wu is back
I got my uzi back
You, dudes, is wack, face it, the Wu is back

Shop and cop rocks, watch the top notch in action
Begin to make your head spin
Wu-Tang my brethren, we bang like veterans
They paid for record spins, taste the medicine
Or face the double M, we came to trouble them
Hustle them for they 20 mill' then buckle them

Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard

Ayo, ayo, waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay 'em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set
If I don't eat
Then we already met fly-ass bro, liver than coke
You might also like
Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in

That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip

Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys
Matching cap, razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess
Studyin' math, signin' 7 and a Sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)
Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin' with their backs out
Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs

You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryna get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime
Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowing without any knowing
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow8Embed
Wake up... wake up
Wake up...

Wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
Straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put, put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
Priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in

Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
I'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real

The world won't get no better

We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

Poor reparations, the Bush administration
Unequality, martial law, segregation
False hood, false teaching, false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite in this song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me
Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me
We gonna change the world (x5)27Embed
A game of chess is like a swordfight
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible
Raw, I'ma give it to ya with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MCs approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains

Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with 'nough niggas and 'nough guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an eighteen-wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'

Drug-dealin' styles with phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I gots to get my props and win it, yo

Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got forty niggas up in here now who kill niggas' father

My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gat
Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shit, boom
Just warmin' up a little bit, ah-eh-em
Rappin'-in' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stackin'-in', hands clappin'-in'
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
Dun-dun-dun, enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff, huff, puff
I'm gonna catch your bluff, tuff, rough
Kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, m-m-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Pretendin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot RZA
Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ho gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack

Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gat
Speakin' of the Devil, psych
No, it's the God, get your shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again, and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad rough task
When I struck, I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your eight-plus-one, start flippin' and trippin'
Niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son

Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang (Toad style is immensely strong)
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist, hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender

My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?

The Inspectah Deck

I smoke on the mic like "Smokin' Joe" Frazier
The hell raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get ya flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' "Goodbye" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and hit ya with sixteen shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, ah
You might also like
It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left, ah
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "sue"
Enough respect due to the one-six-ooh
I mean O, yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*

Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Ow, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U

Yo, you best protect ya neck
First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass

For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes
Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's ten o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style
The ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be
Comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare, G-Gka-Genius
Take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight

Hear Me, See Me
Welcome to Soundview Projects
Bronx New York, 10473

Intersection action ribs touching
New gutter smacks replacing the whole Dutchman
Loose mamis fucking, they're definite land mines
Dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs
Empty in the webbings broke and underpaid
Fighting federal cases with legal aids
The unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat
Can get you in a 8 by 5, the corner's younger
I smell, feel, touch and taste their hunger
Next in line to rep these street signs to their blunder
Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony
These niggas wanna be Pistol Pete - without the penalty
His last words, promise me this much in death:
"Don't let my boy grow up to retrace my steps"
Minne- stay safe move quiet and get it
If you encounter opposition get a inch from their face with It
Later amigo, digest the data end discreetly
Sex money and boss my ties to hear me see me
True villain, face covered, driving gloves
Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove
They say that grown men lay on they prey, took shorts in the street
Came back and made up for that with that white sheet
Revenge is best served cold, get it the same way you give it
This ain't fear I just need to get away with it
So don't stop over here, you're looking at me like I'm lame
But I'm looking at y'all like "You call this the drug game?"
Grandchild hosing sims, put the heroin in queens
Put Pops Freeman on in the early seventies
I sat in rooms with money machines
Drugs sitting three feet off of the floor, cover the smell of the raw
Chess moves like Barksdale, my connects untimely
King Henry from 12th street flooded the Bronx in the 90's
03 scene MVP and one Accord
Boss makes decision paper wins awards

See Me, Hear Me
Welcome to Brooklyn, New York City 11206
Roosevelt Projects, wild rose water the plant

Son you know what it is
From the moment that you come over the bridge
And if you don't ride with me I'ma show you some shit
I'mma show you how my niggas stay sure in the mix
I'mma show you where the pain in the poetry is
Ghetto young'ns spend a lot of time alone in the crib
BET on the screen, walls and posters of BIG
Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6
Blazing up the ambro', with glow over their wrist
Hop in the game knowing the risk, still down to load up their clip
Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip
But when you hear a head crack there ain't no rolling again
Snatch the dice and everything you want is going to them
That's how it happens
Good people, bad habits
Diabetics, crack addicts, asthmatics
Searching for the truth, leaping through the holy tablet
The Bible, the Quran, or the ten crack commandments
Speak on it God: "What's today's mathematics?
The five day forecast? The Dow Jones average?
The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers?"
Life is a test and we've all got to answer
The streets keep calling. It's hard not answer
And on my government-my attribute-my all
So it's only natural I holla black and respond
Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down
Cock hard with no coat we do not fuck around
That's what it is (All Day)
That's what is niggas (Official, Official)
That's how it is niggas (M-Don, M-Definite)
BX, BK live all day
Get with it

She got the red bottoms with cheetah print
She got that python Louie pocketbook
And her leggings from an ostrich
I got a snakeskin duffle full of meds
I got a gun that'll kill an elephant
My little bitch flyer than a pelican
She got a jacket made of sharkskin
And there ain't no place she hasn't been

She from the jungle, she from the jungle
Big tall Amazon out the jungle
Jungle, she from the jungle
She just a rose in this concrete jungle
Jungle, jungle, I introduced that girl to my anaconda
Jungle, jungle, I'm just like Tarzan living in the jungle

Shake your ass for Young Thug cam little nigga
You killin' all these strippers, Brian Nichols
I'm ready to make a dill, no pickle
Baby girl, I'll make you famous, you'll blow up, like a missile
Boom, boom
Hoes with no class, you know that's truancy
I see your ass, I'm pursuin' it, don't ruin it
I'm going to jail for influencin'
You done shake your ass for all my ones
Guap boys, buy you Louie sandles, no Deion
I got a stick that'll light up the room just like neon
We done have a ball here, rich baby just like (?)
Straight out the jungle, jump in a bitch like kowabunga
Got birds so she know they mundo
Spend a half milli on my face like social

But we ain't coppin' no waiter 'cause, shit, I'm the waiter
Why? 'Cause she make me wait for her
Now I adore her and I love it
I tried puttin' it at the top but the cash is still above it
And if you think you can fold this cash, you may pack up and leave
And I'm through talkin', so I'ma let the song bleed
Like yeah, like yeah, like yeah
Then that felt like I was on the throne
And I took me a shot of Patron
And I called that ho phone and told her, "Get back, come"
But if she don't
