5 ContributorsShady Life Lyrics
Jeezy, Kelly, oh!

(Shady life) Crazy
Way these niggas switchin' up, I swear the shit crazy
Tell 'em get they own but these niggas too lazy
Somebody please tell me why these niggas so shady
This 'bout that (shady life), crazy
Way these niggas switchin' up, I swear the shit crazy
Tell 'em get they own but these niggas too lazy
Somebody please tell me why these niggas so shady
This 'bout that (shady life)

Ain't nothin' like seeing ya dogs run to the blogs
Couldn't be something for my haters just because
Thought there was rules to this shit so fuck laws
If you ain't gon' play the game how it go then fuck y'all
Yeah, startin' to make me a believer
Seen a bunch of real niggas actin' like divas
Spill they feelings on the Internet
Let's focus on these billions, I ain't into that
Yeah, don't be arguin' wit' these broke niggas
It's like a junkie tryna argue with the dope, nigga
And nowadays, everybody want attention
And, to get that, yo' name they gotta mention
So caught up in the fame, I don't know what fame is
Niggas I thought real start to act like strangers
You laugh cause they fucked up, you livin' the life
Give a fuck what you say, that shit trif'
They livin' that
You might also like
(Shady life) Crazy
Way these niggas switchin' up, I swear the shit crazy
Tell 'em get they own but these niggas too lazy
Somebody please tell me why these niggas so shady
This 'bout that (shady life), crazy
Way these niggas switchin' up, I swear the shit crazy
Tell 'em get they own but these niggas too lazy
Somebody please tell me why these niggas so shady
This 'bout that (shady life)

They tell me "Young nigga, get to the money, just one thing"
"Soon as you get to the money, it's gon' bring"
"Whole lotta fakers, even more haters"
"Gang of niggas you don't fuck wit' ask you for favors"
Can't forget rule #1, get to the paper
Can't forget 1 Â½, fuck the haters
You know how I do, I smoke all flavors
Never been a better public enemy, ask Flava
Cut your grass, see the snakes
Open up the brick, see the flakes
Soon as you hit you a lick, here come the hate
Man, these niggas come out of everywhere, who opened the gate?
Same nigga thinkin' your friends pro'bly your foes
Same nigga thinkin' your foes pro'bly some hoes
Niggas really bitch-made, nigga, and it shows
Keep playin' wit' it, nigga, get yo' punk ass exposed
'Member that
(Shady life) Crazy
Way these niggas switchin' up, I swear the shit crazy
Tell 'em get they own but these niggas too lazy
Somebody please tell me why these niggas so shady
This 'bout that (shady life), crazy
Way these niggas switchin' up, I swear the shit crazy
Tell 'em get they own but these niggas too lazy
Somebody please tell me why these niggas so shady
This 'bout that (shady life)

All the pain in this world
It ain't nothin' new
Ain't nothin' new, ooh-ooh
So don't you be so surprised
When they turn on you
They turn on you
They 'bout that shady life

(Shady life) Crazy
Way these niggas switchin' up, I swear the shit crazy

Way these niggas switchin' up, I swear the shit crazy
Tell 'em get they own but these niggas too lazy
Somebody please tell me why these niggas so shady
