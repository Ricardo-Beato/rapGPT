(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)

(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed, 'cause I got it goin' on

I'm a nice dude (Uh), with some nice dreams (Yep)
See these ice cubes? (Uh) See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide-wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, tryna ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
*Ticks* You should think about it, take a second *Ding*
Matter-fact, you should take four, B

My nigga Kid Cudi, that's my little buddy
Call some hoes up, and get some cutty cutty
What's your life like? Mine's is kinda tight
A long way from hustlin', that china white
My people love me, the fans love me, I'm all go
If you ain't showin' love, then what you call for?
I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price
So alike and in need of my wife
Smoke 'til I'm gone, Dogg on the throne
I'm world-wide known, I'm a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it 'cause I can, I earn my spot
You see the plan, I'm just fuckin' with my fans
I turned out to be the better man, important to life
You understand while I'm puffin' on this gram

Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll

Got a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin'
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated
Steady wantin' freaky hoes, then I want a lady
Holdin' the fam down, and my close homie
The peoples who were there, when some sucka left me lonely
Phony, when you see a nigga don't approach me
Made it to the top baby, that's on me
Koch tryna claim that they made me
However you feel, another real fugazzi
I keep it one hundred, never frontin', don't need be
I'm in another zone, no place you could see, my nigga
Conyo to haters that don't know
Low pro, how a nigga like from costo
The one fans love, who was always approachable, yo
And I rep the double O, smokin', eatin' Cheerios

And I'm still on the scene, you gotta love it
All out in public, the people want to touch it
I need a blunt with the stuffin'
Nigga, it's nothin' for me to chill out, post up at the house
With Madden on the screen, and smash on the homies
Hollywood nice now, everybody on me
And on the blogs talk shit like they know me, hm

Guten tag, Ich liebe diesen Tag
Ich can't find on this sing
Oh mein Gott, ich glaube Conan, sign con me
Ich swear to God, dizzy unbusted

You know my story
I did a lot of balling
Been around the world
A lot of girls calling
A lot of panties falling
Out the air and on the stage
If my life was a book
You wouldn't miss a page
But none of that really matters
When I cut my eyes and roll
Seen her pass by
I damn near dropped my folds
I'm like Snoopy breathe
Kush had me gone
I couldn't think straight
Pimpin' was all alone
Shoulda seen her walking
Like a model do
If this was Twitter
I would follow you
Open your world to new things
Let Doggy take your hand
I'm seeing wedding rings
Call Diddy lets make a band
She got me hot
I don't want to leave
I seen the world's best
But she's something to see
And now I'm on a plane
Feeling so ashamed
I couldn't catch her name
I call her Miss Everything
You might also like
Tell me have you seen her (Seen her)
Five something, pretty face, and them big brown eyes
Small little waist
When the floor goes tremble
Make a grown man cry
Oooh
I keep runnin' the tune at her
But the numbers never got exchanged
Every town, every city
Got a, a Miss Everything
Miss Everything (Miss everything)

You know my story
I rocked a lot of crowds
Sold millions of records
I love my fans so loud
I got a thousand cars
And all hopes of bein'
A real superstar
I live super far
But none of that really matters
When I caught my eyes in Spain
She walked into me
Like you did your thing
In that Spanish accent
The one I love so much
She looked like an angel
One I wanted to touch
I blinked my eye for a second
And then she disappeared
When I see that Pretty Woman
I felt like Richard Gere
Boss dog ain't never been one to watch it pass
Unless we in they room, and they leave
And I watch that ass
But baby something else
Somehow I didn't speak
I been a player so long
Maybe I reached my peak
And now I'm on a plane
Feeling so ashamed
I didn't catch her name
So I call her Miss Everything

Yah, you know my story
I seen a lot of hoes
A lot of gold diggers
Luda call them pros
I don't call them back
And thats just how it goes
Most people call me Snoopy
Or S-N-double-O
But none of that really matters
When I was in New York
I had a show at The Garden
You know, poppin' corks
That's when I seen her
From a distance
She smiled and froze
Now everything I learned in the game
Told me she chose
And I don't miss a beat
This time I gotta speak
She looked magnificent
Like something to eat
Hey co, I can't let her go
I made my way through the crowd
Let's get out of here

I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drank to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch?)
Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch, "Please
Raise up off these N-U-Ts, 'cause you gets none of these"
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze biatch, I'm just
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke, shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raising up out the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

In the world of change, here I am
Tryin to have some thangs
So what you need is some game, to get your money man
Ohh baby, in the world of paper, paper

Thinkin of a master plan
Cause ain't nuttin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin funny
Stop smilin, cause still don't nuttin move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin this
Feelin out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thang
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full {*echoes*}

Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy

Huh, it's like that that there
They love it when I let down my hair
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson
Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel
So I let 'em all come to my back table
Roll up and lick the paper if they able
Bottles of everything, models and everything
Everything goes and yes I mean everything
Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'
So, I invite her over to my party
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie
No autographs, I ain't signin' now
Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down
My life is like one big highlight
Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life

Cameras flashin', police passin'
Every little model wanna give me some action

Get some m_nage, durin' every visit

Daily, I stay G'd up with my khakis and my 'gars
Burn, then I pick up my two dogs and bend the curb
That's gangsta, gotta grab a fresh {?} bud
Now I bend it up like a thug
And my Chrysler on two dubs, plus, G'd, up

That people are the same, they all share the same fears
Share the same tears, and i over the years

And what i do, i do for the benefit of me and my kids
Dig that

Quick draw - I'm fast on my heat
Buckle up and take a ride in my passenger seat
Put your feet to the pavement, look at my behavement
See how, the be how, and trip what I was raised with
Can't no nigga fade me, bangin' like the 80s
Had a lot of money with a handful of babies
Boy, this shit is crazy - straight from the turf
Hit the red alert and ask Mack it better work
So I slide to the spizot, right behind the lizide
And get a bag of pizot, avoid getting hizocked
Cause hizabs is on me, they want me, but I can't fold
I'm an Eastside rider, I was born to roll
Never tell to be told, never sell to be sold
On the level, what a rebel, boy, I stay in control
And I'mma let you ride with me so you can see how it goes
And we'll hit the track and let you peep out some hoes
And if you like what you see, and you agree with me
Then you enjoy my perspective of the LBC
Kick back and roll up, and mix the Henny with the soda
We ridin' like we flyin' through the system of solar
And the aroma of doja, the atmospherin' we hearin'
Since I'm the driver I'm ridin' with rear-end super suspension
The misson can't be completed 'til you get that vibe

But I can't and I ain't, so just roll up some more of that dank
And pour some more of that drank
And hand me that CD so I can let the shit knock

This is DJ EZ-Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I gets loced and loony, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin' that I learned in Tha Pound, so how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho?
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothin' else to do with it, pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one
Trick-ass bitch

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth?
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger (Uh-huh)
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Snoop Doggy? I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it, 'cause you know I don't love it
Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 red, to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'
Just get on your knees, and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout (Woo)

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none48Embed

Flossy bitches in leathers
Smellin' like Prada, shakin' their tailfeathers

Why you talkin' bout me? You best watch your ho'

Ain't got no time to sit and holler, come swallow me or somethin'
Since tomorrow wasn't promised, I'ma party 'til I die
Big glass of Moet, share with my niggas in the sky
Tipsy on a fifth, I'm gettin' frisky with a bitch
Oh, yeah, I used to hit her sister, but that was in '96
Leave a tip with the bartender
You little slender, fine ho', I'm comin' home with you
Get more explicit, baby, touchin' on my dick, I'm rushin' to get a fix
Another shot'll set us off, it cost to get with this

And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin' bone

In my neighborhood, flavor's good, roll up, put some papers to it
Straight into it, gon' make him do it, that thing can do it fo sho
Get my lift on, while get my spliff on, fo sho
Break bad, stay cool, way cool, roll a doob
Old school, paid my dues, spray these fools, ladies drool

And it'll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night
What do you like?
When you smoke with the Dogg, you had the time of your life

Boys hating, I'm just counting up the money I just made
And what I'm making make a nigga make a million dollars later
Smoking getting high pays
I like my eyes glazed
Ain't empty out my ashtray in days
At my house playing pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats

Is it because I'm black?
Somebody tell me, what can I do?
(Cause their ain't enough bars
To hold the the drama that we've been through)

Right here, right now, I do declare
That I'm more than a gangster, mack, pimp or a player
I swear I ain't never told on nobody
It started in '82 at a 'hood house party
Half Ded, Lil' Loc and my nephew D
Not knowin' what we do, but this is RTC
Heart sparked, puttin' flags in Tucane Park
I leave the house for school, but I come back after dark
You feel me?


More power, more leadership - unifying Bloods and Crips
I used to smoke a pack a day, I used to have to pack a K
Now I've got brothers in suits in my faculty
Pushin' peace in the streets - North, West, South and East
Student of the game, yeah it's time to make a change
So I'm following, no more swine swallowin'
I'm gon' just walk the walk of a righteous man
Try my best to rewrite this plan

Farrakhan is a prophet and I know it cause he show it
And he told me, so I'm teachin' brothers how to be peace
What's wrong? We too strong, and if we all get along
They could never penetrate us, all they do is motivate us
Haters...
The enemy is always watching for leadership that will rise among black people because it is only by organizing effectively that you can change the reality under which we live

Niggas like me don’t never quit
And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch

Don’t you dare try to save that ho
I know that you like her but you can’t wife her

Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

I pull up in a Full Metal Jacket
Pop shots, Top notch with the ratchet
I leave a nigga dead on the asphalt
Slap em in the face tell em take them fuckin’ pants off
T’d Up, G’d Up when we stance off
Two to the chest make a bitch nigga dance off
Goin’ with the Wizzin, Juice with the Gizzin’
Rides til’ I’m Risen, strong with the pizzen'

Yeah, man
Do you ever sit and wonder sometimes
What if?
I mean, like, for real though
I mean, sometimes I just sit and think to myself, like
What if?
I mean, that's a big question, right?
If "if" was a fifth, we'd all be fucked up
But what I really wanna know is:
What if?

(What if?)
We had a reckless motherfucker
That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg
(What if?)
We never had a nigga like Big P
From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof"
(What if?)
We never had a real woman
That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was
(What if?)
We had to take it
If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it

Social media only ask the he-say, she-say shit
And where would I be without Tone, Pimp , and DJ Quik?
Act like you knew that
I'm glad I had somebody tell me
"Don't think with your dick, boy! Don't do that!"
Come on, you know me, man
I pimp on, I entertain, man
That's why I stay inside my  lane
I gotta be careful when I show you stuff
'Cause these haters don't like you if you know too much
Yo, ow give it up if you like this
And you prefer the peace
And won't get mad if you don't have no one to fight with
We pull the cards around a phony
My sister told me, "Niggas act hard around they homies"
Because the West don't need no beef
We need our  and our roaches
And our Reres and our Monique
So stay prayed up, armor on, I got it
What if you talked to that man
And understood before you shot him?

(What if?)
The Bloods and the Crips was the same
And all niggas joined one gang
(What if?)
My granny wouldn't have died
Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side
(What if?)
You could do what you don't
And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that
(What if?)
A phony is a phony, a homie is a homie
And you know the big homie don't play that
Catch him, stick him
Rip it, ride it
La di da di, we shout out the party
The old me, the new you, you niggas tryna do me
You better off tryna do you
Boo hoo, voodoo, taboo
DP, GC, what it really do?
I educate when I illustrate
And those the words I be teachin', preachin'
To each and everyone
Never been a scary one
Always been a down ass nigga, clown ass nigga
Reppin' my city, 
Extra extraordinaire exceptionally
Never late, predicate, elevate, levitate
My nigga, I'm way too high to ever hate
Papa Snoop in my momma Beverly, heavenly
Thank God for ya'll havin' me, for real

(What if?)
The Bloods and the Crips was the same
And all niggas joined one gang
(What if?)
My granny wouldn't have died
Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side

Signed niggas, gave jobs and I made bail
And kept a lot of motherfuckers from goin' back to jail

Oh yeah they will, oh yeah they will
But I paid no mind I get back on my grind

My backwoods packs I turn to a futon
I got my eyes on seven figures
And I'ma get it whether I move crooked like Jack Thriller’s
I’m shitting on 'em, I smell like a winner
Don't hit the bathroom for like 40/45 minutes
Redman and we up in this bitch, huh
I never cruise, I work to be the top gun
And I’m a dog off the collar, the marijuana globetrotters
You got bud, I holler

KRS in the building
Listen! Listen!
{Verse 1: KRS-One]
Too much brrr brrr brr
Too many people getting brrred 
All you hear is brrr brrr brr in the streets
People gripping they heat just to settle they beefs
Now you getting chased by police
You running to the west, running to the east
But the problem is you under the beast
Brr brr brr - now your brother's deceased
We need peace, not brrr in the streets
The brrr in Iraq lasts for weeks
Wack rappers, I'm crushing these creeps
Every time I spit they get weak
Knowledge reigns suprrreme
I take you back to the days when the telephone used to rrring
I'm reading the sacred script, KRS, Battlecat, Snoop in it, uh!

Let us begin - what, where, why or when?
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in
Blastmaster (One!), blast faster
No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous

By any means necessary, peeking out the window
Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders
Thinking how the rap game was
I dig, I dug, I push, I shove, yeah I fell out of love
But it ain't no thing, telephone ring
They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang
So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace
The honorable speaks
Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep
Cause it's truth
What's that? You don't like that?
Well we fight back. And we'll be right back

Let us begin - what, where, why or when?
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in

She throw it to a nigga, I'ma toss it
Boss nigga, boss shit, I got boss dick
Fresh fast done fucked a coffin

Old ass nigga in the club full of young hoes
Smoking backwoods with the Migos
Dranking my drank in the glass, no cup in the cut, ducked off gettin' fucked up
Nothin' but family around me
Man these hoes are astounding
She say she went to school with my young son
Fuck around and get popped with the bop gun
Cute lil' bitch
Told me that her daddy was a 8-Trey crip
I did time with the nigga, four months
Cut to the chase lil' bitch, you wanna fuck?
'Cause if you do, this's what's gon' pop
No pictures and no photoshop
Just get your lean and soda pop
Get with the program, jump in the bro-ham (Biatch)

Whenever I'm down and out I get back to myself
I roll a motherfucking fat bat to myself
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J
And not have to answer to nobody
I live my life like it's a party
So let's go cuz

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nananana

I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep
I got me a sweet
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police
You think you could smoke like me & Snoop, don't try to compete
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song
And do it however you please, you please
Today's the day to smoke weed

And you ain't gotta ask cause we major
I smoke like them old players
Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused
And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit
Only the best what you dealing with

Let the wind blow, open up the window
That girl is poison like Bell Biv Devoe
We have a barbeque to do at four
Swimming pool party in the back on the low
BYOB, and the plates of food will be laid out for free
Little kids get down, I’ll have a bus pull up with Tommy The Clown
Now do The Jerk, get crunk, go to work
And do that dance that'll make your whole damn body hurt
Playing mama dear, calm and clear

From the depths of the sea
Blowing trees in the big leagues
I got a plan, I'm going ham on all you DBs
You better double me up, safety cover me up
Single coverage won't work boy, I'll burn him up
Give me the damn ball, move the chains at the same time
Dressed to impress when it's game time, flame mine
I'm wide open, hoping, scoping out the scene
Catch a quick screen, cake walk on your whole team
Will he beam, will he run,  will he walk, talk, or will he lean
I need riders and goons when I build a team
I get it cracking with the snap of the wrist

Lost him, cross him, quarterback toss

Coach on the play, I'm hoping that he don't mess up
Ayy back up off me, you playing me close
You bout to be hot buttered on a breakfast toast
I rock it out and find my way into the endzone
A couple cheerleaders want to be in my friendzone

There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not of heard it or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horses mouth
Right then and there we can straighten it out
Because I don't get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
Because one day I just might not laugh
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass

No bitches, please
Ain't no rest for my soul til' I come clean
I'll hear from the lord if I speak
So back off and let me eat, let me feast

I'm not mad at you
Things I'm going through make me act the fool
Please don't think I'm cruel
Really normally I'm cool
There is nothing you can do
Hey
When my words are few
Things ain't what they seem
Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know god is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few
I know that I chose to backslide
But now I know the way
I was born and raised in this thing
And that's something I chose to do
Church all my life
I ain't stepped outside but now I feel the light calling me
Back to the fold
Embed
Can we get a motherfuckin' moment of silence
For the small chronic break?
A-hah, yeah
Niggas be brown-nosin' these hoes and shit
Takin' bitches out to eat, and spendin' money on these hoes
Know what I'm sayin'?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up — I never have, I never will
I tell a bitch like this:
"Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Blue Notes
You'll never go platinum"
Hey Daz, give me a light, nigga
We’d like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker, and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put yo' hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' motherfuckers tryna steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'
You might also like
You know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
Usin' my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt, seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, paddywhack, I still got the biggest sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (Why?)
Hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for the break up, so take off your clothes
And quit tryna spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
Speakin' of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize (Uh-huh)
And see where I'm comin' from — it's still Eastside 'til I die
Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinnin' to the D-O-double G, Y

It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World
(It's a Doggy Dogg World)
Oh
Well, if you give me ten bitches, then I'll fuck all ten
See my homie Snoop Dogg sippin' juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip to get papers
Styles vary, packin' flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that somethin'? Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm comin' through
One-two, three — you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, usin' hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A, she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I’m dishin' out blues, I’m upsettin' like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Rough and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in '94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on
I’m head huntin', hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' TEC-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you? You fuckin' wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin' out looney like O-Dog
Ooh (Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, ma-ma, my)
It's a Doggy Dogg World (It's your world)
The Dogg's World (It's your world)

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (All night long)
Uh-huh, 'til when? (Till the early morn')
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit for the
Tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dope shit

Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with the fat dick
'Til I die, I'm still screamin' out ("Bitches ain't shit")
Now, I'm the mack daddy, had he
Not known about the city where I'm from, dum-diddy-dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D, the gangster clique
Now as Tha Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic 'til the day that I die

It's a Doggy Dogg World

Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the area. This is another east coast, west coast event. My name is the Kid Capri. I got my man right here, we slappin' vibe and shit. You know who I'm talking about! Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg!!

I'm feeling the dough, and now I'm feeling the real
Stunning with the stunner, man, I'm one in a mil
Hold on to my hands while we walk up this hill
There's a mountain and a fountain but the waters are still
Walk in the light but I'm changing drill
Me and my homies gangbang on the field
Take a knee, make a G, follow protocol
Can't you see us kick, Capri?
Back with the Wonder Dog
Not the underdog, can't you understand?
Please believe me, I'm with Stevie
Mental wonderland
Or maybe Michael Jackson
Pure satisfaction
Rest in pussy, Hugh Hef
Playboy Mansion
Been a foe, mental fold
Split the difference punk bitch
You on a centerfold
One is soul, never told, forever G
C'est la vie, that's me

They tell me that's a good look
See, I'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all I know
So knick-knack, paddy-wack, Kid Capri and Snoop is back
We do it just it just like this that back (back)

They tried to run a game on a nigga
Word to P.E, shame on a nigga
I never paid attention
Did I forget to mention
I started up cooking up the cavi in the kitchen
Then I graduated, matter of fact I made it
Reinstated but still kept it gang related
I traveled the globe, private jets, and Versace robes
Penthouse suites, what about phony hoes?
Tanqueray glasses, smoke fills the air
And hoes with fat asses playing truth or dare
No bizaar, what a lovely pair
And they all came here just to fuck wit a player
Anytime I wanna jam, shit I'm runnin' through these hoes
Like a pack at the Coliseum
Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, and Bo Diddley
If you know like I know, you come and fuck wit me, fo' real
Tell me what you got for me
I'm getting on the good foot
And see I'm only here to rock wit ya
They tell me that's a good look
See, I'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all I know
So knick-knack, paddy-wack, Kid Capri and Snoop is back
We do it just it just like this that back (back)

And that's just how the story goes
Another Kid Capri slapper
Snoop Dogg

Good foot, on a good foot

I still want you to have my last name

I gave it to you cause you gotta have it
The Broadus family is so magic
T-Bone, You the baddest
Meet the one of us
Glad us had us ring in mind
I'm 'bout to sing a line
I'm all about you when I'm doing my time
With you on my mind
Rock around a clock, Jay and Beyonce
Michelle and Barack, all of the above
This is black love at its purest
Baby we done been through the forest
I'm talking about growing old with you
Sitting on the porch
Going through storage looking through old photos
When I used to rock the Death Row logo
And you was right there, you still here
So all that arguing, fighting

Jumping out the mother fucking gym

It's your uncle Snoop Dogg
Let me show you how we keep the trap jumpin' on the West Side
The best side

McDonald's all American
There's really no comparing it
I play some D and pop a three and fly up in the air again
First-round draft pick came in with this rap shit
Get a lot of moolah to keep you a bad bitch
Those were the rules, I aimed for the full pie
Took a slice and now I'm popping at the bull's eye
I'm equivalent to excellence
With my weaponry, I'm stepping while I'm rapping it
Now could I should I would I do things your way
And end up dead or in jail? My nigga no way
It's like some good hot head with no foreplay
I won't be caught so I cut you like I'm OJ

Whole family had a bag, I'm the plug's cousin
But I found my own plug, the ain't front me nothin
But my nigga Black did give me that Gucci belt (black)
This where I put my heat I never leave it on the shelf (strapped)
My heart froze I don't ever leave it on my sleeves (nah)
I got hoes I ain't never met a bitch I need
So when she tell me that she leaving i'm a let her leave
My aroma in her room ain't gon' let her breathe

And all some niggas ever did was run they fucking mouth
Had to keep it moving had to keep my head up
Had to re-up and recoup to get my bread up
Had to take a nigga boo and put her legs up
Her nigga probably do the same with my main thing
Still ride with the flag for the gang gang
I'm a real trap nigga, I don't gang bang
I done been across the map with the propane
They'll point a nigga out get your old man
Put the noodle in her mouth like the low mein
Kill a nigga with a strap like a gay bitch
Made a band in a minute off 8 sips
Tried to walk away from trapping but I can't quit

Six million ways to die, choose one

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt
Death becomes all niggas, anybody killer
You know what the deal is, nigga, you know what the real is

I see some off-brand niggas on the corner flaggin' me down
Sayin', "Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Ayo, what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?"
I said, "If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the gang"
It's like this, they don't understand
It's an everyday thang to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up with you? I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
Or Compton and Watts see D-O-Gs, now
You can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang, one gun
Is all that we need to put you to rest
(Pump-pump) Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping
Six feet deep in, fucking with the Pound is

Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, ooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon
'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon (Ayy, nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you (I won't leave you)
Until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half-stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself, motherfucker, 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the Devil
Now roam through the depths of Hell
Where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

Now picture this
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine to crack your fuckin' chest plate
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally roughneck
Now everybody scream, 'nuff respect to the X
'Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living
Word to mama and my drama, dilemma

As I look up at the sky

I'm shaking and they break in tryna save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn, I see demons
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better
How long will I live? Eternal life and forever
And will I be the G that I was?
I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes, my son, my eyes are closed

Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Mama and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again, but anyway
I get fronted some ki's to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Mama a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
Just remember who changed your mind
'Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine
Indeed, agreed, proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want more
'Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really though (Check it out)
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izzel, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
'Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas 'cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war
Pops off, 'cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Mama, I'ma ride for you, Baby Boo

I'm gonna tell you a story
I want to tell you a story about a man that's been so good to me
And when telling this story
I hope it bless you
Because I want you to sit your kids down, and tell them this story

Back when I was a little boy, you see
My life wasn't always perfect (perfect)
I remember my grandma praying
And she said one day it'll be worth it (worth it)
She said, "Sit yourself down and listen to me
And let me tell you a little story
This story won't take to long
But I'ma tell you about his glory,"
She said

My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need

I said it happened sixty years ago
When I was washed up in his blood
Saved my soul and he set me free
Now I'm praising the lord above
I never thought that I could change
Until he saved a wretch like me
Now I'm here to tell the story
So that that you will be set free!

Well once upon a time in the Church of God
There was sinners and saints
Evens to odds
Do's and don'ts
Wills and won'ts
The haves to the have-nots
Will be sittin' up front
Gettin' the sermon up close
 the reverend  the offerings
We live in a benevolent lifetime, so stay right
I'm preachin' 'em teachin' 'em givin' em more than a look
My granny raised me right about the Good Book

I said, My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need
My God!
Is the man that died for me

All that was left was the stone
The Sword it was on
Two feet, on two wings
Blood and meat from the bone
A risen kingdom, but no mobile phones
Just faithful messengers
Everyday is being used in mysterious ways
And everything is a cost with some pain
Some lonely days, Jehovah knows

In spite of miracles, doubt abounds
Octo-, with tentacles
I can't make it without the faith to know

Don't you worry, don't you fret
Has there ever been a time when God has failed you yet?
Don't you worry, don't you cry
Just keep your head facing toward the sky
When I was sinking, He lifted me
When I get lonely, He comforts me
He's always there when I need Him the most
Filled my soul with the Holy Ghost

Okay to let your flaws show
Nobody is perfect
Hard for me to bow down

Eastside Long Beach to be exact
(I was raised in the hood)
Where the grass is greener and the Crips are much meaner
(We got your back, I was raised in the hood)
I’ll never turn my back on the hood
Yeah you can take me out the hood
But you can’t take the hood up outta me

Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the 20s
Yeah I’m stealing niggas, please what you know bout that
I do it everytime, told em 1800 had em mixing it with lime (oh weee)
My life is like a movie, I was thuggin in the beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi
Bitch, choose me, cause I’m going to the top
Rap or the rock, them hoes say I’m on bitch
Whenever will it stop
I was poppin’like it’s on, slamming Chevy’s up the block

Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope

These suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news
She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this Crippin', oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right
Eyes open cause niggas get stuck on seez-ight

Thats tha one thang I learned about tha gang bang
If you gon gang bang
Ya gots to be able to bang by yourself man
So whether you bangin for crip or blood
You better bang for sumthin young thug
Cuz you'll get banged on not by bangas
But by Johnny Law cuz they love to hang us (I hear ya)
I ride wit ya dogg if you can get me to tha border
My baby mama flipped out and dipped out wit my daughter
I oughta trip on that bitch I oughta flip on that bitch
I can't trip cuz she look like my daughter and shit
So I'm a load up my clip and go ridin high
And every police car that I see ridin by
I autograph their car wit my brand new lid
Drinkin to tha set and hope my dogg young have head
Throwin up DPG for L-I-F-E cuz thats all I see
Wit love for the LB

Tell 'em how we do, tell 'em what we do
This is what we do nigga - gangsta's talk!
Tell 'em one more time - gangsta talk!
All the homies in the hood - gangsta talk!

To my nigga Eastwood - gangsta talk!
Kurupt and Daz - gangsta talk!
Gangsta's ride, uhh, do what gangsta's do
Bandanna hangin from the rear view
Too smart, load them up, hold 'em up (though)
We could go head up, and I'll fold 'em up slow
There's a gangsta loose, callin all cars
Just left the house in some blue Allstars
Passin by on them thang, it's a brown MC
Niggas goin buffin DPG (Dogg Pound, Dogg Pound)
Niggas mad doggin bumpin a bank account (wood)
But I don't recognize the busta
So I hit up the hood, wit one hand on the heater
The other in the air, Dogg Pound gangsta's yo, we don't care
I gots to watch myself - especially my health, before anything else
My life, my wealth, I'ma G, and I do what gangsta's do
And they do it like me and my G Tray Deee

In the ? lets see what quest over seas
Eightball slippin, Dogg Pound trippin
Back in the mo', where we don't give a fuck

By them same motherfuckers who supposed to be killin me
Peelin me, and ya niggas ain't feelin me
Bad news, seem to travel fast
When you on the mash, and all about'cha cash

Haha..

Layed back, actin a nut, waitin 'till we 'rupt
No remorse, as we bust, let her feel the dust
Let 'em do what we gotta do, fuckin shit up
Let it be known - Daz Dillinger, rough to the bone
And all alone through ya neighborhood at high exhaust
High stylin and profilin, niggas comin after me
In actuality they face the technicality
Let 'em feel the battle, it was a tragedy
Everywhere a nigga die for the salary
Pray to God, pray to Lord, watch after me
Prepair the back sniff streets mentality
It's the gang and we mad and we walk and we stalk
And we do what we do after dark
Niggas keep doin what the fuck they gotta do
And we do what we do when we mash wit our crew bitch (ssh!)
Dillinger, willin ya and killin ya
Doin what I gotta do, it's blood that I'm spillin ya (yeah)
All over your floor; tell the fat guy "Ignore"
Break down your door and let kick ya one more!
Gangsta strait out! (bitch)

I'm sittin' in a over crowded tank
I'm tryna see which nigga these niggas plottin to gank
Cause if it's me, it's on (Sup, homie)
Loc, the Ese wit the black knights just got stole on
And he fell to the ground
Plus, his homie's ain't around so he better get a beat down
It's not a jack for his scratch nor his shoes
It's life in the county and the county gives plenty blues
One point for the black guys
They rolled him up, swelled and belled
And left him with two black eyes
He still alive so he know what's next
Any nigga they catch slippin' they gon' put him to rest
So I made my best to protect my chest
On point all night cause if I sleep I might
Not make it in this world of fools
I might come up missin' if I'm slippin' in these County Blues
1 - Niggas fuck around in they County Blues
You might come up missin', if you snooze you lose
You confused the fuckin system, when you need I be
Why? Cause it's this is gangbangology

See the first verse got'cho ass scared
But hold up, you gotta take a trip upstairs
Where the fools always wonderin?
Young nigga, welcome (welcome)

Put him on a killer row, where the killers kill and disregard
Say you don't gang-bang
Well why your homie - baby boo callin you by ya gang name? (Sup nigga?)
Uhh, later that night, a whole 'nother fight
But it's aiight, cause it's a nigga and a white
But damn, the Ese's is deep
And it look like they straght tryna creep, you peep?
Creep like T-L, on the D-L
But you fail, tryna tell Deputy Bell
Well, that shit was disrespectful, nigga

That's what'chu got checked for, and deck for
Nigga you'se a ho (you'se a ho)
Uhh, and I'mma let you know (let you know)

Snoop ***talkin w/ chorus***
Ya'll ain't even gonna believe this shit man
Remember that bitch I had
That little light skined bitch
Yea this bitch was a trip
You know how she loved to sucked a niggas dick
Every once in a while this bitch got to the point to
Where she thought she was gonna be getting
Some here and there
I told her I wasn't tryin to have that
And the bitch wipped out
So check this out
Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg
I'm at home, layin low
Everything is everything waitin on my hoe
I know its hard to imagne that a nigga on my status
Had a night like tonight look here I'm glad
Came to an end
My girlfriend slid into the bedroom with a woman
Come in, is what she said closed the door and jumped in the bed
Baby would of gave a nigga head insted of flippin and trippin
I run along with the PG, hm
And that's on DP
I mean what could I say, what could I do
Anything I say and do is a catch 22
And I knew I had a clue
Of some type of suspion
Tuesday night when I see you up at peanuts fishin'
I wasn't really trippin
At first I wasn't gonna go dippin
Then I said damn look at all these bitches
I went inside couldn't believe my eyes
Snatch up four fly bitches, time to ride
Tell by the earl pull the Bently in front
Hit me with a G thang, fuck a blunt
Ridin at the highway, thangs is going my way
Tell the bitches that we be goin to my place
Fellin like Teddy Pendagrass on the freeway
Get my dick knocked off, in a G way
Yea they know the program is set
And lovin each other and lovin my dick
It's a trip but I don't see nothin wrong with it
So you can work your thang which is Snoop
And I'ma sip this drank, thank and recoop
Cuz when you close the bar down
You know what {you know what}
Baby you a star know

Man I wanted to fly
When it come to what these women say
You know I'm the coldest

Go walk the strips, her ten toes touch the payment for mine
You know the time, cuz when it's time to make the payment  of mine
My bitch grind, make that G's stack come back and gimme that
All of that proper amount yea, my full count
And now she wants to have sex with me
I told her please sell my piece make my portion a fee
And I'm put you in position for victory
As long as you follow directions carefully
So I flossed her for a month, nephew you know whats up
I keep a bad broad servin that raw and uncut
So I send her up in peanuts for the trickin
She ran into this nigga and some bitches
Who talkin bout he gone pay in a real way

And you can get that, hit that, and split that
Boss up muthafucka and you can pimp that
Hook: Swoop G w/ chorus
I can't fuck no head doctor

And right in front of our kids!

Tryna pack up, I gotsta act up, and get my thang right
Cuz you know, it's all part of being black
No disrespect to the white, but you know

You got to do one thing and try an get some get back

That when you're black, everybody on ya back
It's true, it's a fact
That when you're black, everybody tryna take yo stack
Now watch out for the rat pack
From the black, yo' niggas in the front, yo' niggas in the back
Yo' niggas who got stack, and yo' niggas who got 'Lacs
Yo' niggas who don't get it, but yo' niggas who pack
Now you gotsta have a full game, cuz if you gone be black
You gotsta watch out, cuz these niggas want stacks
These niggas on a mission and they have to rat pack
They don't give a fuck, cuz these niggas is black
They being black about the mind, being black about paper
But being all about black ain't givin you vapors
And try to put you up on game and try to show ya
That if you ain't black, you besta get a white lawyer
Cuz I'mma tell ya and give ya the game, that
Being black is like being in the yang
Cuz they always gone label you, always gone fable you
And always gone point at you when somethin go down
And I knew, that it would be me, and not jiz-ou
Cuz they know that I roll, with the biggest black criz-ew
And we all about gettin green
But when your black tryin to get green
It's hectic, know what I'm mean?
Cuz they always gonna, stop ya - drop ya - pop ya - mop ya
And then they gonna sweep ya, up under the rug
No more gangbangin, no more hidin out thug
I'm tellin you the real, you better feel what I feel
Cuz these niggas on a mission, a mission to kill
And they ain't askin nobody and that's a fact
You better watch out if your black

Now you wonder why I put so much pressure on my brothers
But niggas is niggas, and I can't put it no other -
Way, just play and say what you wanna say
Niggas is the same all throughout the USA
I been around the world, and I came on back home
And niggas is the same, they always try to get ya boy
They like dogs, squabblin, tryin to get yours
But if you ain't gone open it, they knock down the doors
They gone take what they get, gonna get what they take
And if you gone be fake, check that shit from the gate
If you afraid of the dark, then stay out the alley
They got blacks being blacks way out in the valley
I used to be afraid, like to be shook up
Cuz niggas like you always leave the game hooked up
Tryna get yours, but you gone get it too fast
Cuz I'mma tell ya, watch them niggas
Cuz them black ass niggas on the move in the mash boy
And niggas don't care cuz they out for cash and they know
If they catch you slippin, they gettin you and gettin away
Its part of the pay, its part of the day, they do it they way
And if you black it goes on like ev-er-y-day
I don't know black on black, black for black
But blacks take off on blacks
Blacks need to realize and wake up
And see we all one color, all one game
You my sister, you my brother
So you my daddy, or you my mother
I don't know but I know we all realated
And if we stay down there's no way that they can fade it
But that's just a game peice from me to y'all
But if black on black gone continue to brawl
Then black gone fall, then black knah
Y'all better wake up and check out the black Dogg
So Snoop Dogg speak the real
It don't even make a difference if it got matching sho'real

Uh, its like that
Then your black, they out for ya stack
And its a fact, when your black, ya can't come back
Cuz if ya go to the hood, they watchin you
They will lurk in you, they gonna get you
Cuz your not payin attention, you led a nigga too much
But that nigga straight snitchin

So tell me what we do to get cheated the same

Beware, beware

Well, I got the funk that makes ya bump
So we gon funk this motherfucker right on up
Well here's a toast to the boogie while I step on in
So put your lighters in the air and let the smoke kick in
I got the motion, the potion
And once Priest hit the groove everything is in motion
We coastin through the neighborhood and lookin around
And all of my homies on lock down, or either underground
Man, I done found the only way to put mine down is to dip, skip with the homies from the Dogg Pound
Sup, Bow-Wow, how my nigga feelin?
Oh, I'm on the money mission to get a pocket full of millions
Like Sicilians, we do it mafioso
Doggy style, Dogg Pound, Death Row is the logo
I do it by my lonely cause I'm true to the code
Plus I die with the homies cause that's all I really know
Who started with me, who departed with me
Through thick and thin we heartless-ass G's
Regardless, let's see with bifocals, don't try the locals
And y'all wonder why they despise my vocals
I Fold you like crystals, rap spittin like clips do
When I dismiss you, me and my click, fool

May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

Fo' sho tho, you can't take my photo
I'm layin around in the DPG in a grey fo-do

I demolish, stay polished, got no time to rust
No dividing, multiplying cause it's never too much, like Luther
Cause ya see ain't no loser
That can get the scoop on the Super Duper Snooper
I refuse the tactics, you ain't used to drastics
I choose to mash like Land Cruisers
You know I kizick the bomb digga-dee, bomb-ba-zee

My nigga Spanky-Loc was playin basketball
And my niggas in the backyard, 'bout to squab my Doggz

Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey
Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him
Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang but it's a cold game
But when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thang
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
Cuz if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
And if I get caught I'm right back in court
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell

So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick

The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
But the rest of the pits they rollin wit me
We're layin low in the cut, holstered up in Chino
Scrappy-Du and the crew called the Gambinos
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick
Just last week y'know what? She bit the shit out of me
Man this bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet
To get the bitch up off me
And I can't tame her and I can't blame her

Who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP
And leave your ass red and yeah half-Dead
He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg
Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear
Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head
And all the kid do was cry like a bitch
His life was a pit and mine's in the shit
(Chorus)
(Beware, beware)
(Sick em) It's just me & my Doggz
I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard
Just in case you niggas wanna fuck and try to act hardEmbed
Cuz were all a little strong
In the beach where the paper's long
But as for me my only G is when I'm buss'n rocks
Now when I wake up in the morining
And I get up out my bed
I fell good, oh yes I do
Cause I still can give it up for you {What up cuz}

Cuz where all a little strong
In the beach where the papers long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks {Dogg Pound}
Cuz were all a little strong
In the beach where the papers long
But as for me I only G when I'm Buss'n rocks {So take that}

You know you gotta have heart
I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my muthafucking game tight
Cuz ever since elementary or was it pre school cool
I was a muthafuckin fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas , shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth
And it'll catch on
Cuz if it don't it's on
And cuz I ain't even slippin when I'm all alone
Sittin back laughin' in the chronic zone
Clown me, you're wrong
Surround me, you're gone
And it's the same old song
Nigga paper so long
They call him Snoop Capone
So if you want me, get him, got him
Shoot him, shot him
But now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all I LBC betta yet
That's all I DPGC

Southern hospitality
Yea (This that south shit boy)
Y'all know how we do this (shit)
What up fool
This for all my boys in Mississippi
Magnolia, McConnell (fightin south you know)
This for all my boys in Tennessee (tell 'em)
Holler at ya boy when I get there (MJG and Eightball)
All my playas in Houston
Atlanta GA (Georgia boys, in the hou-)
(We'll say sup to that New Orleans clique out there)

It's a Sunday a fun day, one day
Away from Monday, and all day ain't no gunplay
And everything is alright outside (why)
Cuz Farrakhan done put his speech down and got all the brothers to ride
For one cause, and that's how it is y'all
Wise on up to rise on up dawg
Each one teach one, let the lesson be taught
It ain't my fault your homie Tommy Boy got caught
If he was slicker than grease, he woulda been at peace
Instead tryna ride while the war was at cease

When me and Snoop was kids we always knew this kid named Tommy
His parents died left him a gang of cars and money
But Tommy was a hustler from around the way
Stayed on the northside of town, is where he stayed
He payed attention to whatever, they was games so clever
If the situation was bad it can only get better
He ran around the dope house
You might also like
So he put us up on his scheme
He knew that we was riders so he wanted us on his team
(Uh, poor Tommy)
Getcha money, size team (uh)
Getcha money man
(He was out to get paid)
Getcha money man (Poor Tommy)
Getcha money man (Me and Snoop on his team)
(Get paid) Gotta have that money man (Getcha money man)
Getcha money man (Getcha money man)

Tommy was a rider, big money
Tommy had everything, it wasn't funny
All the younger G's used to look up to him
But there was no way, that the bigger ones could do him
They would try him, try him, everytime he was slick
But he never would slip, he always had his grip
And if he did, he'd get away cuz he was just too fast
Homie up Tommy, Tommy, Tommy's out to mash
Get it, get it, get it, cuz ya gotta have it
And when ya get make sure ya grab it and stab it
Maintain it, brain it, the way ya gots to
Cuz this is somethin to rock to
Man, we stacked up dollars and Caddies
On missions muggin 'em for him
We had to gather up cash - whoever owed it to him
The hitman had hit us, niggas runnin shit
And never wantin to quit us, when the machine gun spit
Now we really deep in the game, now it's murder and drugs
No names involved when that nigga caught a slug
Tommy told us forget it, that he's always down wit us
The problems of the murder will be aquitted (young nigga)

Now word on the streets is that Machine Gun Tommy
Ridin on big ballers for a pasttime hobby
So if ya havin money, and ya smoke big weed
First thing ya need is a security team
And we provide, or should I say we ride for Tommy
My compadre, and if he say "spray em", we spray
So I suggest, you get with the 'PG
Or find yourself layin six feet dizzy

We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man.. getcha money man)
On the streets doing his thang, gettin paid
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man..)
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man..)
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man.. getcha money man)
Me and Snoop still on his team, big pimps gettin paid
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man.. getcha money man)
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man.. getcha money man..)
Check me out now man
We had money, jewelry and expensive cars
Niggas who didn't know us, finally know who we are
We was important to the neighborhood like presidents and mass
Everytime he do a lick he break us off our proper share
A couple of days Tommy was on top of the world
Threw a party with the homies, invited gangs of girls

Yeah, it was off the hook ya'know
We had everything from Indo to blow (Whhaaatt, you sniff blow?)
Oh hell no, I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin
If Tommy find out, boy he'll be trippin
So I stay A-Ok, but anyway
Tommy got somethin to say, to say, to say...

Aye look here mayne
What some people won't do for money
Yea I had these two niggas that was on my team
Ya'know, down with me like the Grey Tape
It's always the niggas that's closest to ya
That be the ones that try to get'cha, ya'knowhaImsayin
Shit I heard these ladies the other day say that pimpin was dead
I said not in my bed bitch {*echo*}
Ah-ha, that's real, I'll put that on my fiz-sound
I'm a pimp 'til I die, cuz I represent the big
As well as the small ha-ha
Big Timin baby {*echo*}Embed
Do you think it is by accident that everytime
A black leader appears on the horizon
With any kind of cleverness, or charisma he's cut down?
Malcom, Martin, Leadkur, I want you to arm yourself
And I've asked Josh to be your bodyguard
All right Dason
It might be good for Joshua to seal, like he has somethin' to do
So detatched from us, these are only for you
(Snoop Dogg)
Damn, cool, good, so good, gotta do wrong
So cold should... gotta do wrong
(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
It seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
The world is filled with so much jealousy
You don't know who to trust cause you might get shot
(Snoop Dogg)
You might get got, and you might not
Make it to see a whole 'nother day, you better
Watch your hand and watch how you play
Cause you don't know how the system might get you twisted
If you don't pay attention, and you'll come up missin'
I'mma give it to you - live and direct
Cause I know, a million niggas doin' bad and they check
They game every day but they try to find a way
But somehow, some way, there ain't no pay (uh)
It's the same game, from my town to your town
From L.A. to Chi-Town, Baghdad (that's right)
To the rebel we deliver the true game
And niggas gettin' upset cause they can't maintain (player haters)
Don't get mad cause I was blessed with a gift
To give you people what you need and no more deep shit (that's right)
Lit up, get up, sit up, I write it
Then I, put you all in the mood, you invited
So come on down and party with the pound (come on)
You ain't never heard a nigga come around and put it down
Just like the Soopa-Doopa, with no Woopers
Guranteed to comin' through the party, see you visual cooper
Take her to my criz-zay, what you dizzy-in'
I ain't gonna discuss this, no more about to bust it
And when I do it, I'm gonna touch it, no discussion
It's Snoop Dogg, I got some languages aimin' for the Russians
And the overseas g's, please
Let me get you one of these with another ill beat (number two)
I gots to do ya, like ya never been done
It's Snoop Dogg representin' Funk-2-1
I'm about the gee-ist of 'em all
Can you name a rapper who can fade the dog - hell nah
And if you can - you're lyin' to yourself
And if you lyin', you're dryin' with your cover
And if you dyin, you fuckin' with your death
I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm the top rapper, at the top of the shelf
I leave these suckers in amazement, dazement
And Death Row is still the label that pays me

I turn to the left and I turn to the right

What should I do? (should I do) Should I watch, uh?
Or should I jump in? Or should I come with the Glock?
I knocks on the door, plus "Oh No"
I gots to avoid the drama and take the slow-mo
Type of approach - I'm the team and the coach
I hooks a left turn - no burn, for your concern, you gots to learn
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I'mma give you what you earned
And if you get it, watch me spit it
I'm commited to do it and I'm a still aquitted
Never ever did it, or forget it
This guranteed to keep the party hittin'
And I'mma give you people what you need
And I'mma smoke up on just like a bag of weed
And if you into the mixture and into the rapture
Just sit back and listen cause Snoop Dogg's about to catch ya
Snatch ya and adapt ya with the shit that I got (hmm-hmm)
I'm guranteed to rock the party non-stop (that's right)
You ain't never heard a rapper who can flip this script
Guranteed to make the ho's go ahead and get whipped
And when they stop rockin' - they won't
But if you fake the funk (youse a punk), then youse a punk (haha)
You gots to keep it real with yourself baby boy (boy)
Cause if you don't then you ain't labelled "The Real McCoy"
I'm Snoop Dogg, yes I'm true indeed
I'm guranteed to light it up and ride it up and side it up
I'm guarnteed to, do my thing
Everybody in the party if ya down to bang - sing
What'cha wanna do, what ya gots to
Cause this is somethin' to rock you

Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me

So '94's arrived, nigga, back on up
And let me and my dog Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there, wherever I bails
I put it down all around, 'cause ain't shit for sale
In the coupe with the beat, flossin' off gold Ds
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much for Tha Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for gettin' us all fucked up, now check it
It's a fallout for niggas like those
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin' like hoes
Yes, y'all, walk the dogs, yes, y'all, yiggy-y'all

Beatin' your ass down to the concrete

I'm stranded on Death Row with nowhere to go
So, what's a girl to do?
Take out a crew or two, a few, what you wanna do?

Throw your guns in the motherfuckin' air

I do it big, fuck the rumors
Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas
Gangstas don't die they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted my candy
I'm somethin' like Sammy
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammi
Sippin' Chardonnay, makin' bills on my hands-free
Father Hood, now the actors can't stand me
Cause I own rap and I'm comin' for your day job
Until then, I'm chillin' at the day spa
Relax my mind and just chill

I'm a man, I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shinin' and gettin' Grammy's
But these streets won't say goodbye
 (Snoop Dogg)
I can't say goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the hood)
Goodbye (To the streets)
I can't say goodbye (To the hood)
Goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the streets)
I can't say goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the streets)
Goodbye (To the hood)
I can't say goodbye (To the hood)
Goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the homies)

I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out the homeboy
Plus my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got locked, and we don't know
If he comin' home boy
The industry tell me, just leave it alone boy
Let them do them, take care of your own boy
But I sit back, think about, before I was grown boy
Then had dreams of bein' a doe boy
Yeah I was runnin' from the po-po, bangin' for the turf
Late night huntin', puttin' in work
Hood day comin', airbrushed shirt
Payday at the spot, got my haircut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
See I live in the 'burbs but I think 21st
I know since I've left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there if I couldn't write a verse

To the blocks that raised me
The enemies and the homies that made me
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm tryin' to be the old me
But if they think the old me ever left
Then they don't really know me
And gon' know we don't change, we just become O.G
You always addicted to the life, you just don't O.D
But shit, I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my mama didn't want me
Too wild to be her child, and pops not around
Now all I got now is the homies
To teach me, how to be a man and what not
How to break ounces into grams and what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not
Shit, you think I forgot? Nah


Thank God every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more awards to get
I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignored the shit
That made me who I am, the music and the man
Told me that I can before the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub in the pen with my man
They say leave the streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all came down, my career was to end
I'm sure my name would live, in these streets

See my homie Snoop, we doin' what we do
Don't matter where we at, Miami or Vegas
Every time you ask me, yeah I'm a player
(Beotch) 'Cause I'm the life of the party
I got ten bad bitches, actin' retarded
I'm tryin' to meet a few new ones
What's up with you girl, maybe we can do somethin'
Do you drink; do you smoke?
I could tell by your purse and your shoes you ain't broke
Hang with me, the first thing you do is get stuck
Take you somewhere, later on you'll get fucked, beotch!

Hey look I'm only in town for a night

Now DJ bring the music please

I've been trappin' all day, gettin' paper
Headed to the club in my brand new scraper
Gators on my feet, money in my pocket
I gotta do a show so you know I'm 'bout to rock it
See my homie $hort, layin' low-key
I strolled over to him, and passed him the bleezy
Doggy Dogg, anything goes
Snappin' my fingers, crackin' at some hoes
What do ya know, I'm in The A gettin' play all day
A lot of y'all wanna ball and try to walk this way
Y'all want that shine-shine but that's all mine
I'm bonafied, qualified to have a hot damn time
Now listen, get the picture, and take a picture of me quick
See 'cause tomorrow I got a new city that I'm gon' hit
A double whammy, right before I do the Grammy's
I do a show with Puff Daddy way out in South Miami
Hey look I'm only in town for a night
And when I pull up man the crowd get hype
And everybody love me, the browns to the whites

Two-tone leather with the soul of a hustler
Tryin to stack mayo, stealin clothes from my brother
People wanna know am I close to my mother
I'm a premature baby, I'm ahead of the others
Yes, I'm aware of the gutter
Ahead of my time, the game's gettin smothered
I stay on the grind but it's only gettin rougher
Niggas think I'm playin 'til they smokin like a muffler
'Bout to take flight, the lane open on you bustas
Catch me if you can in a world full of suckas
Niggas keep simpin, they wanna be Usher
Until they get their eyes and coffin closed by the usher

1992, "Deep Cover" hit the world and fell in love with Snoop
"Doggystyle" came out, it's like I dropped a bomb
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time
I was young gettin' money, livin' wild and free
Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G
Niggas knew it was Eastside L.B.C
Gangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get
The one up above didn't like my pace
I was movin' too fast and I caught that case
I fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case
I slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned

I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

I'm finally out
And the critics hated on me cause I went to the South
Said I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead
Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak
"No Limit Top Dogg", the return of the beast
So from that point on I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
"Last Meal" was the one that took me off the leash
That's the last time a nigga gon' eat off of me
Stack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold
I'm the Bo$$ of this bitch and I ain't never went Gold, nigga

Bo$$ of the City, Boss of the Coast
Some other niggas tried but none of 'em come close
They stuck lookin' silly, but nothin' like a loc
The Bigg Bow Wow, I kill it with one stroke
(Wow!) That's what it's about
They tryin' to tell a nigga what could come out his mouth
Motherfucker I'm a G, but first I'm a man
Freedom of Speech, bitch is a word you can't ban
So they blamin' me, sayin' this my talk
To some women as hoes, like it's my fault
Damn they lost, man they just don't know
That a bitch is a bitch, and a ho is a ho
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'm gon' be smokin' dank, livin' like a boss
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'mma be smokin' my dank, livin' like a boss, nigga

Me and my folks, we drink and we smoke, we rockin' the boat

Spinnin' the globe like the strobe
Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night
If I plan to go right, a cold night
In hell before I fail, I'm alright
Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'
Breath of fresh air, classic debonair
Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand
Finger roll cold, Dogg the Ice Man
Brazil to Iceland
I shine like a million lights man
The talk of the town, believe it or doubt it
I don't need to shout it, you better read about it

I love it cause you're not so automatic
I love it when you put it where Dogg can grab it
I got my hands where you'll let me
I love it when you dance, so sexy
I love it when you in that night mood
Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you
I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to
Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue
I let it do what it might do
Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery
I'm blessed with history
No less than best, catch the rest
Live in the flesh, smooth with the style I choose
Not off the stress, I'm hot off the press

And a nigga know if I take her home, with them wide-ass hips
You damn right, I'm gon' beep
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Big-ass booty with a little-bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shit"
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some fuck-faces
But it wasn't no use for me to rush to bust one

Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline

Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up 'til they come out

Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed

I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it, unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended Glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for  this
Soda couldn't rock this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
My  can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before
Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental Cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin' 'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being
Shot

Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed

Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels good to be on the outside

The worlds oldest profession
Yah it's still alive

Not even in the recession
No Christmas toys for the kids

He said he was drunk playing poker with the boys

Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and began to shout

You don't have to ask no questions, just jump in the back

You all can't believe what we did
Provide an opportunity in the community
Tryin' to spread a lil' unity between you and me

Some say life is like a fairy tail (fairy tail)
Did a song with Snoop Dogg, and it turned into a business deal
But it ain't bout da ends, cus we all got matches and we all got benz's
It's about riddin' with the homies (homies)
Gettin rid of the fake and lookin' through the phonies
And the haters can't stop this, check billboards, number one

Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here -

Here's a little something about a nigga like me
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now I'm that motherfucker y'all read about
Smoking you out and your crew, taking a life or two
You don't like how I'm living well fuck you
This is my gang nigga No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute
With the pow pow bang bang and you're dead
And then we stamp that tank on your forehead
Everywhere we go they say "DAMN"
Them gangstas they be fucking up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no we too busy saying yeah
About drinking straight out the satin bottle
Do I look like a motherfucking role model
To a kid looking up to me
Shit life ain't nothing but weed and money
Shit I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass

Homies all standing around just hanging
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll and we deal
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double (gauge) pointing at his window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said "fuck it"
Then we headed right back to Snoop's
Sweating on the bitches in the daisy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in the Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
So we all said "FUCK YOU BITCH" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga 'for nuttin at all
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs
I might stumble but still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
You fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailing

A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the tank but yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

Well I'm C-Murder the one he talking about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me you know they some haters
I said "See you later" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back with the navy blue top
TRU niggas on the scene with the triple beam
Cause I'm the C fool I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a motherfucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know you're jocking my crew
We want to fuck you C
I want to fuck you too
You see No Limit niggas don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fucking with
Cause I'm the kind of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'm a smoke your ass

Gangsta gangsta, that's what they yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it

You ain't gonna realize whats you got till its gone, thats real
You gets no lovin, babe

Girl you know I got you livin plush in the cut
And every time I wanna dig you out
You tell me "don't rush"
Money stashin, you got me sneakin
And we all alone in the zone, I be tweakin
I almost got caught, my game is leaking
I had to stay at my daddy's house, on the couch last weekend
It's written on my face, and I can't even hide it
So I decided, to ride it
Roses are red, and Violets are blue
Girl you got a nigga hooked, when you do whatcha do when ya do
And now ya want a Benz for ya birthday
And I been waitin to hit that ass since the first day
I'm buyin you gifts, draping you out, with gold
I'm showin you love, you's above any other hoe
Tattoo wit my name on your tits
And everytime I dip, I make sure to kick some chips
Now bitch trip

You gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone

But baby didn't give it to me, ughh
I was down at the alter, I seen Sister Salta
Said "lady could you pray for me?" ughh
I'm in a love affair, I can't share, it ain't fair
Because my life is my wife, and that ain't right
Cause I'm a do what I'm suppose to do, and what I was choose to do
Whether it's buyin a house, or car, or some clothes for you
I try to stay true to it, see I ain't new to it
That's why I do for you boo, I need love too, three

This love affair, it's so original, I call it classic
See I'm attracted, an I'm infatuated
At the same time, elated, and gang related, Dogg Pound on mine
But to find time to leave all that behind
And try to spend some time and give you all of mine {what's that} ya see
I ain't hard to get along with, to do a song with a nigga like D.J. Pooh
Dedicate this whole thing, to a girl like you, boo, look here
You know I'm true, just continue to do me like you want me to do you
And, I hope we don't never have to, write another chapter
Just keep it on the real wit me
Cause I don't really wanna, see you on the corner
Just show a nigga love ya see {gets no love, gets no love}

You don't show me some love

Y'all be doin' too much
Running your mouths
Fuckin shit up, you gotta get up
Cus I done had enough
Getting sick and tired of the same stuff
You told Kamil and she told Karla
And she told April and now they all know
But I could give a fuck 'cus all y'all my hoes
So, all that confronting the real nigga on site
Today is today, last night was last night
As I leaned with my hand on my balls
I had to really check these bitches and tell 'em like this dog
You might also like(chorus)

Nina do this and Tina do that
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga them all my hood rats
Back in the days when I was on the block
At an early age man, I was on the cock
Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get ghost
(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-mama's house
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfuckin' press telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up 'cus she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and I paused
And I put my hand on my balls and said check this out, dog
(chorus)

I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fuckin with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fucked my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you a'int shit but dirt for dirt (biotch!)
(chorus x2)
(shoop)
This is a sexy bitch

I've never let a bitch pimp me
Trying to tell me what to do but I'mma stay O.G
Fresh out the pen only 32 days (32 days)
And I added and subtracted in a multiplied way

About to model a hoe
I'm working them, serving 'em and breaking 'em off (You know)
Did the weed, man get here
Taking too long
But when he get here dogg

Niggas know how D-O-double G "doo's it"
Known for making that crip hop music, don't abuse it
Just ride to the rhythm of a pimp ass, upper class, cold motherfucker

And everybody sittin' around waitin' on me
Show us how you do it Uncle Snoopy
So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggas gon' respect me
Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl though
Gettin' interviewed by mothafuckaz like Geraldo
And niggas wanna know if I smoke Newports or Marlboros?
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?
I make dat shit for the realest of millions
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin'
Hmm... and oh what a relief it is
That Snoop is back in dis mothafucka handlin' his biz
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow
Fuck these niggas and peep out Whitey Ro (?)
Somebody told? Well then, somebody gettin' rolled on
And that's usually how the scenario rolls on
Baby girl said she wanna keep her clothes on

If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me
I'm tellin' you the good-god truth, you want proof?
Ask them hoes over there, "Y'all wanna fuck Snoop?" (yeah!)
We'll take the money and the game away
I bet they won't say the same that day
But it's okay, cuz I don't trip
Cuz "Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks"
I thought I told you, bitch I'm a soulja
East side, long beach, gang-bang roller
From the solar, cuz this, is it
Can ya dig it? (I can dig it!!!)
Jelly Roll pulled a rabbit out his hat
I pull a strap out my mothafuckin' back (Aaah!), cuz I know it's like dat
I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread
They want a contract on a nigga till' I'm dead
If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds
They struck me out, now I'm pinch-hittin' for the Reds
But I'm a Dodger blue, so I gotta keep it true
I gotta home-run, nigga we long gone
I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin'
Rip-ridin', put mines in
Takin' this game to the next level
Trustin' no one, especially them Red Devils
Keep ya head level, hand on my get-up
Stay on the red-up, pimpin' ain't easy, but there's a whole lot of fed-up
And like I told you from the get-go, don't trust no one (no one, no one)
And like I told you from the getti, don't trust no one...

Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts
Of flexing his G's, popping his P's
Dotting his I's and crossing his T's
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts
Of verbal and reckless endangerment
From the million dollar mouthpiece;
And leaving these super-sap suckers
Discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice
The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg
Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game
Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system
Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather
Bring him before 12 G's and open up his files
And you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup
His tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll
And charge from a ho to a henchman about his pension
So all you jerks with them $11 words
Comin out of your $2 mouth
About a multi-million dollar Crip
Who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant
And the tongue of a mack - I said
He's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars
While you suckers is lookin for stripes
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle;
And with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court
To grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissalYou might also likeEmbed

And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
Cuz we came here to have a good time
Me and my niggas in the sunshine (sunshine)
On 3 wheels with one 9 (ya know)
It's time to shine, the world is mine (the world is mine)

(Verse 2)
I never ever dropped a dime (shiiit)
Nigga might cop a dime
Never hesitate to pop a 9 (bah!)
And always come up with the proper line
Stick to the script bitch I'm hurtin shit (hurtin shit)
Let me show you motherfuckers what I'm workin with
(what you workin with?)
Don't need no water to go with your order
And you ain't got to smuggle the shit up over the border
Affordable, sportable, unbelievable, feasible, and reasonable
We leavin' 'em low
Cuz me and my loc, keep big leaves of smoke
Gallons of Hennesey and 16 liters of coke
He done drank and she done smoked
The meters are broke, we put the V to the note
I brought the weed to smoke
And Dr. Dre, he hooked the beat up, indeed it was dope
(Bridge)
Stackin what ya mackin D-O-double G
The shit ya doin' is so lovely
The haters hate cuz they can never be
There ain't no limit to this melody (melody)
You niggas sippin on that jealousy (jealousy)
I pour a tall glass of Hennesey (Hennesey)
Do you wanna have a sip with me? (sip with me?)
Or would you rather try and trip with me? (trip with me?)
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
Cuz we came here to have a good time
Me and my niggas in the sunshine (sunshine)
On 3 wheels with one 9 (ya know)

Keep it shaking, Cali keep it quaking
Cause the Ryders got me bringin home the bacon
Show me love, and it wasn't no mistakin
That I would dedicate this melody - fuck the hatin

I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

Aiyyo, so what the deal Dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg
Niggas seem stressed to the brain, how you feel dogg?
Nigga I'mma ride, set it up, let it spill Dogg
Anything you want, I can flip, got the skill Dogg

Baby girl you so so-phisticated
Finance related, you graduated
To the next level in the game, wearin my name
Bad little brickhouse, go and do that thang

Yo - niggas surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty - your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, askin why he kissed me
Stop whinin, just to cry and get the mackin daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is actin crabby
That's why he bagged me
Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy
No stressin over chicks - problem? Bet I solve it fastly

Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin
Thuggin, dig it, dug-in
I'm lovin every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talkin bout, no doubt
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy

Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was frontin I hop on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'mma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my litter strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song

Now Bill, this yo' nigga, Snoop Dogg
Now answer me this - did you fuck that bitch or what?

That's actually, not the first time that question's been asked; but
Since, I believe, and I think any person - reasonable person would
Believe, that that is not covered, in the definition of sexual
Relations I was given - ahh - I'm not going to answer it except to
Refer to my statement. I had intimate, contact with her that was
Inappropriate - I do not believe any of the contacts I had with
Her violated the definition I was given; therefore I believe I
Did not, do anything but testify truthfully on these matters

Poppin collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoein cause this bitch ain't never shit to me
And pussy stay sellin, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thuggin off on the stereo
Killin 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothin, we keep gettin more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top

Feels so good I had to sing about
Get it, get it now, we flying out of town, checking in a suite
Pedicure on my feet
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Aiyyo Jaz, tell 'em how I put it down

Skinny dip in the pool, do it real smooth
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town

Take your pain, take my hand, take my name
Make my kids, do your thing
Ain't no game, show no shame
If I'm the boss, boss lady must be your name
So I got you, got 212
Put your face on my back, brand new tattoo
20 years in the game, what love won't do
A lot of women want me but I want you
You look cute when you smile, so I renewed our vows
Nowadays I ain't moving that wow, I changed my style
It might happen to you
What gotten to me, shit I gotten to you
And start rapping 'bout things like love and being true
Now maybe we can make another baby or two

Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time
And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail
Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness what's happening

World on my shoulder, but I can handle it
Now that I'm older, I'm sharper and colder
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover
And made niggas in the Beach love eachother
A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up
Best kept secret so I'm want up
I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7
Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven
Now all I need is a push in the right direction
Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks
And now the game ain't stopping
And can't nobody say my name ain't popping
Started off young as a little-bitty buck
Now I'm ready for the world, and I got to give it up

You in the presence of a motherfucking millionaire
Stop, look, listen, feel, yeah I ain't tripping on shit
I worked hard as a motherfucker
Fuck Cuzz, and him too cause all y'all suckas
Now with the savvy of a business man
I gave, new niggas a chance, to see what they was saying
And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock
Big Dizzel knocking down your block
Never looking back uh uh, a steady process
And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed
It's like I'm happy now, cause I'm a family man
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again
And these here are the files of a classic
It's my throne till I choose to pass it

Homie I ain't thinkin', I'm too busy drinkin'
Plumber of the month, mami show me where your sink is

Look, I'm just a young nigga in the biz with mo' enemies than friends
Get no money goin' out, but I got it comin' in

I get paid to drop a verse, for 16 I need ten
End all the speculation
Them pre-conceived notions got me over-compensatin'
And for you slow niggas that mean I've been concentratin'
I'm shittin' on these records while you rappers constipated
Uhh, it's get money, fuck haters
Me and hip-hop is like Chucks and blue laces
Me and Snoop Dogg is Sir Charles and King David
With Problem we all ballin' like the '09 Lakers
Yeah, it's Terrance Martin on the track
And I'm that young nigga droppin' crack back-to-back
My album on the way and I ain't worried 'bout the stats
But I could tell you how the streets gon' react
They gon' say

That little cutie thang, 'Fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (Ooh wee)

Rollin' with a player 'cause that's what he was
And dedicated to his paper, Je-sus!
On his bitches hard as feezuck
And if them law boys pull him over he won't freeze up
He got the heata-fa-heata and the keysa
With a pocket full of big faced Visas
They say it's cheaper to keep her, now baby, ease up
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up
Now sit your ass in the treezuck
And do me a favor and turn the music up
Should I slap her, or should I freak her?
I'll take the stronger, you can have the weaker
Speak when spoken to, yeah, I broke a few
And by the way I was hoping you
Had a freak for me and a freak for you

Had to catch my breath, watch my step
Playin' this game, you can holla at the ref
And call a timeout before you put your dime out
Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the "Wizard of Oz"
And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
'Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
And that was smart
It's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state
See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate
I ain't ask for it, homie, I just shake and bake
I won't fake to make you buy my tape

That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep
I'mma get you before you get me
Them niggas that you hang with are so weak
You're talking shit about me
Turn around and you're the homie
Man that shit is phoney
Tried to set me up bro
But you were singing to my ho


From a nigga to a dub
From a g to a scrub
I'm a vet on the set
I'mma show you what it was
Y'all flipping out, trippin' out
Cause I took a different route
6-2 rag, hell yeah come dippin' out
Beach city rider, 85'er, eastsider
Ain't none of y'all niggas live-er
I hear the bad shit that y'all talk
You want to catch me out of pocket but I can't get caught
I'mma show you what a bitch thought, a bitch taught
A nigga got played out and layed out in chalk
It's a cold game
It's like a rap riddle
Nine times out of ten a bitch was in the middle
Most neighborhoods started off cool
In the eighties it was Long Beach fool
With no seperation
Here's a toast to the real shit, the foundation
You know my game is amazing
I keep blazing
Eastside niggas is the craziest and the shadiest
Yeah dawg, tell 'em again

So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine
I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes
So jealous, so envious
What a drag
Real talk loc, you ain't acting like a man
Your message is how blessed you is
I guess you is
Look at the mess you in


When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep
I'mma get you before you get me

This one right here is dedicated to a lot of famous players out there
That might have been in love before
I know some of you might not think gangstas fall in love (I miss that bitch)
But uh, it's true
If you been in love like I been in love before, you know
It's hard to get with somebody once they gone (I miss that bitch)
It's hard to replace that special someone
When they just up and you know
Dip dive and so socialize
And what we gon do right here (I miss that bitch)
We go'n kick something over this HiTek beat right here
For all the players that lost somebody special
And wonder where she at
E. White kick that shit (I miss that bitch)

I got my eyes wide open
The whole time I'm holding on to hope with you on my mind
It's been a while child, I'm getting down with Dogg
I bet my name all around your wall
Perhaps I went to jail
That left us out of touch
Shoulda shot some mail or something
Ain't no telling where she at now
I be God damn
Baby I really wanna see what you got now
I'm all grown up with my shit together
I don't know if I'mma see you ever
I got a woman and shit,but I must admit this
You at the top of my list
Unforgetable
Fuck with them nigga do
I still miss, there ain't no getting rid of you
But in the mean time I'mma get with cha
Until I get somebody with your hook up I'mma hit ya

I miss that bitch
She was a pot of gold
Her body was cold
I don't know where you went
Where did you go (I miss that bitch)
Shopping around looking around
I'm try to see
Where could you be
How could you do this to me (I miss that bitch)

My momma got mad
I was young when I hooked up with her
One hit and I couldn't stop trippin
A long lasting relationship
Pass you around, and let my niggas take a hit
I used to break you down just to roll you up
You the real, you never will slow me up
And you was always on my mind
Say no more
I still miss you at times
All of a sudden you lost my interest
I packed it up and set about my business
You used to have a hold on me
Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me
I kept going to jail and all that
Get out, fuck with you again, I'm right back
I guess I had to learn the hard way baby
I'm leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy (I miss that bitch)

Ohhhhh
Mary, mary, mary
Quite contrary
Ohhhhh
Every time I think about that girl
Make a nigga wanna have a wet dream
Release some steam
Ohhhhhh, ohhhhhhh, ohhhhhh

W-Balls, it's your main man DJ E-Z Dick
About to unleash another one of those platnum plus hits
And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets
We gon go to a live remote, licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg

A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't diss y'all
I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Real, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Heron rest in peace
Big Jay from Campanella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big Neckbone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein' jealous of what I does
Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
In the paint playin' post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't pull my ho card,,,
I fucked all your groupies
When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was payin' niggas off with all my riches,,,
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh I know (bitch!)
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G Files I do it L.B.C. style
I got the word on you Simon
You need to just start rhymin'
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for "1-8-7 on a cop"
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin shit on Crip!

Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it (feel it)

Pass it, pass it - get it girl

Pass it, pass it - get it girl
Breathe it in! Now let go!

Breathe it in! Now let go!
(La la la la la la la la la)

Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back hypnotized by The Neptunes sound
My peoples always see me and they think I'm on point
So they roll me a blunt, or either pass me a joint
I'm the modern day Rick James, yeah that's me
Anything less than the best is blasphemy
So ask for me - when you wanna get spliffted
I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted
Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics
This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted
With the berries and cherries, the high berries
The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!
I took another hit and then my vision got blurry
I had to pass this shit in a motherfucking hurry
I'm looking at this chick, real thick, her name is Cheri
Big fat booty and her pootie was hairy, c'mon biatch!

Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it cause I'm wit it
This is the Face Off, the one hitter quitter
It'll lay you on your back fast, sweat start to trickle
Everything is moving like you on a tricycle
You caught up in the pickle but I get you out
I blow you a charge through your nose, not your mouth
Slow down! ho damn! you're doing too much
You're supposed to take two puffs then give the shit up, c'mon!


Yeah this is classic, fantastic, I'm blasted
I've been growing and blowing, niggas wonder how I lasted
Well, like Jesus I fasted, for 40 days and 40 nights
I got it all mastered
Now I need a hit of that, Neptune-ology
Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be
Real high, whenever writing my novelty
Because it adds to my celebrity
So I celebrated, teledated, innovated, dominated
Orchestrated, situated, petuated, reinstated
Then I created, you're happy that I made it
Take another hit, young nigga get faded
We're going all out, smoke till ya fall out
D-O double G House all in ya mouth
The West got the best, the East got the peace
I'm out and about with a blunt in my mouth, peace!

And one of 'em tried to fuck your shit up (What?)
Nah cuz, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life

That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow

'Cause we all gon' get that day (For what?)
To see if our life was straight
And see if we'll be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)

Say man ay ushers, deacons, lock the do'

{I love, to give you light)

Geah, first of all
Givin honor to God, and all the ministers on the pulpits
Ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir
They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Sing it sister..
Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&G
Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece
Such a, heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch

In the beginning as a child I was chosen
Though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin the ball
As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
To reach teachin the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin
And dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of niggas around you
Once you get on top they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin
I found myself grindin on the streets quite often
With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a Glock and flossed the G-ride
Niggas throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs
Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up
Disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin
Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light
I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg
Just a block and a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin just what I practice
To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe
Man woman young and old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light cause I love you

{I love, to give you light)

And the people that is locked up, locked down
And the people that's locked dowwwwwn
Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade
On 24's, with the spinnin thangs, ha ha
I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors
Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin to heaven huh
And you ain't gon' go!
So I need you right now to, look at your neighbor
And say neighbor, say NEIGH-BOR, YOU AIN'T GOIN!!
YOU AIN'T GOIN!!2Embed
Nigga you young! {Echoes}

No one does it better! {Echoes}

No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

Break out the weed and the drank and chill out and get high
It's 1 A.M. and the crowd is still live
Relax to the groove, I mean, just move with ya boy
Got shit poppin' like always, you know, so enjoy
Go make yourself at home, got big meat on the grill
Ladies and homies all in the mix, it's time to chill
Sha-La-La brought the orange, with the zags and the blunts
Roll up some Bob Marley joints of some skunk, Daz with Thai
And Nate got a hundred piece
So we piece up properly on the O.Z
We in the zone bombed out feelin' good, ya know
Got the homegirls and homies from the hood, ya know
2-1, 1-9, 2-0, we all in the house
And it's a Long Beach thang where I was born and hung out
To all my players and hustlers and gangbangers, listen up
It's about time I kick a rhyme to fuck shit up
Now who throws shit?
You might also like
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

Now do the gangstas run this motherfucka? (Hell Yeah!)
Or do the ladies run this motherfucka? (Hell Yeah!)

No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

Now the party is bumpin', thumpin' back to back
And Daz on the turntables puttin' down a scratch (HA!)
I'm on the mic so I'mma bust me a rap
And I'mma dedicate this one to a pack of hoodrats
The Dogg Pound nation, locs and big posse
These is the peoples I see rockin' the party
Make a nigga wanna poplock on the flo'
And do the Boogaloo Shrimp and pimp the ho
I got to owe 'em my life cuz I'm a O.G
I got the love in the hood cuz I'm the big homie
I got the skills when it comes to rockin rhymes
So put your hands up to the sky, get yours, I got mines
Now everything is live, don't you agree?
And if you do, then keep on groovin' with that nigga D-O-double-G
We ridin' with the hat to the side of the ride
Y'all know how we do on the Eastside
You see the thing is we like to keep it harder
And we real party people just like Afrika Bambaataa
What do you want? Matter fact, what do you need?
Cuz we keep it all on point from the drank to the joint
So pass the bottle, ain't no need to squabble
And hand it to the little homie, let him have a swallow
It's a Eastside thang, nigga, bring yo ass
G's up Ho's down, nigga, you know the program
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

(What you watchin' the clock for?) The clock tickin'
But it won't stop kickin' cuz everybody kickin' it
And gettin at the bitches, which is, the main thing gangstas do
Skip the bump cuz the rump's what I came to view
New pussy in the hood, shall I kill it? (Kill It!)
The way she got it poppin, no, it's probably hotter than a skillet
But baby don't tweak, like you ain't no freak, peep
I keep my game tight, it ain't no leaks
So we can keep this on the down low
And take a walk with the Dogg and lemme show you what the pound for
Candlelight and romancin'
If I can just get the last dance in at the mansion

No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better

No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it betterEmbed

All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...

Instructions to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scoping out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
Cos I'm gon' make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
Let me tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh 'til i expire from existence
With persistence, I proceed
Supplying you with what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crystal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm tryin to keep it real Dogg

Pound puts it down all around the world
The best pick out the litter, LB young nigga
I'll eat your soul out my dog bowl, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
Uhh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin' doo-doo
I'm steppin' on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashin' full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got 'em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want 'em close enough so I can lock on 'em
Wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on 'em
Check this out here man, I lick 'em, sick 'em
Man's best friend, I hit you for ten, uhh
Fleas can't seize my pack, what, what's my name?
Major trick we're hittin' licks like the Doberman Gang
Y'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG

Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
Weed out, DP'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses
Knockin' niggas like Cassius, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin
Bustin, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone
Free the D-O-double G with the solid gold bone
Just keep it real Dogg

Watch it, watch it - Daz is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Kurupt is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Doggystyle is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
You might be shootin, inna de place
Iffa eedyot ever disrespectin, nowww..

Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Think how many plots blossoms to how many times
I'm sedatin my asphixiated from beginnin broke
And the bombest weed smoke that'll make a nigga choke
To my loc's way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach
To my bulls out in Philly, cause all they smoke is phillies
With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really, will he ever slip or trip
A big shout out, to my niggas in Darby Twp
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin cases robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact
You might also like
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
Now when a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere

My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggas can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area whether I'm toast(?) or at home
I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown
At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true
Demandin my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven
To the point of no return - so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock gat, gun, or pistol
Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come
Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust, I let loose
This is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can't fade it
With they every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered
I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp (the deal is) the deal is this
I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin, steppin, with my projectile weapon

With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through
Who knew about the real deal I conceal?
And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must
If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringin drama, with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MC's'll be G's
Also D-P-G's and, L-B-C's when
We do the do to you so go call your crew
And who, wants to compete with Techniec
Conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts that's bomb to ya, suffer from insomnia
And I'ma, gonna be comin for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
(Watch out nigga!)
It's a sucker MC barbecue cookout
Look out.. watch out now!
Ha-ha yeah, witcha bad self, watch out!Embed
Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

Some do the things that they do 'cause they dumb
And some do the things that they do for crumbs
I do mine for me ya see?
Not the big homey double O-G
Scared to do your own work, man that's foul
And that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
Because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
And the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er
Few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
But they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin' ta find em 'cause you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
It ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
But it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But instead, you put it in their head
That at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)

Of makin' loot, niggas wan' trip

Feel the fever, million dollar man like Colt Seavers
Made a non-believing man into a believer
Receive a check the next day, my homies say
This the way to get paid, DP's invade
I don't know why you wanna get on my back? (Why?)
Trippin' 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you shoulda rolled
Wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue
Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop
Niggas from sets be tryin' to set you up 'cause you set in your ways
So ask DJ Pooh what pays

(What's up, cuz?)
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?
You're like a actor wit another script
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip (busta)
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
'Cause, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers
Not part-time FBI singers
Niggas having bad intentions, sending BG's on a mission
One move too many, nigga you missin'
Listen, you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no
Loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D
Niggas got too flossy from all the sacs they tossin'
And guess what it cost me, they crossed me
But before I give a nigga a 9
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme

We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan

I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em, but don't mistreat em
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on
Let me flow on
You can rock to tha rythme you see
Or you can rock to tha rythme of me
Just remember when you do your thang
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang, is everythang
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase

But now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap
Watch your head, I break bread wit G's
Muslims, hardheads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskatin
On them 20 inch tires wit them platinum Daytons

Shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler

Josey Wales was known for robbin' trains and banks
Layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
'Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw
You're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searchin for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)

Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
Back to the drawin down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive thru all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)
Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excell
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stoppin young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hoes be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode thru
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a 20 he had they peace-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Tryin ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't makin no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight
(At the gold rush, at the gold rush
At the gold rush, at the gold rush
At the, at the, at the)4Embed
Ay Dogg, let me holla at'cha man
Wuz up home?
Word is on the streets, your beats gon' be delicate
Since Dre did shake the spea's out, man
Delicate? Beats?
So that's what makes me now?
Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat
(Now let me shake that shit man)
(I hear ya Dogg)
(It's a cold, cold thing!)
(It's a cold thing!)
(For real, hmm!)

I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes
What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'mma tell you, man, that's the worst
Fifth in the world, but I'mma keep my thang together
Cos I'mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?
All y'all broke on the corner
Drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm doin
But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate
Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight
Cos I'mma do mines and I'mma keep everything tight
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you

Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders

So just sit in your seats and wait 'til we come through
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'mma stay composed
Chill for a second, spit at some hoes
Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank
Countin my bank, uhh that shit stank
Stanky bank is what I got cos I'mma keep it
And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret
Yeah, we're in drought season
Niggas lookin for a reason
It's like thanksgiving without the feast
Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church

They got me runnin' for my life, I'm jumpin' gates
They got dogs on my ass, but I'm a Dogg
So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit
The dog run up on me I give him a cold
Like nigga back up off me
He turn around and bite the police, hmm
Game recognise Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes
I slide in the back of a garage, dippin with this ho
They run right past me, ask me "Have I seen the suspect?"
"Yeah, he went that way", now for the jackEmbed
Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business,racketeerin
Smugglin,doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations,spots where it takes place
If you short them my money, your ass is gettin filleted
There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators,the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thang in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass,commence to takin them out!

Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
Youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
Have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
From coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
Of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet makin it pop
Young crook keepin hook,nigga,shakin the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hoes
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust,bust,be aware and I ain't ya curse
Cos the niggas that I dared to (?agank?) the first
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listenin
And war story glory ain't worth the riskin
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee,nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm takin em out!


I come through blastin', me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
In my zone,Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the U-S-C,I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die,till we burst and break
From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums
We ran outta dope,I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example,what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges,I budge when I buzz
I got the City of Long Beach goin crazy for drugs

Countin' my doe, purchased 250 of some bomb indo
Floss through South Central, I'm on my way to the Eastside
We high, blazin' like crazy and don't know why
Feelin' good as fuck, on a hot ass day
And there's a pool jam right around the way
Niggas got hoes, but ladies in the world
They wanna play with their minds like little girls
I twirl my fingers in the air, run my fingers through my hair
Redbones to blackbones, darkbones to Redbones
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
But I play hoes like Plenty Lenny cause I get pretty
It's all about game...
Cause with no game is hard to maintain, for so long man
From Long Beach, California
From Tul-sa, Oklahoma
Tonight boardin' New Orleans from Mississippi
I know you hold the key to unlock the door
From low pro's she rolls with gold thangs, we ridin' fo' sho'

And how much ass can one nigga break?

All in the place (and they) all wannabe's
Tryin' to make their paper, tryin' to do they thang
But to me they all tryin' to say the same thang
How could you rap over beats that whack?
You ain't reachin' the crowd, you ain't makin' your fact
You ain't droppin' lines that hit the top
You can't make the party go hip-hop
And you can't do your thing without using mine
We get and steal, I see you're on the grind
But I'ma take my time to get my point across
And if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost
And if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault
See I gots ta get mine, I don't try no song
I just move on, groove on, try to prove on
Then I do mines to do mines and I'mma keep on, keep on, keep on
To get'cha you in a... .smooth type of atmosphere

Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him
Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang, but it's a cold game
But when you wit' a Corleone name, it's a cold thang
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
'Cause if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
And if I get caught I'm right back in court

But you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you wanna get get one, holla at'cha boy quick
'Cause I'ma be on the lookout for the sale of 'dem pits

I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
Man, Soopafly never ever ever
Fell for the do-low, and you know I'm
Too swift on my toes and it gives a pose
It's too much for me to be givin' to you
Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you
Now she agreed (Uh), I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it (Uh), but that ain't all she blew
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar
In my room, got knocked off in the car, uh
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flipped, talkin' 'bout lovin' me in the week
I said, "That's too damn quick and that's too damn fast
You've been givin' up too much cock and givin' up too much ass
Nah, nah, nah, you ain't gettin' me like that"
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped I went on one
Stepped in the club, caught me a home run
Baby was bad and all, she said, "Give me a call"
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
Talkin' 'bout what could pop out and hit the groove
Then she said somethin' about the cost
Man, that same bus stop is where I dropped
That bitch back the fuck off
You can't ride my bird, so I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe (Uh)
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with your weave
You might also like
You thought you had my grip
(Now, check this out, you horny trick ass biatch!)
But Soopafly never ever slips
(Oh, man, I'm way too cool, girl)
You thought you had my cash
Nah, baby (That's my money!)
'Til I turned around and whooped yo' ass
Like a pimp, and that's for real

I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe, lookin' too cute
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'ma scoot on
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas (Texas)
She fly, but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a ho with her named 'Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama jama, now look here
I like big bitches ('Kay), 'cause they large (Uh-huh, uh)
And big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
'Cause you like it tall, go and work it, baby doll (Baby doll)
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got a lot of cash for a little love
All they wanna do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little bit and get a T-shirt that say "Ms. Snoop Dogg"
I don't see a goddamn thang
That's stoppin' you from buyin' me that goddamn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'ma buy you a zinger
'Cause you make me feel like a real hip hop singer
Your homegirl, bring her, 'cause I've been dyin' to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass, 'cause you know I don't need her
Shit, it was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, "Big things come in small packages, baby"
You thought you had my grip
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whooped yo' ass
Trick biatch

I said, biatch, what are you smokin'?
A big fat dick comin' from East Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstandin'
Hit the parking lot, bitch, I'll be standin' by the Benz
You think a nigga rich, bitch
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggas ain't trickin' durin' pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up, it'd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
What'd you do, $hort? Introduced her mouth to my dick ("How you doin'?")
Glad to meet ya, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin' with a dog, bitch, you ain't finna come up, ho
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the Eastside (Eastside)
Not much for the game that I'm sellin'
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells, but I'ma tell you though
Can't spend on shit that ain't valuable
Fucked all night, woke up the next mornin'
Told her, "I'm a pimp," but the bitch kept on
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent (Hahahaha)
It's funny, 'cause now she can't find the rent money
You thought you had my grip
But Too $hort never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whooped yo' ass
(Check this out) Trick biatch, biatch

Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain't No Fun", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish ?rope? with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
You might also like
I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
{scratching} and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said "Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted"
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to see Daz back in the day"
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

You caught the vapors
You caught the vapors3Embed
Brothers is wack by popular demand
Chasin fame and girls livin they life on cruise control
But tell me; what do it profit a man
To gain a whole world livin trife but then lose his soul?
I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreamin
Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steamin
Even though my star gleamin man my life ain't trouble-free
Homie take it from me, Snoopy D-O-double-G

It's no better people who have left the problems of today
Leavin to conclude that for their life is not the way
But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood
Heyyyyyyeahhhheyyyy

So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed
Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong
Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have
As God blessed the child that can go get his own
And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feelin like this life is a trip
Tryin to keep our hearts pure through the sins
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich
But to them they can endure to the end and win

There's disease, poverty, congestion or oppression
I'm askin' for your protection and thanking you for your blessing
Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm tryna roll
Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that's the goal
Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't askin too much

Ladies like "That's that shit"

Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"

Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi' you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me hip you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

"You know it's easy to talk about.. doin somethin
But when it comes down to the action part, well most folks take a little light vacation"

Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man
Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me
And I need to let my
Peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like...
It's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance so I decide to sleep by the do'
Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin off into another stage of life
Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight
Niggas ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'

Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it
You might also like
Fuck that nigga, I'mma do it right
Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like
For me to be mad, saying, "Niggas can't stand me"
Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's
Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though
In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI
Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme
Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual
Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual
Tryin to change the direction of flowin
And sayin, born sayin, "You know I get live-er when I get fluent"
Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that Jay
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'mma do it
And now you doin it, they booing like, "You blew it! You blew it!"
I'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse
Through the Luda-verse, hit the boota first
You can never beat a ho, lemme show you how to treat a ho
If you likin me, follow me, you so believable
(So...) Got a way to get his own music out
Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad
Take my time, with my.. great mind
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it
Thanks to niggas who might make it illegal
And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples
And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters
And hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adidas
I continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks
Givin niggas a puff, still givin it up
Beanie Sigel what up? Real niggas is up
On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt

We bust 'til we buss 'em up
Lay Low, I know they told you not to fuck with us
Layin and playin, and sayin man, walkin in vain
Anxious for fame, my nigga tryin to walk in my lane
And tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit
You couldn't spit the shit that I spit cause I'm the shit
And this is it, legit, let's split the chips
And fix, and move the work and hurt that bitch
I'm through with this! {*crowd cheers*}2Embed

I had to stop, pause and fix my hair - hand me my mirror Jerome
She was big but she was cute (which one of you bitches like me?)
And I noticed she had major loot (which one of you bitches like me?)
Ho, ho, ho - it really didn't matter what she weighed...
See cause a big girl loves to play and play a playa, playa

Hey! Bitches! I need yo' attention
Who wanna ride in a pimped-out Cadillac and say hey!
Delicious, you look sweet like candy
I gotta ride shotgun with a bad bitch in the back
No matter what you see, or baby what you saw
If you stand tall, we gon' ball through it all
And if the police come, don't let me take a fall
Please stuff this work, in the crotch of your drawers
Which one of you like me?
I heard she was a major ho, so unforgettable
Next time I see her though, I'mma let her know

We been drinkin havin fun, me and you, one on one
Doin thangs, holdin hands, makin plans, help me sing
We been drinkin havin fun, me and you, one on one
Doin thangs, holdin hands, makin plans, I'm your man

Chorus:
Cause we're all a little strong
In the Beach, where the paper's long
But as for me
I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Dogg Pound
(repeat)
Verse One:
Nigga, you know you gotta have heart (Yea)
I told you niggas from the start (Time ago)
If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my mothafuckin' game tight
Cause ever since Elementary, or was it Pre-school Quik?
I was a mothafuckin' fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I, shake niggas
Break niggas
Make niggas, shank they selves
For fuckin with my wealth (nigga)
And it'll catch on
Cause if it don't, it's on
And, cuzz, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone
Sittin' back loungin' in the Chronic Zone
Clown me, ya wrong
Surround me, ya gone
Get the money you're gone
My niggas' paper so long
They call him Snoop Capone
So if you want me, get in, got it
Shoot your shot
Amd now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all I LBC
Betta yet, that's all I DPGC

Big 6, big 5-3, switching bitches
My girls in the kitchen, and she cookin' up some fish and
I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'
Ol knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'
But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck
I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet
Dead, gone, light's out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money
And then I dip to my spot (dip dip)
And set up shop with yo rocks (mothafucka)
And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7
Cause still, all dogs go to heaven
Chorus (2x)
Verse 3:
I'm freestylin'
C-stylin'
Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island
Where the bitches and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D-O double G
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People be lovin' me because I drop cuts
That makes sense, it make big money
See Snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny
But I got yo honey, up under my wing
Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on the ho-stroll to make me some green
And even if she never even saw me befo'
There's just no way that she can tell me no
You know my game's unbelievable baby (uh uh, uh uh)
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me

Come here, sit on my lap
(Okay.)
Check it out

Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a muthafuckin Vietnam vet
Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my nigga
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me
We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this muthafucka cuz
I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip
To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this scandalous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cutthroat on the down-low
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnightYou might also like1Embed

I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn'
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playin' football up in Poly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homicides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end
So next year we can do it all again
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and delusion, my conclusion is confusing
Drifting on my memories, twisted off my music
Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it

Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Corleone
Tragically casualties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way a nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
"But life's so hard on a G", that's what they all say
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way
(Somehow someway)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)

(Yeah, better days ahead)
Better days ahead
(Better days ahead)
Better days ahead

That's real
I feel your pain nigga
I used to be just like you nigga
Before I got off in this rap shit
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar
You know, but one thing I never did do
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing
I went out and got my own ya feel me?
So from me to you, man to man
Better days ahead my nigga
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on
Cause I'm a get mine regardless
Nigga whether I'm rapping or on the streets
I gotta have itEmbed

Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty
Black female with chips, from the city?
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends
Good girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)
When I was a kid, growin up, I never had toys
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up
Shit, she'd take a nigga out
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look
Baby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low
Bought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together
Man I hope this thang last forever
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet
She lovin a nigga, steady buyin me shit
And don't say shit when I dip with my click
And understand, when I'm down and out
May need some help with some chips
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world
Buyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug
In love with a thug

Whatchu gon' do? "You know I'm gon' stay true
But I'mma go ahead to college like my father want me to"
Well um, off to my cell withcha body on my mind
And I'mma call you back tomorrow round the same time

This bitch ain't sayin SHIT, cause the bitch ain't SHIT
Old fat golddiggin-ass county check receivin BEOTCH
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap
Niggas watchin Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)
Never caught slippin, always on strap
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfuckin get back
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college

Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays

Once upon a time, in the L.B.C
On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, peep game
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
"We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!"
And even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows
Girls used to say, "Snoop, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit"
Welllll, one day, up the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew
He said ah, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess"
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said, "Step-dad, may I?"
And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied (Cinderfella!)
My brothers were goin, they were gettin down
Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
"We can and you can't," is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah)
They all stood there, laughin in my face
And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!"

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss
And I'd get them back if I had one wish
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, "What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb
I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish"
I said, "Herb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest"
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet was some white tube socks
And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock
I showed him my sack, and don't you know
With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, "One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

I jumped in the low-low and went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!)
The princess was starin, while holdin a drank
Reflected from her eyes was gold tank
She waved her hands like, "Hello! Hi!"
Then gave another gesture like, "Come here, guy!"
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps
For the six-fo' I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess screamed out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout
My fresh low-low, also went too
And there was no denyin that my night was through
The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next mornin, when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
Slid into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin, "Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be"
They kept askin me if I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock at the door
"Who is it?", that's what my brothers barked
"The princess," this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin her shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
And said, "No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief"
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, "Is this the one you're referring to?"
Well she said, "Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?"
I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light
And I was wearin shit, from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'
Yelled to my family, "I've GOT to go!"
We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me, I heard my family cry...

Ten little Crip niggas runnin' outside

Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season

The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta MAC, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. fools be like, "Break off some cheese"
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laid

Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit)

My mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break ‘em
Be about your paper nigga take it
Everyday’s a hustle, got these haters at my neck
Suckers tryna get a check
Boss dogg does it, hoes wanna call it what it wasn’t
Tryna kiss a nigga all in public, bitch, is you crazy?
I preach pimping not pussy, shit I heard it all before
I ain’t no motherfuckin rookie
I’m a long beach, grown twenty? playa ’bout his g’s
I ain’t tripping off these walls
You know these rats is after cheese
Messing with my focus, the locust on his grind
They be focus on this dick and keep your focus off my time
Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill
Until then it’s been real, I gotta handle business
And you I know we’re in it, see tripping gets you nowhere
Cause bitch i’m on that

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, thats why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…

We used to rock to the rhythm that didn’t stop
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
Cause it’s over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you
I don’t mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together
Now it’s dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen
Fuck one that once sucked my dick and find another (bitches)
I don’t need ‘em, don’t buy ‘em nothing to drink, I don’t feed them (bitches)
Never mind them, I stay in front, I used to chase behind them(bitches)
No, I don’t wine and dine them

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me

Hell no, I don’t need one
And all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me
I put these size twelves down on a 10 speed
Before I let a bitch get the best of me
(I don’t need no bitch bitch bitch)
The recipe for danger, phone checking, the recipe for anger
I’m from a gang but I don’t wanna bang ya
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears? bitch
Really I’m the perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker
Body like miss parker, maybe get little darker
But I’ma have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
Never understood when it was work day
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way
You need to detox, bitch see Dr. Dre
Cause crazy ain’t gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere
Cause bitch I’m on that, bitch I’m on that

Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying

Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy

Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy

It all goes back, to '85
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-0-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
Whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to "One Love"
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'mma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, "Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?"
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young ho with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a ho in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little ho I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went "Ahhh"
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a ho
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
Better move on somethin fast if I thought I
Could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you livin with that ho and y'all got fo' kids

There's some hoes in this ho-ow-ow

Bitch, why you looking at my dick?
Acting like you wanna blow a dick
Yeah, I know he know a bitch
Got my homie, and we all out to get laid
Seen this bitch on stage
Live, right, get it goin', don't stop
Panties drop, hit the floor
Don't act like you new to this hoe, I seen you before
Yeah, you don't remember me, cause I ain't have no loot
Now bitch, you tryna act cute
Pull up your skirt, do it like it's ’sposed be done
Ain’t no fun if the homies can't have none
And after we get to ya, get with ya
Get through ya, stick dick to ya
Got my niggas in here motivated
Heated, gang related
, and it’s like this
 bitch

This is for my homeboys
Let's show 'em how we get-get down
Show 'em how we -get down
Show ’em how we beat it to the beat of Tha Pound
Don't mind, it's just a pimp thang
Money with me every time, it's a grip thang
Short and simp' thang, get it like you want it
With the shake of Dogg on it
Go on do it like you want it
Baby lick it good-
Hip, big tits, shit's so thick
Baby flossin' that kitty, I ain't bullshittin' bitch
Go on, do what ya gotta do, baby lick it so tend'

Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (when you see 'em, turn 'em out)

Trip, now Daz, Luke, Kurupt, and Snoop
Come bangin' all the hoes in ya muthafuckin' group
It's a shame, how my game
Gon' get that pussy for me in a minute mane
There's hoes all over this place, I bumped a hoe from Atlanta
Named Nevanah, and I, ran a, plan up
That I had designed for another bitch named Savannah
Man I, had a lot of hoes in my lifespan
Even had a bitch from Iran named Jan
Not to mention Japan, I had a tight-eyed hoe with dough
Ya know? Fo' sho'
Now ya know I can bump 'em
So when they get out of line I won't hesitate to dump 'em
Cause I was taught not long ago
In order to gain a hoe, you gotta lose a hoe
That's why my stable, keeps me able
To buy nice cars, homes, and cables
Gangsta haters, a question for y'all
Why yo' bitch paws in my draws, holding on my balls?
You act like you don't do it
But you know ain't nuthin' to it
Don't play like you ain't been through it
Fit to blow dick like ain't nuthin' to it

One for the money, two for the hoes
Seen 'em all coming, they coming in rows
Bitches ain't shit, so I suppose
Your bitch is different, in different clothes
Hell nah she ain't, she's just an average hoe
That gives the average dick the average blow
Don't play, don't look at me that way
Don't switch, I know a bitch when I see a bitch
I know a hoe when I see a hoe
DPG done get blowed in some 

Baby sit back, with your bad self
You ain't never ever had a piece of ass n'em
Once you get it butt-nekkid get to mackin' 'em
And she worked it on a nigga so 
I get nasty, when you least expect
Get fine drunk hoes to get butt-nekkid
We don't be trippin' when walk inside the club
Find me a freak by the name of love
She love, wants a girl that like that dick
Plus like that clique and like freaky shit
You wonder why we bring these hoes
These types of clothes, so we suppose
Spit this game, once you think you know it
These freaky hoes is good to go
Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)

Man, this nigga right back in the club looking for some love
Standing at the bar with a pocket full of dubs
Paying some bitch, to make your dick get hard
Cause you's a muthafuckin' trick
I gets, niggas like you's on the regular
Send a hoe at ya, then look at ya
Right where I want ya at
Make sure you won't get no get-back
I learned from the best pimps in the game
I got hoes all over, my best hoe's Nova
I know ya tried to come over
And get at her, it really didn't matter
I had her, ready to cock back the hammer
And jam her, 9-double-M in your face
While you dance to the boogie of the bass
You chase hoes, I place hoes in they place, nigga

Now let me tell you som' right, a lot of niggas don't understand (nah they don't understand) how real pimps and real players handle their shit (they don't understand, know what I'm talkin' about)
Ya know, aye, me and my man, Dogg (tell 'em), you know we just puttin' hoes in they place, we pimpin' hoes (pimpin' hoes), laying hoes down (slamming Cadillac doors)
You know, a hoe is gonna be a hoe (hoe gon' be a hoe)
Some of y'all niggas don't understand that (yo' hoe be a hoe, let the hoe be a hoe fool)
So, so don't act like you don't do it (cause you know ain't nuttin' to it), cause you know ain't nuttin' to it
Just like we said, aye, hoes gon' be hoes (lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, yuh, yuh), niggas gon' be niggas
We gon' get ours
Aye, y'all hoes gon' be madEmbed

But coming at a real Crip like he ain't one
Especially when he helped fucking make one
On the dead homies, I was at the motherfucking top
When I hit my nigga up and said, "You need to grab 'Pac"
Told Daz, "Hook him up," brought straight up out the box
Here's the gang, here's the beats, here's the keys, here's the locks
Then he hit them niggas (Yes, sir), it was us, cuz
Look around, it still is just us, cuz (Yeah)
Dre rich, Nate gone, and Ricky too
And look at me, shit, I'm 'bout to turn 50 soon

I hate when a motherfucker come talkin' to me about some shit that I ain't tryna hear. Tellin' me how to do my shit.
"You need do this, you need to do that"

Let me tell you somethin'
It's everybody's favorite crip cousin, Snoop Dogg
Inductin' these woop hoes as loopholes
Death rowin' them blue drawers, bitch niggas

So what we really talkin' 'bout, if we ain't talkin' 'bout
What I'm talkin' 'bout
'Cause what I'm talkin' 'bout got niggas hella bags
Sophisticated crippin' with the ghetto swag
Three-piece suit with a black and a yellow rag, tied in a knot

I would like to say to this gentleman and all other people who are not blessed with melanin at this point in time to understand that what has happened in our history is that you have been misinformed as much as we have been misinformed.
Much of the information that is brought forth, not only from Doctor Mohammed, but other areas, other scholars, are not available to you as a sister said in your curriculum that you've had for 400 years when you did not allow us to read and write, it was being hidden.
Whether you, sir, personally did that or not, it was a legacy that was passed onto you.
And I end by saying the Holocaust is simply the greatest atrocity on film.
Ours was not filmed.

Smoke so much dope you in a daze
But you ain't trippin', you gettin' paid
Who do you praise? But anyways
I read a history book, but I ain't learned nothin', dawg

Top of the morning, there's just something I wanted to address real quick. You know, there's a lot of people that didn't, like, really appreciate the Unity Walk yesterday. Don't like peace and all that, and I understand. When I was out there, I didn't understand it either. They couldn't talk peace with me. They tried, and I was like, "Nigga, that's schoolyard." You can't find a home in my generation that put in more work than me. You may find one or two that put in as much as me, but you ain't gon' find none that put in more than me. And I'm here to tell you that shit was worthless, bro. When they try to peace, I don't wanna peace. Look where I'm at. This shit ain't cool, bro. Crazy part of this, you go this way to me, two steps that way, you got 60s. You go two steps this way, you got Bloods. We wait for each when we walk to trial, bro. We united in here. Nigga might not hang with a nigga every day, but we know we got each other's backs. And I don't knock y'all out there that ain't with the peace, but don't get on people that are. Some people's just tired of this shit, bro.

One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one

For God so loved the world he gave us a good Crip
The late, great Neighborhood Nip
Dippin' in this L.A. bullshit
'Bout as solid of youngsta as a nigga could get (Yup)
Wasn't nothin' like these thug phonies
Was always showin' love and big respect for all the Blood homies (What up)
You understood the values in the youth
Man, I swear to God, nephew, you was the truth
Damn, how could this nigga do this?
It's 'cause every neighborhood Jesus got a neighborhood Judas
Who hate to see your team ridin' rich
You see that envy and that pride, that's that green-eyed bitch
Worse than a woman scorned (Damn)
It had been better for that man if he had never been born
But Mary, don't you mourn, Martha, don't you weep
You see, your son still affected us deep
Give us the faith to take that leap

Shackled at the hips for the color of our skin

Ain't got no ulterior motives and no other agendas

Still standin' 'cause the way a nigga handled that

Only nigga with a star that got put on at the Park, nigga

The feeling is fine once you fill in the line
Ain't no blank spots, just all go tank tops
I'm realer than real and my word is my bond
Pop a bottle of Don and blow a blunt with LeBron
I'm on my way to the tip, ain't no cookies and milk
Just satin and silk, I look for my quill
We writing the script, flipping the shit like a flapjack
Boss lady, that's my queen, blackjack
21, get it done, we having fun
Make dough, legs show, let's make a run
Real talk, boss dog, you are the one
The star, the light, and the sun
Just bees and things and flowers

See, talk is cheap so I stay quick on my heat
You niggas bad? Well, Dogg is badder
"Rat-a-tatta!", make you niggas scatter
I one shotta, your boy want me now
Went to the station, that nigga straight point me out (Snitch)
So I'ma lay away and spray away and spray away
'Cause at this time I think it's best to just stay away

They say I am a fool
'Cause I like to do my thing my own way (My own way)
I gotta couple strikes against me
One more and I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I ain’t got time to hang around the hood like I used to do
I gotta get my bread, keep my head
It's either go to jail or get this money instead

Separate, elevate
Concentrate, dominate, and innovate
Try to be, fly as me
And every other homie tell a lie to me
I need a deal, I need some stones
I need some beats, Dogg, I need a loan
Help me out, throw me some cash
If I got it, you got it and you ain’t got to ask
But on the real - or is it lately?
A lot of homies done tried to implicate me
They say I changed; is it the fame?
If I throw it to you, then charge it to the game
Money fold: overload
In the hood, another episode
Man, I'm getting old, the game cold
Yeah, I'm from the dub, but that ain’t how I roll

They say I am a fool
'Cause I like to do my thing my own way (My own way)
I gotta couple strikes against me
One more and I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I ain’t got time to hang around the hood like I used to do

Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking, I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a niggas just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here, dog, a ho once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it
With rich niggas, nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop, niggas of rap
And when we get to spittin', make sure y'all step back
You with that? Cause if you ain't clown

Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping, hit the club, and then start come by
I never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age but they call me mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed
And then I, dropped to my knees and called on the Lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild?
Damn I had to slow down

Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records

Haters ain't gon' stop me cause haters can't run me
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Everybody seemed glad but now they mad
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And feds can't take shit from me, so slow down

I got niggas, shot niggas, drop niggas for fun
I swap from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the 90's and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't wanna get caught up in the mix
Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
We don't, never ever, talk no shit
Unless we back that shit up, nigga you get lit up

They do it for fortune, some for fame
I got five different strains, you ever taste Purple Rain?
Turn up the volume, adjust the game
Ain't a damn thing change, still a G-thang

As the smoke disappears, I'm ready to ball

And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg

Ha, what ya got? (x4)

It get hectic livin' life as a suspect
Ferocious out there, wild as a grizzly bear
Yo girl on a mission tryna jack ol boy for the cash
Two ski masks, strapped, where the yay at?
Ain't nothin' nice about the criminal life
Knives and guns and the chains and the teens in gangs
That done dropped outta school, he too cool
To read a book, see nook, crooks wind up on the news
The earth rattle, the over contaminated cattle
The enemies sail across seas to do battle
I know, I used to do those, now I'm retired
I desire not to have my soul burn fire
Everybody got a nickname and they clique bang
Rumble you can hear it through the concrete jungle
I spit it so well cause I see it all day
Homemade, pushin' sledge, spittin' gettin' that
Ladies say hey come close, I don't bite
I go to class durin' the day and I work at night
I go where I want and I do what I like
I'm pursuin' doin' plumbin', layin' down pipes (that's right)

A million things run through my mind
And you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time

Time brings change and change brings time
Just sit back and listen let me hit you wit a line
That I wrote and I quote that it's dope from the top
Please don't you quit, oh Snoop can't stop
I rock non stop when I have that mic
I give you motherfuckers just what ya like
You can bounce, you can pop, but just don't stop
Cause when I take the mic I plan to make your body rock
And don't you quit and don't you spit nothing to me
Cause you can't do me, why you talkin' madness you handed
Your microphone to your mouth now
You couldn't spit nothin' couldn't even turn it out, dumb ass
You got jealous and the fellas got mad at you
You couldn't do what the L.B.C. Crew do
You couldn't do what the D.P.G. niggas do
And you damn sure can't do what the L.A. zoo do
Try to stay true and try to get wit this
Niggas since Dogg was on the mic I'm too sick wit this
And when I come with some, boy I'm so ridiculous
Now shut the fuck up and listen while I'm kickin' this

A million things run through my mind
And you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time
Killin' up crews give 'em the real street blues
Have 'em slidin' in they eel skins, groovin' in they tennis shoes
Of course I don't stop, being a west side rider
Wit no tattoos, that's how they got you
I make conversations on rappers CD's
And B.G.s and originals listen for the mission
Behind the wall, raise the shot call
Aimin' at the liberty blastin' artillery
My mental mind state is to build and create
And to weed out suckers, cremate motherfuckers
Mail through, put it down on your whole military
Pen ink scary like death at 13ths

So all you alley cats get your eyes off the trash
And beware the bow wow cause I'm bitin' at your ass
And got you barkin' at the wrong tree, nigga
Can't you see we got the whole game locked like the penitentiary, nigga


What you watchin' the clock for?
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'...
Me and my niggas just keep on dippin'...
But I ain't set trippin'
Yeah... Throwin' down y'all
They fucked around and let some dogs in the zoo
I've never seen a dog at a zoo
True...
Oh yeah, west coast

Yo Doc, what up my nigga?
Snoop Dogg, this is what it is mane

Come on

Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggas trapped imagining having action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin' if we never got this shit crackin'
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine, it's like livin' in the City of God, you feel me?
Imagine life on the yard
Or tryna get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' called "Pop" by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son, hm
Imagine life where you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen, you go right to the gin
So if you get back to the streets, you go right back in, hm
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam, just another nigga hustlin'
And ain't no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas, just tryna keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know niggas been blessed with hip-hop

When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
Reactin' like they hate to see you gung-ho
But just imagine if the rabbit got the gun though, but you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
And felt just like them niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine that's what's coming when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean, imagine we said, "Fuck this shit"
Imagine if my niggas got together and tore up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growing up in jail dumb
Happy just to be alive, watching all your people run
Would you imagine growing up to sell you
Fifty million records worldwide or fuckin' off somebody's son?
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other?
All a drunk fool get is pissed-on balls
Keep fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all

21st, east side of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin' shit with his homies like he was a straight G
Askin' where I'm from while he runnin' up
Gangbang my set on e'ry one of 'em (20's, nigga, 20's)
Some things, sons, they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin' but the gangbang (Bang)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin' like a marathon
Lil' G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (Mm)
But they don't know once they get close
It's tic-tac-toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray, I heard a ese say, he said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

But for a G like me, it's just a case, really, you could see
I crack the MAC back and pop off rollin'
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin'
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were broads
Believin' all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dope? What the fuck? No
See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed, all you hear my enemies goin'

You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be "Beast of the East", motherfucker
I never hesitate to blaze (Blaze)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, 'cause my peoples
Is screamin' that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Ba-ba-bang on a song, make it feel like a drive-by (Drive-by)
It's a shame, but somebody gotta die (Die)
They see it happen state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A., all I hear the eses say, they go

And now, our national anthem!
It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

Party people, party people; do you wanna get funky?
Get down.. get down.. you know..

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case; any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find;
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!
It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uhh..

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents; disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific; niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west; where it's about your money and your set
You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman

Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it
It's like magic, it's so tragic
The West Coast, Hoo-Banging, Westside Connection, L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, and you know about the infamous D.P.G.s
We make them freeze to their knees, real Gs
Keep it real though!1Embed
Just another day in the motherfucking neighborhood
A pimp's waking up and he's feeling good
Versace to the flow
He didn't even mess with the Taylor made shit today y'all
Smelling good with his reptiles on for sure

I'm waking up in the morning, man I'm mourning; what's wrong?
My Nigga Corleone gone in my Zoning, but I'm boning, out to school
Cause I can't be late, cause they'll lock the gate
And it's damn near eight, that's when the bell ring
I'm a slide on in, and come right on in
And once I bail through the hallways, giving it up
Funky fresh stars and khakis, cool living it up
What up? - the same shit trying get paid and stay strong
Lunchtime, I make my way to get my grub on
Ten minutes to one, feeling good like I should for sure
Fourth period; walk through the door
I'm wreaking and smelling like endo
But still the day moves on to 2:44; one minute left to class
By Warren G, the Twins and Daz
Nate Dogg finna scoop us up in a blue drop top Brouham
I hear some bitches from Wilson wanna tag.. along
And get up, for the get-down
Word got around about the niggas from the Piddound
We keep the whores on point, to join on lit
And keep heat discreet, until the shit jump off
Well we're all from the side, so we won't ask why
So you best get high!
You might also like
Too high, so fly, like Snoop is poly high

See I... took advantage cause I live right next door
To the funkhouse, dunkhouse with the whole show
Niggas know how we go; from first 'til four we don't show
Lunch and then the last whore
It's getting dealt with some melt shit I guess
We smoke the Stress, cause my quest wasn't chronic yet
Little niggas growing up with my dogs
Cause we pack the hogs, exercise for my balls

Stacked bigger than I thought it would be
Me and the family, working on TV, get paid and fuck their enemy
Moving on up, like the Jeffersons but quicker
All we think about is finding ways to get richer
Hit you like some dodo, got you're begging for more
It's a trip, I'm serving on the solo
Low blow, I had you feeling me
I got some C-O-N-V-O for your community

I'm still in a fast lane state of mind
Time is impossible, for me to try to find
I'm out of school on the line
Hustling here and there, never show no fear
Hosted it up on a watch, I posted it up with a Glock
PCH in atlantic, is what you see just don't panic
It's me, Snoop rocks and when my homies get static
Got a pistol that blasts like a cannon
Look out for when we form at the wall, nigga where you standing?
Raise up, realize, street lights magnify
Life is giving; don't let it pass you by
I'm here and there with the bud, conversating with the drink
Shocked in my own zone, got time to think
Cause what would I be, if I wasn't who I am
Maybe dead or in jail, maybe time'll never tell
Approach me wrong and you will get chin checked
To disrespect my clique, and you will get dealt with
Uhh.. plain and simple, nevertheless with the best shit available
Test me now, let me see how brave you are
I'm scott free, so it's on like it used to be
D-O-G-G P-O-U-N-D G-C, for life, two times 'til I die
Oh why, Oh why, life is a challenge when you die?
What's the peak for me, is the cash and the strap
Since the 2-1-3 days been like that

Feeling very playish, ha.. I mean very plash
And the bitches saying: why shouldn't he?
Yeah he should; doing what he does and he does it good
He goes to work, yeah, he does it good
On pavement or dirt, checking the skirt
The story of a Pimp's Life, yeah baby
You gotta have the stomach for this shit, Hoo weeee
To fuck with this, the story of a Pimp's Life
Ohh yes baby, honey suckle to a berry
Got to check; the traps, got to check the dollars
Got a doctorate from the street called: Peace Mack of Diamond Net
A scholar with my niggas from the underground Embed

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

Sippin’ yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err’y day, err’y night till I’m carried home
Forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now

Thats what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee’s I’m tougher than leather
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I’m biting whomever
Cause I don came from a long path
Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it’s from a tall glass

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery, Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks, I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids, go when the bell rings
It's feeling like hell rings
It's bringing me back down, he's checking my background
Its ironic what's happening, imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out, dawg, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we won’t agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed

Polarizin', prophesizin', I'm what put us on the map
At Poly bustin' down them P-O-U-N-D's into them sacks
Poundin' pavement with the pushers, pocket rocket for the pussies
Player tried to play me cold, I left him bleedin' in the bushes
I'm like a pigeon with precision, Snoopy shittin' from the top
Piggly Wigglys on patrol, tryna pop us at the park
Partner, please, we just posted up, we plottin' on some paper, man
Just popped a Pontiac and peach is probably what I'll paint the thang
Papered up, I can't complain

Snoop Dogg in the building, yes, y'all
Line 'em up, barber shop, fade 'em all

I'm balling, mayne, I boss up back in this thang
Believe me, bro, you wanna stick around and see the show
See me go, Snoop Dogg, CEO
Proceed to capitalize, I'm back with my guys, slapping the five
Making more hits to slap in your trunk
They know this is gangsta funk
Take your risk and get what you want
Fuck with this, I figured he won't
Figured they lying, I'm a cold muthafucka, it's getting chilly
I didn't really wanna fuck him up and slap him silly
So I ran that bitch-ass nigga up out the city

Back up in the motherfucker, tell me how you feel now (How you feel now, oh)
Either you're fake or you're plastic, it's hard to keep it real now (What? So real)

With more knowledge and more game, the best weed

I had seen a lot of niggas come up in this game
But never did they make the look so good
From candy cars to bright yellow bras
The gangster white walls and the wood
You see, there comes a time in a man's life
Where you gotta choose the goods of the game
Oh, but it so hard to turn your back on a place
Where everybody knows your name

It's a cold game, I ain't been one to
Jump in and out of the range
Maybe an old school synagogue
Spinnin' the vision from which I faint
You got to do it, you can, gotta keep rhymin'
East Side High enjoyin' life, hair blowin' in the wind
The state that I'm in is gangster bliss
This is what you're callin' a sis
Passin' them off quick, memories missed
I made a lot of friends, a whole lot of money
Been down a couple times, but it never stopped my rhymin'
In fact, I got better, clutchin' on Beretta's
Blowin' a sticky, turn it to whether
A war shows in dough free lobos, this is how a player roll
And I never be questioned by some new young chump
Poppin' their toss, Snoopy D.O. made the way for you to walk
Owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done
Your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?
Hold closer my hands from my throne
And I never be crucified within my own zone
Here is a very good reason to show love
But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug
From almost goin' down for murder in '93
To keys all over the city bowlin' in Snoops league
I changed, I got smarter, I got a daughter
Two sons, beautiful wife for starters
I did it all, Jack, poppin' this peas
Eatin' international cuisine overseas, yeah
Don't judge me, you only knew Snoopy
You never tried to know Calvin, you tried to groove me up
Like some loco, I earned my respect
Did so much shit for the Coast, I should get a check
But all in all, I did it big
Cool as a blind with a C
Leveled my life as I push away the groupies
Snoopin' in a coopin', you can call me Uncle Snoopy

Weapons to blast, now put that fetty in a bag (Yeah)
From The Isley Brothers to the Jackson Five
A nigga give it to you on the Black hand side
Collide and glide 'til we amplified
And do it all together, Electric Slide
It got good to you (Good to you), now you feelin' the vibe
In the Chevy, rollin', ready to ride
Hand out the moon, heavy on the gas
Steady on the mash, now put the fetty in the bagEmbed
Ayy bro, who got smoke?
Swisher Sweet, Backwood, fronto, sky zone
Pure hemp what I roll
And a nigga need one pronto, I'm on
High as the condo
OG seasoned cilantro, I blow

I can't believe it, believe it (Damn)
I do this shit every time, damn (Every time)
Get so very high and (So high)
Then forget

Or somebody gotta pull up on me, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, pull up to front, party goin' live
Everybody happy when the Dogg arrive
Boss in the building, party with a real one
Pocket full of racks and still number one bonafide
Show you right
Post up with a few bottles, a few models
Make a toast to the boss life, I do the honors
I make the hits to make the deals to make the dollars
And I smoke to that
Reachin' in my Louie bag
Tryna find that King Louie stash
Yeah, I'm 'bout to do em bad
Baby wanna take a flick
I'm like, "Cool make it quick 'cause I still can't find my shit"
Reach a little deeper, now I'm mad

Nigga movin' too quick, tryna get with my friends
To get fucked up, I got my coffee cups and the brewskis
But hold up, I noticed I'm missin' my ooh-weed
Like Snoop D, I need at least two Sweets to soothe me
Blunt wraps, Swishers and loose-leaf
Now I got to go back to the crib
And try to sneak in, I hope my gal don't shoot me
Thinking I'm lying, I'm trying to have a good time
Barbecue, music, the good vibes
Wonder should I make a call to come through with an ounce
When damn, I got two at the house
Now I got to make a decision
Should I hit the back door with precision?
Or maybe I should bum from my coffee brothers
They be gottin' Red Dead Redemption vision

A friend indeed
Feeling like Cee Lo Green
Middle finger in the sky
Meditate and let it ride
Rock-a-bye beddy-bye
A friend indeed
More than jimming to
More than giving you
No prohibits to
You can have a listen too
I couldn't find no one else that I could give it to
And now that we on
I could put my family in a brand new home
My kids is grown
And I'm still rocking on the microphone
People love me everywhere
And I know why
It's not that I'm dope and my style is so fly
James Brown sat me down in a chair
And said, "Snoopy, don't you ever cut your hair"
I was dazed and amazed
That's why I keep my shit in ponytails or either braids
When I was in school, I used to get cool grades
When I graduated, used to smoke two jays
With a fifth of Seagrams
Mixed with some sacco
Then I got a Caddy sack, just like them vatos
Posted up six-one, yeah, that's the block though
Ride by slow and get your ass popped, though
Me and Geeda, Faith and Terry, that's when rump was enough
Can't forget Tim, Baby Dog and Half-Dead
Dre-Loc was a 20 Crip that showed me a lot of shit
But moving along, I went from a Camaro to a Fleetwood Brougham
My sack in the back
My strap in my lap
Room to the back
Rolling through the neighborhood, checking my traps
As you get old, life like just might unfold
Can't settle, this might be untold
Twilight Zone, live life long
Smoke you a bone, and hit you a blunt
Buy you a zo', and roll you a jay
And put it in the E-I
And let's stay way fucked up til we D-I
All in together now if you agree
And lighters in the air, repeat after me
I’m too blowed, forever in a day
I love for oh's so
Cause everybody green ain't dro
Everybody can't smoke like we smoke
Give a dog a bone
I like trees that cypress hills grow
Roll up this shit, pimpin', it's on

That's the code in every hood that you roam
Fastest way to catch a hot slug in your dome

Black Lac like that and it's sitting on chrome
Plaque in back strap in Lac
Antennas wake you up for a rat trying to set a new trap
Swinging the track dripping curl juice on your back
Breaking hearts like Roger and Zapp motherfucker

Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her

Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy condition
In which we create  'cause that's our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around ten o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands upon a cup
And said, "Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all?"
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, "You are, you conceited bastard"
Well, that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, "Oh no"
I went back in, "I forgot my Indo"
Then I dilly (Dally) I ran through a (Alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said, "What's wrong?" 'cause she looked upset
She said, um
It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much, you'll never know
'Cause you took your dope away from me

Damn, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feelin' blue
I said, "Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother step, then says to me, "Hi"
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Somethin' was wrong, I said, "What was goin' on?"
I tried to break it up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her"
She said, "If I can't smoke none, she can't either"
She grabbed me closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started cryin' on my shoes and grabbin' my dick
And sayin', "Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay"
And on and on and on, she kept goin'
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, "Cheer up," so I gave her a hit
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you, bitch"
She said, "No, you're not," then she starts cryin'
I says, "I'm nineteen," she says, "Stop lyin'"
I says, "I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"
Yeah, uh, tick-tock, you don't stop

Game's sustained, my new jersey's in the rafters

Statisticians, they keep up with it
No sleep 'til they get it
And once they got it, they count it
So I learned how to dismount it
My landing was perfect
A man with a purpose
I learned to resurface
A boss but no workers
While you're sleepin', I'm lurkin'
I'm shifty at fifty, I keep the work and I'm workin'
Big Snoop D-O-double-G
Yеllow like bumblebee
Mellow likе R&B
Your bitches keep followin' me
I'm right where I oughta be
Plottin' my pottery
I'm watchin' my calories
Rechargin' my batteries
A ticket up front? That's my usual salary
They imitatin' my style, shit, I call it flattery
I'm here forever, nigga, and that's just what that'll be
Look it up, hook it up
Charge it to the game until you book it up
Take a picture, nigga, look at us
Hit-Boy and Snoop Dogg in the kitchen, nigga, cookin' up
You might also like
Ayy, Dogg, get on the phone with Dre, tell Dre call Interscope, tell them niggas run me my shit or else, nigga

The Game's to be sold, Blood, not to be told, Blood
The chronic get broke down, Backwoods get rolled up
Yup, fifty Bloods when I showed up
What's beef? Chopper turnin' niggas into cold cuts
Snoop told me, "Show love," but niggas ain't deserve it
I'ma talk my shit like I'm the next rapper murdered
Red sedan swervin' with the Peter Pan workin'
Hand-to-hand serve 'em right outside of Tam Burgers
Bullets ain't got no names, my fully quick to aim
I bully niggas for change, I pulled in to rip the strings
Puppet master, F&N's got 'em duckin' faster
Aftermath, you niggas know it ain't nothin' after
I can't chill 'til I see a hundred mil'
Hop off a PJ in Aruba with a blunt and chill
My old apartment still in action, water runnin' still
And if I can't kill you, these L.A. summers will

It was him then me and no one after
So I blazed my trail and wrote my own chapters
Stomped down pterodactical raptors
Game's sustained, my new jersey's in the rafters (Nigga)

Welcome back

Every time I turn around, every time they hear my sound
They get me all up underground, still inside the box
Fuck what they say, just be, the Black folk like it, it's a hit
How can this true gangster shit be still outside the box?

We came from a place where our hearts are pure
People wanna know what we're marchin' for
Grouped up, scooped up all my pals
Flavor for days, so much style
They can't even put it in a box now (Wow)
Stepped out, gator smile, wait a while
"Excuse me, Snoopy, can we get a flick?"
I ain't really trippin', go on, take that shit

What? It's really gon' be 'bout gettin' love
And that's only 'cause I give love
I stand up for it, I manned up for it like a brother 'posed to
Went through, go through, goin' through, knowin' you
Showin' you, flowin' to and the mental to grow into
Let bygones be bygones

Do it for the love, on top there's the cream

You gotta keep pushing on
Just sitting here reminiscing, man
Pushing on
Gotta keep pushing on
Mm
You gotta keep push—

Who remember growing up eating Corn Flakes?
Spend the night at granny house 'cause momma on a date
So you ate what you ate and you ate it quick
'Cause you knew your grandma, she ain't play that shit
Paw Paw, he stayed in another house
With another woman, she a brick house
Growing up fast was a shit show
It's a fеw things I learned from the gеt go
A few folks in my fam fell down
Then they got they feet back on solid ground
And came back around and showed me how to fail
See there's a lesson every time a nigga take a L
Dead or in jail, that's the fairytale
What I know about it? I know it very well
That's why I don't stop, won't stop, can't quit

You gotta keep push—

Through hell or high water, keep my confidence on the level
Let my family support me, it could be me against whoever
Say I'm cancelled, I say even better
Man, who gon' tell 'em?
Your opinion doesn't validate me, I been the shit
In my hood, can't get no better, could never intimidate me
Trap music say we geniuses, politics say we crazy (Shit)
Man, I was selling Ye when Brenda had a baby
When nothing but hip-hop could come and save me
And I just sat there on the pavement
Tryna find a way to make some payment
Had first dibs when they came in
Selling pounds of reefer was strange then (What?)
For eight thousand they gave me ten of 'em
Drove to make it make twenty off the same ten
All our lives we were taught to just hold the pain in (For real)
Imitate Neanderthals and copy cavemen
Can't teach a man how to make it with a handout
Fuck fitting in, keep pushing until you standout

I was all in the bar, wind drift up, Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor, now
With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips
You so right I'm gon' beat
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shh"
See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

Ya,uh
I was once told
You get your freedom
By letting your enemy know that
Youll do anything to get your freedom
Then youll get it
Its the only way youll get it
When you get that kind of attitude
Theyll label you as a crazy negro
Or they just call you a crazy nicca
They dont say negro
Or theyll call you an extremist
Or a subversive
Or a setatus
Or a red or radical
But when you stay radical long enough
And get enough people to like you
Youll get your freedom
So dont rum around here
Tryin to make friends
With somebody whos deprivin'
You of your rights
Their not your friends
NO.. they ya enemys
And treat them like that
And fight them
And youll get your freedom
And after you get your freedom
Your enemy will respect you, and will respect you
And i say that with no hate
Cuz i dont have no hate in me
I have no hate at all
So i say to you, Big Man
Im the man you think you are
If you want to know what ill do
Figure out what youll do
And ill do the same
Only more of it NICCA
(damn... shit)

I'm tryna be with you, I ain't got nowhere to go
And the way I feel, girl, I think I ought to let you know (Let her know)
I'm through lookin' for a ho'
And like Big Pun and Joe, I don't wanna be a player no more
And that's on the real dough
'Cause I'm feelin' like, uh, gettin' paid

You know how to make me say things I wouldn't normally say
Girl, have a drink (Have a drink), and just think about it
Ain't nobody else for me (Nobody), you've always been there for me
Girl, take your time (Take your time), and just think about it

Flashback to the Cadillac with the fat sack
SA's out front, P-Lo stayed in the back
Wasn't nothin' to it, slide through it, get to it
I was so horny, bitch, you never really wanna do it
I guess they my growing pains
I look back on this shit, now I'm knowin' things
Ha, ease to please you, love to kiss you
Hold you and squeeze you, and breathe to you
You know, talkin' on the phone
Holdin' hands, laughin', while I'm walkin' you home
I proceed to love you, believe you
And don't trip 'bout what them other fleas do
Baby-boo, I'd never leave you
'Cause I do need you in my life, forever more
We a perfect combination
And it's built on trust and conversation

You know how to make me say things I wouldn't normally say
Girl, have a drink (Have a drink), and just think about it
Ain't nobody else for me (Nobody), you've always been there for me
Girl, take your time (Take your time), and just think about itEmbed

I was thinking...
We need to take it back to the way it used to be
You feel me?
Yeah, c'mon, yeah drift with me, drift with me, c'mon, drift with me y'all

Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

Take it back to the afros and the naturals
Cape cutter picks we slips into the back roads
I'm O.G. my nigga for real though
Straight up off that east side top of the hill yo
I'm looking at the overview
Thinking bout '86 damn I was overdue
Walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood
While I'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood
That I came from it raised me real Crip crazy
What up, oops a daisy
Demon or a heathen, scheming while I'm dreaming
Screaming to get even, seeing is believing
And don't you forget that
Get it to you get back hit that kick back
Three flies one a way
Reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say
Stay in your own lane stay on your own and quit trying to be grown
Day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

I like them girls from Ladera Heights or the girls on Hills
I take a trip up the World On Wheels and get in a fight
Make it back to my ride
Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side
My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo
Slid me away just to get me away
I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood
I'm banging riding but doing it good
When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering
As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred
With the dealers the killers the realest
The best from the west and the beast from the east
Yeah I'm acting a fool
I'm getting my degree from gladiator school
I chose this life cause I knows this life
Sell a little crack and my flows is tight
I'm clear on my choice and what's cold is
I can still hear my grandma's voice
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right
Reflections of the way life used to be
Reminisce
It's all right

If you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk
And these was the rules squeeze on these fools
I came up in a different era homie
Where the G's is the G's and the little wannabe's really want it
Wanna be like cause the C life make you wanna G like
Now who you wanna be like Snoop
That fool on the TV screen
Or the homie on the corner getting major cream
In the Cadillac beating like Battlecat
A nigga with money don't know how to act
Smoke til your eyes get cataracts
All money nonsense yeah none of that
Quarter sack run it back
Hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that
If a trick jump the track do you want your money back
Lil bitch was a bunny rat
Watch for the funny hat
Cause it's gonna come
And my granny said it's no fun
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right
Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right4Embed
Summer in da hood, it's a party all night
Walking down the streets, I see the people in flight
Hookahs blowing, beats dropping, grill frying
Passing by the homies, saying what's up and hi'ing

It's summer in da hood, it's a place to go
A place to cool off, kick back, and just flow
It's a place for me to unwind and let go
Gotta love it, summer in da hood

Every day feel like a Sunday in LBC
Cool breeze went through and hit me with that real G
Rollin' in my Benz with all the homies blazin'
Asking the Lord above, please don't change what's happening
My crew steady thriftin' like we lookin' for a come up
Ain't gonna back down, gonna drop some fire to make it jump
A seal of protection with my homeboys, I'ma keep it comin'
Causе this the 'hood, all day, it's summer in da hood nigga
 It's summer in da hood, it's a placе to go
A place to cool off, kick back, and just flow
It's a place for me to unwind and let go
Gotta love it, summer in da hoodYou might also likeEmbed

Hmm, and I ain't never felt like this
I ain't never met a girl with the right mix
Green eyes, light-skinned with some nice tits
It took a minute just to write this
I'm the Boss Dogg baby!
I'ma die rich
So let the money talk for me, fuck the nonsense
Hold me down, be my ride or die bitch
We fuck then we fight, we fight then we fuck
I'ma beat it up tonight like Kimbo Slice
Come live the proper life, no I ain't the shoppin' type
I might take you out to eat, we can grab a bite
Now let me grab my bike and roll yo' ass through Crescent Heights
Up in Hollywood, step into the limelight
And hit this bubble kush, let me get your mind right
This is "Wonderland," let your mind take flight
We gotta hurry up, I'm only here for one night

This next girl Bird, she from the suburbs
And live by herself, like cars and nice furs
And loves hip-hop, The Neptunes and Murs
But I'm her favorite rapper, my biggest fan is her
I like her skin tone, and how her figure curves
We smoke mad kush and drink until our vision blur
And then I pat her down, like she gettin' searched
I fuck her with my chain on, she pulls on my shirt
Like nigga don't stop, until the pussy squirt
I hit it twice and bone out, she went back to work
This happens all the time, I gotta go rehearse
For my next show, I tour on May 1st
Get yo' mind right, and this may work
You know love is pain, and havin' faith hurts
You rollin' with the best, so grab your heels and purse
And welcome to "Wonderland" the best place on Earth
Uhh, you gon' love me
("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me
