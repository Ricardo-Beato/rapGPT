Ayy
Ayy, ayy
Gang gang, nigga
Bang bang, nigga
You know how I'm rockin' like cut-off stockings, nigga
Kush in my pockets, nigga
All designer, get your grind up
Got a Breitling for the timer, nigga (Ayy)

Me, I ain't playin', (Nah) got my pistol on my side (Bang, bang)
Pull up on my side bitch, (Skrrt) with my side bitch (Gang, gang)
And I got some money with me I got from outside (Gang gang)
Bitch, I'm from Southside, (Southside) the Southside projects (Chiraq)
Pull up with a big MAC, large fry on the side (Bang bang)
Live by the gun, die, (Gang gang) gang, none of that squad shit (Gang gang)
Pull up where you live, (Skrrt) fuck the cops, call the SWAT (Woo, woo)
