13 ContributorsOne of a Kind Lyrics
Ain't nothin' else like me

I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on? (Mac Miller)
There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone (Aha)
I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter (Nah)
You, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper, no (What you are)
I'm one of a kind (One of a kind)
I'm one of a kind (Ha-ha, Mac Miller, uh; one of a kind)

Here's a prototype that I know you'll like, right?
Head into the light on an overnight flight (Aha)
Never in your life you gon' see another me
I tend to catch the eye like a pair of double D's
I'm here, not the same, I'm a pioneer (Pioneer)
Stabbed the game in the heart with a giant spear
Grind to see success, goddamn, it's clear (Uh-huh)
Design shine like a chandelier (Fresh)
I'm goin' through this cake, spittin' 'bout what you relate
Never can you duplicate any of the music made (Music made)
Gettin' super paid, lookin' at a future star
They recognize me when I pass 'em in a movin' car
Always worried 'bout findin' out who you are (Who you are)
You know somebody, you gotta look into his heart (To they heart)
My mind sublime, ahead of my time
'Cause I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind
You might also like
I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on?
There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone
I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter
No, you, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper, no
I'm one of a kind (One of a kind)
I'm one of a kind (One of a kind)

And my pops said, "Young man, you ain't ready for the world ahead
Way too much marijuana, always havin' girls in bed (Haha)
You gon' realize that life ain't a party (Ain't a party)
Fuck around, you gon' end up starving"
Fuck it, I stay fly, live free, die hard (Die hard)
No Bruce Willis, this the whole nine yards (Nine yards)
Thought that I can rhyme bars, go and buy cars
You gotta grind hard once the sunrise start (Grindin')
In my heart, great things in my future (Uh-huh)
'Cause broke rappers, shit, that's just a rumor (Right?)
I see these diamond chains, mansion in they videos
They must got silly dough, do they really though?
Or is it all just a scam for your eyes? (Your eyes)
Failure in disguise, goddamn, I can't decide (Uh-huh)
All these words here come from my mind
Got nothin' to hide, boy, I'm one of a kind (One of a kind)
Walkin' through this world, I just take a look around (Look around)
Ain't nobody here like me (Like me)
Don't nobody got my style (My style)
People say I'm different, I assure you that's okay (That's okay)
'Cause I'm way past tomorrow, and you stuck in today (Today)

I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on?
There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone
I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter
No, you, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper, no
I'm one of a kind (One of a kind)
I'm one of a kind (One of a kind)Embed
