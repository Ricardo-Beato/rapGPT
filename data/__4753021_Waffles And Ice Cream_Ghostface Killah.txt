9 ContributorsWaffles And Ice Cream Lyrics
Ma, Ma
Throw down some money
The ice cream man is coming

Yo, Shaolin's finest
What up, Boo? Peace your highness
Let's rewind this
Both get naked and kill the shyness
Wu Tang's timeless, blow out your sinus
Sweet talk that ass into bed, kill 'em with kindness
I'm thinking we should fuck again
Get back to the sucking and
Freak shit, all on the road we keep truckin' in
Bottle of rose, double G's on the sneaker
Let me slide in, love, I got respect like Aretha

Ice cream
Ice cream

Watch these rap dudes slide all up in your texts
French vanilla, butter pecan, we complex
Even caramel sundaes, they gon' flex
Scooped in the ice cream truck, let's have sex
You might also like
My tenderoni, she was young when I first wet her
Lil' niggas from the hood used to upset her
I'm from the era of blowing kisses and love letters
Big wheels and skates, now I'm skating on big wheels
Lovin' my honey buns and I'm givin' 'em big thrills
We build and destroy, it's different how shit feel
When them boys turn to men, dick shit get real
Look at my shorty and get clapped with the steel
Hit with the Jason
These save-a-ho niggas is fuck facin'
Lard niggas, pure bacon
Doo-doo head, fed nigga think he down with my clique clique
Homicide housing, sometimes I fuck me a quick bitch
It's the goony hillbilly drip
Hashtag Ruck Juice
And we don't give a fuck about none of y'all, fuck you
The odd couple all night
Fuckin' honeys on sight
Chick like to sing on my dick just like a long mic

Ice cream
Ice cream

Yo, yo, your honey dip, summertime, fine jewelry drippin'
It's been a minute, let your boy get back up in it
No fake digits, no ex, to the next, let's text
Meet up at the spot and have sex
Low specs, big jewels hangin' off the Cuban
Wrist iced up, the hotel room is boomin'
Boozin', buttnaked in the jacuzz', we coolin'
Ice cream

Watch these rap dudes slide all up in your texts
French vanilla, butter pecan, we complex
Even caramel sundaes, they gon' flex
And scooped in the ice cream truck, let's have sexEmbed
