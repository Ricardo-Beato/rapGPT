20 ContributorsFor My Dogs Lyrics
Uh, uh
My niggas

This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)

My dogs, the beginning of this bloodline of mine
That spark that's in a nigga's heart and 'cause him to shine
Before all the rhyme, lessons that I keep in my mind, I owe you
And I give my right hand to show you
Whether it's fist or guns, whatever it go to
It's me they go through, if ever they want you
I'd line the flame, dead game and trying to scratch
K-A-S, I know where my dogs is at

And I'm gonna be the one behind just to keep you on your toes
I be your extra eyes and hold you down around your foes
I be your extra gun, if you need me let me know
For my dogs, I be the first to cock it back and let it go
They do it for the dough, me, I do it for the love
You my nigga to the death so I treat you like my blood
If push comes to shove and they try to send you back to the streets
I give my last to put you back on your feet, feel me
You might also like
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)

You're my dog, nigga, I die for (Shit)
Bust a five for, see the judge and lie for (Uh)
You the type of nigga, I throw weight up on the block for
Just go ahead and lock jaws, and your half? I got yours
Send in the dog, I smell it all night
I told niggas to shut up and write
X barks with a hell of a bite
For the love, they always will be 'til they kill me
I put my thugs on it, and slugs with my blood on it

And to my motherfuckin' dog, big ups to your first share
Niggas know the deal, just wait for them plaques to get shipped
Do your thing, nigga, you know we got your back
'Cause real dogs always return with food for the pack (Uh)
Why these wack niggas swinging? When they all gon' miss?
Take it from me, he was nice before all this
Yo, X, rain on 'em, 'cause after that comes the blood
Ruff Ryders, feed all they dogs wit' raw blood
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)

My people show love (What?), and haven't left me stranded yet
Though I have a death wish, it ain't been granted yet
So until then, I'm gonna be that nigga all up in your chest (Come on)
Until the Lord decides to lay my ass down to rest
Bless the body at the funeral and hope I don't burn
Was a hard-headed nigga and nope I don't learn
Saw the truth but chose to ignore it, wasn't going for it
'Til a nigga had to give it to me (Ahh), then I saw it
This is clear as day, I know here's the day
I'ma be on my way, nothing more to say (Yes)
But take me Lord, make me Lord, what you will
Really wanted to chill but learned how to kill
It's been downhill from then on, 'cause I been on
Some shit, and on, every move to get ten on
The next sack, but you know that's how the X act (Come on)
That's why these street niggas is waiting for the next track
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)

This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
