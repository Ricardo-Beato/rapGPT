I just came up in this right hand when I was walkin' into the yard
Slide
And, um, they just opened up, and there's no other way to put it, they just drove up like this, slowed down a little, paow, paow, paow
Slide

Made 'em proud but I never made a million
I'm talkin' net, I heart the set, I'm tryna raise the children
From the Naughty where we ain't pretendin'
Made a lot of niggas die but I ain't admitting
Damn, ain't forgetting, can't forgive 'em
Preyin' on 'em, no, it ain't religion
Sick of niggas, no, it ain't remission
With it even though I hate the killings
Rather point it at the crackers, FN with the ladder

Slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide (Beggin' on 'em)
Slide, slide, slide, slide (Beggin' on 'em)
Slide, slide, slide, slide (Beggin' on 'em)
Slide

I love my mama 'cause she did her best
I feel nirvana when I'm in the set
We see who pop it on the Internet
Catch one, it's a bet
It's a wrap, hit his lungs if he run
Hit his back, if he crawl, hit his hat
Out here livin' raps (Huh, yeah)

Slide, slide, slide, slide (Beggin' on 'em)
Slide, slide, slide, slide (Beggin' on 'em)
Slide, slide, slide, slide (Beggin' on 'em)
Slide

Late nights, who rides?
Grey slides, suits, ties
