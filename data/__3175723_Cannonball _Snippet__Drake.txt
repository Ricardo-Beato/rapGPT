How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonball

Like my big bro say, I'm goin in
Olimpic loser money, I just glad I learned to swim
CAnnonball, bitch, I hope dive untill it's 30
And I hope when dinners cold, my fingers do not dessert me
And these haters like, damb m
Gave a lot of women they first ride in the phantom
And yeah, I got a deal now, and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so exciting, I get bored with it
I'm the best one out of my peers, and everybody pray I'm running out of ideas
Past my MOs, cause I shine so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures, man, the floor is a collage
Critics have hard time pointing out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky, through the roof of your garage

How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonballYou might also likeEmbed
