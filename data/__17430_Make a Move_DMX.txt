25 ContributorsMake a Move Lyrics
Grr

I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street
'Til I knock off this rock, I don't get to eat
Sometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle
Step on toes, strong-arm and show a lil' muscle
Ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated
I hate it, seein' crab niggas that made it
And I'm robbin' cats just as broke as myself
Livin' foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth?
It ain't in New York, 'cause niggas talk about goin' out of state
Money got an eighth, comin' back hot with a lot of weight
Where's my plate, nigga? I'm hungry too
So I'ma do like hungry do and get a hungry crew
Niggas that ain't never had, and doin bad
Will be glad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad
Grab your bags, it's about to go down
We goin to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how they get down
You might also like
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

I gots to make a move and make it soon
Gots to take a block and make it boom
We comin' through, so make some room
Found somethin' that could be somethin' if I pump it up
This kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up
The purple top thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells
But I'ma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
I send two niggas back up top, and come back
We chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop
It's four in the morning, we on the block creepin'
Killin' the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin'
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler
'Cause, nigga, if I ain't know you since I was like six
Then I don't trust ya
And we'll bust ya over somethin petty like two dollars
Put somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (Ah)
You think I'm here for the ho flow? I want the dough flow
And fuck the po-po, nigga keep a .44
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

I spend my money on niggas, 'cause niggas get me rich
And a bitch ain't doin' shit but suckin' my dick
Niggas is family now, and we stand strong
Thirty niggas over six blocks, makin' the cash long
Shit is good, because niggas gettin' what they been wantin'
And we see the same shit, other New York niggas frontin'
Stick up kids huntin', but I ain't got no love for 'em
I keep the burner and the duster with the glove for 'em
Them motherfuckin' knockers come at us and chop us
And I know they really tryin' to stop us and wanna drop us
So we pump from the alley, and the last house we use as a cash house
It's holdin' 'em strong, it's a stash house
I got runners that work for twelve hour shifts
And when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff
But I ain't tryin to hear that nigga took your pack shit
Ain't tryin to hear jack shit, you fucking black bitch
I ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run
If I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun
Got bitches to transport without an escort
I'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport
Local police ain't a problem, 'cause they don't even stress us
It be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure
Just so you know, ain't gon' never put my Glock down (Why, nigga?)
'Cause I'm a hustlin' motherfucker, and I'm holdin' my block down
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money32Embed
