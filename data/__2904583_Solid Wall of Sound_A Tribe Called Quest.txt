Gonna hear electric music (What you gon' hear?)
Gonna hear electric music (What you gon' hear?)
Gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound
Solid walls of sound
(Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound)
Solid walls of sound
(Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound)
Solid walls of sound
(Pressure breaking ground, pressure breaking sound)
Solid walls of sound
(Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound)
Solid walls of sound
(Tip and Phife in town, Tip and Phife in town)
Solid walls of sound
(Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound)
Solid walls of sound
(Solid wall of sound, pushing breaking ground)
Solid walls of sound
(Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound)
Solid walls of sound (Jedi, Ali, Phifey, Tip)
Solid walls of sound (Jedi, Ali, Phifey, Tip)
Solid walls of sound (Jedi, Ali, Phifey, Tip)
Solid walls of sound (Jedi, Phifey, Phifey)

Yo, ATCQ, Massive and crew
Bars to any beat, we beat the beat for true
Massengale MC’s, you smell like pussy stew
Don’t let it be you, man up my youth
Phife, you should've spoke of, man you'rein the mode of
Leave that to me, el-Hajj Malik
The man with a plan who went for it all
Like Marauders on a mission when we killin' dance halls
Mmm, Saga boy, Trini man
Ride out when mic is in mi hand
Loved all of mi fans, one, two, three of dem all of the gang

With a couple pound a weed and a couple dollar van
Hmm, broke pockets, find another plan
Yeah, cyan dun, push up on the one
And big up the sound man, dibby dibby DJ walk
Ayo Bus with them a talk
They don’t want no prob, they don’t want no issue
Outline them in bloodclaat chalk
Earlier in the night when we bring out the music
With a box and a band killer sound boy movement
Live and direct when it all goes down
You an idiot boy, you don't wanna fuck round
Big tune make the world go round
Make way for the sound boy crown
Don't you know we're the wickedest sound
One box off in your face make a sound boy frown
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound

Sound checking, a million watts are shaking the room
In just a few hours you're gonna feel the burn
All of the goons are checking their guns at the door
A solid wall of sound is here on tour
It's gonna get loud—so no phones allowed
It's gonna get loud—so no phones allowed13Embed
