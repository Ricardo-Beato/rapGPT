2 ContributorsFall Back Lyrics
These silicone rappers acting real but
Light them up like blunts gotta spill guts
Never mind they still acting tough
My T-shirt breathe corporate corporate magazine steal some
Fuck ever heavy metal shit real pop
You been pop because you daybueing real flop
Cops trying to kill guys but killed shot
Exploring every options while the water still trying to feed cops yeah
Everything a vibe but it's still the same
Only the real remain when i kill the game
Running over the niggers in a renter hearse
Then i erks tire marks tire marks
Wait that's a Kendrick verse
None i ain’t have to steal that
What's left when all of your layers are peeled back
Got a mind like a steel trap
And then fill it to the brim with real raps

Yep you wanna fall back (fall back)
You wanna fall back (fall back) 
If you the real shit you really real shit
Drop it let me feel shit if it's really real
If it's really real drop it let me feel some
If it's real drop it let me feel
If you the real shit you really real shit
Drop it let me feel shit if it's really real
If it's really real drop it let me feel some
If it's real drop it let me feel
You might also like
Up the money tell them to fall back
Fuck the money we coming to north black
The cops trying to kill us we can’t ignore that
Some rally some riot
Government selling up bull shit and we buying
Giving us all sort of drugs and we try it
I’ve never been to a court with a judge that ain’t bias
Look at the conviction rate i got the colour that the system hate
Wait face facts as they face us the racist trying to erase us
Beat us to the truth then erase us
History is a high story Knee high
Don't watch exodus no one is our story
Rearrange the past no one is our glory
Not matter the colours of my brothers will ride for me


Hip hop is still evolving from stealing vaults
Some of these real life shit dont appear in blogs
Rap niggers soft this ain’t a pillow talk
At the club ain't saying nothing when they kill us all
Ah silence but you say you real ya that's how you feel huh
Ey yo fro real bro riders better watch who you steal from
A true steal gun tighter than the steel drum
We on that crazy steel drum
Smoking that B real what the fuck you feel one
Wow you niggers acting real young
Stop that recording that baby beef shit feel tongue
Yea no time for your hard feelings
Blood is in the ghetto my socks is like curry shillings
Un apologetic as fuck when they say my name
Open methic in the truck men i bring my pain
