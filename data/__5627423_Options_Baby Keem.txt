I've been at it for a while
I've been vibin' for a while
Get the feelin', girl you feel it
You been fakin for a while
Got the Bentley all "Wow"
Cut the feelings off, wow
Got the feeling, girl you feel it
Now you feelin' all wow

(Uh, man) I've been at it for a while
(Uh, man) I got options all now, amen
Now you soak it all now
Like sharmain, like garmain, I know you see this Balmain

Bitch, I'm ballin', I flex the whip, top fallin'
My pockets tall, man, I used to drink the faucet
And now I floss it, I never lost it
Grandma told me, "You the bossman, so feed the family"
Grandma, that is way too far, man, that shit is complex
I got verify niggas living in my context
Off, bitch, I cut you off, bitch, I cannot handle
Options, I got my options, I chose to gamble

Fashion way, dead with the trigger, it makes you happy
Swear to god, y'all make me Nauseous, just to be Gaseous
Put the fuck to pet the ‏rumors, that shit is nonsense
