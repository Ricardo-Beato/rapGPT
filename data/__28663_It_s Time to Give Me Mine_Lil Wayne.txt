Been running for too long
Been running for too long
Been running for too long
It's time to give me mine
(Better)
Been running for too long
(They better)
Been running for too long
(They better)
Been running for too long
(They better)
It's time to give me mine
(Because it's)
Time to-time to give me mine
Time to give me mine
Time to-time to give me mine
Give me mine, give me mine
(I'm so far ahead man!)
Been running for too long
It's time to give me mine

What they talking 'bout, Fee?
They ain't saying shit
Nigga, we could hold court
Like Stan Smith
Or Judge Judy
You niggas better shoot me
Cause I bought my mans a Glock
And I bought myself a Uzi
Don't confuse me
No, they don't amuse me
I come after the Money
Like Wednesday come after Tuesday
I told Stunna I'm wylin'
He say "Don't worry, I got ya"
He told me "Cut they heads off
And bring 'em back to Papa"
Them niggas gettin' scurred
Word
All that talkin'
Just a whole bunch of verb
Pussy-ass nigga
Got a whole bunch of nerve
I'll have 'em putting your picture
On a whole bunch of shirts
I smoke a lot of weed
And drink a whole bunch of syrup
I like brain
So I fucks with a whole bunch of nerds
I am number one
'Cause two is not a winner
And no one remembers third
You might also like
Been running for too long
Been running for too long
Been running for too long
It's time to give me mine
(They better)
Been running for too long
Been running for too long
Been running for too long
It's time to give me mine
(Cause it's)
Time to-time to give me mine
Time to give me mine
(Check your clock nigga)
Time to-time to give me mine
(Check your watch nigga)
Give me mine, give me mine
Time to-time to give me mine
Time to-time to give me mine
Been running for too long
(Wizzle F Baby, bitch)
It's time to give me mine

See, money is the topic baby
See, I'm a giant
All these other niggas mockin' baby
They microscopic baby
Big crib, I can't even hear 'em knockin' baby
Headed to the top
Like I'm tied to a rocket, baby
To all the foreign women
Let's make a tropic baby
I got so many bitches
I could make a compilation
I'd like to thank the haters
For your cooperation
I got that doctor chopper
Give you an operation
Nigga this is my crusaders
Kill for confirmation
We all got on masks
We 'bout to toxic waste 'em
I hope they mommas raised 'em
Cause they got bitch ways
If they don't pay for ya
They get ya back dead
Real talk
Stop walkin' on ya back legs
Step into the limelight
Bullshit backstage
I used to tote a .32 up in my crack days
I tote that AK-47 in my rap days
Been running for too long
Been running for too long
Been running for too long
It's time to give me mine
(They better)
Been running for too long
Been running for too long
Been running for too long
It's time to give me mine
(Because it's)
Time to-time to give me mine
(Check your watch)
Time to give me mine
(Nigga)
Time to-time to give me mine
(Check your clock nigga)
Give me mine, give me mine
Time to-time to give me mine
Time to-time to give me mine
(I'm comin')
Been running for too long
(Wizzle F Baby, bitch)
It's time to give me mine

Come and get it (tell 'em)
Anyone can get it
But since I'm the President
I'll be a little more politic (hah)
I'm chilling in the clinic
Cause that's how many nurses I got workin'
On my dizzick
Snakes in the grass
Rats, lizards
But 'round here snitches don't exist
Like wizards
Ho, this ain't punch
I'm sippin' on some sizzurp
I roll a fat joint
And do my fingers like scissors
The game so cold
I done had my share of blizzards
But now I got that big money
Runnin' like rivers
Nigga
I'm here to get my shit straight
Burner on the hip-waist
Leave a nigga's street full of bones
Like a fish plate
Yeah, I'm from the hood
But now I'm living in a rich way
Swear I got on my knees
And thanked God for this day
So say what you wanna say
I need to throw a cup of water in my face
First place
I –
Been running for too long
It's time to give me mine
Been running for too long
It's time to give me mine
Time to give me mine
Give me mine
Time to give me mine
Been running for too long
It's time to give me mine14Embed
