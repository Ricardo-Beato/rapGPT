25 ContributorsHeat Lyrics
Uh, yeah, yeah
*gunshots*
Uh... grrrrrrrrr... uh... hot!
Uh.. arf arf arf arf-arf

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

The heat is on, what's my next move
Do I stick with the score, or get with the door
Feds got the drop in the back of the Uhaul
Snipers on the roof, chance of gettin' away - too small
Tell 'em like this, "Look, it's gonna be a shoot out
Whoever make it out meet back at the new house
Good luck, if I don't see you again peace
Let's handle our business with these government police"
You and you go out the front, you take the back
You cover the first two and I'll take the sack
Boomer didn't make it, neither did Stan
Now it's three niggas, splittin' four hundred grand (aight)
We all feel the loss but enjoy the profit
The game is the same, ain't nothin' gonna stop it
Most times you make it, one time you won't
All niggas could really do is have a vest under the coat (come on)
You might also like
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

Me and my two mans gave money, twenty grand
For a scam, they don't get the condo in the sand
And chance of gettin' caught slim next to none
But now we like three deep, need that extra gun
Bump into my man, I remember from up north
I remember he had principles and wasn't nothin' soft
Off to discuss, just what's goin' dizzy
Everybody got it? Aight, let's get busy
Run up in the bank, bitch, *woman screams* hit the deck
Yo, bust money and get the keys off his neck (come here)
We on the clock, three minutes until we finished
Feds are on the way, but I'm tryna see spinach
In and out, duffel bag across the back
Extra large sports coat to cover up the Mac
Feds they attack, I spit lead out, niggas spread out
Run up on a civilian in his car, make him get out
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

High speed chasin', racin' through the streets
Death's in the air, I can taste it through the heat
My partner's goin' fast, I don't think he's gonna last
But if he don't, I'mma hit his wife with his half
But that's the type of nigga I am, this ain't just rappin'
I made it, he didn't, but hey, shit happens
What can I do, but go on livin'
Fleein' from the condo, I'll go on a ribbon
Life goes on, that might sound wrong, but hey
We all live by the rules of the game we play
Day to day, death is a possibility
The way I play is a vest stops you from killin' me
It's too hot to be in the heat 'cause it's on
Too hot to be in the streets, so I'm gone
Go back to bein' discreet, live long
'Til one day either me or the heat is gone
Come On!
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know
The heat is on39Embed
