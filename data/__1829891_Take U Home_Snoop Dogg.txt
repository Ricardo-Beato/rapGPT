2 ContributorsTake U Home Lyrics
You in the club lookin' grown, with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be your best friend; let me stick it in

And not just the tip
I wanna give you all of it
She's a model, all tall and shit
I'm Too $hort, but I ain't got a small dick
Just ask around
I fucked a lot of hoes in this town
I get down, I come long and wide
And when I pull it out they all wanna ride
The sun's comin' up, we started at four
I spit so much game it's hard to absorb
And everything you believe she hates
Like pimpin', she appreciates
'Cause my women, hope they understand the game
It's all about the money, give a fuck about the fame
You'll never get a chance to go out with me
If you a broke bitch, and you're not a real freak

You in the club lookin' grown, with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be your best friend; let me stick it in
You might also like
You came with your friend but she fat as fuck
And nann one of my homies wanna fuck, and now she wanna front
From the get-go I figured this is how it gon' be
Tell that little punk bitch that you ridin' with me
Don't stop, fo' hop
Hollywood Hills back to Too $hort's spot
You wanna roll, let's get ghost and jet
I wanna see if I can make you wet
'Cause you need it, let me beat it
Your lil' fat friend, actin' conceited
Sittin' in the corner; leave her, the bitch is a loner
Dancin', givin' me a boner (Ooh, mmm)
I pull a pole on out
Me and you, boo, we need to roll on out
You sit here, in the bed where
A nigga just wanna put the head in, biatch

You in the club lookin' grown, with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be your best friend; let me stick it in

She wanna be my BFF
I'm on a time limit, got no time left
See, I'm a mathematician, you can add the bed
Subtract your clothes then divide your legs
When it all equals out, you can moan in bed
She gave me the P, gave her the D instead
See, you a hot mess with that booty and thang thang
Swangin' in the club when you drinkin' that drank drank
Smoke in the air, chillin' all in the zone
Fuck me on the dance floor with my clothes on
Too $hort, Snoop Dogg, uh, imagine that
She threw me the pussy, I threw the dick right back
See, I just wanna hit it and stick it in
'Cause I don't wanna be your boyfriend (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
And you don't wanna be my girlfriend
I told you once, don't wanna say it again
You in the club lookin' grown, with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be your best friend; let me stick it in

Oh, oh, ho, ho
Oh, oh, ho, ho
Oh, oh, ho, ho
Oh, oh, ho, hoEmbed
