40 ContributorsStraight Up Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Freebandz on the building
Straight up
Ayy

Got the Gucci boots on like it's snowing, straight up
Big booty freak and she foreign, straight up
All my hoes treat me very important, straight up
I put red on the bottom of ya shoes, straight up
I got racks on me, straight up
With a gat on me, straight up
I'ma spaz on ya, straight up
Throw some cash on ya, straight up
Molly with the lean feel like you come from another planet, straight up
Every car I drive you know it gotta be Panamera

I’m fly like Pan, and ain’t gon' Neverland
I tie my strings, cause I run to them bands
I'm on the Molly, don't fuck around with them xans
Got them baby bottles, full of Actavis ain't playing
I'm a hot topic, I'm in popular demand
With a penthouse, but guess where I been staying
In a Continental, with this fat ass Dominican
Got to cost over 80 racks just for me to gone sit in
I'm an astronaut, yes, yes, yes I am
I'ma take this guap and cash out on a Lamb'
Throw some red bottoms, Jimmy Choos be all you wearing
Fuck the dress code, nigga it ain't no comparing
You might also like
Got the Gucci boots on like it's snowing, straight up
Big booty freak and she foreign, straight up
All my whole team we very important, straight up
I put red on the bottom of ya shoes, straight up
I got racks on me, straight up
With a gat on me, straight up
I'ma spaz on ya, straight up
Throw some cash on ya, straight up
Molly with the lean feel like you come from another planet, straight up
Every car I drive you know it gotta be Panamera

I'ma go to Mars and take the baddest broad
This ain't no facade
She a natural born star
Emilio, Valentino Gucci
Slow my flow
We go to sleep in Gucci
This ain't tricking off
This how you kick it with a boss
We blasting off, like a rocket what you thought?
On another level, we put diamonds in our cross
Keep that heavy metal, like a rock star so don't you cross
From another planet, yes, yes, yes I am
I got ya baby mami, she in love with who I am
Riding Panoramic, with the turbo booster
She got the red on her, like she down with suu whoo
Got the Gucci boots on like it's snowing, straight up
Big booty freak and she foreign, straight up
All my whole team we very important, straight up
I put red on the bottom of ya shoes, straight up
I got racks on me, straight up
With a gat on me, straight up
I'ma spaz on ya, straight up
Throw some cash on ya, straight up
Molly with the lean feel like you come from another planet, straight up
Every car I drive you know it gotta be Panamera8Embed
