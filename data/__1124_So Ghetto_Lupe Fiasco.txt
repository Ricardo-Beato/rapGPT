22 ContributorsSo Ghetto Lyrics
Ugh
Enemy of the State
Aww, yeah

This one for Chilly Chill
Food and Liquor flow
Strong like it's been distilled by hillbillies in the hills
And we moved down to Beverly
So heavenly, waking niggas up like "Reveille"
We won't be going back to you regularly, so, forget it
Shadow flow, colder than Punxsutawney Phillip's
My mind's on dope; my brain's on skillets
Thoroughly trained to just bang off lyrics
"Bang, bang, bang," like Pops Wayans—
Witherspoon or with a fork
Was coming out my egg like Mork
Deserves his own head on Rushmore
Flood the game like a giant in a dwarf shorts
So long, niggas
Career so short, it should be riding on a horse
Mines is a horse
But mines is the size you could sneak inside a fort
Yours is a pony—it could sleep inside a Porsche
I am on point like the eating side of forks
So keep your head down like your reflection in a spoon
Chilly Chill'll be out of Corrections real soon
You might also like
Enemy
God willingly
