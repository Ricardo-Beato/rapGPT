Huh
Huh
It's Metro
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
I finessed
Huh, whoo
Ahh
I got extra drugs
Haha

I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I suggest that you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, in Glocks we trust
You might also like
A conniver, a miser, a plug despiser
A Financial advisor, I make you wiser
I do stunts like MacGyver for my survival
If you a rival, I trick you, watch your tag and title
I'm a slimer, a grimer, a real big-timer
Tellin' lies to the judge with my hand on the Bible
I'm a shyster, I'm spiteful and I love rifles
And I love white folks, I walk on a tightrope
Trick you out your cargo, I feel like Pablo
My hood is a jungle, get burnt like charcoal
Take dope from the narcos and bring it to Flat Shoals
And we take chances, 'cause life is a gamble

I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I suggest that you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, in Glocks we trust
Gucci two pistols, get robbed at the Crystals
I'm a trickster, she love how I'm rockin' my crystals
I can never be a victim 'cause my bruh name Victor
Three brothers, no sister, we so rough with ya
Shy with ya last week, today I gots to get ya
Kick you dead in your ass, tell you "Take that with you"
It's a lowdown dirty game, no ref, no whistle
No harm, no foul, but the team just blitzed ya
Slap you clean 'cross your head, tell the docs to stitch ya
All that flexin' with that pack, boy, you gots potential
Gon' bust you with the Draco, now you need dentures
Shitbag no tissue, we so rough with ya

I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?

(Where's the love, where's the love)
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you4Embed
