30 Contributors50 Ways to Make a Record Lyrics
You sit and think about how you can hit the scene
Take one look inside your mirror, clear to see
You need to find yourself as honest as can be
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Now don't get wrapped into the hype and what they think
This shit ain't rocket science and the scene changes with beats
And now you ask yourself, how you want to be seen?
There must be fifty ways to make a record
He's up inside the clubs, they like to lean and rock, oh
Stands around and looks intrigued by what he saw, now he asks me
How he can make hit songs to reach the top
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Fifty ways to make a record


You got talent and your soul cannot be bought
He looked and smiled at me and told me "Thanks a lot"
See, I could use your help
And would you please explain about the fifty ways?
It's kind of easy if you have a open mind
This game is more than spending money and fuckin' dimes
It's all within your words, some shit that outlives time
There must be fifty ways to make a record
