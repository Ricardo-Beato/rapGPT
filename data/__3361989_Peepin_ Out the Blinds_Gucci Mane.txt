Gato, ha
They come to my trap
Take my shit, you should post too
Ka, ba, gato

Firin' at niggas, I'm firin' at niggas
I'm firin' at niggas outside
I feel like Malcolm X I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm coming out firin' at niggas, firin' at niggas
I hear sirens, I'm firin', I'm firin' at niggas
I'm like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm comin' out

Bow, bow, bow
Man down, click clack
Who your man now
Know you heard 'bout Gucci Mane, that boy 'bout lettin' that thang sound
You stunt on Instagram, I'm in a rental van now
Don' know how this shit gon' turn, but I won't run my mouth
Nigga run up on me, I'ma back his ass down
I'ma stand up, nigga, I will never lay down
I bad place by the cartel, they gon' knock us head down
One thing 'bout the Eskimos, dem boys don't fuck around
Jamaican plugs and Mexicans, they spoilin' me with pounds
Medellín affiliated, grow it out the ground
We grow it out the ground (Wop!)

Firin' at niggas, I'm firin' at niggas
I'm firin' at niggas outside
I feel like Malcolm X I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm comin' out firin' at niggas, firin' at niggas
I hear sirens, I'm firin', I'm firin' at niggas
I'm like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm comin' out

Boston, George Diego flow, my bitch like Griselda though
Thousand pounds of yellow dough
Rich ass junkie, full of money
Cameras watchin' every door
Ten mill in an envelope
Banana boat with telescope
I count 2 mil on Periscope
Duplex is exceptional, burglar bars protect the door
Draco on the floor, and AR-15 on the sectional
And young nigga with plenty dough
I done hit so many hoes
Eenie menie minie hoe, I always use protection though
My Smith and Wesson teach a lesson what you call your brother for?
You ain't even special ho, why you gettin' all extra for
Why that nigga pull up to my truck actin' aggressive for?
I bless you I don't stress you, if it's pressure then it's pressure (grra)
Firin' at niggas, I'm firin' at niggas
I'm firin' at niggas outside
I feel like Malcolm X I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm comin' out firin' at niggas, firin' at niggas
I hear sirens, I'm firin', I'm firin' at niggas
I'm like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm comin' out

Man down, click clack!
