15 ContributorsPlay Ya Cards Lyrics
Uh (Yo, yo, yo)
Ya (Yo, yo)
Little old school shit (Yo, yo)

So she came up to me and asked my name (Yo, yo)
I said it's Funky Mac, I don't play no games (Yo, yo)
If you wanna come home with me tonight (Yo, yo)
You better play ya cards right, heh (Yo, yo, yo)

I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
She got a boyfriend, but left him home
See, I got style, so yes, I brag
The things I do just make them mad
Download new pics to my iPad
While your girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag
You a fad, this is forever, ladies in love with my agenda
My name's somethin' these girls remember
She write hers down, return to sender
I don't need it, Vicky, she can keep her secrets
One night only, that's how I treat this
Sleep in, bitch please, make me some breakfast
And then leave, haha

So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's Funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's Funky Mac, don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right

Hey
You see, I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
Girls audition to bring them home
See, I might choose, so just go with it
Her mom adores me, dad thinks I'm a nitwit
That don't really matter, I'ma have her fall in love
I need my beauty, brains, booty, and she all of the above
Relationships, I hate that shit (Yo)
Got one night only, so make it quick (Yo, yo)
They see me out, wanna take a pic (Yo, yo)
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit (Yo, yo)
I ain't that rich, but I got bread (Yo, yo)
To make a sandwich, get me fed (Yo, yo)
Decide right now, don't got all night (Yo, yo)
This the life, so play ya cards right (Yo, yo)
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's Funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's Funky Mac, don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right4Embed
