7 ContributorsEverybody Quiet Lyrics
I'm kill-gunning
And this the gangsta shit (the shit)

First, I slow the car down
Roll the window down (damn)
Hanging out the car, know'ma let off every round
Now er'body quiet cause they say er'body died

They say er'body quiet
It's a homicide (for real?)
4 niggas on the block, and er'body died
Say it's drug-related, niggas ran off with some pies
And I'm the only suspect cause they think they was mine (you lying)
But I ain't do that kill (nah) I don't know 'bout that
Say they got a witness, dead men don't talk back (uh-uh)
They know I got goons, and if they see me get mad
They know that my goons a-light this bitch like Baghdad
AK-47's like a street nuclear warhead
They come through your bricks and shit and hit you in yo forehead
Living in a day and time where er'body violent
Choppas hit yo block and leave er'thing silent

First, I slow the car down
Roll the window down (damn)
Hanging out the car, know'ma let off every round
Now er'body quiet cause they say er'body died

So you ran out with the boss man work Han Solo 
Park up this pretty boy truck and it blowed up
We gon' do it like that "All Day's Way" poster
Desert Eagle hit his tater tot now it's swollen
Goddammit sure alotta bullet holes in yo car
No suspect; say the weapon was an AR
MAK-90 long in closet , I don't give a damn, no
Gucci Mane and Gotti got more scrubs than a gun show
Buffalos, breathing hoes  they say it come from over there
Pawn shop Tec with no cooning it gon' gel you up 
Glock forty, Glock forty-five with a life on it
AK-47, homie, mine got a knife on it

First, I slow the car down
Roll the window down (damn)
Hanging out the car, know'ma let off every round
Now er'body quiet cause they say er'body died1Embed
