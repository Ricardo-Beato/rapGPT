Here We go Again (2x)
Woke up in the mornin' and I bought a benz
Here We go Again (2x)
Woke up in the mornin' and I bought a benz
Here We go Again (2x)
Woke up in the mornin' and I bought a benz
My country boys just left and theyll come back again
He just bought six next time he buyin ten
Here We go Again (2x)
Your girl keep callin then she bout to call again
She knockin at the door Im bout to let her in
Here she go again we bout to fuck again

I got a mansion in missouri
Gucci man u trippin'
I got 70 worth of jewelry

All these girls are curious

Diamonds on they periods

Tell ya mother listen to it
Tell ya bitch to hear it
Dirty bricks are plenty good

Once a friend not a friend then a friend once again
Can't pretend we grown men must defend once again
Once again behind tinted windows on some rims
In the wind with the trail rims are big tires are thin
I do ya girl like a convicts first day up out the pen
Every night is a movie but my mornins' begin like
Las Vegas I go again
Ten thousand I make this ten
Eight thousand on six to eight
I make or break I play again
Lambo lot I go again
What the fuck I want this time?
Yellow lamb with yellow rims
Winter time wear yellow tims
Come out here well go again ?
20 thousand dollars in
Fuck it order ten more thousand
Then midnight come back thru again
Its Gucci

Its this girl named Nicole who I know since like ten
Has a major crush on me but I can't be her man
We were flertin after junior high playin like some kids
When out of nowhere she kissed the lips of the kid
Now Nicole is a lady somewhere someone want to have
But her and the kid doin it all thats not the myth
I would walk the other way when Nicole would cross my path
Cause I know what she would say and i couldn't help but to laugh
She would ask me for a date and somethin she would love to have
Me take her to the ?? so we can do it bad
Sorry Nicole baby but look u dont have a chance
I got 10 grand in every pocket thats the battle of the band
Im the man
Here We go Again (2x)
Woke up in the mornin' and I bought a benz
Here We go Again (2x)
Woke up in the mornin' and I bought a benz
Here We go Again (2x)
Woke up in the mornin' and I bought a benz
My country boys just left and theyll come back again
He just bought six next time he buyin ten
Here We go Again (2x)
Your girl keep callin then she bout to call again
She knockin at the door Im bout to let her in
Here she go again we bout to fuck againEmbed
