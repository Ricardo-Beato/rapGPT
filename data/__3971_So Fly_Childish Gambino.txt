38 ContributorsSo Fly Lyrics
You are the bestest, I will obey you
They wanna know what, I couldn't say who
You are the only one who's ever really seen me
I know that I'm the reason that you don't watch any TV
I wanna lay on your stomach so bad
And it gets a little quiet in this bachelor pad
And I don't really understand the thing we had
I wanna try again, but it would just be sad
And oh, oh whoa
You are the only one who's ever let me be me

We can make it easy, we can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there, promise to be gentle
Sitting by your window, girl, you're so fly to me

So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly to me
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly to me

Oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Will it be tonight
I won't let you down, oh
Oh
You might also like
We can make it easy, we can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there, promise to be gentle
Sitting by your window, girl, you're so fly to me

So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly to me
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly to me23Embed
