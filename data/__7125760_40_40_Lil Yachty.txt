11 Contributors40/40 Lyrics
Right in my bag like Cole, hot, it's a god damn stove (Hot)
Pick a bad bitch from the Grove, I’m 40/40 like Hov (Yeah)
Ask me, I've been on a roll, finna start preaching like Joel (Uh)
No matter how comfortable I get, still keep my pole (Blatt)
The more money that I make, the less that I trust these hoes (Yeah)
Just cause you comin' around, don’t think you can call me bro (Nah)
We start thumbin' it down, we start thumbin' it down (Thumbin' it down)
Don't get humble now, don't get humble now (Don't stop)

Them niggas out there ain't got love for you like me, my nigga (Yeah)
You my brother, I got your back, you know I’m gon’ deliver (Yeah)
Put it on God, whatever you need, give my brother my liver (It's us)
Cross me once, never again, told the bitch, "Cry me a river"
2015, we was in that basement, feelin’ like Tigger (God)
I had dreams, wanted to make it, couldn't get bigger (Dreams)
We are dead friends, but it's all the same
Promise I remember your face, just can't remember your name

Right in my bag like Cole, hot, it’s a god damn stove (Hot)
Pick a bad bitch from the Grove, I'm 40/40 like Hov (Yeah)
Ask me, I've been on a roll, finna start preaching like Joel (Uh)
No matter how comfortable I get, still keep my pole (Blatt)
The more money that I make, the less that I trust these hoes (Yeah)
Just cause you comin' around, don't think you can call me bro (Nah)
We start thumbin' it down, we start thumbin' it down (Thumbin' it down)
Don't get humble now, don't get humble now (Don't stop)You might also likeEmbed
