61 ContributorsThe Big Day Lyrics
I can't believe it
Must be the luckiest guy alive
Somehow, I arrived
But we're only gonna survive if we go crazy
Yeah the only way to survive is to go

Oh my God, think it's the greatest day of my life
So glad you arrived
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive is to go crazy


Oh my God, think it's the greatest day of my life
So glad you arrived
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive is to go crazy


Oh my God, think it's the greatest day of my life
So glad you arrived
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive...

Fuck money, shit, fuck, shit, tell 'em, burn it
I don't wanna, get it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Fuck it
Yeah, uh, uh
Still wanna, drink it, fuck it, drink it, drink it, fuck it, shoot it
I don't wanna, just get it, get it, get it, get it
(That shit is so hard)
Oh, Lord

Oh my god, think it's the greatest day of my life (Oh, Lord)
So glad you arrived
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive...

In the simulation
This is the only part I like
Or I might just be a molecule of Christ
Folding in a universe of dust and light
Or maybe we're just molecules in the body of Christ1Embed
