Migo!
It kinda feel like we been in this motherfucker for a very, very  long time man
Forest Whitaker, huh

We got big guns like Marvin
I'm spittin' fire like a arson
Hop out the Lamb and don't park it
You talking bout gas, we having a forest
Came from the gump, no Forrest
One eye open like I'm Forest
(Who you talkin' 'bout?) Forest Whitaker
If you didn't get the picture
My niggas keep the big missiles
Break in your safe house like Whitaker
(Who you talkin' 'bout?) Forest Whitaker
If you didn't get the picture
My niggas keep the big missiles
Break in your safe house like Whitaker

2 million on the mansion, got a butler in it
And the nigga name is Cecil
I'm the last king on the North
So I gotta look out for my people
Mansion got a panic room in it
Dare a nigga try to break up in it
Came from the gump, I'm feeling like Forrest
Walking the trap I'm experimenting
Street kings off a bling bling
It's a brand new day and a bird gon' sing
Rich niggas on the same thang
Yung Rich Nation we just living the dream
All this gold like I'm livin' in Zulu
Welcome to my kingdom like Shaka Zulu
I don't want your hoe because she working voodoo
Spaghetti, Baguetti, don't like it but you do
Forest Whitaker
You might also like
We got big guns like Marvin
I'm spittin' fire like a arson
Hop out the Lamb and don't park it
You talking bout gas, we having a forest
Came from the gump, no Forrest
One eye open like I'm Forest
(Who you talking bout?) Forest Whitaker
If you didn't get the picture
My niggas keep the big missiles
Break in your safe house like Whitaker
(Who you talking bout?) Forest Whitaker
If you didn't get the picture
My niggas keep the big missiles
Break in your safe house like Whitaker

Stake out for the check, Forest Whitaker
Bloodsport, shit can get physical
I like the color of money, they callin' me Amos like I'm Forest Whitaker
I'm riding the sprinter it's bullet proof
No Forrest, but I'm in the phone booth
My diamonds shining take a peep at you
Canary yellow diamonds, Pikachu
Everyday's Halloween we pulling out costumes
And these kids love me like I'm a cartoon
The streets are like the Vietnam war
When the bitches see me they get star struck
I can't argue with no niggas, cause shit can get physical
Bullets come flipping and it was critical
I don't think I hit 'em, but I know I hit 'em cause they calling them Whitaker
We got big guns like Marvin
I'm spittin' fire like a arson
Hop out the Lamb and don't park it
You talking bout gas, we having a forest
Came from the gump no Forrest
One eye open like I'm Forest (who you talking bout?)
Forest Whitaker, if you didn't get the picture
My niggas keep the big missiles
Break in your safe house like Whitaker
Forest Whitaker, if you didn't get the picture
My niggas keep the big missiles
Break in your safe house like Whitaker5Embed
