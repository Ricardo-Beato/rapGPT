29 ContributorsEnglish Lane Lyrics
Don't even know my schedule, levels reachin' several
Rose petals deliver, make you feel special
They thought the money should've changed it
Slide's still blue, why the world keep tryin' to paint it?
When the life around you changes, try to keep your sameness
Try to keep your brain maintainin' through the lameness (Lameness)

Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home (Home)
I hope it's never all gone (Gone), don't think it's ever all gone (Gone)
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home (Home)
I hope it's never gone, forever long (Forever long)You might also like7Embed
