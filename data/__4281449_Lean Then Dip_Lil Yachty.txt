10 ContributorsLean Then Dip Lyrics
EarlOnTheBeat

Lately, I been chillin', I been too lazy
They want me to jump in the crowd, but I can’t
My earrings too brazy
For that sack, lil' baby, she go too brazy, ayy
Cameras on us, run out, keep it cool baby
I'ma fuck her for fourteen minutes then dip
Walkin’ through the Galleria up in Houston like Lil Flip, ooh
Glock up on my hip, I cannot slip
Havin' threesomes with my Brooklyn bitch, she crip

Hit my lean then dip
Lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip-ip-ip
Dip

Off the rip
I just want her lip, rocketship
Sax drone, drunk pop, keep a trombone
Flip a nigga like a Tracfone if he act wrong
Please don't do that doe
Buddy in the back gotta move that dough
Keep them dirty birds like Julio
Real Slimeball like Nudy, bro
Bitch bent over on the back of the boat
Ribs, I'm in her ribs
She gon' eat this dick up like some chips
You might also like
Hit my lean then dip
Lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip
Dip (Dip, dip), lean then dip-ip-ip
