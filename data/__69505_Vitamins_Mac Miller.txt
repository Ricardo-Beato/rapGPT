27 ContributorsVitamins Lyrics
Well
Take your vitamins!

Well, I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met
The other day while I was on my break to smoke cigarettes
I hit her up, she had some weed and told me, "Come through, we should smoke
Bring a pair of lungs, don't bring no money, baby, I ain't broke"
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor
The door had opened up and it was her
She told me, "Hurry, come right in
Leave your shoes up by the front, 'cause we just put new carpets in"
She asked me 'bout my day, then sat me down
Told me, "We should have some fun, there ain't nobody around"
She got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work
Told me it would make my problems go away and fix the hurt
That I had, well, that don't sound bad
Down the hatch, kinda nervous, "Just relax," she said rubbin' on my back
Well, I ain't really into drugs, but fuck it
I'ma take a trip and I'ma love it (Love it)

I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back
You might also like
I left right after that and started drivin' to my house where I reside
I was high and possibly a little fuckin' out my mind
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house
I said, "Fuck it," took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out
And it's funny 'cause I didn't even hit against the road
I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own
I see colors, different colors like they glowin' and they're light
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark, but it was bright
That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take?
If this kill me, I'ma come back, haunt her every single day
As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I never seen
Feel like I forever dream, just imagine, set a scene
Power and imagination got all my surroundings changin'
Found a place to drown my brain in somethin' like it's outer space
But nothin' like the pictures from the astronauts
They showed me back at school
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man, they had me fooled

I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back
