All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money

All I want is some money
All I want is some money

We gone ball out in trues
We done fucked all the hoes
We done walked in every pair of Louis came in the store
We done got cool with the owner
Out of town we bought out the club
Valet parking the car, man I’m already a star
Already bought out the bar, man I don’t walk to no bar
Man I got a tab with the waitress could have bought a car
I let her ride in the dipper, I bet her flipper I sell it man
I done spent twenty thousand going in at the telly

We done drank all the lean
We done smoked all the green
We done flew to Miami and turnt it up at the king
We done went crazy at mansion when back and played at the mansion
I live a superstar life, yeah the fame ain’t nothing
These bitches ain’t nothing I got these bitches on lines
Bally Gucci and Louis I’m in it all the time
And the Louis store down in Houston they hit my direct line
Ain’t a bitch I can’t buy, ain’t a car I can’t buy
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money (aye)
All I want is some money (aye)
All I want is some money (aye)

All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money

I stay high as a soda
And my jewel worth a quarter
I got plenty of soliders I knock your head off your shoulders
I know the manager homie don’t make me play back on camera
The security can’t handle us cause they know we some animals
? everybody in here my people
See them goonies over there you know them niggas my people
They say its deeper to keep her so thats why I smash em and leave em
She ain’t up on her visa so young future can’t keep her
Cause all I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money (aye)
All I want is some money (aye)
All I want is some money (aye)
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some money
All I want is some moneyEmbed
