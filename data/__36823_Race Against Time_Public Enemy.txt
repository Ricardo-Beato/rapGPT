5 ContributorsRace Against Time Lyrics
Everybody over here, get on up
Everybody right there, get into it
Everybody over there, get involved
Get involved, get involved
Everybody just

Microphone check, microphone check
Can I get a check up from the neck up?
Can I kick a rhyme while I'm checkin' my time?
Can I get a cure 'cause you did the crime for sure
You're probably killin' me with these shots
Tell me what I got and I'm gone
Pandemic, who did it, right? Who did it?
That's who did it, who?
World health organized, murderized
Came to the aid, got paid
Doctor, doctor in a lab, concoct a germ warfare
To the booty, I rocked it
One hundred five million goin' down in the ground
Most in the Black and the Brown, ow!
How did I catch this riddle
If I didn't crossover like a Hardaway dribble?
They blame it on some green African monkey
Now ain't that funky?
And while the clock is doin' the tickin' the tock
I didn't know that the gun is aimed and cocked
You might also like
On us, on us (Race against)
On us, on us (Race against)
On us, on us (Race against)
We're runnin' outta

Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time

Testin', one-two, testin', one-two
Can I get a blood check? Testing one-two
Can I get a witness? (Yes, you can!)
Can I get a witness? (Yes, yes, you can!) Then check it
I'm checkin' records and facts about the battle
'Tween the Indian, Japanese, the Whites and the Blacks
Germs they spread it, warfare I read it
Quote me on this again, and I said it
A bigger damage than the trigger and Glocks
The mass-murderin' masses for a blanket full of smallpox
No guarantees, gettin' lesser fees
In Tuskegee blacks got shot with disease, please
Check the time, check the rhyme
Tribe of mine, killed by the swine
Who crossed the line? Who did the crime?
The mind of a world destroyin' kind, runnin' outta

Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time

A lil' piece of my mind while we runnin' outta time
People of color goin' out like no other kind
Mad drama, genetic gettin' wreck
Protect ya neck, check the epidemic
Drug use, addiction, and murder, I heard a
Pregnancy, infant mortality
Rest in poverty, not peace
Disease till deceased
Sterilized, realized that beast
So here's a word to the wise
They got us runnin' outta
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time
Time, time, time1Embed
