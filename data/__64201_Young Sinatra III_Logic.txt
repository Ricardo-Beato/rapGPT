(Visualizing the realism of life in actuality)
Various women, I'm swimming in, like a shark
Hip-hop heads never die, we multiply then dominate
(Visualizing the realism of life in actuality)
C'mon this sound, it had to come from somewhere, right?
Uh, yeah

Various listeners is wishing us death
Don't give a damn, I'm reppin' Young Sinatra till my last breath
Easily my darkest confession is lyrical aggression
Through indiscretion that triggers anti-depression
When addressin' my profession in every session
The fact that I'm alive is such a blessing
Sippin' wine while these honeys undressin'
What I'm about to say is highly confidential
And in the music industry today, very essential
So bust out your pencil, you can do it on your own
Stop thinking that these labels is the ones that put you on
Let's change the topic, who's your favorite rapper?
I'm the top pick, ha
The flow is elegant, never irrelevant
How many times must I say this?
Cock back and spray this, never delay this
I pray this, reaches the masses
And spread like cancer on they asses
Now allow me to catch wreck, bust rhymes like Tech
Put me in your box and I destroy the deck
You might also like
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

Whipin' through Cabo in a Murcielago
Dodging paparazzi with the finest dime I met in Chicago
The baddest Bobbysoxer that you ever seen, reppin' my team
We real all the time, so my squad keen, bing
Dave, it's me Sinatra and my boy Dean
The way we (Winning) I can't believe there isn't a Sheen
And pregnant women listen and they give birth to a fiend
I spit narcotic epidemic all up in your genes
In layman's terms, I disperse a verse you never seen
Assassinate rappers the moment that they intervene
While you in the alley playing dice
I'm in the yacht contemplating plans for the next diamond heist
Art thieves and jewel connoisseurs
I study every part of they mind and make my rhyme better than yours
Elevated by being hated, sleeping on the brother like they heavily sedated
Some say I'm one in a million, I say I'm one of a kind
Only cocky when I rhyme, I'm Muhammad in his prime
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

Yo, address the mic and start spillin' like I hit the vein
Back in the day they used to sleep on me like Tryptophan
Touchdown now the city screamin' my name
I flow gunshots and break fingers just to shift the pain
Whoever hate ‘em, I levitate 'em like David Blaine
Black Ops state of mind, play the game like campaign
Bumpin' Santana in the finest Copacabana
In Havana with a honey by the name of Hannah
Wearing nothing but a bandanna
Pussy wetter than Louisiana
You know the deal, peace to Miilkbone, I keep it real
Flyer than a man of steel, motherfucker how you feel, It's Logic
I woke up early on my born day, I’m 20, it’s a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body
Now I’m fresh and my physical frame is celebrated
Cause I made it one quarter through life
Some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it’s pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don’t go against the grain, simple and plain55Embed
