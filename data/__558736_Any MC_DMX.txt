There's wild MCs that day,  you knowmsayin
I give props to, niggas is nice, you knowmsayin?
But on the real, y'all niggas know!
That them niggas is not fuckin with me
You knowmsayin?
Any MC that disagree with me
Wave your motherfuckin arm
Cuz it can happen!
It ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cuz he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, yes
Ain't a whole lot to breaking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cuz thats how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin thing going down til I eat
So kill that beef? You betta while you still got teeth
'Cuz they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Copped out, through a you know what
Cuz you know why, and you know my
Motherfuckin name up in this game
And bitch, you know I
Will never be caught slippin', but on some east coast terms
New York niggas do, fuck the perms
You might also likeThey talk about the hawk is out because it's stiffy
They know the flow is riffy, crush more nuts than Skippy
It's the dog with the bark of a Devil's arm
Don't even play yourself, cause you ain't on my level, hog
Niggas get ate up, straight up, so bring another plate up
When I bitch slap a rapper if he can't hold his weight up
Last nigga was lucky, he only got mushed
I have the niggas falling off like they got pushed
And I get flows, straight from the get-go
Hit a nigga wit' fo rounds, that's split yo stomach
Coming through niggas like an obstacle course
A lock to the Source, give props to the boss
Unstoppable force, take it as a loss
That's what you get for getting fly with niggas
Roll with niggas niggas cause you cool with niggas
And you'll die with niggas, don't try this nigga
Cause I'm possessed bust a hole through his vest
Into his chest, strap your boots cause I'm stressed1Embed
