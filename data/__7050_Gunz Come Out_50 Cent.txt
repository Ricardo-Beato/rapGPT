47 ContributorsGunz Come Out Lyrics
It's cold (It's cold, it's cold)
So cold (So cold, so cold)

Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)

I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine
Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind
They say I'm fucking crazy, they think I'm out my mind
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
22 inch chrome, a nigga money long
You try to touch me, I pull out, you get your brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on your own
You're entering in my zone, welcome to the terrordome
The ice blowing my chain, blood blue in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doing my thang
The semi-auto spray, run if you get away
We'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
Nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead
You might also like
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)

In the hood, hoopty, hat low, niggas don't know I'm around
Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects, 187's in progress
Hard niggas finna soften up when that lead touch 'em
You cut 'em once he keep fighting, fuck it just keep cutting 'em
It's real killa instinct, kill or be killed
Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get your cap peeled, nigga you know the drill
Brownsville, Flatbush, Crown Heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food and the hand that feed 'em too
Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York, New York
Gangstas use sign language and let their guns talk
Look homie, I'm cool with some Bloods, I'm cool with some Crips
I'm cool but if there's a problem, nigga I got extra clips
I don't know karate, but I split the bricks
I don't love 'em lover boy, we can share a bitch
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)

I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass wanna tussle
AR-15, cooling system makes the shell case muffled
Scope, infrared, run you're still dead
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head
Contract killa, murder for the scrilla
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready
No exception to the rule, death is promised
Plus I just bought my niggas new Macs and llamas
Got respect for human life, but will accommodate you
One phone call and niggas will exterminate you
No future fucking with me, there's no tomorrow
Niggas'll run up on you tonight and hit you with hollows
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
