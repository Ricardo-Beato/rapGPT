It's your boy DJ Hustlenomics
I'm just checkin' in with Y'all niggas man

Y'all know what the fuck it is man, Chief keef
You know where we come from, Lamron, o' 64, O'Block, 600, shoutout to all them niggas reppin' them sets
Me? I just do this shit man, this me
Anything you throw at me, I'ma murder that shit
Best mixtape DJ in Chicago, Probably in the country, shit I'm seventeen, I got 12 mixtapes droppin' in one month, you can't tell me I ain't workin'
