I would paint the sky for you
I would paint the sky for you

So surreal
The vibes I feel
It must go on, oh, oh, oh
All for you

Fiendin', fallin', crawlin', I'm stallin' for your love
You got me drinkin', smokin', I might, overdose on your love
Fiendin', fallin', crawlin', I'm stallin' for your love
You got me drinkin', smokin', I might, overdose on your love

I need to chill
Emotionally scarred, I cannot feel
Am I not the one? Am I not the one?
Not the one, one for you?
You can keep it real
You get me high, you get me high, high
High enough to paint the sky for you
Every time it's you and I, I feel revived
I would die for you
You might also like
Fiendin', fallin', crawlin', I'm stallin' for your love
You got me drinkin', smokin', I might, overdose on your lovе
Fiendin', fallin', crawlin', I'm stallin' for your love
You got me drinkin', smokin', I might, ovеrdose on your love

Overdose on your love1Embed
