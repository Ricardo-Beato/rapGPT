55 ContributorsWannabe Lyrics
How much does fame weigh?
A gram

I wanna be famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be famous?
I wanna be famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be f– I be f–
I wanna be famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be famous?
I wanna be famous, I wanna be famous
I wanna be–

I'm just a regular person, so I'm not good enough, no, I'm not good enough, no, I ain't shit
I don't get likes like they get likes, so I am gonna slit my fucking wrist
I ain't apolog'in', inject the collagen
Make me feel like I'm in college again (College again)
He sellin' fame by the gram (By the gram)
Can't leave the house without you in my hand (You in my hand)
That social media shit is a contest
If I ain't winnin' then I am depressed
And I feel less than, I get stressed then
I, I, I, I, I get stressed like, "Ooh"
Why you think Kanye crazy?
Why you think YG brazy like, "Suu whoop"
Why you think homeboy ain't on the Internet no more?
Motherfuck all of you

Why can't I be f– I be f–
I wanna be famous, I wanna be famous
Why can't I be famous?
I wanna be famous, I wanna be famous
I wanna be–7Embed
