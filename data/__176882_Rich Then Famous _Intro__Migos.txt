39 ContributorsRich Then Famous (Intro) Lyrics
This the world we in nigga
A world full of young rich niggas
No college degree but worth half a milli you feel me?
I mean these young niggas out here getting it
Some of these niggas worth a ticket before 21
These young niggas plugged up and connected nigga
Ey yo Migos you ready!

Nigga I'll rather be rich then famous, r-rich then famous
R-rich then famous, nigga I'll rather be rich then famous
Nigga-nigga I'll rather be rich then famous, r-rich then famous

Young nigga, young nigga I'll rather be richer
Than flexing these cameras and taking these pictures
Ima young nigga, I walk 'round the hood
Got boss credentials, they callin' me mister
Quick to shoot 3, Derek Fisher, no referee I'm official
I just might pull out my Fisker, you pussy I see your Whiskas
Call up the plug no Santa, but he sending trees of gas for Christmas
Whippin' the dope, I terminate it, J's they say it's delicious
I got a bitch in my kitchen, with a onion booty I call her Deelishis
And after she water whip it, I make that bitch wash the dishes
Enter the Fisker, I'm doing 250, I'm praying I don't get a ticket
Yes I'm a Migo, but I don't wear Dickies, I'll rather put on True Religion
And if you want fame over money my nigga, then you not true to your religion
I'll rather be rich, cause its some niggas that's famous that ain't got shit

Got some niggas in the hood, they got M's nigga
Ask P, ask me, Northside Migo gang OG
Ridin' round, deuces on a damn Audi
Before I had a deal, young nigga copped it
Them dubs, them fifties, them hundreds, my trap always bunkin' you niggas is funny
I'm laughin with money, beatin the pot like I'm Sonny
Taking them trips making them flip
12 hit the block then I dip, callin' up P, for the whips
Get in the pot then I whip!
