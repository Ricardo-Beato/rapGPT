She's a pretty young girl, doin' pretty young things
She's a pretty young lady, pullin' at my heartstrings
Pretty young girl, take my hand
I'll be your man, I'll be your man
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before
Yeah, before
And I, and I–

I'm fucked up
I mean, I really am hurt
You're new and you're beautiful
But experience tells me this ain't gonna work
You're just like all the rest, suffering in disguise
Behind those beautiful eyes, lies, lies, and I
Just can't do it again, I just don't wanna pretend
That it'll work in the end
Or if it don't, we'll be friends
My heart can't take no more, I'm sincerely sure
But if that shit was true, why in the hell am I singing for?

A pretty young girl, doin' pretty young things
She's a pretty young lady, pullin' at my heartstrings
Pretty young girl, take my hand
I'll be your man, I'll be your man
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before

Yeah, last shorty, I ain't have no free time
Gave her all my everything, ain't never had no me-time
Too scared to commit, no, don't want no rewind
I could give a fuck what the world think, we fine
I've been feelin' shook, don't know where to look
Last girl got me sprung, threw out my black book
Now I ain't got no Rolodex, but I ain't lookin' back, though
I ain't jumpin' back up in the game, show me the backdoor
I ain't got no time for thots, that shit is a bad idea
I don't got no time for hoes, I only want a good girl who knows
How to get wild with it, start out shy wit' it
Like she from the 3-1-2 'til I hit it
Shorty know your limits, get up in it, yeah, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good

And she's a pretty young girl, doin' pretty young things
She's a pretty young lady, pullin' at my heartstrings
Pretty young girl, take my hand
I'll be your man, I'll be your man
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before
I don't think you know, all the things you do to me
It's new to me, it's all the things I've never known before
Y'all–y'all walkin' around instead of helpin' us out, right?
Right, no lies
Hahaha, alright18Embed
