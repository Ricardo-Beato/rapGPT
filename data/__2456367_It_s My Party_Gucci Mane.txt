It's my party buy a dub if you want to, dirty if you want to, whatever I front chu, a block on da plate take a line if you want to, you know dat chu want to I know what you goin' through
It's my party buy a dub if you want to, dirty if you want to, whatever I front chu, a block on da plate take a line if you want to, you know dat chu want to I know what you goin' through

Ridin down the half thirty bags of da drought
Gucci run da six with a pot and a fork
Hell yeah I rob, hell yeah I steal
Hell yeah I smoke, drank, and pop pills

It's my party buy a dub if you want to, dirty if you want to, whatever I front chu, a block on da plate take a line if you want to, you know dat chu want to I know what you goin' through
It's my party buy a dub if you want to, dirty if you want to, whatever I front chu, a block on da plate take a line if you want to, you know dat chu want to I know what you goin' through

Nigga dis my party where do u live, who let chu in who'd chu get her, gucci go bonkers, man the flows monster
Old folks wonder how I ride hummer, corvette, old school vert Look like Tonka, 4 deep gangsta me woo and Waka
Choppa, might jump out just like Flocka
Nigga try us be missin like jenny harper so icey

It's my party buy a dub if you want to, dirty if you want to, whatever I front chu, a block on da plate take a line if you want to, you know dat chu want to I know what you goin' through
It's my party buy a dub if you want to, dirty if you want to, whatever I front chu, a block on da plate take a line if you want to, you know dat chu want to I know what you goin' through

I'm brown, da cut leak moet might leak out
Million dolla trap out an I just cashed out
Got the red card cause it can't max out
And I bring packs out, thraxx Out, sacks out
It's my block dats where dem slengs get slammed out
And issue dat crack out try to take my crack house
Can I suck yo dick, hell nah u junkie bitch, can't touch my work I'll beat cho worthless piece of shit
I'm up three million and dats just hittin licks
I sell white ick, Off Tan base bricks
Safety compartment safety deposit
Glock no safety I already cocked it
Gucci toat bags can't fit in no wallet
I'm all bout da profit, the feds keep watch it
Gucci toat bags can't fit in no wallet
I'm all bout da profit, the feds keep watch it
