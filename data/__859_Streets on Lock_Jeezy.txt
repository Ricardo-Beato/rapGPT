15 ContributorsStreets on Lock Lyrics
These niggas just hating they ain’t talking bout shit
I’m a grown ass man, I flip my own bricks
I don’t need your help I can own my own dick
Ain’t no motherfucker help me write my rhymes
Ain’t no nigga pay for my studio time
See me at the top and want to claim my fame
Nigga took my chain, yeah motherfucking right
You better off saying a nigga took my life
Want to assassinate my character but I ain’t acting
It ain’t adding up so you niggas subtracting
B.I.G. said it first: more money more problems
The why I see it more problems more money

I got the streets on lock
Atlanta on my back
I do it for the hood
You got a problem with that
Real nigga so this rap shit easy, when I speak
Theses niggas believe me
Cause bitch I’m Jeezy

Eyes wide shut, I don’t see these niggas
Cause deep in your heart you want to be me nigga
Want to stand in my shoes, want to fuck my hoes
Want to live my life, want to rock my shows
You young punks with your loose-ass lips
I keep an AR with them loose ass clips
What type of real nigga name himself after a bag
Nigga you’s a ho, a Louis Vuitton fag
My name ain’t dick so keep it out your mouth
It is what it is look I am the south, that’s right
Big Mac you niggas small fries
You just another nigga I’m more like the franchise
You might also like

I was born in the Field raised in Atlanta
Pop busted a nut here so I was made in Atlanta
Mat Lew died so I stayed in Atlanta
Had a plug on the squares got paid in Atlanta
Twenty-two’s on the two-door it sits so right
Ice tray on my wrist yea it shines so bright
Make moves in the day and I ball by night
9/11 Porsche I was on that flight
5’9, 6’1 I call em the twin towers
Had them on the triple stack
Hit em both in the shower
Pedal to the medal bout a buck eighty-five
Mr. 17.5 slow head well I drive, whassup
