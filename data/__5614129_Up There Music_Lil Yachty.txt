You is not me, we on different time
Niggas do the most, they be out of line (Yeah)
She ride dick like a pony, I ain't Ginuwine
Free my niggas out that cell bangin' five-nine (Frrt)
Gave that X6 to my brother 'cause he real slime (Yeah)
Keep a cannon on his arm like Metroid Prime (Frrt)
And I pop my shit with every single line (Yes)
And these hoes gettin' hit, I feel like Barry Bonds (Why?)
I think I'm Don Juan (Why?), think I'm Uncle Lou (Yes)
I think I'm ninety-five Denzel off that tan boot (Beep)

I took three or four bad hoes out to Cancún
I was too blessed, I was the only man on the moon
It get live in the red room
She too high, she took ten shrooms
Baby girl, don't die on me
No, you ain't on earth, but just look me in my eye one time
I wanna just vibe one time
Livin' in the clouds (Beep)

Four a.m., late-night, shawty streaking (Streak)
Kissing on her thighs got her pussy leaking (Leak)
Doing shit right now I won't tell to my deacon (Deac')
If she don't fuck me right now, she gon' see impeachment (Peach)
That is not a must
But you can't stay, huh, nigga, trust
I'm that damn boy
Tote a stick everywhere like children with a toy
This ain't no decoy
You might also like
I took three or four bad hoes out to Cancún
I was too blessed, I was the only man on the moon
It get live in the red room
She too high, she took ten shrooms
Baby girl, don't die on me
No, you ain't on Earth, but just look me in my eye one time
I wanna just vibe one time
Livin' in the clouds2Embed
