Closer to me, baby, I won't bite
You look so tasty, but I won’t bite, really
I'm such a good kitty, don't put up fights
But if you trick me, baby, it gon’ get sticky
I might (Might just), bite (I might just)
I might (I might just), bite (I might just)
I might (I might just), bite (I might just)
I might (I might just), bite (I might just)
I might

I, I, I might just rip a nigga head off if
He just wanna hit and head off, then
Why the fuck you in my bed all day?
Talking 'bout you getting bread
'Less you is a bird, then I understand, okay
Never ever bite the hand feeding you the worm
These are not your eggs, okay, look, look, look
Long ass money with a short fuse
I'm 5'3", but I'll make that nigga 4'2"
If you wanna do it, motherfucker, I won't stop you (Yeah, yeah)
Do it, motherfucker, I won’t stop you, ooh
You might also like
Closer to me, baby, I won’t bite
You look so tasty, but I won't bite, really
I’m such a good kitty, don't put up fights
But if you trick me, baby, it gon' get sticky
I might (Might just), bite (I might just)
I might (I might just), bite (I might just)
I might (I might just), bite (I might just)
I might (I might just), bite (I might just)

Don't be (Nah)
Sorry, I’ll be carefree (I'll)
Serve your ass like Geoffrey (Plug)
Do it for the glory (Wow)
Late to the shift, be sweet
Kept my voice high C and I let my braids drop
Don't give a fuck who see
Nigga D-E-F 'bout to throw grenades (Grenades)
Keep a ghetto freak, but she lightin' sage
Natural hair poppin', don't ever get it twisted
She at your scalp for the fame
Nah, nah, nah, nigga, listen, let me lecture, see
When it be about the bread, oh, want the Quiznos, don't test it, ayy
I'm a gentleman, I turn to a barracuda swimming in your blessings, hey
Higher than a hallelujah, hot as halitosis, she lick me like
(La, la la la, la la la, la la la, la)
Closer to me, baby, I won't bite
You look so tasty, but I won't bite, really
I'm such a good kitty, don't put up fights
But if you trick me, baby, it gon' get sticky
I might (Might just), bite (I might just)
I might (I might just), bite (I might just)
I might (I might just), bite (I might just)
I might (I might just), bite (I might just)
I might
