62 ContributorsGood Dope Lyrics
Wet, wet, wet, wet wet
You know it's Pluto

Tiffany's, Tiffany's, we goin' shoppin' at Tiffany's
You crampin' me, they ampin' me
They 'bout to make me start braggin'
Five percent on the wagon
I spit and I'm hot as a dragon
My niggas in the streets be shootin'
My niggas in jail be stabbin'
I do good dope, I got a good ho
Junkies at the door, got dem junkies at the door
Got some junkies at the door, got them junkies at the door

Servin' outta burglar bars, watchin' cameras
Drivin' foreign cars, totin' hammers
Gotta crazy squad in Alabama
South Carolina boys, we good in Tampa
Swipe the big credit card, it's worth the gamble
Lamborghini boys, excuse my manners
My paint wet, my neck wet, my ears wet, my wrist wet
Rings wet, my bitch wet, her bitch wet, they stay wet
Anytime I miss her, I'ma call her, she stay with it
Emilio Pucci, Pucci is different from Gucci
Kooky, coupie, a cartoon, you lookin' all Droopy
Goofy, Goofy, these niggas they lookin' like groupies
Styro-foam cup, purple Act' gluey
You might also like
I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Junkies at the door, got dem junkies at the door
Tiffany's, Tiffany's, we goin' shoppin' at Tiffany's
You crampin' me, they ampin' me
They 'bout to make me start braggin'
Five percent on the wagon
I spit and I'm hot as a dragon
My niggas in the streets be shootin'
My niggas in jail be stabbin'
I do good dope, I got a good ho
Junkies at the door, got dem junkies at the door

Purple Act' gluey, sticky, icky
Esco, he a hippie, tricky, tricky
Pass your dog a Mickey, hit me, lick me
Fuck me, bitch don't kiss me
Fuck me, bitch don't kiss me
I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Junkies at the door, got them junkies at the door
Got some junkies at the door, got them junkies at the door
Servin' up burglar bars, watchin' cameras

I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Junkies at the door, got dem junkies at the door
Tiffany's, Tiffany's, we goin' shoppin' at Tiffany's
You crampin' me, they ampin' me
They 'bout to make me start braggin'
Five percent on the wagon
I spit and I'm hot as a dragon
My niggas in the streets be shootin'
My niggas in jail be stabbin'
I do good dope7Embed
