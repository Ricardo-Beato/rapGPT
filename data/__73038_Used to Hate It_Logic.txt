46 ContributorsUsed to Hate It Lyrics
Undeniable
Yeah (Logic)

Bitches be pressed for paper
Chillin' with my homie SlayDro while he ignites the vapor
(Logic)
Life is a bitch and you cannot escape her
Unless you talking suicide (Sinatra)
What the fuck you mean that I'm changin'? 'Cause I finally got a little bit of money and a Range in my driveway
With a Rattpack smoking on Zimbabwe, crankin' Sinatra, that "My Way"
Bitches they love it, Visionary nothin' above it
Get shorties wet when I rub it, carbon copies they dub it

Ha-ha-ha, you used to hate it (Used to hate it), now you love it (Now you love it)
Smile in my face (in my face,) I think nothin' of it (Nothin' of it)
Yeah, I shake your hand (Shake your hand), kill 'em with kindness (Kill em' with kindness)
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest
Ha-ha-ha, you used to hate it (Used to hate it), now you love it (Now you love it)
Smile in my face (in my face,) I think nothin' of it (Nothin' of it)
Yeah, I shake your hand (Shake your hand), kill 'em with kindness (Kill em' with kindness)
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest

Yeah, yeah
This is for my independent women that's runnin' shit in high heels
Educated in business but majored in sex appeal
My shorty she gotta, sportin' Gucci, Louis and Prada
Lookin' beautiful in it all but I prefer nada (I prefer nada)
Yeah, low maintenance and high scale
Type of shorty that when you get locked up she pay the bail
I used to follow my dreams until I caught up to 'em
People talkin' shit but pay attention to what we doin'
It's never been done, watch me go platinum just for fun
Far from materialistic, but let me stunt, son
You know what I been on, you know where I be at
The proof is within the numbers, they slumber but now they react
I got three tapes, zero tolerance, one of the greats
Put that shit together and what you get, that's where I'm from
The 3-0-1, smokin' joints with your girl for fun
Stand strong and never run 'less POPO go for the gun like
You might also like
Ha-ha-ha, you used to hate it (Used to hate it), now you love it (Now you love it)
Smile in my face (in my face,) I think nothin' of it (Nothin' of it)
Yeah, I shake your hand (Shake your hand), kill 'em with kindness (Kill em' with kindness)
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest
Ha-ha-ha, you used to hate it (Used to hate it), now you love it (Now you love it)
Smile in my face (in my face,) I think nothin' of it (Nothin' of it)
Yeah, I shake your hand (Shake your hand), kill 'em with kindness (Kill em' with kindness)
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest

Yeah
We snatch it like interception
Met the girl of my dreams, her love resembled inception
Her sign was a Leo, me, her, and music, that's the perfect trio
Spanish hunny, we met in Rio, future lookin' Cleo
Bitches be braggin', so much money my pants saggin'
VMG is up-to-date but these businessmen be laggin'
Eve bit the apple and Steve changed the world
Gettin' money like Zuckerberg, my bank account is sterol
I am not defined by that in which I do possess
'Cause all it takes is riches to get bitches to undress
I need drive in a lady, not a girl that drive me crazy
Need a girl that don't care if I drive a Honda or Mercedes (Or Mercedes)
Spit fire like Hades, I infect it like rabies
It's all that, shout out to them '90s babies
Never hesitate to supply the heat
What 6ix produces from his chest, we call that shit a heartbeat
I'm a king, you fuckers my pawns
Shortcut to the desktop, I am your newest icon
These bitches they love it, I truly can't stress it enough
Girl, got them daddy problems, that's why she be actin' tough
Innocent in person, but in the bed she love it rough
Runnin' away from reality to sniff coke and puff, so
Let me get it, the second I spit it you know that I did it, everybody wanna come around
They used to hate it, but now they love the sound
Ha-ha-ha, you used to hate it (Used to hate it), now you love it (Now you love it)
Smile in my face (in my face,) I think nothin' of it (Nothin' of it)
Yeah, I shake your hand (Shake your hand), kill 'em with kindness (Kill em' with kindness)
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest
Ha-ha-ha, you used to hate it (Used to hate it), now you love it (Now you love it)
Smile in my face (in my face,) I think nothin' of it (Nothin' of it)
Yeah, I shake your hand (Shake your hand), kill 'em with kindness (Kill em' with kindness)
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest
