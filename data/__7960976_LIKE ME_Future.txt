I got HitMan on the beat (Whew)

I got twelve watches, four bustdowns, ain't none of my shit plain
I got twenty watches all Plain Jane and I bulletproof my Range
I got twenty buss down watches, would've could've went and bought me a plane
If you don't got business mind, and he ain't kill nothin', ain't no sense stressin' my game
You can't turn mud into diamonds, then you won't feel my pain
Swear I used to sell drugs to buy fly shit, you don't know how far I came
I'm a real skreet nigga, I'm on that, for these millions, I play lane
Fuck how they feeling, nigga, I made it, do what you want bitch when I'm payin'
God damn, rap's ten, got about a quarter M in that van
How you doin' shit but servin' them jays, he say, "Wе still duckin' them rags"

You jumpin' in that water, nigga, you just like mе
I spent your salary with boss niggas who just like me
You from the trenches, got the line on dog food, you just like me
You on a jet, playin' with a check, nigga, you just like me
A street nigga with finesse, dog, you just like me
You know how to play around with that Fentanyl, you just like me

You with the junkies standin' outside, just like me
Tote a hundred round drum, told her, you just like me
Slangin' choppas, you outside, you just like me
Plain watch, bust down, just like me
You might also like
Pay in cash, ain't got no lease, nigga, you just like me
You was tryna rap, get out the skreets, nigga, you just like me
You love that bitch, but you can't trust her, dawg, you just like me
You hustle hard to get new Air Force 1s, you just like me
You put them switches on your Glock, nigga, you just like me
You ready to die behind your block, just like me, yeah, yeah

Just like me
You ready to die behind your block, just like me, yeah, yeah

If I don't pull up certain Lambs, bro, I just can't sleep
He bought the Demon, then the Lamb', nigga just like me
You out here riskin' it for your fam', nigga, you just like me
He went to bricks from a gram, nigga just like me

You with the junkies standin' outside, just like me
Tote a hundred round drum, you just like me
Slangin' choppas, you outside, you just like me
Plain watch, bust down, you just like me2Embed
