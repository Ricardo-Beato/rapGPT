5 ContributorsDouble Lyrics
C-NOTE!
R.I.P. to Michael Jackson - Go on girl!
Beat It! (Beat It! Beat It!)
My bitch got a bitch, I'm seeing double (double)
Them bitches in double trouble (double)
(x2)

I said double, double-double, double-double nigga
Double, double-double, double-double nigga
I fuck these freaks with double rubbers
I'm a lean drinker, I double cup 'em (lean, lean, lean!)
Double (double)
Double, double-double - yah!
Double, double, double
They wanna shoot me j-just like double
But I'm a gun tottin' motherfucka'
Double, double, double, d-d-d-double (double) double

You might also likeI got a charger in my charger so it's fucking double
Cost me a 60, put 60 more, now I'm burning rubber
I got Flintstones around my rollie face like Barney Rubble
These ho's so freaky, when I get head I wear double rubbers
These nigga's so sneaky, keep two forty Glocks, I double tuck 'em
They wanna shoot at me like Double-D, but they in trouble
Ay, see, your boyfriend is a lame, he's a double duck
I got his money plus my money, I got double bucks (Waka Money)
Tooly truck and Holman trucks, I double truck
64 Scagli, yea that 4-58 Ferrari bitch, I double stunt
My girlfriend got her girlfriend sucking my balls, they getting them double nuts
Your baby daddy broke and messy as hell, he got that double must
Every time I see Keyshia Ka'oir Instagram man I double lust
Me and my main bitch stunt so hard we need to drop a double diss

My bitch got a bitch, I'm seeing double (double)
Them bitches in double trouble (double)
(x2)
I said double, double-double, double-double nigga
Double, double-double, double-double nigga
I fuck these freaks with double rubbers
I'm a lean drinker, I double cup 'em (lean, lean, lean!)
Double (double)
Double, double-double - yah!
Double, double, double
They wanna shoot me j-just like double
But I'm a gun tottin' motherfucka'
Double, double, double, d-d-d-double (double) double
I got a charger in my charger so it's fucking double
Cost me a 60, put 60 more, now I'm burning rubber

Ya'll already know what it is man
Ya'll understand, Ten Seventeen, American Dream
Ya'll know what it is, turn up, don't turn down1Embed
