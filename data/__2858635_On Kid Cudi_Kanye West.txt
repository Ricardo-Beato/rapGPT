Don't try to say who I can do songs with. You mad 'cos I'm doing songs with Drake. Ain't nobody telling Ye who to do songs with. Respect the god! Run it back Mike.

Me and your parents is cool. You know how many people wish they could be signed to G.O.O.D. Music, get their life changed? Had that opportunity? Never... forget that. I'm so hurt. I feel so disrespected.
Kid Cudi, we two black men in a racist world. I wore skinny jeans first. I got called names before you bruh. Why y'all gotta be coming at me? This ain't the end of the "Malcolm X" movie!
I'm out here fighting for y'all! Creatives. Artists. Independent thinkers.
Don't never mention my name! In a bad manner!
None of y'all!1Embed
