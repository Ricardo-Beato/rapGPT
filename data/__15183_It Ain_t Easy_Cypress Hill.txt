8 ContributorsIt Ainâ€™t Easy Lyrics
I remember times I hustle, times I struggle
Times I had to get over the everyday shuffle
People trying to muffle my thoughts and all my dreams too
People who I thought were down, and see true
But I blame me too 'cause it's a Chronicle
My life, I realise I'm responsible for obstacles
In front of me, my own self to blame
But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame
It's a worthless game, but if you're willing to play
There's sharks in the water who are, willing to pay
The price of your soul, but if you give it away
You silly motherfuckers are all committed to stay
It's a cold world, but you still want a part of it
So then you'd better fuck around and learn the art of it
Don't walk through life with your blinders on
'Cause you'll keep going crazy till your mind is gone

It Ain't Easy
But you got people trying, to put you down, believe me
I keep gaining ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you deceive me?

I been around for many days, of musical mainstays
Cypress, is Worldwide and we like it that way
You can't fade-ER, or compare TO
The Original Pyscho-Baiter
Got the next rhyme and we'll check you all later
Can't nobody fuck with them Cypress Hill Raiders
Heard it all before and I don't need no more
Advice on the game and how to kick hardcore
Played the game out here with the best
Toured around the world and got big respect
Now, what's (?) all with this year 2000's?
We putting the Smackdown and we ain't clowning
Not many have lasted
Since we first blasted
Up on the scene, singing about the dream
Recruiting for our team, niggas know what I mean?
Damn, you defy, when you live or die
You might also like
It Ain't Easy
But you got people trying, to put you down, believe me
I keep gaining ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you deceive me?

Times I hated, times I waited
Times I went by where I was drunk and faded
They said I wouldn't make it, but where are those people now?
Still hating, creating all the evil now
Your insecurities are showing, exposing you
You're tripping on me and showing emotions too
Don't you spend your life full of envy, it's deadly
Heed me, as I spit the venom believe me

I keep my guard up, and always let you see my rage
I get pissed, like a pitbull in a cage  (*barking*)
Not that many can deal with the fury
Attack and ransack and kill in a hurry
I kill and observe and go in an instant
I bring the pain like the Rampart precinct
I kept it right for the brother in the chullo
Something I bump when your gates in the (?)
It Ain't Easy
But you got people trying, to put you down, believe me
I keep gaining ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you deceive me?2Embed
