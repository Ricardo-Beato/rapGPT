10 ContributorsAct Up Lyrics
See this swagger, that real boss music you know
I mean you know you had a...
You gotta turn up this shit a lil louder, you feel me?
Gucci Mane
Scream!

I ain't never want a Grammy, I ain't never been a nominee
P's in my Hummer V, 30 grand for one of these
I don't like these pussy ass niggas just like Chief Keef
Bon appétit, when I eat, nigga feast feast
Bishop think, capish pish
Keep her on a short leash
Half people deceased
Cause they know they dead meat
Toes out, top off, grinding my freak G
You came to the game but you way in the cheap seat

I swear they don't want me to succeed
But I'm not letting them leave until I stop em from breathing
I ain't fucking 'round
Don't let 'em get you down
Man, it will make a nigga really wanna act up
Cause I'm a do what I'm a do, in my new Cadillac truck
What about you? But I ain't fucking 'round
Don't let 'em get you down
You might also like
I got killers on my payroll, moving when I say so
These hoes don't really love me, they just love I got a bank roll
My plug he just keep sending blow
He ain't never said no
He mixing on the hat they broke
And I can't understand folk
I'm talkin to you, pussy ass nigga – you'd better listen
Stepped, is that so hard? With that pistol he paid attention
Jump out with them K's, start hittin' cause they were snitchin
Tell the ambulance hey no need to rush cause shorty twistin'

I swear they don't want me to succeed
But I'm not letting them leave until I stop em from breathing
I ain't fucking 'round
Don't let 'em get you down
Man, it will make a nigga really wanna act up
Cause I'm a do what I'm a do, in my new Cadillac truck
What about you? But I ain't fucking 'round
Don't let 'em get you downEmbed
