10 ContributorsThru Ya City Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We talkin' 'bout

Hot times runnin' through your city
If you miss it now, it'll sure be a pity
We got hot times runnin' through your city

I ain't no thug, son, my name is Plug Won
I drop a certified gem for him and her
Knockin' on your radio like the Crash Crew
Ask whoever you want, I'm managin' the funk on the paper
Outside of that, we pull capers for days
Ridin' throughout the maze of street while we blaze the beat
Watchin' the sweet things wiggle they butt
To Plug Three, on the cut, movin' on you
Whatever you got, we gon' get
Bringin' our point to your position
Rippin' stages with my thought coalition
Carryin' on, eradicate all your stress mode
Just another episode through these area codes
We bankin' on
You might also like
Hot times runnin' through your city
If you miss it now, it'll sure be a pity
We got hot times runnin' through your city
Hmm

It's the hotness, talked about, but never seen
Like the Loch Ness, 'til ya cop this, drop it inside your vein
And like a train, we be runnin' throughout your legs and arms
You're high off our talent and charm
Check the caliber
This be a smash like some food on stage for Gallagher
Wear your bib 'cause it's messy
Niggas schemin' on my girl as if my name was Jesse
Watch your manners
Now let me pass it off to Dave Banner

Yo, I set travels like Karen LaRue
Small talkin' in the big city, it's all about gettin' the coins
Everywhere I go, I touch a tenderloin
They sportin' a dot com Viet marker bomb
On your metro, MARTA, or the iron horse
Yo, take the cross and meet a nigga at the butcher
I'm cuttin' your girl, we on a world tour
Supplyin' your bloodstream with nothin' but the pure uncut in you
Hot times runnin' through your city
If you miss it now, it'll sure be a pity
We got hot times runnin' through your city
Mmm

Freak, freak, freak, freak the funk, the funk, the funk, the funk, funk
Freak the, freak the, freak the, freak the, freak the, freak
Freak, freak the funk, freak, freak the funk

We ain't walkin' on a yellow brick road, these streets stay red and bloody, kid
Study your code so you can easily pass
I stash a little love when I'm on the visitation
If you crossin' my line, nigga, do the same
I'm guaranteed to run through and prove the game
Ain't bigger than the pieces in it
You see, the feces in it had me stuck travelin' one side of map
Clappin' hands with rap cats who ain't deserve dap
Long hauls and livin' out a suitcase, man
Chickenheads and gangs of fruitcakes, man
Ain't nothin' better than explorin' the outskirts
Especially when she ain't got no pantyhose on, and it's on

Hot times runnin' through your city
If you miss it now, it'll sure be a pity
We got hot times runnin' through your city
Mmm
Hot times runnin' through your city
If you miss it now, it'll sure be a pity
We got hot times runnin' through your city
Mmm
Yo, it's like, the Mercenary gettin' down (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And we got Dave Banner gettin' down
And we got Maseo gettin' down (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And of course, my nigga Eno gettin' down
And we got Jay Dee gettin' down (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Say word, y'all)
And of course, the Slum V gettin' down
And we got my man Khrist gettin' down (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And we got Com Sense gettin' down
And we got N.D. gettin' down (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You know Troy Hightower gettin' down
And we got C. Smith gettin' down (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And my nigga Dave West gettin' down
Come on, come on
What you doin' there?
Yeah, come onEmbed
