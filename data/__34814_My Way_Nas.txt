44 ContributorsMy Way Lyrics
Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight
Livin' my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on?
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Boppin' to The Supremes, smokin' joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want

(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', backspins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bulletproof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said
(I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
(I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me
(I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat
You might also like
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Jacuzzi's, Gucci soap, throwin' cash in the air
Though I still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get what I got
They think it's a lot; in the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, comin' if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder 'til I seen my man get popped
No blood soakin', layin' there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was lookin' right through me, yo, starin' beyond
I wonder what he saw: the limos, movies and tours?
Did he die in vain or represent for the cause?
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game; y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (Ill Will)

(I did it my way) from the crumbs, roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) I call it how I see it, niggas
(I did it my way) if you don't like it, so be it, niggas
(I did it my way) I make my own rules, do my own plans
(I did it my way) gangstas do what they want, suckers do what they can
(I did it my way) takin' sacrifices, kid
(I did it my way) you only gettin' one life to live
Yo, hoes in my focus slow me; roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scoldin' my foes who phony
From blocks where coke'll feed you, and cops is over-evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel
Her-on and blow, it ruins minds, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappeared
Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminisce and remember
Sittin' on wood benches gave me splinters
Just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, movin'
I thank the ones who said
"Shorty, go home, we about to be shootin'"

(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bulletproof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said
(I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
(I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me
(I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat9Embed
