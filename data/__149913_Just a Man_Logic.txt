61 ContributorsJust a Man Lyrics
Yeah, this is my vision
Written without second thought or revision
The type of shit that affect you like an oncoming collision
That just make you freeze, drop to your knees and beg 'em
Please Lord, forgive me for gripping a semi now
When searching for God all I ever do is stare up
While Satan sending me women
Wearing nothing but they hair up
Got the condom on the dresser, I can't wait to undress her
Would you think lesser of me if I did it?
Cause I get lonely, I'm human, and boy it's been a minute
Fresh out the states, surrounded by women that wanna hit it
But should I take the pussy just cause I could get it?
Or do I want something that's more committed?
God damn, it's hard to admit it
As you focus on the little things, the bigger ones will get you
So I minimize the negatives to see the bigger picture
I get richer while you fuckers hate
So keep it up and watch a young brother elevate
I'm black and white but racism I still cannot evade
I never understood the concept, even to this day
You know we're all the same in the eyes of a blade
Because when men shed blood it's still the same shade

That's why I'm just a man homie
Flesh and blood, I'm just a man
But I don't think they understand homie
I ain't perfect, I'm just a man
Yeah, y'all think I'm more than just a man
You might also like
I contemplate on the daily if I'll survive and strive
To be the greatest lyricist dead or alive, I gotta prevail
That's my word like excel
Went from a small town in West Deer Park to XXL
Now we shopping at Louis V, back in the day it was Ross
They calling me the savior, hope they don't give me the cross
Now that's the realest shit you ever heard
Never in the streets but I was closer than the curb
Do you feel me?—Whole world wanna kill me
Signed a deal but I'm still me—in five years will I still be?
Ever since I was a youngin this is all I've ever wanted
Always kept it real while they perpetrated and fronted
I was in the studio while they was gettin' blunted
Always have my doubts but deep down I knew I'd run it
Sportin' Armani like menage a trois that's double breasted
A lot of time I've invested and never once have I rested
Feeling nervous like when you getting tested
The game is over saturated, completely infested
The greatest story ever told, realest song ever written
To hell with a Plan B, motherfucker I ain't kiddin
I''m just trying to get this money, I'm just trying to get paid
That's the type of mentality put careers in the grave
Fuck how much you made
What's it worth if your memory fade?
Now I ain't perfect, on occasion I'm strayed
It's been forever since I prayed and I guess today is the day
So I step in the booth and treat that shit like a confessional
Thinking back as I reminisce
Wondering; does God even exist?
A man of faith but mentally I feel at risk
What you want from me, where am I supposed to go?
Seems like you never talk, tell me how I'm supposed to know?
I'm just a man, I ain't perfect—is this life even worth it?
It's time to dig up the past so fuck it let's unearth it
Like my childhood, living free like a child should
Remember the time I opened the bedroom door crack?
And saw my daddy smoking more crack?
No food in my house, we just couldn't afford that
Momma drinking, sleeping until five
But she always seemed to get up whenever men arrived
Feeling alone at like eleven
Segregated from the other kids like it was 1957
I've loved, I've hated, I've cried, I've died inside
I've resurrected but don't neglect that I've modified
I'm stronger, faster, better than ever before
And everything I've been through can honestly assure
I'm no less, no more
That's why I'm just a man homie
Flesh and blood, I'm just a man
But I don't think they understand homie
I ain't perfect, I'm just a man
Y'all think I'm more than just a man30Embed
