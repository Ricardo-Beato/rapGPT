3 ContributorsIntro (Freestyle) LyricsYo, you see how rappers are now?
Turn the camera at me
See what the public-
See what y'all did to rappers?
They scared to be theyself
You know what I'm saying?
Niggas don't think that people
Gonna accept them as theyself

That's what people don't understand about me
That I could make so many albums and just keep going
How the fuck you do that?
Because it's me, It's really me
I'm just talking what I go through
Whatever it is, be it good
I might say the worst shit
In the world, but it's me
But then you saying shit
That make people in the hood do crime
You're gonna do it
'cause you want to do it
But then you don't help them
You saying that you sell drugs
That you've got a gun
This, that, that
My rhymes are not
"Yo, nigga, it's all good."
You know what I'm saying?
More so now
You toned it down
For whatever...
Yeah, the evil
The bad side of...
Yeah. "There's heaven
And then there's hell, niggas
One day you're cruisin'
In the 7
The next day
Your alibis ain't matchin' up
Bullshit catchin' up
You hit with the rico
They repo that vehicle
Shit was all good just a week ago
About to start snitchin' ain't you?
Ready to start bitchin' ain't you?
I forgive you, I forgive you
Hustlin' just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars
Honeys that shake
They ass in bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers
Carriers of mac-millers
East Coast bodiers
West Coast cap peelers
Little monkey niggas
Turned gorillas
These are my rhymes, "B"!
This is my first albumYou might also likeEmbed
