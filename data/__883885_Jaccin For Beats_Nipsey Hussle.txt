7 ContributorsJaccin For Beats Lyrics
Look
Hoppin' off the plane
Blue chucks on the runway
Hussle nigga yeah I only get it one way
Momma said boy you'se a fool stay in school
Last month I made more then every teacher at my school
Come, kick it at my pool, come, swim in my jacuzzi
Watch my big screen you could fuck one of my groupies
Truly, young hussle livin' like a boss now
Straight up Slauson to Fox Hills and tear the mall down
Five thousand, really it ain't nothing fuck browsing
Spend it all double back for more hustling
I'm so south centralized I'm accustomed
To envy I see hatred in his eyes I'mma rush him
Trust no, bitches you'll be fucked over lust plus
It's six million ways to die that's just one, I'm
One in a million, mammas grab your children
Save 'em from the block and what's in back of them buildings
We'll be, somewhere on the coast fucking filthy
Rich off racks smokin' cohetes buying realty
Gold medalist, I got to bring the torch home
Speed boating and gettin' my Scott Storch on
Now Al Gore calling me up on my iPhone
Sayin' that the kush that I'm burnin' fuck up the Ozone
09, a nigga tryna' to go fo golds
Nip Hussle nigga rich roll or get rolled on
You might also likeYea, and my big shots to my bro bros
And fuck you's to the niggas that told on
Little chopper
Young niggas, to the judge they was still grown
Old enough to do a hunnit on the Level 4
Gangbangin' niggas harder than a steel toe
Still know, I still go and kill fo'
What we pledge allegiance and squabble back of the 'ville fo'
They yo' hands in the ai-r
And wave 'em like you just don't ca-re
If you a Blood or a Crip on that gangbang shit
Everybody say, 'Oh-ye-a'
Back in action, tiny Locs, gettin' clapped for crackin'
You turnt down, I'm active
Minus the fact I'm gettin' paid just to do this rap shit
Still find time to leave my enemies fractured
You niggas is actors, my niggas is
Nah, I mean
My pistol erases
Any nigga hatin'
I'm 'bout the cashEmbed
