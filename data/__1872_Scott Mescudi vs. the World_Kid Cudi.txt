What up, how is everyone doing?
You are now in a world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some "generation next" shit
Speak for the silent who are left with
Parallel levels in a dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club
Money doesn't move me except on the literal
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words, these are facts from a winner

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side
You might also like
What up, how is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, faded aided to the T
Work hard, making sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side31Embed
