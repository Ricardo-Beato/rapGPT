40 ContributorsBeen Around Lyrics
When you, when you was in Chicago still
Did you find yourself like as a lost boy?
Yep, mmh
No mother

I think I could do better, but I still
I want this forever
Uh, sometimes life's about the people you know
Watchin' a flower bloom as its features will grow
I mean, I never been one to preach to them folks
I'm just speakin' from experience, my teachings is dope
Learning lessons with my brethren, joy is quite contagious
Counting blessings on blessings, my heart right to make it
And it's kinda my only option, maybe my decisions
Haven't really been the best, but this my life I'm livin'
Although it seem so bittersweet when you ain't got nothing to eat
And Sallie Mae callin' your phone for like the fifth time this week
All your bills overdue, all your bitches over you
Only one option remains, you just gotta show and prove

And so I know, little darling
I know how the pain, it hurts
Say something to me sweetie
We'll get through, we'll make it work
'Cause I've been around
And you've caught me down bad, I say
Next time in town
You're always welcome 'round my way
You might also like
Uh, so take risks and live spontaneous, I'm so insane
But that's the shit that make me rich and why we love the game
And to my various enemies who carrying energy
Of greed and envy, just know I love you for centuries
So all is forgiven, animosity for none
'Cause I done been through a lot, thankful who I have become
I done lost a couple brothers, dead cousins on the regular
But I ain't even stressing, count my blessings, know we headed up
I dropped out of school, pops thinkin' I'm a fool
It may seem all cool, but I'm feelin' awful
I was down in the dumps with my confidence gone
But then my whole life changed, droppin' prominent songs

And so I know, little darling
I know how the pain, it hurts
Say something to me sweetie
We'll get through, we'll make it work
'Cause I've been around
And you've caught me down bad, I say
Next time in town
You're always welcome 'round my way8Embed
