We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'
We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'

Yeah, I'm back, bitches, niggas know that, bitches
You've been missin' the game when it come to these rap bitches
You can quote cash for heat, cause she has it
When it come to the heat, she's a eat hazard
His bitch is a cheat, sick as can be
Niggas with HIV ain't sicker than me
But you claim to be the sickest em see
And I can't do shit but laugh at you like you're ticklin' me
Cause y'all niggas ain't tough, y'all fake
A lotta niggas is rough, but so is the surface of coffee cake
Get yo paws and get off my plate
Hook it off, tho can't toss the waves if yo corpse decay

We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'
We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'

I'm the type of nigga you should praise
The hood luv a nigga like good haze
This is what the hood made
(Applaud Mila?!) I been grindin' since a puppy
Squeeze the.4 beefer, you'll survive if you're lucky
Trust me, you don't wanna see me flippin' out
Nah, fuck that, X, it's time now, I'm flippin' out
Walk with me now, gon' fly with me later 
Well I been ride or die, it's been fuck a hater
So get the muzzler out, I'm a spit, got rabies
Hard on the beats, street sweep with the ladies
I'll pop a collar, snap a fingers, break yo neck
Now show me some respect, and cut the fuckin' set

We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'
We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'Embed
