1 ContributorGo Head (80 Gz) Lyrics
Shawty got a ass on her (On her)
I'ma put my hands on her (On her, DJ Mothafuckin' Rell)
I'ma spend a couple grand on her (On her)
I'ma pop a rubber band on her (On her, Trapaholics)

I'm tryna figure which chick I'ma see today (See today)
Picked up a young girl, looked like Lisa Raye (Lisa Raye)
When I seen her in the club, said I gots to get her (Gots to get her)
'Cause she look like she might be Trina sister (Trina sister)
Got a girl that look just like Lauryn Hill (Lauryn Hill)
Took her to the crib 'cause she know what it is (She know what it is)
Love her mama, but I can't stand her daddy, though (Her daddy, though)
But shе got more ass than Jacki-O (Jacki-O)
Got a brown-skinned girl like Foxy Brown (Foxy Brown)
Bought a quartеr-pound just to blow it down (Blow it down)
Tattoos all over like Eve or somethin' (Eve or somethin')
Long hair, but it must be weave or somethin' (Weave or somethin')
Got a spot, so I bought her new furniture (Furniture)
'Cause she pretty in the face like Monica (Monica)
I really dig the girl
So I gave her a ticket to Gucci World (Gucci World)You might also likeEmbed
