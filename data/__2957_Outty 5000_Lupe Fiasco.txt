30 ContributorsOutty 5000 Lyrics
Are all nerds as good as you?
Yes

Look look! Gander gander
It's the young boy from the Lambda Lambdas
The Land of Lincoln, the Grand Theft Auto: Chicago
Warn all the mics that he's hardcore
And he's thinking, rose bearers to the area
Spotlights, dancers dancers
Pro Tools come in, answer answer
His flow is like the Klu Klux versus the Panthers
HaHaaaaa!

Hit the track like a heart attack, cancer cancer
Boogie Man on the mic and a band of Santas
And the Easter Bunny is the backup dancer
They fainting in the stands, gotta fan the fans-uh
Panties on the stage and the pampers of grandmas
Cause they love the way that I pamper the grammar
Moon Man, strutting down the ramp of the lander
Was nuts with the cane, Planters Planters
Adjust my frames, tamper tamper
I'm real, they Seinfeld
They ain't talking 'bout nothing, George Castanza
Louder louder, grander grander
'Cuff a friend, we tell it to 'em like Miranda
The game's in danger, panda panda
Send orders to the reporters, tell 'em pan the cameras
You might get killed if you don't listen enough
Well I guess I'm dead cause I ain't listen to Puff
HaHaaaaa!

Best believe our system it sucks
And a person like me don't believe in assistin' in such
Nah, I be rippin' 'em up
But for every pond there is different ducks
I believe if you participate at a lower level you can get a lot more things done
Like working with the alderman, but I ain't alterin' this song
To be a political statement
Let's take it back to the basement
To the encore of the sold out tour
The "More, more!"s and the standing ovations
They be standing with more patience than the county on a Friday
I did it my way, thank them
