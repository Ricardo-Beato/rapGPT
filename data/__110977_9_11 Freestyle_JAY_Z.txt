19 Contributors9/11 Freestyle LyricsBootleggers, bombing, Bin Laden
I'm still crackin'
I will not lose, I simply refuse
I dropped the same date as the Twin Towers
I show power
Still I show compassion for others, sent money and flowers
Devote hours
I live in the struggle, I'm addicted to the hustle
I'm conflicted because, dude
America, this land of mine
Is filled with prisoners, with the same plans as mine
So I'm a walking contradiction
On one hand I love my position
But easily I could have been in that prison
And no, I am not a Christian, though I believe in God
But I don't believe in the devil, my beliefs are odd
If we the people was given freewill from God
How could He give the people freewill, without giving you E-vil?
We will hold it together, believe in the Roc
Long after you leave the spot
Long after my breathing stops
My spirit remains vibrant, I will lead the flock
And that's the tip of the iceberg
You might hear Christ's words in my scriptures
But I only write it for my niggasYou might also like6Embed
