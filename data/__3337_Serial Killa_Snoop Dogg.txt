75 ContributorsSerial Killa Lyrics
Six million ways to die, choose one

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt
Death becomes all niggas, anybody killer
You know what the deal is, nigga, you know what the real is

I see some off-brand niggas on the corner flaggin' me down
Sayin', "Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Ayo, what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?"
I said, "If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the gang"
It's like this, they don't understand
It's an everyday thang to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up with you? I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
Or Compton and Watts see D-O-Gs, now
You can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang, one gun
Is all that we need to put you to rest
(Pump-pump) Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping
Six feet deep in, fucking with the Pound is
You might also like
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

The cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, ooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon
'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon (Ayy, nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you (I won't leave you)
Until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half-stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself, motherfucker, 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the Devil
Now roam through the depths of Hell
Where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin' name?

Wake up in the morning, eat your Lucky Charms cereal

Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta
Now picture this
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine to crack your fuckin' chest plate
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally roughneck
Now everybody scream, 'nuff respect to the X
'Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living
Word to mama and my drama, dilemma

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin' name?
