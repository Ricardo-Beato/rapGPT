Baby girl, hey ya

What kind of language do you know?
English and some French
(...)
Baby girl, hey ya
I know a little French, though...

Loving
(...)
The sound of you comin'
Is nothing
(...)
Loving, loving, loving...

Ever you made love out in the rain
But your body so hot
That the water does not ??? in the flame
So arouse to the brain
??? Profanities coming out of you
And you shouting out my name
I'm the truth like I'm coming out ???
We are on the top of the world
And to reach this level had to climb a mountain of pain
But we are here now
Noting to fear now
Everything clear now
I ain't gotta tear down walls to your heart now
Every single stare down
Calling for sex
So emotional tear gonna fall
I applaud your agility
Should you really be deserving an encore standing ovation
Old faces, Got you feeling all flush
Cause we are touching in public places
In the studio alone on the console
Making amateurs movies in a condo
You gonna need a toe-tag like John Doe
When I'm wilding out with my tongue like Jon Snow
Every sword need a chief
Animal attraction like I'm lord of the beast
You are the lioness
And you roar so loud
Niggas call the police
You might also like
Doesn't matter
Where we get down
When love comes over us
Doesn't matter
Where we get down
When love comes over us
Baby girl, hey ya
You are my one and only
My one and only
You are my one and only
Baby girl, hey ya
You are my one and only
You are my one and only
How come you lonely?

??? ambition girl
You are going places
I make the temperature rise
Call it homeostasis
We are up and down
We on and on
I'm sorry ain't being around
Let me show remorse
Now you showin' off
Now you showin' out
Know what? We are staying in
Fuck going out
We smoking out

We smoking now
We smoking now
What you know about?
What you know about?
What you know about?
