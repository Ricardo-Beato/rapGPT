8 ContributorsDown & Out Lyrics
Baby, oh it just pains me
To see you down and out

It just pains me when I see my main boo thang
Down and out, going through her fucking mood swangs
You and your bestie having convos about Longway
I just landed first class on the runway
You feel my feng shui, I’m in London bae
Racks andale, fuck you mean down and out?
You the queen of my house, got shit to be stressing bout
On your call and  route, fuck your bestie talking bout?

Baby, oh it just pains me
To see you down and out

Oh baby, just tell me
What do you want, I
All I got to
You ain’t got to say anything
Oh I, don’t know, I don't really
Anything you need
You might also like
Baby, oh it just pains me
To see you down and out1Embed
