Burr Burr Burr Burr Burr Yeah Yeah nigga Yeah
Recording shit in our own studio yeah

These niggas hate to see ya working
That crack a smile when ya hurtin
They say ya were a different person
Cause ya truck on some 30s
I tell em man I deserve it
These shits ain't worth nothings
I tell em man I deserve it
These shits ain't worth nothings
I tell em man I deserve it
These shits ain't worth nothings
I tell em man I deserve it
These shits ain't worth nothings

Bricksquad money pounds ammunition
Every whip i gotta mount on 30 inches
Servin junkies fishstones out the kitchen
Got me rubber facing big face bit benjis
I done went from a Jack to a blue face
I Drop the top Double RR like a tooth-pick
I got it off the all the junkies love Colgate
OG Gas bag send it to state to state
Show em how to whip a brick I ricky lake
And the Price on the coco make a nigga hate
I'm the type that skeeted in yo bitch face
Cavalli givenchy i put the fendi on my waist
? the russian AK
No face no case yellow tape shit
Back to the spot doing numbers everything gucci
Young nigga trappin' in Yellow Pucci's

These niggas hate to see ya working
That crack a smile when ya hurtin
They say ya were a different person
Cause ya truck on some 30s
I tell em man I deserve it
These shits ain't worth nothings
I tell em man I deserve it
These shits ain't worth nothings
I tell em man I deserve it
These shits ain't worth nothings
I tell em man I deserve it
These shits ain't worth nothingsEmbed
