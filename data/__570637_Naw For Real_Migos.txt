14 ContributorsNaw For Real Lyrics
Your bitch, she wet, she leakin' (Naw forreal)
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (Naw forreal)
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me (Naw forreal)
When you gettin' money, stack it up for a reason (Naw forreal)
Take a look at my life back then, trap season (Naw forreal)
When you make it, everybody think that it's easy (Naw forreal)
My family need me (Naw forreal, forreal)
My squad let me lead 'em (Naw forreal, forreal)

Get this bitch ass nigga off of from 'round me, Naw forreal
I had the plug with the molly and the xans in a marijuana field
Want to live the Migo life? It's hard to live
Want to walk in my shoes? That is hard to fill
Naw forreal, man you know that we made a mil'
Independent, I cease and desist your deal
You niggas trippin' cause you out of business
And we came in the game so fast, we're professionals
Started doin' shows at Mansion and Obsessions
You seen it, everybody know, they witnessed
Naw forreal, R.I.P. my nigga Pistol P
I know he send a nigga down blessings
Now I wanna walk around on the north
Nigga gotta keep the mac chicken
You might also like
Your bitch, she wet, she leakin' (Naw forreal)
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (Naw forreal)
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me (Naw forreal)
When you gettin' money, stack it up for a reason (Naw forreal)
Take a look at my life back then, trap season (Naw forreal)
When you make it, everybody think that it's easy (Naw forreal)
My family need me (Naw forreal, forreal)
My squad let me lead 'em (Naw forreal, forreal)

Offset!
Naw forreal, really had to sit down and do some time
Naw forreal, young rich nigga got rich off of a halftime
The block be beatin' like Alpine, nah forreal, 200 for the Act line
Stand at the stove, whip a slab, that's a cookie slab
Police tried to get me for a gang, I had an alibi
Nah, fuck niggas you a lie
Rel hit a jug Willie Mac found a nine
Forreal we were hot boys
Put the gun up in your mouth just like a Altoids
Chopper start snappin', gotta be a damn poet
We ain't holdin' no lean, go ahead and pour it
Skinny tires on the rari' lookin' bow legged
I'm a bachelor, I live in a mansion that's gated
44 to say bow!
Your bitch, she wet, she leakin' (Naw forreal)
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (Naw forreal)
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me (Naw forreal)
When you gettin' money, stack it up for a reason (Naw forreal)
Take a look at my life back then, trap season (Naw forreal)
When you make it, everybody think that it's easy (Naw forreal)
My family need me (Naw forreal, forreal)
My squad let me lead 'em (Naw forreal, forreal)

Naw forreal, pints double sealed
And the OG gas bag come vacuum sealed
Remember kickin' in your door takin' flats
And the door stickin' out at my grandma crib
Trap on the block whether rain, sleet, or snow
Young nigga tryna make a dope deal
They askin' me questions like Dr. Phil
Got excited when I seen a half a mil'
I was prayin' just to get a record deal
Now we independent, worth a couple M's
Came a long way from bustin' out sticks and stems
It's a lot of shit that I regret I did
Can't let negativity get to me
I take a private jet to Sicily
So you the grinch who stole Christmas
I got the OG gas bag Christmas tree
Your bitch, she wet, she leakin' (Naw forreal)
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (Naw forreal)
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me (Naw forreal)
When you gettin' money, stack it up for a reason (Naw forreal)
Take a look at my life back then, trap season (Naw forreal)
When you make it, everybody think that it's easy (Naw forreal)
My family need me (Naw forreal, forreal)
My squad let me lead 'em (Naw forreal, forreal)3Embed
