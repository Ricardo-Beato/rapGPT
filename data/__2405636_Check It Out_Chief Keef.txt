Zaytoven
Ayy, check it out, nigga
Check it out, nigga, ayy, ayy
Bang, Sos', baby, yeah, baby
Ayy, go, ayy, go, pew, pew
Ayy, go, yeah, baby
Ayy, go, go

You got some money for me? Check it out
I'm icy, know I had to bring the necklace out
I saw a bitch, I told that bitch to check it out
I hop up out the car, she wanna check me out
I'm in your city for a day, bitch, check it out
Too late, bitch, I'm already checking out
The cops pull up on me, they like, "Check it out"
Glad my shit was tucked and I ain't have the weapon out

Hit the dealership like, "Check it out, my doors creep me out"
Told my Glock .40, "Ayy, check it out, these hoes creep me out"
These niggas eat these hoes out, ayy, these hoes eat me out
These bitches be geeking every time they ass see me out
Want smoke, check it out, checking in, checking out
Check it out, my whip sound like he just went to bed just now
It said vroom, sound like it was snoring, had to check it out
Check in at the doctor, get the script, then I'm checking out
You might also like
You got some money for me? Check it out
I'm icy, know I had to bring the necklace out
I saw a bitch, I told that bitch to check it out
I hop up out the car, she wanna check me out
I'm in your city for a day, bitch, check it out
Too late, bitch, I'm already checking out
The cops pull up on me, they like, "Check it out"
Glad my shit was tucked and I ain't have the weapon out

Hit the doctor for a checkup then I'm checking out
Why you steady looking at me? Bitch, check it out
She step outside the box then I check her out
Like a halfway house, I'm checking in, checking out
I'm checking my car for bugs, checking my car for dubs
I'm checking my car for change just to give to the club
Foenem check the spot out, we gon' come through, line 'em up
Check 'em in a torture house, drown his ass, tie him up
I check my money, better be right when I count it up
I go to sleep, what the fuck I see? Cap and Blood
Foenem said they had to check and make sure that I'm acting up
Feet hit the concrete, hopping out the swan doors
I got a package coming in, I was checking the time for it
These Louis shades, lil mama, these ain't no Tom Fords
Your bitch was checking me out, soon as I walked in the door
I was checking for racks, for cheese, for green, for lawn mowers
Go and get some Margielas, no need to see the Concords
I'm checking for cowards, for boolers, the shooters, the nine blowers
I'm checking on foenem, they cooling, they booling with nine whores
Smoking on dope, I'm cooling, I be smoking that mind blower
I come through, I'm checking on checks, yeah, I'm checking for mine, boy
I ain't checking for hoes, I get my box and check up, boy
I ain't checking for you, you sitting on your ass, get up, boy
I'm checkin' Saks and bill direct, Margielas and marble floors
You got some money for me? Check it out
I'm icy, know I had to bring the necklace out
I saw a bitch, I told that bitch to check it out
I hop up out the car, she wanna check me out
I'm in your city for a day, bitch, check it out
Too late, bitch, I'm already checking out
The cops pull up on me, they like, "Check it out"
Glad my shit was tucked and I ain't have the weapon out2Embed
