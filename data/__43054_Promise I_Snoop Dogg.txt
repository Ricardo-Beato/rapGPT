4 ContributorsPromise I Lyrics
Papito, te amo, y nunca, nunca quiero dejarte
I'll never leave
Never leave you, no
I'll never
No, no, no
No, no, no

Boy, boy, boy (You know that you got me, Snoop)
You're a joy, joy, joy (It's all the pimpin' things you do)
Boy, you got me in a daze
And I don't if it's the haze
'Cause we smoke so much
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Get a bitch, got a bitch
Hang out with the D-O Double, girl, be a part of this
Now hang up your coat
Blaze the dope, never missin' a stroke, yeah, yeah
Now this here's a torpedo
You ever seen a stretch Learjet two-seater? (No)
It ain't what you want, it's what you need to
Real-ass nigga to help you kick your feet up (Yeah)
Now flip the channel to Lifetime
You stay on my mind even when I'm writin' rhymes
We can chill all day until the nighttime (Nighttime)
I'll let you know when to go at the right time (Right time)
I know you don't wanna go, but you gotta get the hell up out of here (Go, go)
I say, "Go," you say, "No," go
You might also like
Boy, boy, boy (You know that you got me, Snoop)
You're a joy, joy, joy (It's all the pimpin' things you do)
Boy, you got me in a daze
And I don't if it's the haze
'Cause we smoke so much
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Have a drink, have a toke
What it do? Whatever you want
And we don't wait until the first of the month
We never hesitate to roll a hundred-dollar blunt
Nigga, money is nothin' to us
It's big pimpin' over here, baby, you fuckin' with us
Struck it rich with the struck of the luck of the Dutch
Tripled you up, you little late for the flush (Flush)
You got plans for honeymoon (Honeymoon)
I got plans to move your fine ass up in my living room
At the studio on the D-low, is you with it? (With it, never leave you, no)
You gots to stay committed
To do what I say, no matter how I spit it
You're with it
If I say, "Go," that means go
Now go
Boy, boy, boy (You know that you got me, Snoop)
You're a joy, joy, joy (It's all the pimpin' things you do)
Boy, you got me in a daze
And I don't if it's the haze
'Cause we smoke so much
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (Wee)
Yeah, come spend a week with the Blackjack Tripper
Unzip your zipper
Got a couple of bitches that's gon' help you up out of that
I want you to sing with 'em
All y'all sing together, come on, we gon' be a group
Let me hear you say
Promise I'll never leave you
All my bitches, let me hear you say
Promise I'll never leave you
Come on, let me hear you say1Embed
