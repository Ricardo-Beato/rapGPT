This is a Melo beat
Traphouse Mob

Baby girl, come and meet the woo
She know we keep a tool
Big knockin' on my body
Watch who you speaking to
(Girl, watch who you speaking to)
Baby girl, come and meet the woo (Uh-huh)
Big knockin' on my body
The beat went off?

I call Ace Makaveli, got treesh in the 'telly
Shawty wan' fuck off a glass of some Henny (Gang)
Don't call my phone, got the feds on my celly
Flight to Miami, put dick in her belly
Wanna make bread, tell her open up Welly
TD, OA, Tander, Citi, Chevy (Woo)
Pull up in Rovers, catch him, it's over
Spinnin' like Julius Sover
Shoot down Hawthorne, shooting like Korver
Put that boy head on his shoulders (Shoulders)
Swerving (Swerving), give him two shots if he twirling (Grrt), uh
Burn him (Burn him), I promise it's gon' be a murder (Murder)
If I catch him, I hurt him
Sliding, I murk him
Look at that boy looking nervous (Uh-huh)
I got one thing for sure, I got two things for certain
They wrap that boy up in a curtain (Wrap him in a curtain), uh
Touchy, I drop thirty-eight on his touchy (Touchy)
I made it flip off this uppy (Uppy)
I turn that boy to a duppy (Duppy), uh
Balmain (Uh), true blue (Woo), ocean (Woo)
Mystery (Woo), potion
Back out (Uh), toast him (Uh)
Pop Smoke (Grrt), run him over, over, over
Rrr (Woo)
