21 ContributorsTrap Money (2006) Lyrics
Zaytoven
I got trap money dawg
Real talk, real spit like
I ain't even gotta rap
I'm good nigga
I make hits nigga
Now da word on da street I work for a mil od da low nigga
Shawty Lo in this mutha fucka wit me nigga,westside to zone 6 nigga
Dats wats happenin nigga

Ey mane you wanna rock gucci then that means you wanna die
Soon as you shop wit Shawty Lo, tell me what you wanna buy
I'm a rapper, slash trapper, and my lyrics so fye
Every time tha drop come, throw my prices so high
Give some work to my dawg, told em take it round there
Soon as you get dat cake, bring it right back here
I got trap money baby, I sell cris, not beers
I got trap money baby, you can check my ears
Half a mil for a deal homie why you sign that?
Where I had to cop that gola, they will neva find that
Mix the yay with the soda, it come back to good use
Wife beater on shawty, just to show my tattos
I'm a zone 6 rapper, cash mil thats flat
I ain't talkin to you nigga, less u want a tic-tac
Give some work to my dawg, he gone bring dat money back
If i front a 100 pounds, he gone bring a 100 stacks

I got trap money, I got trap money, I got trap money
20 for a show, but it's really rap money
20 for a hole, and it's really trap money

I'm ridin biggo, we be talkin real illego
I be like 500 taco homes, 75 burritos
When I talk to my rasta, be like where da bumbaclot?
Twenty thousand pounds, we might bring dat to my trap spot
A Chinese plug wit dem pills, no lie
Every time I shop wit him he like hurry up and buy
Gotta rush wit my shoppin cause I really don't curr
Got a work and a deal, shawty under control
Got a couple niggas buyin and he want a big part
As-salamu alaikum, wa ʿalaykumu s-salām
Got a groupie nigga buyin and he really can't walk
And anotha nigga buyin and he really can't talk
You might think that shit funny but I'm not a comedian
Wanna-be trappers seem to lack da ingredients
Gucci Mane and Shawty Lo, we pushin weight nigga
I got trap money nigga, I'm a heavy cake nigga

I got trap money, I got trap money, I got trap money
20 for a show, but it's really rap money
20 for a hole, and it's really trap money
I'm at da base, and Gucci at da trap house
I'm in da kitchen and dat shit smellin real loud
And I ain't use nothin but a lil soda
A lil water and it jumped back ova
30 minutes, thirty grand
I'll bake dem cakes, I'm da baker's man
I'll sell more shoes than baker's man
I'll blow hundreds of grand and baker's man
I got trap money, I got rap money
And I don't rap, I connects da spits
Do what I want, talk, blow on these
Da blow taught me so I'ma teach da streets

I got trap money, I got trap money, I got trap money
20 for a show, but it's really rap money
20 for a hole, and it's really trap money1Embed
