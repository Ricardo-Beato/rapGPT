84 ContributorsDie Like a Rockstar Lyrics
Brown bless the mic like gesundheit
Bud 'bout the size of a bonsai
Kick it like Muay Thai, flow like sci-fi in high def
I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored
And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch in my target when I shoot my load
Bullseye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died from
Smoke somethin' with your man, bitch
Like Wyclef, used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript, sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffin' Adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Trippin' off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much, it's a miracle I'm livin'

And I'ma die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar

Bitch, I wanna party like Chris Farley
Shot of Hennessy, spike that with some molly
Tell mommy I'm sorry, God bless my soul
But life was so sublime, goin' out like Brad Nowell
I got that Kurt Cobain type of mindframe
Feelin' like Keith Moon, shrooms in my dressing room
Basquiat freestyle
Feeling like Jimi Hendrix in Anna-Nicole mouth
River Phoenix, '93, VIP
With some drugged-up porn hoes all around me
Like Teri Diver, Linda Wong
All in hell havin' orgies where the horns growing long
'Cause, bitch, I'm Frankie Lymon, Heath Ledger
Hyped up in a jacuzzi, doing that John Belushi
With Brittany Murphy, we blowin' hershey
I'ma die like a rockstar18Embed
