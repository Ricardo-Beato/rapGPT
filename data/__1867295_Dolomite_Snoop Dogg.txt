7 ContributorsDolomite Lyrics
Yes, this is me, the bad, bad dolomite
And I'm ready to put me in the White House
Make me the President
I'm gonna move on my first act
I'm a, get me 2000 raggedy ass painters
To paint the muthafuckin' White House black
Dolomite for your president
I'ma legalize every muthafuckin' thing
Somebody ask me how do I stand on Marijuana
Very high baby, very high
How do I stand on prostitution
I don't stand on it, I lay on it
I'ma legalize sellin' pussy
Sell it, sell it, sell your pussy, girls
Pussy will sell, if pussy don't sell
Grits ain't gross and eggs ain't poultry
And Mona Lisa is a muthafuckin' manYou might also likeEmbed
