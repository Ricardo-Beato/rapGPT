It's been two years, I keep calling
I'm standing here and I ain't got you
As we lay here, lovers in arms
I can feel your fear, can this love be true?
Come on, lift me up, love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling
Lift me up, love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling

She said, "Baby, keep me closely", love it when you hold me"
Know that I'm a real one, I don't do no ghostin'
I know that you love me, you don't gotta show me
Off to the world, please, hide me from the police
Everywhere you go, we together, inseparable
You know I'm down for whatever, protective of you
I don't wanna use protection with you
But the glove'll keep you safe if you ever get loose
Never put you in a jam, hold whatever for you
When you first shot your shot, I knew you would be the one to hit the spot
Only you can make it clap for the homies, I am not
On the late nights, me and you, circling the block
Tryna make it pop
Put that pussy nigga 'cross the street from Cherry Park
Hope we don't get caught
Don't you break my heart
Love how you illuminate my thoughts
You might also like
It's been two years, I keep calling
I'm standing here and I ain't got you
As we lay here, lovers in arms
I can feel your fear, can this love be true?
Come on, lift me up, love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling
Lift me up, love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling

Damn, can't believe they took you from me
Kickin' in your front door, lookin' for me
Hid me in our secret place
Nothing I could do for you but sit and wait, contemplate
Did we leave a trail? Did we make mistakes?
Can't drop on your bail, can't check on your case
Know that you won't tell, that's why I'm afraid
You'll probably never get to see the light of day
I'm ashamed to say I think I hate you now
We should've took 'em on a chase 'cause I can't save you now
At least give me a chance to try to lay 'em down
Is you trippin'? You forgettin' that we made these vows?
Still here I am, waiting 'round
Dreaming that you comin' home, right your wrongs, take me out
I can't wait until you bust it down
Probably go a hunnid rounds
I keep calling
I keep calling (Oh, ooh)
I keep calling
I keep calling
I keep calling (Oh, ooh)
I keep calling
I keep calling
I keep calling (Oh, ooh)
I keep calling
I like him 'cause, you know, 'cause...
'Cause I know  when somebody go back for me
We'll be back together and we can have a little fun
But he's in jail right now
For something that he had no business in doin'
"What did he do?"
They said he killed somebody11Embed
