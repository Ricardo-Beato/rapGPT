8 ContributorsWarlord Lyrics
I was born with thunder up in my hands to silence all of the lambs
I've conquered so many lands, put up with whatever man
A sucker for God's plan, my journey eternal
Hell fire spreading wide, now you're in the inferno
Pray to God to intervene, you feel it, your inner being
The sinner sings a song, plays all day
Will it bring peace, to the hearts of men?
Spending life on the frontlines of life, to no end
Waste of time, wasting away
Wasting the day, tasting the bitterness of hate
Face of decay, lead 'em off into the dark
They follow me from the start
With the light chasin' the demons, runnin' from the spark
I'm the sword, guns clutch, swingin' at the unjust
Just one touch from the blade that cuts us
Leading the rat race where losers are born
When it's above you, whatever form, it goes on
The cycle, perpetual, death is eventual
If you ain't givin' no hundred percent, unacceptable

March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
You might also like
I was formed with fire upon the blade
The violence and the crusade
The engine is cultivated where the revel is made
Invading with the horde on a white horse, just a warlord
The country is war-torn and that's love, it's a universal way
The archangel gon' hang in the clouds and they watch us pray
For the glory of history, intimate story
Night of the Templar and the tempest warning
God's too delayed, we'll give the prayers to the fallen
Hymns are callin' if you willin', give yourself and we go all in
Ritual beginning, individual strike
A violent, quick, in descendence of height
Feel her soul elevate while enemies lie in wait
I'm sendin' 'em to the gate, kill them, we the hate
Be eaten at the rat race where losers are born, winners are loved
When it's performed, it goes on
The cycle, perpetual, death is eventual
You ain't givin' a hundred percent, unacceptable

March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the Devil
March on the DevilEmbed
