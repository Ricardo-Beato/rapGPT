12 ContributorsU.S.A. (Aiight Then) Lyrics
Eh yo this ones for all my M.O.B.B
And my out of state niggas reppin' NYC
To my dunns up in the clink stuck in the bing
For my dawgs on the corner that cook they own weight
For young lords livin' like old time kings
And old timers puttin' young bloods on them things
Just a little something for ya block to sing
Can you relate?
Do you feel me?
Aiight then

Mind like the Dutch, forward or backwards
Couldn't clear my style like Anita Baker "Rapture"
Fracture, cry now laugh later
We assist and compute data, On ya IBM
Dime bitches I be eyein' them
Shoot me down a hundred times
Still come up wit new lines
Rec execs dont like me
Come up with new rhymes
See you on the edge and give a push for all mankind

Eh yo this ones for all my M.O.B.B
And my out of state niggas reppin' NYC
To my dunns up in the clink stuck in the bing
For my dawgs on the corner that cook they own weight
For young lords livin' like old time kings
And old timers puttin' young bloods on them things
Just a little something for ya block to sing
Can you relate?
Do you feel me?
Aiight then
You might also like
Mike Tyson style, animal dunns, we live wild
Too many ways to die, we alive for now
We cross borders, take the guns along wit us
Defend infamous to the fullest
Protect my dunns that came with me, they move with me
Its risky for you to try to approach the god shifty
We all gorgeous, the most fly, the illest
Its amazing what my Benz do to ya bitches
While you bearin' witness, we handlin' ya chick bidness
Thug her out, dug her out, you know the dealings

Picture you dead and in the raw
Flippin' two not ready for what you and
Moms already missin' you
Old fool from the old school
You thirty-six, I been doin' this since niggas selling nics
Gettin' head from tricks
Takin' shorts for kicks
Niggas mad ain't tell them where the stash was at
If she a dime baby moms
Dunn be baggin' that
Smack 'em with the gat
(what) React that
Eh yo this ones for all my M.O.B.B
And my out of state niggas reppin' NYC
To my dunns up in the clink stuck in the bing
For my dawgs on the corner that cook they own weight
For young lords livin' like old time kings
And old timers puttin' young bloods on them things
Just a little something for ya block to sing
Can you relate?
Do you feel me?
Aiight then
And to my fifth ward clique (how you like this)
And to my dirty south thugs (how you like this)
And to my westside niggas (lets unite this)
And to my Chi-town gangstas keep thuggin' it

Connect the dots
Merge with many a block
My porto rock representitives blow plenty of shots
It's love sincerely
Deep in my heart
For those that relate to this here song

Lovin' the angel
Have you noddin' off like good dope
And if the nappy good, then bolt regardless
Finish it when you want to start shit
Turn the body into carcass
Handle mines regardless
Eh yo this ones for all my M.O.B.B
And my out of state niggas reppin' NYC
To my dunns up in the clink stuck in the bing
For my dawgs on the corner that cook they own weight
For young lords livin' like old time kings
And old timers puttin' young bloods on them things
Just a little something for ya block to sing
Can you relate?
Do you feel me?
Aiight then
And for my midwest terrorists rock this
For my New Orleans team they can't stop us
And to my Little Rock clique that's heartless
This for my Beantown dogs and the lifers
From Seattle to pink houses
The Unified States of America, let's get it right, shit1Embed
