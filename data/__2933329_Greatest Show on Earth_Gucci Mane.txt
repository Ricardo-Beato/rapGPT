18 ContributorsGreatest Show on Earth Lyrics
I get you fuckers knocked out for a quarter key
I told you motherfuckers not to fuck with me
Mike WiLL Made It

Gucci Mane, and I'm a one man band
Big papa, I got a brand new bag
Fresh out the feds, I got a brand new swag
I don't mean to brag, but let my mink coat drag
In Vegas they treat me like I'm Elvis Presley
She using her eyes to undress the sexy
Who wanna come down and be the next contestant?
The list get the chance to hang in Gucci's section
I walk in the spot like I own the venue
You might find your girlfriend on my private menu
But please don't leave 'cause I ain't tryin' to offend you
But don't blame me, she got her own agenda
Tie dye shirt on like we at Coachella
Let's make love and make these other hoes jealous
I might just jump in the crowd like I'm performing heavy metal
I'm one of a kind like this extraordinary bezel

Shout out every word in my verse
I need you to scream with me 'til it hurt
'Cause this is the greatest show on earth
You witnessed the greatest show on earth (Gucci!)
I need you to sing with me 'til it hurt
And shout out every word in my verse
'Cause this is the greatest show on earth
You witnessed the greatest show on earth, ha
You might also like
Verse number 2, so I'm jumping back in
Make her chew me up, like the Doublemint twins
Remember I was trappin' at the Bouldercrest Inn
Now I'm slidin' down the Crest in a drop top Benz
'Scuse me, I meant in a drop top R
Neighborhood celebrity, but worldwide star
In some lowtop Giuseppes, and I'm steppin' on the bar
Eight figure Gucci Mane, now that's a god damn bar
Choreographer, I don't need it
Who needs stylist when you this freezy?
Fuck a interview, I talk greasy
 a hired man, for what reason?
I'm a one man band, but give the drummer some
Mike WiLL, yeah, the Ear Drummers some
I'm a Black Beatle like Rae Srem' and them
And every weekend I have an M&M

Shout out every word in my verse
I need you to scream with me 'til it hurt
'Cause this is the greatest show on earth
You witnessed the greatest show on earth (Gucci!)
I need you to sing with me 'til it hurt
And shout out every word in my verse
'Cause this is the greatest show on earth
You witnessed the greatest show on earth, ha1Embed
