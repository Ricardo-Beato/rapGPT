11 ContributorsThat Night Lyrics
I got that cash it wasn't nothin'
I8 drive by, M6 speed by, race me why not?

I got that cash it wasn't nothin'
I8 drive by, M6 speed by, race me why not?
Lets bet 5 thousand, you got it, I got it
You can not beat me, yes you can die by it
I pulled out them fat knocks, like I hit the jackpot
Its raining them wet knocks, strip-club, that's right
After she give me top, give her wet wipes
I'm so damn high off life, I don't remember that night

I call you on damn Skype, make sure my check right
I'm in the lime light, you's in the dim lights
I'm too damn rich for lice, don't got no damn mice
You hatin' too damn goofy, don't got no damn life
My pool is 9 feet, I just hop in and swim right
I do's the stunting, I just hoped out that damn ride
I need a Moncler ring, you know that I'm gon' get it right?
Perfect day for flexin', walked outside and its feeling nice

I got that cash it wasn't nothin'
I8 drive by, M6 speed by, race me why not?
Lets bet 5 thousand, you got it, I got it
You can not beat me, yes you can die by it
I pulled out them fat knocks, like I hit the jackpot
Its raining them wet knocks, strip-club, that's right
After she give me top, give her wet wipes
I'm so damn high off life, I don't remember that night
You might also like
I make that crunk music Juelz and Killa Cam
I'm getting Ben's why you playing, bitches in Switzerland
Nigga get your bitch, shes a damn nigga digger man
I set her out by the fire, then I started getting head
She tape her mouth onto my dick, I'm a asshole, I'm the shit
Was just on the phone with slick, his lawyer need 36
Was on the phone with Stunna Ray, he told me flex on them bitches
When these bitches be wanna play, I'm gettin' the check on these bitches

I got that cash it wasn't nothin'
I8 drive by, M6 speed by, race me why not?
Lets bet 5 thousand, you got it, I got it
You can not beat me, yes you can die by it
I pulled out them fat knocks, like I hit the jackpot
Its raining them wet knocks, strip-club, that's right
After she give me top, give her wet wipes
I'm so damn high off life, I don't remember that nightEmbed
