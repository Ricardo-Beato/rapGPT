Yo, Ace you sound really pissed off
This music shit's got you stressed out, huh?

Yeah man, it's like every other day
It's a brand new set of bullshit you gotta' deal with
Gotta' deal with these fake ass people man, I don't know
But yo, before we talk about whatever you wanted to
Speak about, I'm gonna' run to the store
Get me a Sprite or something, I'm thirsty
Y'need anything?

Yeah uh, I need to do some laundry
Get me a thing of like, Tide or whatever they got on the shelf
I got no clean drawes left, I'm walking around
Like a fucking porno star 'a whole week
It's ridiculous

Yeah yeah, Fats that's way too much info, man
Is that all you need?

Yeah yeah, but hurry back 'cause
I really gotta' talk to you about this thingYou might also likeEmbed
