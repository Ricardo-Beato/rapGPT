21 Contributors36 Villainz Lyrics
You'd be very foolish to not to understand that because demons are real and people are influenced by bad spirits
Yeah, yeah
Carti, yeah

Southside nigga, black ninja (Yeah)
My niggas take time off yo' clock with the Glock
Purple killing that fool, I smoke dolo by two
Got me high to the roof, got your bitch getting loose
Carti that dude (Carti), it's blue in these jewels
Redman comes on, three Gs, one blunt, just me
Three cups, cups filled with pink, drink up (Uh, damn)
I'm 'bout them green, guys (Guys), so I'm serving pies (Pies)
I'm high, white lie, my eyes reveal the truth (Bitch)
This is what I do, bitch
This is what I do, bitch, nigga fuck you (Carti)
Fuck 'em all, get this cake, that's how I pissed them off (Carti)
I got work that's gon' be gone tomorrow (Yeah)
Ship it off state to state, nigga, don't hate (Yeah)
Cartier with your bitch on the interstate (State)
Foreign whip, she love this shit
She ridin' it, rollin' that glass
Roll that gas, bitch, I'm the man

All of these bitches (All of these bitches)
All of these bitches (All of these bitches)
I'm gon' fuck all of these bitches (All of these bitches)
I'm gon' fuck all of these bitches (All)
Yeah, I just gotta fuck right these bitches
All these bitches
I just gotta fuck all these bitches
I pull up right on these bitches
I just gotta fuck all these bitches
Fuck what you think, Carti
