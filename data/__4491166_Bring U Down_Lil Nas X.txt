I don't know what’s gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don’t know, but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down

I'm lookin' at you and I got a trick up my sleeve
And yes, I'm peepin' ya secret so you get ready to leave
The media’s callin’, oh, baby, that's TMZ
I’m tellin' your secrets, so best get ready to grieve

I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don’t know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down

I dug up your past and now I know all of your moves
And I got witnesses, statements, and I got all of the proof
I'm wonderin' 'bout you because I got nothin' to do
I noticed you're winnin' and I got nothin' to lose

I don't know what's gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know what's gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down

I don't know what's gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know, but I'm gonna bring you down (Down)
I don't know what's gonna bring you down

I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down10Embed
