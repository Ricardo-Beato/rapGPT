I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm really really hot
Hot, hot, hot-hot

Let me holla at the DJ
Come on, DJ, put that record on the replay
Don't you see how them bitches move they booty
Every time you play this record, smell they coochie, follow them
Screamin' like a groupie
Misdemeanor move my nookie like a hoochie
Fuck them haters, haters fuck whatever you say
Because you know I'm too cool for you anyway
I'm just a bad bitch
M-I-S miss
I'ma keep talkin' shit 'til you get this
I'ma bust up in the club with no guest list
Them other artists I'll keep em' all restless
I don't french kiss, unless it's 50 Cent
Vivica we can share him like the president
Tabloids I don't care it's irrelevant
I'm heaven sent now watch how I do this shit

I'm really, really hot
Every time my records drop
Radio says I won't stop
'Cause I'm killin' em
You might also like
You don't know what you talkin' 'bout
You would think I was Suge when I come out
My album hit hard when I roll out
Y'all records make a bitch wanna throw em out
And that's no doubt
See, I rock bells
Fly as hell and cool as Zinfandel, baby, can't you tell?
I lick my lips like I'm LL
And I'm doin it and doin it and doin it well
Straight to the hotel
I'm celibate, so boy, you gets no tail
Kiss kiss and still you gets nowhere
Just two blue balls down in your underwear, I play unfair
I'm a hot gal, fly cars and stars in strip bars it ain't hot if I'm not there
I'm a true playa, you can find me up in any record store, hurry up and get chea

I'm really, really hot
Every time my records drop
Radio says I won't stop
'Cause I'm killin' em

Look, let me move to the left
Go 'head, let me feel myself
Touch my chest, my sweat
Show the DJs how I shake my breasts
Jiggle, jiggle, jangle
Watch how my gluteus dangle
I do a one-two step
(Stop) No, I ain't done yet
Everybody in the club go to work
Tight jeans, crop shirts, short skirts
I'ma rock to the beat 'til it hurt
I'ma drop it on the street, yeah, you heard?
Haters, I flip the bird
Got guns, so what? I ain't scurred
I came to boogie and swerve
I ain't lyin', folk, that's my word
(Release yourself)
(Release yourself)
I'm really, really hot
Every time my records drop
Radio says I won't stop
'Cause I'm killin' em1Embed
