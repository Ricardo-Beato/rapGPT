18 ContributorsMy Everything Lyrics
True Religion my everything
(We made it ho, we made it ho)

True religion my everything
G4s my everything, G5s my everything, G6 my everything
Double Gs my everything, double Cs her everything
She bought me everything
Why leave she everything...To me!
Designer clothes is my everything (yeah, yeah)
Foreign cars my everything (yeah, yeah)
If you in this club show everything (show everything, yeah, yeah)
And if you're getting money throw everything

Now my big dog buy me everything
She say I'm her everything
Cash is my domain, too many big dogs like I have on every chain
She said I look very mean
I say I look very clean
Racks stacked in my kitchen I thought I was getting robbed by Yao Ming
I don't know what yall mean
I ball, I mean all the teams
Dirty sprite that's the purple lean
Smoke a lot of weed, no garden
Y'all shouldn't have started me (don't start me)
Now you cannot park me (can't park me)
Told your ho to arch her back and get on her knees, work hard for me
I love her, like what the fuck is you sayin' bro? (Fuck y'all fuckin' saying man?)
Y'all niggas better stop that playin' bro (Really stop playin' round here man)
True Religion my pants bro (True Religion, and what?)
Now my whole crew got them bands bro!

True religion my everything
G4s my everything, G5s my everything, G6 my everything
Double Gs my everything, double Cs her everything

Why leave she everything...To me!
Designer clothes is my everything (yeah, yeah)
Foreign cars my everything (yeah, yeah)
If you in this club show everything (show everything, yeah, yeah)
And if you're getting money throw everything

I Ralph Lauren every single t-shirt
I Burberry my boxer and hit the tone nigga on my feature
Anytime I'm in Miami I'm in Bell Harbor with a dumb chick
I done went designer crazy, Marc Jacob on my new spits
You could say I'm very popular, all my clothes popular
You ain't even in my view, even wearin' binoculars
I'm off that water water layin' up with some tilapia
She bad and she 'yella, and I'm very proud of her
Cause she got designer everything, in the club with everything
Her bag, her shoes, her fit, her shades I'm talkin bout everything
That lean, that kush, them bars, them bars I want some of everything
That Gucci, Louie, Fendi now it's pluto everything

True religion my everything
G4s my everything, G5s my everything, G6 my everything
Double Gs my everything, double Cs her everything
She bought me everything
Why leave she everything...To me!
Designer clothes is my everything (yeah, yeah)
Foreign cars my everything (yeah, yeah)
If you in this club show everything (show everything, yeah, yeah)
And if you're getting money throw everything
I got polo horses on my everyday
Actin bitch, lil scary thing
Blew up my room by whore old spot, dark candies pitchin' out everything
And she like baby you very mean
I reply that I'm very clean
Got shoes stacked up in my closet right now, walk in you think you in Lion King
I got bad asian hoes around me like I'm Bill Gates
I got points of that money in my pockets call me sweepstakes
I got long term bars and my (?) forever cake
I got thousand round drawls on for that K who wanna play?
Like what the fuck is you saying bro? (Fuck y'all fuckin' sayin' man?)
Y'all  niggas better stop that playin bro (Fuck nigga better stop that playin' man)
True Religion my pants bro (true religion my pants man)
Now my whole crew got them bands bro

True religion my everything
G4s my everything, G5s my everything, G6 my everything
Double Gs my everything, double Cs her everything
She bought me everything
Why leave she everything...To me!
Designer clothes is my everything (yeah, yeah)
Foreign cars my everything (yeah, yeah)
If you in this club show everything (show everything, yeah, yeah)
And if you're getting money throw everything2Embed
