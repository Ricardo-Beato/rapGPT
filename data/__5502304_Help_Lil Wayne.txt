Got it on Smash

Yeah, ayy, ayy
I've been fuckin' up, now what you think I need some help for?
Need to stop relyin' on you, do it for myself more
Layin' out a bunch of traps and you know that I fell for 'em
I won't fall again, shawty, I won't stall again
I been dropped, ayy, takin' phone call up in the Benz
I got weak, but, yeah, lil' bitch, I'm on it once again
Can you help me? Please don't stall a nigga in the end
'Cause when it comes down, you gon' need me once again

Ooh, girl, I love you so
I told myself not to love these hoes
Told myself not to love these bitches
Got my head in the clouds like the sky is the limit
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you ain't been thinkin' 'bout me
You only want every Abraham Lincoln on me
You got a nigga at home, he don't be thinkin' like me
That nigga think he like me, you need to check his ID

Yeah, ayy, ayy
I've been fuckin' up, now what you think I need some help for? (Yeah)
Need to stop relyin' on you, do it for myself more
Layin' out a bunch of traps and you know that I fell for 'em
I won't fall again, shawty, I won't stall again
I been dropped, ayy, takin' phone call up in the Benz
I got weak, but, yeah, lil' bitch, I'm on it once again
Can you help me? Please don't stall a nigga in the end
'Cause when it comes down, you gon' need me once again

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Real love, I'm tired of hearin' real love
Make my ear drums real numb, everything happens for a reason
Everything that didn't happen, didn't happen for a reason
Bitches yappin' for no reason, just so happens I'm the reason
Got me tryna find a reason to find a reason
Got me tryna reason with my demons
I ain't rappin', I'm releasin', real love, yeah

Ayy
I've been fuckin' up, now what you think I need some help for?
Need to stop relyin' on you, do it for myself more (Woo, real love)
Layin' out a bunch of traps and you know that I fell for 'em (Ayy)
I won't fall again, shawty, I won't stall again
I been dropped, ayy, takin' phone call up in the Benz
I got weak, but, yeah, lil' bitch, I'm on it once again
Can you help me? Please don't stall a nigga in the end (Yeah)
'Cause when it comes down, you gon' need me once again (Yeah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
And everything happens for a reason
Real love2Embed
