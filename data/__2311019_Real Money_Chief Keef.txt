8 ContributorsReal Money Lyrics
I'm talking real money, no counterfeit
You can tell I get money, baby look at my wrists
You can tell I get money, baby look at my crib
You can tell I get money, now she wanna live with me
I'm talking real money, real money real money, real money
Real money, real money real money, real money
Real money, real money real money, real money
Real money, real money real money, real money
Real money, real money real money, real money
Aye bitch I'm talking real money
Real money, real money
Bitch I'm talking real money

I pull up then slide out like touchdown
Nigga you can nuck if ya buck, gon buck, get yo dumb ass bucked down
It was me an Kenn Rob on the southside of Chicago looking for a damn buck down
I was pulling up with the players, out there looking, you know I got touchdowns
Make the bullets go left, right, in the middle of your eyesight I paint it like peter
You niggas my sons, I know shoulda stomped on ya'll fetus
Bitch I got stripes like a tiger, pulled up in the all white bitch I ain't a zebra
I knew she was gon' eat when she seen my car but she says shes ain't a eater
Baby if you ain't no a eater it then I can say I ain't a cheater
I'm smoking on reefa - high as fuck, and I can say I ain't a tweaker
I'm pulling up flexin' up, think that I'm lacking' cause pussy I got the fajita
I hit up yo neck, and yo arms, and yo chest, and then for the forensics I leave ya
