61 Contributors2 Cups Stuffed Lyrics
All my real niggas across the world
We broadcasting live from Atlanta G.A (Swamp Izzo)
1017 Thug
Hahaha, scream

Panoramic Porsche
Pull up on a bitch like "pass me the torch"
Let me fire this spliff up
I ain't from New York, but ayy, ayy, bruh
I don't need no pork, I just need to two cups stuffed
Lotta ice, I just need two cups stuffed
Gimme a cup twice, I just need two cups stuffed
Go light on the ice, I just need two cups stuffed
Gamble with ya life if I don't get two cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed

L-E-A-N-I-N-G
Lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean
Five-hundred horses inside my machine
Five-hundred DNAs in my ding ding
Come here bitch, what you chasin' cash?
Two guns up, Ferrari smash
Hundred pound green, herbie kerbie, trash
Smoke a whole ounce, leave ya bitch the ash
You might also like
Panoramic Porsche
Pull up on a bitch like "pass me the torch"
Let me fire this spliff up
I ain't from New York, but ayy, ayy, bruh
I don't need no pork, I just need to two cups stuffed
Lotta ice, I just need two cups stuffed
Gimme a cup twice, I just need two cups stuffed
Go light on the ice, I just need two cups stuffed
Gamble with ya life if I don't get two cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed

AR-15 inside my trench
Plus I blend in with the fuckin' trenches
Hundred crushed diamond for my fuckin' missus
Take the bitch shoppin' 'cause I fuckin' missed it
Ralph Lauren boxers every day and night
Bitch, I ain't Barry, but I play with white
Bitch, I ain't scary, I could never fright
Hundred black choppers like a fuckin' night

Panoramic Porsche
Pull up on a bitch like "pass me the torch"
Let me fire this spliff up
I ain't from New York, but ayy, ayy, bruh
I don't need no pork, I just need to two cups stuffed
Lotta ice, I just need two cups stuffed
Gimme a cup twice, I just need two cups stuffed
Go light on the ice, I just need two cups stuffed
Gamble with ya life if I don't get two cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed, uno dos cups stuffed
Uno dos cups stuffed
