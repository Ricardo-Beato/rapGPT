I'm so far gone
Can you take me back home?
I'm stuck in a zone
And I'm a million miles from—

Home is only an idea
I fear it's costumes that you wear
I see clear in the atmosphere
None of my peers were really there
Sunshine and moonlights make a tough time feel nice
Fun times, fun nights with all of y'all, it feels right
We outcasts, avoid hype
In the sunshine, we break ice
In the moonlight, escape life

In the sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
In thе sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshinе

Oh, oh-mm

I feel at home up until I'm alone, ha
I feel at home up until I'm alone
And you always feel loved until you are wrong
And I play this song to come down calm when you are wrong
You might also like
I never meant to make you feel 'lone
A non-chivalrous tone you've used since I got home
I feel wrong, deep down inside, I'm stoned
I feel cold and alone
But now I know that you love me (Love me)
Will you put anyone above me?
Let me know, is this home?

Oh, oh-mm

Ha-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha-ha
