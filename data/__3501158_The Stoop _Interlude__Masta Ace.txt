There he is, there he is
He's on the stoop, he's writing again
I'm gonna' start calling you Stoop Dogg

Yeah, whatever, what's up Fats, man?

Nothing man, I always see you on this stoop
With the pen, the paper, you're writin'
But no, it's a beautiful day outside ya'know
Don't you wanna' get out, hit the streets
Check some bitches, c'mon bro

Nah, I'm good man, I'm chilling man, I'm aight

(Laugh)
Yo, that your car?
What happened to your windshield?

I don't really wanna' talk about that man
You might also like
(Laugh)
You need to leave Reese's crazy ass alone
She's a fuckin' psycho
But, on a serious tip I need you to come to the crib later
'Cause I wanna' talk to you about something
I got a little idea that I'm gonna' wanna' run by you

Uh-oh, here we go

Nah nah seriously
What are you writing anyway?

Yeah I'm working on this song or whatever
You know, about the beautiful things I see

There ain't shit to see that's beautiful sitting over here
I'll tell you that

Yeah there is, yo
You've just gotta' look closerEmbed
