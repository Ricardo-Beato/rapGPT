28 ContributorsCee-Lo Lyrics
I’ll shoot a nigga and some ceelo
I’ll put your wifey in a trio
And I can't lie and stroke my ego
And they done got me back in beast mode
I got some shooters and they ain’t seen though
I’m out the country in Montego
And these bitches don’t speak no englo
All they wanna know is the lingo

In the matrix all like i’m neo
I make movies like Al Pacino
I can wrap a bale like burritos
I go hella hard for them c-notes
They ain’t never seen what we did, nigga
You can’t get fingerprints off these triggers
I’m a guapaholic, i’m money-drunk
Death-defying, i’m livin’ like avatar
I done went to another planet
See my pockets they on gigantic
I take off like a rocket in Paris
I fuck bitches that don’t mind sharin’

I’ll shoot a nigga and some ceelo
I’ll put your wifey in a trio
And I can't lie and stroke my ego
And they done got me back in beast mode
I got some shooters and they ain’t seen though
I’m out the country in Montego
And these bitches don’t speak no englo
All they wanna know is the lingo
You might also like
They say wale dope
They gon’ say what they say, never to my face, no
And i’m runnin’ out of space to put all of my favorite clothes
Took a nigga’s favorite shoes - took a nigga’s favorite store
I call the folk that made ‘em, foreign
These ladies trippin’ …
‘cause I buck a lot but I don’t be datin’ none of ‘em
And I roll with niggas, go-to niggas, know they ain’t as friendly
And all my pieces wide receivers they all eighty’ somethin’
Wale, though…
And I make your ladies do my say-so
I’m just a nigga on the grind tryna make moves
Shine like a g, though
Rhyme bully, my mob goodie, shout-out to ceelo

I’ll shoot a nigga and some ceelo
I’ll put your wifey in a trio
And I can't lie and stroke my ego
And they done got me back in beast mode
I got some shooters and they ain’t seen though
I’m out the country in Montego
And these bitches don’t speak no englo
All they wanna know is the lingo1Embed
