(Dean, what's poppin'? Hahahahaha. Yo, Travis)
Mhm, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Mama's mailin' out that blow, cravin' 9021—
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

She a porn star girl, ah, from the valley
(Honestly, God bless)
Who left her hometown world all for that alley
Ooh, created Lake Tahoe all from her panties
(I hope it was wet like my jumper, though)
Ooh, used to take the long way home
Long way home, all for that candy (Hahahahaha, mhm)

Baby's hooked on feeling low-ow
Do, do, do
Do, do

Jacques turned La Flame, now he rollin' on an Addy
Fifty on a chain, 'nother fifty on a Caddy
Ooh, he might pop him a pill, pop him a seal
Pop anyone, pop anything
Pop anything to find that alley
Mhm, yeah, to find that alley (Mhm)
You might also like
Baby's hooked on feeling low-ow
Do, do, do
Do, do

In the 90210, 90210, lookin' for that alley
In the 90210, 90210, lookin' for that alley, ooh
It's the superstar girl, superstar girl, roamin' in that alley
(Baby's hooked on feeling low-ow)
Ooh, in the 90210, 90210, somewhere in that alley
(Do, do, do)
(Do, do)
Ooh, ahh
(I gotta tell ya)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(All, all, all thang, thang)
(All, all, all thang, thang)
Yeah
My granny called, she said, "Travvy, you work too hard
I'm worried you forget about me"
(All, all, all)
I'm fallin' in and out of clouds
Don't worry, I'ma get it, Granny, uh
What happened? Now my daddy happy
Mama called me up, that money comin' and she love me
(All, all, all thang, thang)
I done made it now, I done found life's meanin' now
(All, all, all thang, thang)
All them days her heart'd break, her heart not in pieces now
Friends turnin' into fraud niggas
Practicin' half the passion, you niggas packaged different
(All, all, all thang, thang)
All you niggas, you niggas want the swag, you can't have it
(All, all, all thang, thang)
I'ma sell it, your niggas salary, we 'bout to cap, bitch
Youngest nigga out of Houston at the Grammys
Smilin' at 'em laughin' at me
I passed the rock to Ye, he pump faked, then passed it back, bitch
(All, all, all thang, thang)
All of this off of rappin', should've wrote this in Latin, yeah-yeah
(All, all, all thang, thang)
Mmm, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Cuzzo said we hit the store, yeah, we 'bout to drop a four
He passed the cigarette, I choke, woo
Told my auntie, "Put them 'Ports down, them 'Ports down"
Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin', nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Whole crew, I swear they countin' on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm stylin' on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm drivin' too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them
Just this guy from north of the border, my chips is in order
My mom's biggest supporter, so now a nigga support a nigga
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
