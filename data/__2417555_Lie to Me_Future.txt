38 ContributorsLie to Me Lyrics
I see you Spin, this right here the truth
Gang, gang
Future Hendrix, just like that
Cut it up

I'm a motherfuckin' boss (I'm a motherfuckin' boss)
I'm a motherfuckin' boss, I'm a motherfuckin' boss
I'm a motherfuckin' giant
I see how you watchin', I see how you lookin'
I see how you smile
I sit back and watch how the drama unfold while I'm on recline
I know the homies, my brothers, my cousins
They gon' ride for me
I know Tiarra, and Britney, and Keisha
They gon' lie for me
I got some people they know that I love 'em
But I ain't got time to see
I see in people the moves that I'm makin'
You know I'm playin' for keeps
You niggas ain't seein' me, never, you're never gon' see me

I got big racks, all in your face and you 'bout to get silent
Big 'Bach, fuck that little bitty car that you're drivin' (skrrt, skrrrt)
Big racks, anything I'm whippin' barely got mileage
Big racks, and you know that bitch that you're with, she mine
Yeah she my bitch, nigga
She wanna hit on me under the covers like lovers
Like we divine
She recognize that I'm so thorough
I'm one of them breeds, I'm all on her mind
She wanna look me eye to eye and tell me her lies
I had accepted you
Just like you came and never look down on you
Tell that lil' nigga to stay in his place before I expose you
You take one shot at me, you know that'll cause an explosion
Never fight the hand that feeds you, nigga
You gon' pay a nigga, yeah, to squeeze the trigger
You an itchy finger blog type of nigga
And you know me, nigga

I'm a motherfuckin' boss (I'm a motherfuckin' boss)
I'm a motherfuckin' boss, I'm a motherfuckin' boss
I'm a motherfuckin' giant
I see how you watchin', I see how you lookin'
I see how you smile
I sit back and watch how the drama unfold while I'm on recline
I know the homies, my brothers, my cousins
They gon' ride for me
I know Tiarra, and Britney, and Keisha
They gon' lie for me
I got some people they know that I love 'em
But I ain't got time to see
I see in people the moves that I'm makin'
You know I'm playin' for keeps
You niggas ain't seein' me, never, you're never gon' see me

I got way way too many issues
Some are coming out on the internet
Baby girl sayin' that she miss you
Is it too late for a comeback
I had to live with this crown on my head
I don't got no regrets, I don't have no regrets
I got to live with this crown on my head
I got to talk to my homies up stairs
Sorry to tell you I gotta address it
Feeling this game and I'm learning my lesson
Accepting the hate when it's coming
I jumped out the Wraith on them bums
I tell you you're wrong when you're right
I'm never gon' judge, no I'm never gon' judge
You got a nigga, but I know you love me, baby
I know you love me
I'm a motherfuckin' boss (I'm a motherfuckin' boss)
I'm a motherfuckin' boss, I'm a motherfuckin' boss
I'm a motherfuckin' giant
I see how you watchin', I see how you lookin'
I see how you smile
I sit back and watch how the drama unfold while I'm on recline
I know the homies, my brothers, my cousins
They gon' ride for me
I know Tiarra, and Britney, and Keisha
They gon' lie for me
I got some people they know that I love 'em
But I ain't got time to see
I see in people the moves that I'm makin'
You know I'm playin' for keeps
You niggas ain't seein' me, never, you're never gon' see me
I'm a motherfuckin' boss (I'm a motherfuckin' boss)
I'm a motherfuckin' boss, I'm a motherfuckin' boss
I'm a motherfuckin' giant
I see how you watchin', I see how you lookin'
I see how you smile
I sit back and watch how the drama unfold while I'm on recline
I know the homies, my brothers, my cousins
