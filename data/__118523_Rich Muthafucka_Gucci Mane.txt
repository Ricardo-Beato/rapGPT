19 ContributorsRich Muthafucka Lyrics

Bitches say my diamonds be retarded
My little boy worth a mil in kindergarten
You in the VIP but ain't important
You say you want a bottle but can’t afford it
Growing up I ain’t have a lot of choices
My mama dropped me off on Moreland
She a vulture, it was better man, it was torture
If you married to a broke bitch my nigga divorce her
You don’t want these five hunnids
Then it ain’t and I can tell ya
If yo baby daddy broke then your child is a failure
Flash back to 99 now I got some shit to sell ya
Fast foward to 2009, Guwap got something to mail ya
I’m smoking gangsta kush, I’m on the toilet
They pulled us over but your girlfriend took the charges
Your boyfriend broke, can’t even buy a pair of Jordans
I’m ballin so hard I might buy a pair of Porsches

I’m a rich muthafucka
And she a thick muthafucka
Zone 6, muthafucka
And we some rich muthafuckas
You might also like
Man I laughing to the bank again
Smoking dank no limit, it’s the tank again
Ice cream, Gucci Mane with the diamond grin
And if you really love me baby let me fuck your friend
I’m so turnt up that she tuned in
My penthouse so big she wanna move in
And my rims so big man it can’t fit
15 chains on, call me Slick Rick
Thick bitch, hill squarin' like a red nose
And these Forgis got me squattin' like a blue pitt
I got my main ho buyin more extendos
And shitin' on all my old foes, was my old goal
.44 bull frog, you a tadpole
