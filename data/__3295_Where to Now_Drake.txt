21 ContributorsWhere to Now Lyrics
Okay...
There comes a time...
When you gotta be like
You know, I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now, you know?
But I just—I just tell myself this one thing

It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time, I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit, but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My sixteens should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah, Heartbreak Drake, I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse, then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight
Go—Go—Go—Goddamn, how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over, watch a season of Flight of the Conchords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But ugh, tell me you surfing, let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes, I swear to God, girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Fords
Ethiopian girl, Ethiopian girl
With your long, curly hair and yo' big ass boo-tay
Reading all them pro-Black, pro-female books
Just let 'em, let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription, a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And man, if '09 is when I'ma see mine
Being cool ain't enough, homie; I'ma freeze time, like that!You might also like7Embed
