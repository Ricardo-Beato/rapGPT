75 Contributors4N Lyrics



And I began to riot

Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Bend we don't break, swing we don't miss
We just might be okay, the same voltage
Hold the charge like the phone lit
No regards for the bullshit
Who all in?
Who got the cards flipped?
Who on shit?
Who get the target split?
Who on your marksman's bad side?
Going at landmines, don't count steps
The old chest said "it's about time"
Slow breath, cold flesh made her mouth cry
We know death, alright let's go left
Hand signs, still with the bands like lead singers
Niggas remember them camp fires
I dip when they capsize
And swift hit the roads kickin' cans like chivalry dead
You really dead, but we still ahead
Couple clips left, couple lips cleft
Hammer and nail, Hommy and Earl
Spotting, got 'em from the top of the hill
Wrote it on the foggiest mirror
The quality thorough, ill
It's all I could spill
There's more I could do
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
