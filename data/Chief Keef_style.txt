Rolling with my gunners, my gunners, they'll gun ya

And they scream, "That's my shit," every time they cut me on it
Came in the trap, on the floor goes the money
Ho bust a loud pack and I put a lighter on it
How my doors flap, I be thinking I'm a hornet
Where he at? I'm gon' have to kill my opponent

You got a very freaky mama, we can do a slumber
She asked for my number, gave her the jack, lumber
Rolling in the uh-huh, they like, "There go Obama"
Rolling of that uh-uh, bitch, I can't even mumble

Go and fall, bitch, I won't be there to catch you
Go and sneeze, bitch, ain't gon' be there to bless you
Twenty grand my i8 can beat your Tesla

I saw that motherfucker and I'm like, "I gotta get 'em"

She's a very bad bitch, I saw her on the corner
That ain't my bitch, I just wanna fuck her mama
Xbox shit, I'm the only one
And they scream, "That's my shit," every time they cut me on it
Came in the trap, on the floor goes the money
Ho bust a loud pack and I put a lighter on it
How my doors flap, I be thinking I'm a hornet
Where he at? I'm gon' have to kill my opponent
Kill my opponent, kill my opponent
Where he at? I'm gon' have to kill my opponent
Kill my opponent, kill my opponent

Dropped out of school, I was livin' with my grandma, she didn't never wanna let me get nothin'
And then what? I had every fuckin' robber at grandma's
I got a phone call, then who pulled up on me? Mike Epps
Then my grandma took the motherfucking glass off Mike Epps
She met a lot of stars, seen me drivin' a lot of them cars
Then I asked her, did she want one? She said, "Oh, hell no"

Girl, all I eat is food, all I eat is shoes
All I eat is clothes, why I won't eat you
Baby, all I eat is money, don't like seafood
Eat the rims up on my truck, skrrt skrrt skrrt, doo doo doo
Shawty said she wanna fuck, I'm like, "Cool, that sound cool"
And you know I rollled up smoking on that superglue
Death Row just like Suge, got my dough and got my food
Throw your ass in the pool, have them bullets wet you upEmbed

You can have a .30 on you, we takin' niggas guns
When I was up in school, I was takin' niggas lunch
And this ice on me dedicated to a gun
They say I do the most
I be like on folks
Now let's have a fuckin' toast
'Cause I made it through the smoke

Look how my ice hittin' off of my wife beater
Hop out on you stuntin' in a white creature
Sixteen ounces in the two liter
M16 in the two seater
In Barney's gettin' designer by the boat load
Don't stress over me baby girl, smoke dope
And the only thing I'm dodgin' is popo's
And I'm in love with the dope smokes3Embed
Fuck what they say, you can rule the world
I'm blingin' thanks to my jeweler, girl
I ain't worried about you, girl
I ain't chasin' no stupid girls
I know I can hit it any day I want
Fuck your friends, baby, just say I won't
I'm sittin' here at Cryo, therapy for my muscles
You got cash for me? Put it in my duffle
I like to get it, count it, in a money machine
I cannot trust you, that's my honesty
How many times you said you're down with me?
All of these times you thought you were on to me
I don't love you, I know baby, I'm so wrong
You called me, like Monica, I'm so gone
You leavin' voicemails like, "Nigga please, answer your phone"
Slammin' my doors sayin' I ain't goin' home
Scratchin' my cars with keys
Hitting my Balmain's with bleach
Broke the glass all in my seat
I'm leavin' girl, you awful to me
Don't want me to see my shawty
That's that shit my mama taught me
For all the shit my mama bought me
I owe her a million times for all itYou might also like1Embed

You would think it's homicide how I hit her with the steel
All this energy it took, I should hit her with a bill

I fill a cup up and I sip it too fast

Fill a cup up, fuck a slut bitch, Semi too big, I can't tuck it
Niggas rowdy, they with that ruckus, I'm in a kush coma, concussion
I'm in Barney’s buying trousers, in New York smokin' sours
So much chicken, I need flavour, at the spot out in Braurer
I need space because I'm outer, that shit good but this is louder
I just exit off a garage, foreign got that money power
Get it hoe? I'm money shower
That bitch know that world is ours
I don't care to race man, bring the prowers
Valentino kicks and Gucci trousers
I'ma need 'bout two-three hours, before I come get the backend
Hit the stain and do the magic, Hermes belt but I'm still saggin'

I'm in that robot and this bitch don't stop
And I got on tank-top with a knot
Prolly finna pick up your thot
Bitch I'm gang til' I rot, totin' Glock like a fox, nigga
Me and foe'nem be gettin' on the grass
Back-to-back doing dash in the traffic
Grandma told me that I'm livin' too fast

I'm smoking cheese, I'm rocking bling
There ain't shit, that what it be

Open up the pack, and let it reek
This is checkered field T, it's not Burberry
We ain't scared of po-po, word to Tyler Perry
We in dem foreigns back to back, now we on a journey
After my Miranda rights, I need my attorney
Wifebeater like it's hot, but it's really really not
All this well earned ice, that I really really rock
All these damn designer clothes that I really really cop
Niggas pray really really that I really really flop
Gas in the car, I don't ever let it up
Got a foreign out the cut, it was time to rev it up
All green Valentino looking like some 7-Up
I wipe my ass with a hundred, fuck around and tear it up (catch up)
Get that backwards redrum
You wanna smoke, here we come
Loaded with them drums
They go brr-rum-dum-bum-bum
Got the big rubber bands
Feeling like the man
Your bitch can get ran
In the club with some bands

Just to get the fucking loot, bitch ain't in my room
All this water, I need a swimming suit, counting up revenue
I just met this bitch but I put fuck her in my schedule
Bitches on my testicles, cruisin down Melrose
Fly by and choo-choo like I'm on a railroad
Baby got an ass on her, damn she shaped like J-Lo
And she got that good grizzle, you a lucky fellow
Yeah, I had to pipe her, cash excite her
Cash get a bitch wet, put her in a dryer
I don't even want her, put her in a fire
She said she dig my jeans, she say she dig my fibre
Run 'em niggas over, put 'em in a tire
Dope got my stove stuffed you can call me Skylar

Made my lungs black, oh well
You better stand where you at
Don’t try me, pussy, don’t go there
You better watch your hoe
Cause’ she give me top so well
All the Keke’s call my phone
They hit me like I got a dope sale
I’m ringin’ like I got a doorbell
All my fiends and they say give 'em more hell
Hop out the whip, it feel like the floor fell
He squeeze, he can't breathe, give him more air
I'ma wait outside his house and build a fort there
Midnight, ring his bell, give him more mail
Gotta lot of beef, taco meat, more shells

Consider that my bitch if I fuck with her for three-plus
Say she wanna kick it with me, I'm just like FIFA
Told her, "Stay away from my ice," it might freeze her
Told her, "Stick around," never know, I might need her
Think I beat my wife 'cause I wear a wife beater

I’m on that kush with them beans, countin' all this green
All us get money, bitch, 'cause we the money team
We got 40s on our waist, 30s in them things
I’ma let this hammer blow, bitch, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I got all the shells on me, bitch, I'm never lonely
I got all this money on me, bitch, I'm never hungry
I got all these diamonds on me, your bitch waitin' on me
Say you wanna get like me, keep grinding, homie

I’ma go to the mall, I’ma buy that bitch
I’ma hop in my 'Rari and I’ma ride that bitch
See my truck sittin' on 4's, can’t ride on no lows
And bitch my pockets on swoll, blow hundreds on my nose
I put Fendi on my belt, Robin all in my jeans
I don't wanna go to sleep, so bitch, I don't do that lean
Big knots in my pocket, I don’t carry no wallet
Sneak dissin' us, stop it, and go get you some money
I love bankrolls, I don't love these hoes
Never snitchin' on bros, keep my mouth closed
High off that Earth, I don’t smoke that purp
I don’t smoke that mid and I don’t smoke that dirt
