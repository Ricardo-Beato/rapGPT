28 ContributorsDonâ€™t Ever Fucking Question That Lyrics
Enough to hold you to the brightest of lights
To place you dangerously close to that sun
Enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore
And recognize the cause of what's done is done
More than enough to put my name behind my ideals
And neglect my logic twice daily
Enough to keep me looking for my Lucy in the sky with gems
When I remember how you used to call me baby
Enough to look in my mirror with detest
For every tear you shed regardless of why you wept
Enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth
Of the ocean I swam till I ran out of breath

I love you, don't ever fucking question that
That's why we'll probably never get along
If I was better at finding the right words to say
I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs
I love you, I love you (faded)
Never, don't ever fucking question that
Don't ever fucking question that

Riding the public transit, I study the blank stares
To answer my questions of how and why I got so many grey hairs
I take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord
And I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord
Single file lines, to give her a pound one at a time
But when I faced her, I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine
I awokened from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me
To submission and I still walk with my religion
I watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror
Worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer
I hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin
Gassing me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within
For every eclipse that stares at me
From the other side of a paper cup of espresso
I light a match beneath a kettle
And for every set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program
To seek success, I bleed my ethics out a slow drip
I know a man who met a woman, don't remember where
Big beautiful eyes and light brown hair
She was from the 'burbs, he was from the south side of the city
This was back when Franklin Avenue was still pretty
Two different worlds apart, but the world is just a small town
We all know how people like to get down
Here we go, Aquarius, Pisces
Feel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul
Push shoved to came, without the glove, numbed the pain
The magic from up above what it does for the brain

The player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean
Make the love, paint the picture, write the song
The player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean
Make the love, paint the picture, and write that song
Till the break of dawn

I love you, don't ever fucking question that
That's why we'll probably never get along
If I was better at finding the right words to say
I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs8Embed
