10 ContributorsHitler Day Lyrics
"Five hundred years ago one man claimed to have discovered a new world. Five centuries later, we the people are forced to celebrate a Black Holocaust."
"How can you call a takeover a discovery?"

Mass murderer, this side of the planet
Most people take it for granted, five hundred and two, and still doin'
Give a reason I'm hatin', October celebratin'
The dead of the black the brown and red
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Don't jump to conclusions before I clear the confusion
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'm talkin bout' Columbus, hit me off

"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler Day
"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler day (crazy)
"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler Day
"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler Day (crazy)

Hangin' heads and snappin' necks
Splittin' up kin, makin' families wrecked
Turned this planet to a sewer
Provin' to all just a lil' grab, will do ya'
Or do us, so my disgust
Got credit from the ones that read it
Ain't blind to the fact of a wack headline
And if you didn't, pay the paper no mind
You might also like
That's how I feel
(That's how you feel?)
That's how I feel
(That's how you feel?)
That's how I feel
(That's how you feel?)
That's how I feel
Yo, shit is mad real

"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler Day
"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler Day (crazy)

My, my, my, my
Celebrate my
Good old days go by

Some thanks for the givin' when times are hard
And some got the nerve to pray to God
It ain’t about that turkey that get me sick
It’s that take from the Indian trick
Lookin' pretty grim when they takin' the pill
From the slavin' sucker seekin' somethin' to kill
Now he got a day to celebrate, ain't that a trip
Cause the Indians ain't got shit
Let em know, let em know (Tell 'em 'bout it, now)
("I don't hate nobody")
Let em know, let em know
("I don't hate nobody")
Let em know, let em know (Tell 'em 'bout it, now)
("I don't hate nobody")
Let em know

May 31st when it comin' it hurts
Remember the dead and it makes me curse
When they don't include 100 million of us black folks
That died in the bottom of boats
I can carry on 'bout the killin' till dusk and dawn
But war ain't the reason they gone

Fourth of July, a goddamn lie
When did we ever get a piece of the pie?
I gotta whole day comin' without no pay
Cause a job can't gimme no play
Even had enough I huff and puff
At brothers sellin' the stuff
I'm takin' in Washington's, Lincolns, and not their birthdays
Payback for 'em makin' us slaves
And that is real
(That's how you feel)
And that is real
(That's how you feel)
And that is real
(That's how you feel)
And that is real
Shit is mad real

"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler Day
"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler Day (crazy)
"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler Day
"I don't hate nobody"
But this day's as crazy as Hitler Day (crazy)

"I don't hate nobody"
"I don't hate nobody"
"I don't hate nobody"
"I don't hate nobody"
"We don't hate nobody because of their color—we hate oppression"Embed
