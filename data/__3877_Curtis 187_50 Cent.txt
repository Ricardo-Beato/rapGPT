18 ContributorsCurtis 187 Lyrics

Ay, nigga tell 'em where you from
Southside, I'm a Southside nigga what?
Nigga stunt, you know I tear a nigga up

They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtball nigga
Saying I can't wait 'til I get a little bigger
After niggas jumped me bumping my head
Thinking I wish I had a gun, I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife to finna poke me a nigga
Wishing I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the Caddy
Now those were the days, when crime really paid
The nine milli sprayed, I got the fuck out the way
From shootout to shootout, the bricks went fast
Robberies went bad, niggas got blast
Niggas kidnapped Drew grandpa kid
Came through and shot Ms. Leak in the head
You wonder why I got a gun?
So I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time
You might also like
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

It was Kangols, Cazelli shades, Pumas and corn braids
Doo-rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades
Ski mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed
Hoodrats to get laid, money to get made
Yeah, yeah I had a dream
I was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand
Saying ''damn, dope cost sixty a gram'
I got to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say "give it up kid, before I put one in your wig"
Picture me thirsty, riding 'round foaming out the mouth
Saying "I don't get on, I'mma lay a nigga out"
Now diamonds are beautiful and pearls are precious
I hit you and your bitch both over your necklace
I'm wreckless, I spray the semi drunk off Henny
Wipe your blood off the shines, run and sell 'em to Benny
Fuck with me, y'all niggas know Boo Boo get busy
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

Yeah, I gave Just a buck-fifty, ask him if I cut niggas
Shootouts in Bedford, ask them if I bucked niggas
In four-fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby
Hennessy and cocaine helped to grime me and make me
My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child
Got my ass whooped in Spofford, but never that now
When my name in your mouth
You better watch how you talk
I'll send yo' punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk
I bust a clip, I'll hit ya hip, I'm takin your shit
That's how the eses play, for that SSK
You probably heard through the grapevine
I'm good out in Watts
Bulletproof shit, cruising through them Compton blocks
I'm the beast from the East, but I play on the West
In the drop by myself with my nine and my vest
And you niggas best be on yo' best behavior
I was bred for this shit
Front on me I'mma blaze ya
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about8Embed
