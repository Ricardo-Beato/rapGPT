Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
When I slide in her like butter she come like a Hellcat
Will, A, Fool
Every time she step out the house she bring a check back
Wi-Wi-Wi-William!

Show my chain some love (yeah)
Come show my chain some love, uh
Come give my rings a hug (come give my rings a hug)
Come give my rings a hug, yuh

Come show my rings some love, come kiss my chains
When you start comin' on me, just say my name
Come with me to paradise, takin' all my jewels
Ten chains on my neck, feel bullet proof
Don't let them broke bitches get you, don't let them do it
I was in the ghost like Casper then hopped in the Porsche
16 passenger jet, it hold me and my comrades
We got tigers for pets, got a Bugatti in my bookbag
Show my watch love then you gotta show my wrist love too
I took a piss in the coupe, I didn't deny it
I got the cash on me and I can't hide it
After you ride it
You might also like
Show my chain some love (yeah)
Come show my chain some love, uh
Come give my rings a hug (come give my rings a hug)
Come give my rings a hug, yuh

Your smell it's dangerous
If I fuck on a thot she gotta be Blue Flamin' up
I'm in a executive board with the redskin
Blood out and blood in, yeah we bangers
So much money on me right now I can buy you the world
I got two model bitches I make 'em merge
I told her everything in, what's the word
Come by darling, just to make 'em swerve
These diamond clean, no rough
If it's CÃ©line, ain't worth
I call her back, surprise
We ain't tired of fuckin' in, hope ya hug on me

Show my chain some love (yeah)
Come show my chain some love, uh
Come give my rings a hug (come give my rings a hug)
Come give my rings a hug, yuhEmbed
