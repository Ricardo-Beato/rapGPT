8 ContributorsDangerous Mouths Lyrics

Uhh (*inhales*, ahhh, yeah)
3000, baby (Never how to douche)
Raunchy, uh-huh (Another touchy on the mushy)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (Check it out, motherfuck)
Ooh (You ain't know), raunchy
Raunchy, yeah (Check it out, motherfucker, do it!)
Raunchy, uh-huh, raunchy (, part two)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Haha!)

Good riddance to niggas and bitches bullshittin'
I house MCs like baths and full kitchens (Uhh)
Ready or not, doc, hood lynchin'
Icy flows I write with wool mittens
It's two, not one (Heh), Missy-dot-dot-com
Come once in the blue like free hot (Uh) lunch
So once it's on, turn it up!
Chickens flockin' in, shocked at birds are us (Uh)
Murderous (Ha), don't blame me, blame the music
I write with napalms in my hand, flame the fuses
Like, "ca-pssss," off you go
I'm nice battin', I practice when the park is closed
I'm that man who squats out of Jeeps and vans
Jump from roof to roof on the TV cam (Hahah)
Fuck a model, I go out with the cheapest tramps (Hahah)
Pussy have me trippin' like Kima, Keisha, Pam (Aha!)
I remain cool like (Eheh) open house on a school night
Animal House gettin' thrown out for food fights (Uhh, hehe)
PPP strictly don't give a fuck (Uh-huh)
And Brick City niggas strictly don't give a fuck
You might also like
Let me intervene, come between like dick through your jeans
Hang down to your knees, it's "mwaa" the Don-Wan
Carry on, D-A-N to the danger
Y'all MCs in a whole lot of danger
Change up all your rhymes, you need beats (Uhh)
My beats you see, completely unique, forgive thee
See it's the shots of Henessey that's in me
Reggie Noble, come through after me (Uh-huh)

Shit takes two to tango and two to fuck (Uh)
I done fucked in Range Roves to Isuzu trucks (Hehehe)
Used to move weight, now you makin' moves to duck (Uh)
Built solid without bolts, screws and nuts
Pussy tight, Jiffy Lube it up
Doc came up, hoes use to hang up, now my arm close hang 'em (Uhh)
My crew deeper than Karl Kani pockets
We don't buy bullets, we ask "What size rockets?" (Ooh)
For the occasion, one shot'll have you ravin'
Like Symon√© when the .44 is blown
Two minutes later I'll make it hotter
Snap you from the vine to my medulla oblongata
So what you wanna do, what you wanna do?
Yo, I got the chickens, the brew takin' X and  mushrooms (Uhh)
Def Squad in the house, bitch, drop your drawers
Tell your boyfriend to ease up and park the cars
I'm from the south, better watch your mouth (Uh-huh)
Fist the M-I the S-I, if you try then you die
I don't take no mercy on you suckers, so (Uhh)
Would you still be in love, baby, if I cut your throat?
Cut the jokes, I ain't got no love for yo' (Uh-huh)
No friends with those who imitate me, ya bold
My style I own, I'ma have to steal your flow
You know me, Joe, I ain't got to say no more, bitch!

That's right, nigga, eheheh
It's Misdemeanor here
Redman
Timbaland, uh, mutherfucker
Huh, three-triple-zero

The Matrix, baby
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I'm out2Embed
