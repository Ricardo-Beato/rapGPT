No, you can't be on my mama album

Pops home, I ain't gettin' frisked
I put your security at risk
Pops home, I ain't gettin' frisked
I put your security at risk
I put the security at risk
Okay, we gon' make this an event?
Y'all gon' need security for this

Hmm, yeah, uh
I ain't getting frisked, I put your security at risk
I walk in the crib, no gettin' frisked
Butt-naked in the kitchen cooking grits
Tell yo' mama, "Come give me a kiss"
Security gon' need security for this

I ain't gettin' frisked
I put your security at risk
I ain't gettin' frisked
Don't put the security at risk

Never take thе family picture off the fridge
Nеver stand between a man and his kids
Y'all ain't got enough security for this
Y'all ain't got enough security for this
I put your security at risk
I make your security quit
Like, "We don't get paid enough for this"21Embed
