Who ride? (We ride!)
Who ride? (We ride!)

On three "We ride"
One two three - WE RIDE!
One two three - WE RIDE!
One two three - WE RIDE!
 Mr. Porter! {*echoes*}

Beat up on yo' pads
C'mon little homie go on and beat up on yo' pads
Yeah, beat up on yo' pads
Ha ha (Steelers Steelers)
Yeah, beat up on yo' pads
C'mon little homie go on and beat up on yo' pads
You love football? Well beat up on yo' pads
If you down with Snoop Dogg go on and beat up on yo' pads
All my little homies beat up on yo' pads
C'mon little homie go on and beat up on yo' pads
If you're runnin the ball then speed up on 'em fast
Ain't no need to play with 'em, go on beat up on yo' pads
They bang every Saturday and Sunday loc
SYFL, man it ain't no joke
Helmets and shoulder pads, ain't no bulletproof vests
See ain't too many options on the wild wild West
See I've been blessed, so I guess that I can give back
Football in the hood dog, you dig that
I brought the demos back and that's just one
I'm in Pomona with the Steelers, come and get some
Want some'n bad enough take it
Them runningbacks dippin, cuttin and shakin, you ain't gettin none
Inside-out, hit the eight gap
I love it when they say that - who's house?!
C house, G house, P house, D house
Well, we house wherever we go, blowin 'em out
Lettin 'em know, never know that you could shine
It's all for the kids and plus they havin a good time
And as long as I live
I'mma stay doin positive and helpin the kids
So when you see me on the football field
"I need to holla at you Doggy Dogg!" Homie chill (chill nigga!)
