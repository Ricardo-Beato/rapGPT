12 ContributorsFoolinâ€™ Around Lyrics
Ayo, Jerm
Banger, aha

Rise and grind, tryna get this money right (What?)
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around (Yessir)
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around (Aight, check it, look)

I'm just foolin' around, comin' new with the sound (Uh-huh)
I give you music that pounds, start movin' the ground
I'm a wildfire, y'all just burnin' slow
Got that Midas touch with it, how it turn to gold (Aha)
You gotta earn your own chips, never lose focus
Bang it 'til your ears goin' deaf like Moses (Like Moses)
I'm on vibrate, buzzin' all crazy
Haters gettin' mad 'cause I'm fuckin' all they ladies (Aha)
I stay skeed, smoke until I can't see (Can't see)
Takin' pictures with a hater like, "Say cheese"
Yeah, I'm kinda young, weavin' where the vinyl's spun
But no practice here, so call me Iverson
But I'ma be ready when the finals come
Said I'ma be ready when my time'll come (Okay)
Gimme brain, get inside they mind
Go to sleep, wake up, now it's rise and grind (Oh, oh)
Ayo Jerm, tryna tell 'em, man (Go 'head)
Let's get it (What?)
You might also like
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around (Aight, look, haha)

Look when I come around and spit that flow (Uh-huh)
Three in a row, no Tic-tac-toe
Hit that Dro, get so blowed
Hold up, let's spit that slow, ooh, I'm high ()
Y'all hatin', you gon' stop, I'm comin' to your block
Still hear my music knock (Aha)
Gon' take this to the top, I want the top spot (What?)
Spittin' them pop rocks (Uh-huh), the human talk box
I'm top notch and you ain't got a fan yet
Watch me blow they minds with some bars, call me Xanax
I ain't even goin' hard, told you my flow is sharp
And when the Dro is sparked, sittin' back: Rosa Parks
Don't call me lazy, I ain't just some bum kid
But I can bust wigs with every single drum kit
I like to joke a lot, I'm  I'm not
My moms is walkin' in the room like, "Are you smokin' pot?"
Blow the smoke out like, "Yes, I am"
So can I mothafuckin' kick this? (Yes, you can)
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' aroundEmbed
