2 ContributorsBogus Women Interlude LyricsY'all know, we be tryin' our best as men to be faithful, you know
We might have our wife or our girlfriend, or the lady we care about in our life
And we really be tryna be strong
But then we go to these basement parties like this, and it be all these beautiful women out here
And we start losing focus, you know what I mean?
And then we be tryin' to do good and stuff, and you know
You start getting tempted and you see these beautiful ladies
Wearing the campers around their neck and stuff, you know
Nice striped dresses, very cultural and beautiful, and you start losing it
And I know it ain't right, we do gotta do better, men
But then again, it's some of y'all ladies that need to get y'all shit together, yeah
I ain't sayin' all of y'all, but it's some of y'all
You know, 'cause I know this one sista
In fact, I know a couple sistas that be like, "Man, I'm in love, man," you know
"That's my man right there, that's my boyfriend"
Then I see them out with the next brother
Where is the love? Where is the respect? What happened?
And I know this one sista, man, she did one of my guys real wrong, man
She was really bogus
She was like, she was ugly bogus, she was like super bogus
I'm talkin' 'bout she bogus, man, for real, she straight up bogus
I'ma tell y'all about herYou might also likeEmbed
