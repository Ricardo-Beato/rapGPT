Ha, everybody know one

Wrist on hockey, Pimp C cocky
Rich ass junkie and my phone keep jumpin' (Hello)
Different type of water from a different type of faucet
Neighborhood watchin' try to cut into my profit (Fuck you)
Rich ass junkie, Louis V down to the wallet (Louis)
Different clientele, hit my line, you know I got it (Gucci)
Fresh up out parole (Woah), keep it in a row (Woah)
Ballin' out control (So?), cash out on your ho (Ho)
Money down the drain (Huh), dog food in the vein (Oh)
'Cause I'm the one that servin' her, am I the one to blame? (No)
Crack cocaine, got my cousin losin' weight (Oh)
Used to be a plug, now he just a J (Woo)
Snortin' his life away (Damn), a couple G's a day
But now he on the flake, he so small, he blew away (Smoke)
Rich ass junkie (Huh), same sad story (Woo)
Drunk reminiscin', 'bout his dope boy glories (Wop)

Rich ass junkie (Huh), rich ass junkie (Woah)
I'm trappin' out the loft, servin' rich ass junkies
Rich ass junkie (Woo), rich ass junkie (Yeah)
In the Six, gettin' it off, servin' rich ass junkies
Rich ass junkie (Gato), rich ass junkie (Gato)
Round around the city servin' rich ass junkies (Gato)
Rich ass junkie (Huh), rich ass junkie (Wop)
Diamonds on my neck (Brr), rich ass junkies (Brr, brr)
