26 ContributorsJesse James Lyrics

Snuck up behind him, had his hands in his pocket
Took my pistol out, unlocked it
Pulled the hammer back and cocked it
And left his shit all on the carpet
I seen a (Murder, murder) I pin-pointed my target
I'm making my way up out the building
I got the nigga that I came here to get, notify his children
That they old man done fell up out the game
Because I came through this motherfucker
And killed his ass just like Jesse James

Think it's a motherfuckin' game?
I come around this motherfucker and kill your ass just like Jesse James
What's my motherfuckin' name?

There'll be no witnesses to this homicide
No reenactment on the late night news to be redramatized
All you got is a nigga with a dot
In the middle of his motherfuckin' head he's been shot
Dropped in the middle of the floor and he ain't breathin'
And the nigga's on the go 'cause we ain't seen him
He did his dirt and got the fuck up out the picture
The hollow point just hit ya, out of line, so it got witcha
Call the motherfuckin' helicopter
But ain't no hope, 'cause the nina broke that nigga off a hella proper
That oughta hold your monkey ass (Motherfucker, you)
That oughta teach your funky ass (Motherfucker, you)
I know this motherfuckin' game is sheist
And you done lost the fuckin' game of life
And that's a motherfuckin' shame
You let a nigga come around and do your ass just like Jesse James
You might also like
And that's a motherfuckin' shame?
You came around this motherfucker and let me do you like Jesse James
Think it's a motherfuckin' game?

Wait, this motherfucker got me bent, I gots to break
Because this nigga done put his hands all up in my face
He best to chill before I hit him with this mace
And catch this motherfuckin' case
'Cause once I got him blind, then he done with
Because I'm true to myself, fuck the dumb shit
You ain't no motherfuckin' gangsta, G
And when I get up out your ass you gon' realize it just ain'tsta be
It ain't no studio up in me
And all that bullshit I'm hearin' you talk only offends me
And lately I'm under a lot of pressure
It seems to me you can't come clean, so yo, I gots to check ya
I pull my .45 and (Buh buh buh buh)
And right before he die I (Fuh fuh fuh fuh)
I could give a motherfuck about the sentence
I snatch yo ass up off the hinges 'cause I'm screamin' for vengeance
'Cause life has no meanin', no meanin'
We were all born to die, so no screamin'
Think it's a motherfuckin' game?
I'll come around this motherfucker and cut your ass just like Jesse James
Blow out your motherfuckin' brains
I come around this motherfucker and kill your ass just like Jesse James
Think it's a motherfuckin' game?1Embed
