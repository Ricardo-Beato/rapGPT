10 ContributorsOn Everything Lyrics
I really don't care what gang you bang
What set you claim
On everything (Nigga, put that on everything)
I really don't, really don't, really don't care what clique you with
Cause when I trip
A nigga trip (Nigga, fuck your clique, nigga)

Don't come around me on your sucker shit
I ain't the type to be fuckin' with
Lover boy, want a tougher bitch
Get the fuck from around me, get the fuck from around me
I say the shit cause I mean this shit
Bentley Mulsanne, Iâ€™m clean as shit
Seat back and I'm leaning, bitch
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You know how the shit go
Out the door, O after O
That's more money, that's more money
That's more money fo' sho
I got a whole bunch of bad habits
That fly shit, I gotta have it
That pistol on me, I pack it
Bitch, your fuckin' head, I crack it
Me and my pinky ring are like marriage
Plus she cut ten carats
I shine on 'em, get a line on 'em
Send the wolves right there at 'em
I never said I'd get you by now
You done heard I got you
Heard all your homies was haulin' ass
To that club tonight they shot you
You might also like
I really don't care what gang you bang
What set you claim
On everything (Nigga, put that on everything)
I really don't, really don't, really don't care what clique you with
Cause when I trip
A nigga trip (Nigga, fuck your clique, nigga)

You know every beef, I don't need my strap
Knife work, I cut you, jack
Niggas watchin' my paper stack
Cops comin' every time I black out
Oh, oh
Shawty sayin' I'm a mental case
I'm sayin' fuck out my face
You finna make me catch a case
Your new bitch my old hoe
I put her on fo' sho though
Her head game was so-so
That's why I had to let her go, go
I'm blowin' up like I'm supposed to blow
Neck glowin' like it's supposed to glow
Gold Cuban, club movin'
New music, hoes choosin'
It's a win, win, we don't lose at all
Came up, we supposed to ball
Don't know who you take me for
I kill you if you make me, boy
You don't know how real it get
Playin' 'round with this gangsta shit
We all in, we all in
I want one when I'm fallin'
I really don't care what gang you bang
What set you claim
On everything (Nigga, put that on everything)
I really don't, really don't, really don't care what clique you with
Cause when I trip
A nigga trip (Nigga, fuck your clique, nigga)
I really don't care what gang you bang
What set you claim
On everything (Nigga, put that on everything)
I really don't, really don't, really don't care what clique you with
Cause when I trip
A nigga trip (Nigga, fuck your clique, nigga)3Embed
