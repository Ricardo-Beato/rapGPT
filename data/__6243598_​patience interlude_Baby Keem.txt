I know the lonely feeling when you've been consumed, fool
Lie on my resources when I scope the room
They should've left these bloodsuckers inside the womb

Don't grip on possessions, that's one of my lessons
It's never been that deep, I can't be desperate
I turn to Alexa, when I can't find a Lexus
This feel like a rainy day in Texas
My niece holdin' a bible, and she deserve the blessings
A mеss I made back home is manifestеd
I can't turn a blind eye, the feelings here are restless
Resentment weighing heavy, and I've been understeppin'

Can't let them take my patience, put the phone on mute
I know the lonely feeling when you've been consumed, fool
Lie on my resources when I scope the room
They should've left these bloodsuckers inside the womb
Can't let them take my patience, put the phone on mute
I know the lonely feeling when you've been consumed, fool
Lie on my resources when I scope the room
They should've left these bloodsuckers inside the womb

Don't grip on possessions, that's one of my lessons
It's never been that deep, I can't be desperate
I turn to Alexa, when I can't find a Lexus
This feel like a rainy day in Texas
My niece holdin' a bible, and she deserve the blessings
A mess I made back home is manifested
I can't turn a blind eye, the feelings here are restless
Resentment weighing heavy, and I've been understeppin'

Can't let them take my patience, put the phone on mute
I know the lonely feeling when you've been consumed, fool
Lie on my resources when I scope the room
They should've left these bloodsuckers inside the womb5Embed
