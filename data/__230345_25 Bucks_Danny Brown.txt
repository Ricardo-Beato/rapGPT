62 Contributors25 Bucks Lyrics
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas

Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists
'Bout to feed her kids at night, sit between her legs and twist
While she listen to the oldies, soap operas, smoking bogies
On the phone, gossiping, telling homegirls stories
Girlfriend worried 'cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state pen' or a cemetery buried
Ma replied, do her best, but it's still rough
Keep your kids off the street and away from drugs
Doing hair in the house, ain't putting on Daniel
Daddy in and out: "Ayy, who turned that channel?"
Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back
Ashing her cigarette in a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, laughing, tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove, put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going

Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division, only thing that add up
Fucked up 'cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division, only thing that add up
Fucked-up nigga tryna get a couple bucks

25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas
Iverson Zig Zags, good night: fast food
If you really balling, mommy cop Chinese food
If you really wonder why these people got issues
'Cause the rent owed and the fucking lights due
On her knees at night, pray a miracle come through
Daddy shooting Craps, tryna win a pair of shoes
I been growing my hair, 'bout to let mommy twist it
Out wilding with my friends, even got myself a biscuit
Homie momma smoking with nothing to lose
Now he stashing cracks in some hundred-dollar shoes
Sitting at his crib, smoking Swishers, getting faded
Told me hit my mommy up, 'cause he tryna get braided
What we gon' do? See the local dopeman
See if he can put some money in our hand
Same one jump me, the same one front me
'Cause I'm tired of seeing my family fucked up and hungry

Now I'm in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see a nigga dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up nigga tryna get a couple bucks
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see a nigga dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living64Embed
