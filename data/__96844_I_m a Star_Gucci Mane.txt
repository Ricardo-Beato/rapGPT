18 ContributorsIâ€™m a Star Lyrics
Gangsta Grillz
See my shit?
My shit like Hollywood, right?
You call this the Gangsta Grillz walk of fame
Everybody waits to get they star (I'm a star, I'm like a star)
Gucci has officially been inducted (Get out my car, my car, ah)
Oh, they tried to keep 'em out
But don't worry, baby (Gangsta Grillz)
It's mainstream America from here on out (The Affiliates, nigga)
C'mon man
Drum Cruise, nigga, this what I do (Gangsta Grillz)

I'm a star, I'm looking like a star (Yeah)
Everythang is up to par (Yeah), girl look at my car (Mr. Thanksgiving)
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star (Yeah)
Everythang is up to par (Yeah), girl look at my car (Gangsta Grillz)
My shade game crazy, Cavallis and Gucci frames (Yeah)
And my shoe game crazy, Louis not no Nikes mane (Not no Nikes mane)
And my ice game crazy, Gucci got them stupid chains (So Icy)
And my tone game crazy (So Icy), I am going black tonight, black tonight (Yeah)

On Moreland Road, four Moreland hoes
I think we smoked 5 o's or mo'
After we smoked 5 o's or mo'
Them hoes left, them some Moreland hoes
Them hoes was cheap as hell
I bought 'em Goose, them hoes wanted Glen Mo'
Them hoes wanted Glen Mo' to drank
Them hoes was broke, them hoes was broke
I know them hoes from school fasho'
Them hoes' mama be smoking dope
Them hoes mama used to sell all
They clothes to me for the low low
Starter hat and Starter coat
Starter hat and Starter coat
Falcon shirt, the Falcon hat
The furcoat man, you know I go
Go to school so fresh, you know
With your shit, you know I go
Go to the lunchline with a bankroll
With a big ol' bankroll
You on the bus, Chevy 4-do'
You on the bus, Chevy 4-do'
You on the bus, I'm Chevy 4-do'
Beatin' down the block, Candler Road

My shade game crazy, Cavallis and Gucci frames (Yeah)
And my shoe game crazy, Louis not no Nikes mane (Not no Nikes mane)
And my ice game crazy, Gucci got them stupid chains (So Icy)

A Buick Regal, 8's and Bose, on Bouldercrest, I'm selling dope
At Texaco, where Mr. Kim keep saying"Get away from sto'!"
No I can't get 'way from sto' (No, no, no), I got so much blow, gotta go (No, no, no)
Gotta go, go buy some mo', holla at woe, go buy some low
On Gresham Road with Randy Low, I think we blowed a half of dro
We think we gotta buy some mo', we so high like a brick of coke
2004 had forty wholes, forty halves and forty wholes
You don't know 'bout Gucci Mane, he is from 'round Gresham Road
Sun Valley soldier, flex on soldiers standing at tha Amaco
'96, I'm in the Hamps' finna get a dub to blow
Antwerp with me, Duct Tape with me, Zone 6 Kirkwood fucking with me (I said it)
Gucci Mane La Flare, Eastside Atlanta, that's my city, huh

I'm a star, I'm looking like a star (Yeah)
Everythang is up to par (Yeah), girl look at my car
I'm a star, I'm looking like a star (Yeah)
Everythang is up to par (Yeah), girl look at my car
My shade game crazy, Cavallis and Gucci frames (Yeah)
And my shoe game crazy, Louis not no Nikes mane (Not no Nikes mane)
And my ice game crazy, Gucci got them stupid chains (So Icy)
And my tone game crazy (So Icy), I am going black tonight, black tonight, ah (Yeah)
You see, I used to be Samuel L. Jakson
Means I had too many snakes on my plane
But now, I'm Jack Nicholson (Gangsta Grillz)
'Cause I'm shining on you niggas3Embed
