6 ContributorsBack Then LyricsI said I came into this game young and yay tall
Gold Mouth shot me a bill, copped my first 8 ball
(Yall fuck niggas betta get it together nigga
Watch how I get gangsta man, fuck wit me shorty lets go)
Nigga I was focused, knew what it took to get there
Now I'm 14 working wit' a half a block fare
Hoes, getting money, having twice the fun
And don't play wit' it dog, we got twice the guns
When I was young, serving niggas thats twice my age
Getting it, riding hard, getting twice the paid
(Ay, what the fuck, it's Jeezy nigga, let's go)
Older niggas hating dog, they don't want it wit us
See us in the street dog, they don't want it wit us
Niggas snitching, niggas telling, they don't want it wit us
Me and my lil' niggas yall, see we kicked up dust
Straight gangsta shit dog, we nothing but mobstas
How the fuck you niggas gon' try to rob the robbers?
(Don't get yo mothafuckin' head split nigga
CTE nigga, fuck wit me, let's go)
We talkin' back when I was trapping on Lumpkin Road
I had the cut dog, nigga wit the hammers and load
The first nigga in the hood wit a set of Vogues
We used to hit the high school nigga and scoop up hoes
Older niggas hatin' yall, but its all good
I had the two 12s in my trunk wit the Kenwood nigga
You might also like(What you know about that nigga? I'm true to this shit nigga
I been doing this since 'Here We Go', let's go)
I'm talkin when Masta P dropped 'Ice Cream Man'
I was posted on the corner wit' the ice cream man
All the gangsta and the killas they be giving me dap
Back when me and Goldmouth used to fall asleep on the trap
Shit, stayed in some shit, we a shot for fun
Back when Lil Monique used to hold my bun nigga
(Hold up, yall think this a rap nigga talking to yall man?
Yall think about what ya hearing pimpin', let's go)
I'm talking back when Mailman use to play B-ball
And yall was mad cuz we wouldn't even fuckin' wit yall
Yall use to page a young nigga and I wouldn't even call
But you could catch me coppin' all the fresh J's at the mall
Use to try to hang wit' me, we wouldn't even cool
Back when I use to hide my re-up at my locker in school nigga
(You heard that, "in school nigga" - adlibs)
Mel Man got jammed, man the shit got serious
Gold Mouth got jammed, man the shit got serious
Look at me now dog, I'm up in the booth
And shit ain't mothafuckin' changed, I'm still the truth
Posted up in the club, I'm packing my tools
Niggas hating on me dog, cuz I'm rocking my jewels nigga
(This USDA nigga, this CTE nigga
I hear all them niggas talking about they trap boys
Thats bullshit nigga, the real is back nigga
Fuck what you said dog 'fo you fix yo' mouth to say anything nigga
?, Big Zoe fuck wit' yo' boy, Kink B I love you nigga
Mel Man, Gold Mouth yall hold it down nigga)Embed
