16 ContributorsPlay With Your Children Lyrics
Yeah I fell off for a minute but I’m right back balling
I’m a big ass nigga but got this little sharp on it
I got my wine with me nigga but I ain’t from New Orleans
You know them young niggas will kill you for them brand new Jordans
I fucked the gamblers house up, I want to buy one, bought it
Little bad bitch went and bought me that brand new Audi
They call me thigh pad shawty, got the real high prices
Keep a pocket rocket, make your ass come out of the closet
I got the squares in, niggas smelling like nail polish
My stack seven feet tall like Rasheed Wallace
These niggas say that they some killers but they act like hoes
I got a heart so I'm kill you and send your grandma roses

You better play with your children, you better play with your children
Cause you ain’t got to tell me, I can see you’re in your feelings
Hell naw, I’m not a psychic, but I predict a killing
In such a short time, I made myself some millions
You better play with your children, you better play with your children
Cause you ain’t got to tell me, I can see you’re in your feelings
Hell naw, I’m not a psychic, but I predict a killing
In such a short time, I made myself some millions

Just a short time I made about a million
Not off no rap check but trapping in them buildings
From all this lean I sip I done spent about a million
And I don’t beef with kids nigga, go play with your children
Working with the work man, just like a gym do
Niggas try to rob me, thank god I had my pistol
Some thot calling me, she talking bout her rent due
Better go find your boyfriend, 'cause all I do is fuck you
Nigga playing with me, knowing I’m a loose screw
Don’t make me pull up with the youngins, boy them boys is KuKu
Hop out the cut, on foenem, I will shoot you
Just bought a brand new chopper, them bullets gon' kiss you
Funeral next Friday your mama gon' miss you
But that’s how it get when you’re fucking with a boss dude
Ain’t no pretending, you don’t want to cop a Hyundai
I’mma tell you once boy you better play with your children
You might also like
You better play with your children, you better play with your children
Cause you ain’t got to tell me, I can see you’re in your feelings
Hell naw, I’m not a psychic, but I predict a killing
In such a short time, I made myself some millions
You better play with your children, you better play with your children
Cause you ain’t got to tell me, I can see you’re in your feelings
Hell naw, I’m not a psychic, but I predict a killing
In such a short time, I made myself some millions3Embed
