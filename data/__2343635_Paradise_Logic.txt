126 ContributorsParadise Lyrics

Chuch, yeah
Now this that—
Yeah, yeah

Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious
I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born out of wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good
No ingredients in my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda
Gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it, hold up wait
Now take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin
Based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway—
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that "My Way"
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
What the fuck done happened to the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy (crazy)
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep (why)
Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker
Wide awake on the creep tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed watch him grow and then watch him lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC

Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise

I remember my life long ago in my adolescence
I could feel the presence in my residence
Hesitant even thought it was evident
I should get the fuck—
I know something is wrong
Yeah, I know something is wrong
Feel like my mind gone
I know I play along, I might drown in this song
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed
Shit maybe then I'm noticed, huh, but maybe not
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
Walking to work and I go blind
Sippin' on that Kool-Aid
Gettin' big wig money, that's toupée
Look around and see people with no class
Like snow on a school day
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu
Livin' life how I do is crazy
This shit never amaze me
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why
All I know is my mind racing
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it
Yeah, I be pacing, bitch I'm back again
Been here since way back when
Now let that shit begin, yeah
This album two but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise

This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming "I knew it!"
This is real, so real
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
Most of these people will never hit fruition
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
All alone with no one to dial
I'm just a man, I got problems
Understand, this is all I ever wanted
Yes, I do it for the fans and I ain't perfect
I've questioned if this life was even worth it
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now

This album two but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise61Embed
