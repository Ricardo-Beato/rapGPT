8 ContributorsWhy Lyrics
(Bless you Andy)
Yeah (Hurt, what it do?)
Yeah

My timin' is rich, my diamonds are different
Uppin' the ranking, big with the bankin' (Yeah)
Low with the press, no blocks for the boy
Hop in the coupe, she look tight like a minute (Skrrt)
This bitch a ten and in ten, I'm in it (Yeah)
White teeth, bitch, FaceTime in the kitchen (Ha)
Fuck her two times, oh well, good riddance
Border ego in a room full of pigeons
Throw me that pussy, one hand catch, dig in'
Coupe like I'm white like Andy Griffin
I cannot stress it, ho did the boys and the girls get thе message
Give hеr some ecs', I hope that she blessin'
If she get mad she tryna arrest me, she wanna sex me
These niggas pounds like the fresh level chest piece (Zoom)

Why would they test me? (Zoom)
Why would they press me? (Zoom)
Run up that sack, need a ESPY (Zoom)
Fuck on that bitch, I got technique (Uh)
Bro had a stretch where his Tec be (Zoom)
Bitches be actin' like they know me (Mmm)
Knowin' damn well they ain't meet me (Zoom)
Me, me, me, fill in Maybach, couple freaks (Zoom)
Lames get treats, mmm (Mmm)

Why would they test me? (Zoom, zoom)
Why would they press me? (Zoom)
Run up that sack, need a ESPY (Zoom)
Fuck on that bitch, I got technique (Uh)
Bro had a stretch where his Tec be (Zoom)
Bitches be actin' like they know me (Mmm)
Knowin' damn well they ain't meet me (Zoom)
Me, me, me, fill in Maybach, couple freaks (Zoom)
Lames get treats, mmm (Mmm)
