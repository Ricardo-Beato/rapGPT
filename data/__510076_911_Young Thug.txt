16 Contributors911 Lyrics
Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left
You know I'ma cop them foreign cars till it’s none left
Thousand dollar step, I’m in that 911
Tearing out the streets in that new 911
Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's

Tearing on the block, I don’t care about no cops
I ain’t gonna never stop, they gonna race me to the top
I’m in that 911, just don’t panic
Whip it all up out that bowl, water, Titanic
I think my car need a band aid, I’m bleeding through the streets
Me and DK on the autograph, my car get a lease
Ain’t nobody supposed to have it, I snatched it
I gave 'em mostly green like a salad, not average
Come across the ocean on a boat, then a train
I’m not trying to go to prison but I’m blowing out the brains
No shirt with a scarf on my head like Sudan
Got a bank full of cash money, Baby and Wayne, dang

Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left
You know I'ma cop them foreign cars till it’s none left
Thousand dollar step, I’m in that 911
Tearing out the streets in that new 911
Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's

Brand new AP, came from OG double D
R-I-fucking-P, 5 mill' spent in the streets
You know we gonn' spaz, we gonn' kill her to find out
But we street bees, we don’t have no honey hide out
Bleeding like a fool, Memphis Mark, OG boo dirty
Just hit my line when they ask I say “I know you heard me”
OG Double D left everybody’s streets working
I miss him, I got RIP OG Double D on all the birdies
Feeling like Ken, hundred dollar bills on Tonka Trucks
Riding round with so many sins, I ain’t gonn' tell 'em all that
The pussy nigga hit the pen, I ain’t gonn' tell 'em fall back
Catch me riding in the 9 11, banging fall back

Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left
You know I'ma cop them foreign cars till it’s none left
Thousand dollar step, I’m in that 911
Tearing out the streets in that new 911
Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's4Embed
