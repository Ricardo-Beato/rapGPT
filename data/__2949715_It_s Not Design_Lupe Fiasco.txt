Oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

What if I said, love was a lie though?
It was more like hate with a eye closed
And the other eye, had the eye rolled
That's contempt and ignorance, I know
But what do I know?
Only thing that I seen was the inside, of a blindfold
And you just as blind as me
So how I look? Askin' you where do I go
Eye and I keep high hope alive though
That love's not a lie it just likes to lie low
Likes to hide right there in plain sight
And you got to find it with your eyes, closed
And in the dark, you see the part
Of your partner that's the heart
If you die, it's like apartheid, we can bring it back to the, start

It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
No, it's not designed to make you feel love
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Oh no, yeah
You might also like
On second thought, leave apartheid in the grave
But the heart part, that can be saved
The hard part's makin' sure it don't break
Into little sharp pieces that are hard to replace
Hard to find spare arteries these days
In decent shape and know things'll decay
And at these rates you're gon' need to be paid
Like three-ty ways just to see D. Wade
To the place that sells these parts
That you couldn't keep safe from the stee-art
So why would we waste our art on your mistake
When you was drivin' reckless? Didn't pump the brakes
Hate to have to shoot you down
A fine runnin' heart makes a soothin' sound
It's junkyard love in your future, pal
Didn't appreciate it then, bet you do, now

It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
On no no!
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Oh oh oh, yeah, hey baby
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Noooo baby
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Never gonna make you feel, nooo, babe
And in the futuristic
Love will be reduced to physics
Computer digits made by robots
That use statistics, algorithms and group logistics
The mood-resistant
Downloadable thing that's used specific
Easily updated with few commitments
Can find its way home if you forget it
Say, maybe on a starship tour
Heard a knock at your starship door
It was the girl that you had met at the starship bar
Had a dance on the starship floor
But then you got starship sick
So you had to run to the starship store
And then you got those starship pills
But when you back, she wasn't there no more
She says, "Hope you got a starsuit at the starship store
Maybe we can take a trip
To take a look at the stars around parsec 4"
And it was the most beautiful thing
You both had ever seen in your lives before
And she pulled out her love
So you reached down in your starsuit for
But your pockets empty now the moments passed
And it'll probably never happen like this again
I guess it didn't work out for you in the, end
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
On no no, yeah a-yeah
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Not designed! Not designed baby! Hoo, hoo baby
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
Not designed! Not designed! No no no no no no no oh

Oh oh
No no, baby
Hoo hoo, ahh, baby6Embed
