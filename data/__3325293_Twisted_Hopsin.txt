39 ContributorsTwisted Lyrics
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it—

I see myself as Bruce Banner
Some people say I'm a loose cannon
I only came here to do damage
Not 21, I'm just too savage
Go ahead and get you some new glasses
But I am unseeable, dude can it
I will applaud you if you manage
I now reside on a new planet
Nigga my ego is on Eiffel
Piss a nigga off, I ain't really gonna see no high road
"Damn, Hop, why you seem so spiteful?"
Steppin' on niggas like fee-fo-fi-fum
Get used to my trifle ways
When enemies got a price to pay
I don't really fit in with none of you niggas
When I'm near you I feel like a metal in a microwave
I'd much rather be at home all alone by myself
Fuck your support, I can buy it myself
Foes be the real reason why I melt
Y'all get around me and eyein' my wealth
I don't need anyone sideline help
Pain in my eyes every time I yelp
If I don't relax then my mind might swell
But I guess that's life, oh well
So here's my hypothesis: the old me does not exist
Y'all like, "What Hop is this?"
I'm not here for peace, I'm not here for love
Bitch, I want the opposite
So fuck all the compliments! Fuck being positive!
I'm in my prime, but I ain't no Optimus
Shit's about to go down, I can promise it, biatch!

You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it—

How you tryna drive from the backseat?
I been runnin' things like an athlete
Pedal to the metal goin' max speed
Sippin' Red Bull 'cause I barely had sleep
Laboratory smellin' like a gas leak
Goin' up in flames when the track beat
I made a 100 motherfuckin' K last week
Niggas feelin' me like Mr. King's last speech
When you mix in a lot of hardcore revenge
A pitchfork and sins, then misfortune wins
You can cop you a house up in Porter Ranch
And pull up on these hoes in Porsche or Benz
So many fake friends, I'm bored of friends
Life feel just like I'm bordered in
Have I talked to the Lord? I sorta been
I been battlin' with life in a tournament
Let me spit the facts
Bitch, relax, I lift the match and build the shit from scratch
First empire I built, shit collapsed
Had bad splits 'til my lips were chapped
Back in high school where not many kids could rap
But I engineered they ass just for cash
Niggas couldn't see where my head was at
In my living room where I rest the plaques
So here's my conclusion
As I sit in this booth I condition to bruise
I'm vicious and gruesome, you're listenin' to
Some premeditated murder, yes, I meant to intrude
It's Panorama city, madness up against me
UC Prodigy, the rap attack committee
I been rappin' 'fore the world tell me not to go sittin', like—
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it—

Welcome to my euphoria
This is a place where I'm too victorious
This ain't a place where the grass is greener
This is a place full of mad demeanor
Look sideways, catch a bag of fever
Niggas stay shooked like they havin' seizures
My life's a movie, this track’s a teaser
So recognize the real nigga

You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it—14Embed
