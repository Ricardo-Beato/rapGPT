Burrrprint (2) HD
1017 Bricksquad (Yeah, boy)
Who we do this for, Gucci?  (Yeah)
The shooters, the hood niggas, the goons (Yeah, boy)
Let's go (Yeah, boy)

Everybody lookin', yo, yo
Lambos get the bitches, more hoes (Holiday Season)
Stove make the cookies, O's, O's (Skrrt, skrrt)
Hurtin' these suckers' feelings, ouch, ouch (Ouch)

Yo-yo-yo, come check this crazy flow (Burr)
I gotta go and do this show, just where is Tokyo? (Burr)
Yo, yo, damn, Bricksquad be burnin' dro (Burr, burr)
Drink, burr man and white folk with me (Burr), I got cash to blow (Burr)
Yo, yo, your nose gon' grow just like Pinocchio (Burr)
You lying that you hot as me, but that is not the truth (Burr)
Oh no, my left right wrist is truly extra cold (Burr, burr)
My flow sick, need them extra O's (Burr), I need an extra stove (Burr)
So, so, I'm So Icey, my squad run in snow (Burr)
You know it and you knew before, so much dough I shut down the store (Burr)
Hoes, hoes, I birdfeed these bitches like they were crows (Burr, burr)
I pull the totem pole out (Burr) and leave that pussy swole (Burr)

Say, say, what you thought? What you think I say? (Ah)
I make money different ways, get bags off through the day (Ah)
Ayy, hey, damn, I paved my way, I paved my way
I used to sell a lot of yay, I moved a ki' a day (Gucci)
Way-way, way-way-way-way back-back in the day (Wow)
I ran the A, me and my wolves, two shotguns and a K (Wow)
Now I'm gettin' that stupid cake, I'll put you to sleep like Jake the Snake
Then throw big faces right in your face, right in front the place (Gucci)
One day you might get some money, maybe twelve bars if you pay me
'Scuse me, girl, you want some babies? "Gucci, you can't have my baby"
Monday, I'ma go to Magic City, see some ass and titties
Hit some strippers, sip some liquor, all these bitches fucking with me

Everybody lookin', yo, yo
Lambos get the bitches, more hoes
Stove make the cookies, O's, O's (Skrrt, skrrt)
Hurtin' these suckers' feelings, ouch, ouch

Hurtin' these suckers' feelings, ouch, ouch
Goddamn, Gucci Mane just bought another Lamb'
Chevy with the crazy cam', I pull up with that stupid slam (Damn)
Yeah, plus I got all this jewelry on
Flexin' like I'm Serius Jones, Bubba Kush still my cologne (Well, damn)
Word up? Bricksquad, put your birds up
You ain't never heard nothing if you never heard of us (Goddamn)
Blood, cuz run to you, you can't rep no more (Holiday Season, nigga)
Matter, you can't breath no more
Go so hard that it ain't nothing left for sure (Go)
What? I'm royalty like King Tut
Got someone to introduce you to, baby, that's these nuts (Damn)
Plus I wouldn't give a flying fuck 'bout none of that shit you fuss about
I fly them in, then bust 'em out, there's nothing left to talk about (Well, damn)

Everybody lookin', yo, yo
Lambos get the bitches, more hoes
Stove make the cookies, O's, O's (Skrrt, skrrt)
Hurtin' these suckers' feelingsâ€” (Ayy, what?)2Embed
