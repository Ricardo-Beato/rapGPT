39 ContributorsNew Era Lyrics
Niggas out here snitching, do my dirt all by my lonely
I been in the D, so long that I don't even like Coney
And you could never be my homie
I'm a Linwood nigga that was raised up on bologna
Say we over here hustling, over there grinding
Calculator wrist watch, multiply my timing
I be with your girlfriend, say she like my rhyming
Dog, I shine so hard that I don't need no goddamn diamonds
I'm up in Eastland, just to hit Lids
Walked up in the store, you know just what I did
Looking at the wall, you know the other half
Blue tiger fitted in a seven and a half

And I rocks that shit, any climate, any weather
In my brand new blue tiger-fitted New Era
And I reps that shit right now forever
(Old English D on a blue New Era)
And I rocks that shit, any climate, any weather
In my brand new blue tiger-fitted New Era
And I reps that shit right now forever
(Old English D on a blue New Era)

So fuck who you are
I been in the D so long when outta town your store barred
And you could never be my man
Fuck a turkey on Thanksgiving niggas lucky to get ham
And every hood I'm in, niggas greet me with "What up, doe!"
We call fiends "custo's," freak hoes "busto's"
If we say the hook then that really mean the po-po
If we say that’s ‘bo’ then that mean that’s fucked up bro
Niggas don't know gotta put 'em on the slang
Out of town niggas lost hip 'em to the game
You know where I'm from, no matter where I'm at
Cause of the logo on my New Era hat
You might also like
And I rocks that shit, any climate, any weather
In my brand new blue tiger-fitted New Era
And I reps that shit right now forever
(Old English D on a blue New Era)
And I rocks that shit, any climate, any weather
In my brand new blue tiger-fitted New Era
And I reps that shit right now forever
(Old English D on a blue New Era)

Ain't heard it like this in a while
I been in the D so long that I don't go to Belle Isle
Now do I look like your child
If I ain't got no Newports, I'mma freak a Black and Mild
Say I'm riding down 7 Mile, 'bout to hit the Lodge
You front I put a knife in you like you a shish-kebab
Your baby momma slobber put my palm up on her bob
She go up down, up down, oh, God
We heading downtown, riding through the tunnel
Smoking on some gans, banging keep it a hundred
Where the hood Crip niggas don't know how to act
You look up in the car all you see is D hats

And I rocks that shit, any climate, any weather
In my brand new blue tiger-fitted New Era
And I reps that shit right now forever
(Old English D on a blue New Era)
And I rocks that shit, any climate, any weather
In my brand new blue tiger-fitted New Era
And I reps that shit right now forever
(Old English D on a blue New Era)
And I rocks that shit, any climate, any weather
In my brand new blue tiger-fitted New Era
And I reps that shit right now forever
(Old English D on a blue New Era)
And I rocks that shit, any climate, any weather
In my brand new blue tiger-fitted New Era
And I reps that shit right now forever
