7 ContributorsGoodnight Lyrics
Hold up, hold up, big ring, big watch, crushed ice
Young Juiceman and I'm shinin' like the street light
Step off in the club and my chain say goodnight
Baby girl, you foolish if you think the kid ain't wrapped tight
Maserati coupe in the blue in over night
Sprite mixed pink you can call that a pink Sprite
And the way I live, you can call that street life
VVS diamonds, everybody say goodnight

Twenty bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
Twenty bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
I walk off in the club and my chain say goodnight
I step off in the club and my chain say goodnight
My watch and my ring lookin' just like crushed ice
My watch and my ring lookin' just like crushed ice
I got the lean and the Sprite so I need to get some crushed ice
Lean and the sprite so I need to get some crushed ice

Godly, who's he? Who, me?
It's So Icey E.N.T and do you understand me?
I'm a walkin' bank roll and you can rubber band me
Goodnight, it's a thirty-thousand dollar show spree
See a chain with better clarity than bleach on me
Yeah, I'm white, I'm catchin' light like a dog catch fleas
It's a Kodak moment, everybody say, "Cheese"
The car so cloudy that your girl can't breathe (Gucci)

Twenty bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
Twenty bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
I walk off in the club and my chain say goodnight
I step off in the club and my chain say goodnight
My watch and my ring lookin' just like crushed ice
My watch and my ring lookin' just like crushed ice
I got the lean and the Sprite so I need to get some crushed ice
Lean and the sprite so I need to get some crushed ice

Twenty bricks a week make the girl say goodnight
Pull up to the club, 72 with the loud pike
Ring, watch, chain and bracelet purchased by the street light
Buy the whole bar, make the club say goodnight
Swag so stupid and my diamonds cut just right
Compliments the flow, powder stones just ain't right
Colored stones separated by blue and white
OJ da Juiceman came up off the corner right

Twenty bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
Twenty bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
I walk off in the club and my chain say goodnight
I step off in the club and my chain say goodnight
My watch and my ring lookin' just like crushed ice
My watch and my ring lookin' just like crushed ice
I got the lean and the Sprite so I need to get some crushed ice
Lean and the sprite so I need to get some crushed ice
I'm smokin' with my left to show my watch off when I'm blowin'
This kush is superfragilisticexpialidocious
Fifty bags I'm bringin' they would think I'm totin' groceries
But they can call that I purchased just to feed the family
Baby, call me back, god damn, a nigga gamblin'
Trap still jumpin' like a baby on the trampoline
Goodnight, crushed ice, Sprite and Promethezine
Goodnight, crushed ice, watch, chain, pinkie ring

Twenty bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
Twenty bricks a night make your girl say goodnight
I walk off in the club and my chain say goodnight
I step off in the club and my chain say goodnight
My watch and my ring lookin' just like crushed ice
My watch and my ring lookin' just like crushed ice
I got the lean and the Sprite so I need to get some crushed ice
Lean and the sprite so I need to get some crushed iceEmbed
