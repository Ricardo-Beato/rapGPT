Speak
Eat my flesh flesh my flesh

Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualties
It started with my bitch, mistress, and her family
Whole town mad at me, but fuck it, I am glad to be
The killer, nothing realer in this world than a tragedy
Before I take her soul, I take her ears like Tyson
Cut my main bitch with my glove
I love to ball, I never liked hoes
I couldn't trust them, so I hunt them base, molest they eyelids
Stalk their dreams and predict their every move like a psychic

Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualties
Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualties
Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualties
Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualtiesYou might also like4Embed
