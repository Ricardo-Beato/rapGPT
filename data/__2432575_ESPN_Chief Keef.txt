Ball like ESPN
ESPN, ESPN
ESP-N
Chase Gang
Bitch, huh
Credit card debit, it go sway sway
ESPN, bitch, turn up
What I'm smoking, reeking
Bad bitch
Bitch, I ball like ESPN
Bad bitch, she from Puerto Rico
Smoking on this reeking

Bitch, I ball like ESPN
What I'm smoking, reeking
Bad bitch, she from Puerto Rico
Said she like Almighty, True Religion
Thirty G's up in these True Religions
Robbers fuck with me and
Hermes fuck with me and
Ben Franklin fuck with me and
Shoot my gat, bitch I'm Memphis Bleeking

They want that old Chief Keef
The one that was toting pistols
They said they know Chief Keef
But you don't know me, my nigga
He said he gonna blow at Chief Keef
Gon' blow at me, my nigga?
I got some niggas gon' blow for Chief Keef
They gon' pull up and show, my nigga
I'm getting old, my nigga
I'm getting grown, my nigga
I mean, I'm glo'd up
Bitch I showed up, I showed out
Show stoppers got them poles out
Glo Gang gloing up 'til we glo'd out
I'm pouring up 'til I throw up
Catch up, pussy musty
What I'm smoking, marijuana
This some stanky ganja
Pistols beating like kongos
Boy, you don't want it
Fifty hundred for the Hermes
Five hundred for the gun
Hundred niggas for the run
Glocks and chops, he gon' do this shit for fun
This a Breitling, tell that bitch I be sunny sun

Bitch, I ball like ESPN
What I'm smoking, reeking
Bad bitch, she from Puerto Rico
Said she like Almighty, True Religion
Thirty G's up in these True Religions
Robbers fuck with me and
Hermes fuck with me and
Ben Franklin fuck with me and
Bitch, I ball like ESPNEmbed
