6 ContributorsRunning Through A Check Lyrics
I'm runnin through a check
I got money on my mind
Ain't gon never get it off
Is like a tumor on my brain
Runnin through a check
I was going through some things
And I took off like a plane
I'on giva fuck bout no fame
Runnin through a check
I'm a get a piece about my hands
They wouldn't even understand
It's so hard being the man
I'm runnin through a check
We in popular demand
Gotta stay fly for your fans
And ain't got time for playing

My heart don't even pump unless the trap jump
I was stuck off in the slump put the fore way in the trunk
Cause the country boy shopping
I'm a flex it the next 2 months
Rap it up in green rap it take it to the comp
Hi, and we were working for forever
And we'll grind for forever
And we gonna shine together
I'm a make sure everything around me shine forever
Um going in on these verses
Um way to clever
To be writing this down
I deserve a crown
This ain't no disrespect, but look at me now
Took a hundred pound and put that shit on wax
And Now I got the whole wood screaming racks on racks
You might also like
I'm runnin through a check
I got money on my mind
Ain't gon never get it off
Is like a tumor on my brain
Runnin through a check
I was going through some things
And I took off like a plane
I'on giva fuck bout no fame
Runnin through a check
I'm a get a piece about my hands
They wouldn't even understand
It's so hard being the man
I'm runnin through a check
We in popular demand
Gotta stay fly for your fans
And ain't got time for playing

And when you going through hard times
And you stay on your grind
Can't help but take off flyin'
Every day you wake up tryin
And you know what you desire
To be put in this bind
Gotta Make your next move your best move
Gotta make every play you can't lose, You can't snooze
And you gotta pay dues and more dues
And all the fake dudes you gotta see through
Can't see ya, I get amnesia and I ain't grieving
I'm a stay fly till I'm leaving
And if you go before I go, it's one thing you need to know
I'm runnin through a check
I got money on my mind
Ain't gon never get it off
Is like a tumor on my brain
Runnin through a check
I was going through some things
And I took off like a plane
I'on giva fuck bout no fame
Runnin through a check
I'm a get a piece about my hands
They wouldn't even understand
It's so hard being the man
I'm runnin through a check
We in popular demand
Gotta stay fly for your fans
And ain't got time for playingEmbed
