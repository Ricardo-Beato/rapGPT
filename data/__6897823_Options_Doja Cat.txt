I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options

I know you faded, boy
I feel it wearin' off
When I get Henn' and Coke
I like the way you talk, yeah
I couldn't give a fuck
Givin' him paranoia
He just wanna smash on tour
Fuckin' for that new velour
I like it when you're with me all night
I can't imagine what you might try
Yeah, you so full of surprises
Guess you one of my vices
You want a picket fence and a wife
You never change your mind when I cry
Yeah, I see your flaws and you know it
Droppin' your jaw when the drawers hit the floor
You might also like
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options

You can count on me
To never count on you
I'm only down for you
Way you put it down, baby, wow, I, I

She wanna fuck a nigga like she love me
She got a lover, but I might get lucky
But you got me on a drain like a drunkie
Lookin' at the junk in your trunk like a junkie
We don't speak, just fuck twice a week
And if she like freaks, we must try a threesome
Do it on the beach, in the sand, let me see somethin'
Seashells on the shore, I'm a beach bum
Finna eat somethin' when you come
Baby, don't you wanna let me know?
Layin' in my bed like a vegetable
Lied when you said, "Never let me go"
Just like a pro, you professional
Stand on your hand 'cause you flexible
Now she tryna fuck me in the restroom or the parkin' lot
At the restaurant, anywhere, everywhere, anytime, I
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options27Embed
