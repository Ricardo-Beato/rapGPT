(Oogie Mane, he killed it)
(I'm working on dying)

Bro got the 9, I got the 4 tucked (4 tucked)
Niggas wanna keep talkin', they gotta show us (Gotta show us)
Pull up in a Rolls same color as pour-up (Woah)
Told her bend right over, do the toe-touch (Lean)

Aventador, my doors, I lift 'em like, "Sure 'nough" (Skrrt)
I pull up in a Lam', this not a Lotus (Vroom)
I see my opps again, I gotta load up
I got a demon in my engine, I did a donut (Skrrt)

Oh no, no, no, not you again
Baby girl, yeah, you a ten
On the real, yeah, you a ten
But you cannot pay your rent
Got her rubbin' on my skin
Sing to her like Boyz II Men
Tired of her, give her to my friend
Then I proceed to her twin (Okay)
You might also like
This a UZI, not a MAC, I got no pin
I bet you couldn't tell the difference and that girl a gem (A gem)
Gucci pants come out the Gucci store, come with a hem (Hem)
My pants, they so tight, don't know if they for her or him (Him)
Niggas want my style, I got some swag that you can lend (Lend)
Balenciaga with the Prada, still rock Phillip Lim (Uh)
Louis bandana tied around my chin (Damn)
Gosha socks, them bitches pulled up all the way to my shin (Damn)
Yes, I'm off a 30, psych, nah, I just took three 10s
We rock spinners, we rock spinners on my rims (Uh)
You sucker niggas do anything cause y'all wanna win (Uh)
Oh, no, no, I won't fold, I won't bend

Aventador, my doors, I lift 'em like, "Sure 'nough" (Skrrt)
I pull up in a Lam', this not a Lotus (Vroom)
I see my opps again, I gotta load up
I got a demon in my engine, I did a donut (Skrrt)

Oh no, no, no, not you again
Baby girl, yeah, you a ten
On the real, yeah, you a ten
But you cannot pay your rent
Got her rubbin' on my skin
Sing to her like Boyz II Men
Tired of her, give her to my friend
Then I proceed to her twin (Lil Uzi)
No, I don't drink lean, but pour that four up (Four up)
I get so high that I might throw up (Ayy, ayy)
They keep judging me, but I'm like so what? (What, so?)
Yeah, let's get geeked, girl, let's load up (Ayy)
I bet these niggas never thought I'd blow up (Ayy)
Yeah, so much check but I get more bucks (Woah)
That nigga mad because his bitch still chose us (Chose us)
I got her tweakin' on the six, she goin' nuts (Go dumb, go dumb, go dumb)
Yeah, she goin' nuts (Go dumb, go dumb, go dumb, go dumb, go dumb)
She said "How the diamonds on your neck so polar?" (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, my ice on my neck can't get no colder (Burr)
And I'm from outer space, top of my Wraith so solar (Burr)

Aventador, my doors, I lift 'em like, "Sure 'nough" (What?)
I pull up in a Lam', this not a Lotus
I see my opps again, I gotta load up (Fire)
I got a demon in my engine, I did a donut (Skrrt)

Oh no, no, no, not you again
Baby girl, yeah, you a ten
On the real, yeah, you a ten
But you cannot pay your rent (No, no)
Got her rubbin' on my skin
Sing to her like Boyz II Men (Yeah, yeah)
Tired of her, give her to my friend
Then I proceed to her twin28Embed
