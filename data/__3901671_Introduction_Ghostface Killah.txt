Yeah, yes. You hear that motherfuckin' soul shit? You hear that shit? Soul rap, R&B, dusty soul rap, Ghostface Killah, Tony Starks
Motherfuckin' Pretty Toney, Starkey Love, The Wallabee Champ, Deini, Ghost Deini, Sun God, motherfuckin' Iron Man. The man, his name Ghostface Killah. This is The Lost Tapes, my name is Michael Rapaport. This is an honor and a motherfuckin' privilege to walk you through the beauty of the Ghostface Killer Lost Tapes. You hear that dusty soul shit? I love it. Yo, without further ado, comin' in right now: Ghostface Killah, the icon. Shit, the motherfucker needs no introduction, I don't even know why I'm doin' this shit. Yo, Deini, do what the fuck you do

Hey cocksucker, yes, 80. Yo, what's good? What's good, what's good, what's good? Yo, yo, yo, check it out y'all, I found The Lost Tapes. I found that Lost Tapes, champ, let's go. I'ma send it over to you so we can just blast off with that shit one time and shit, aight? So holla at me when you get to me, man. Just, uh, hit me back, hit me back. You know what it is, truth with the golden voice. OneYou might also likeEmbed
