7 ContributorsWhat Dat Mean Lyrics
Thugger, aye! What dat mean?
I been blowin' paper! What dat mean?
I been blowin' this shit! What dat mean?

Always say you gettin' money like me! What dat mean?
Ridin' round foreign cars like me! What dat mean?
High in a skyscraper like me! What dat mean?
House sitin' on acres like me! What dat mean?
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'

Make the work jump like a trampoline
I love my home team, they red like a beam
Check out my new shoes and they never blue
They red clues
Them niggas right there, they scared of you
So they won't hesitate to bury you
Or Bloody Mary you
And them niggas keep straps
And I hope you don't wear Nike cause you never do
Tonight I'll probably fuck nuttin' in girls
Call her Thugs world, there you go girl
Bring your home girls, long as they fuck the world
They that knack-knack, I did that natural
You might also like
Always say you gettin' money like me! What dat mean?
Ridin' round foreign cars like me! What dat mean?
High in a skyscraper like me! What dat mean?
House sitin' on acres like me! What dat mean?
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'

What the fuck you mean?  You gone take my money?
I call Young Thug, got 100 goons and they (?) in Montgomery
But it clean it baby, the chopper fold
You took 300 from me, I paid 100 more
To take you life, fuckboy
You think shit is sweet? You'se a dumb boy
My little niggas just beat a case, right where (?)
You think you I get no money just by the trunk boy?
Let me eat 'em Thugger
You my little brother, Big Duck my mother
And niggas on that bullshit
Til I hit 'em with that full clip

Always say you gettin' money like me! What dat mean?
Ridin' round foreign cars like me! What dat mean?
High in a skyscraper like me! What dat mean?
House sitin' on acres like me! What dat mean?
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
Niggas think they gettin' in like C-Neil? No, no
Like Ice-T, I stays with that white girl, coco
Lotta niggas get real mad when they see me come
I'll take your bitch and won't give her back, call that no refund
My block is the park, you can call me Nino
This rock-a-bye baby, when you play with my dinero
Get the green, get the pills, get the lean, you can get the soft
Get the time he's gone get here, not guarantee, I get it off
Ridin' in that foreign car, fuckin' around with them foreign broads
Hoes you fall in love with, I treat 'em all like porn stars
Everywhere I go yes, bitches and niggas feelin' me
Twenty grand on my wrist nigga, my time is money, literally

Always say you gettin' money like me! What dat mean?
Ridin' round foreign cars like me! What dat mean?
High in a skyscraper like me! What dat mean?
House sitin' on acres like me! What dat mean?
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'
What dat mean? Dat don't mean nothin'1Embed
