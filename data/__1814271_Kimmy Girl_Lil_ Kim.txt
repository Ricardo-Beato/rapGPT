Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ,ah
Yeah, do the Kimmy Girl rock
Do the Kimmy Girl rock, yeah
What's my name?

My name is Kimmy, flyer than a frisbee
Boys in Miami wanna see me in my Vickies
Might do a little dating, like my girl Chili
But I'm already taken, married to Mister Benji
Weter than the river, sweeter than a swisher
My Jimmy Choo's cuter than the girls that's with you
Everybody staring, might as well take a picture
Mail it to the haters, now sing it with me ladies

All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girls a ten
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful, don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful, don't hate me cause I'm beautiful

It's only one QB, Bed-Suy beauty
If looks was a killer, I probably be a oozie
They be hating on me cause they man try to pursue me
I'm something exotic, she's hardly a cutie
I'm flyer than a G6, sweet like peaches
Bottom like an apple, I know you wanna eat it
He got a huge appetite and I'm the one to feed it
Michael Jackson bad, tell that other bitch to beat it!

All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girls a ten
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful, don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful, don't hate me cause I'm beautiful

CT, DC, do the kimmy girl rock, yeah, ah
ATL and Miami, New York to L.A
All my girls let me hear you say, yeah, aha
Do the kimmy girl rock, yeah, ah
All over the world, all over the world
If I forgot ya please don't be mad at meEmbed
