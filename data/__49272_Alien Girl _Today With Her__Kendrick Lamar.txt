55 ContributorsAlien Girl (Today With Her) Lyrics

She look better than Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO, fly away

So, let's go, go, go, go
Let's go, go, go, go
Let's go, go, go, go
Let's go, let's go

Uh, she got me goin' (Now, she goin'), I'm all in (All in)
Fifty stories (Damn), I'm fallin' (Mm)
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar (Unfamiliar) but still, I feel ya (Feel me?)
Energy is sendin' me towards the ceilin'
I'm high now (High now?), are you up there? (Up there?)
If you was, I would climb every other stair (Mm)
I gotta stare (Gotta stare), I mean, wow
And I'm wowed, no one compares (No one compares)
A one-on-one (One-on-one), you must've won (Must've won)
Every pageant in America when you was young
You might also like
Lips, hips, hair drip down her back (Crazy)
Body frame (Crazy), insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me stop—

She look better than Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO, fly away

So, let's go, go, go, go
Let's go, go, go, go
Let's go, go, go, go
Let's go, let's go

Uh, so, now we on (Now we on), so, now we goin' (Now we goin')
Livin' in the city of the unknown (Unknown)
I show her off (Show me off), I stunt with her (Stunt with me)
We do it sweet (Do it sweet), they look bitter (Mm)
Look at her get up (Look at my get up), I hear 'em say (What they say?)
"But why him?" ("Why him?") I hear 'em hate (Hear them hate)
I laugh at it, rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
'Cause I'm addicted (You addicted), and you the drug (Drug)
Cold turkey? (No way) No, sir (Mm-mm)
You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above
You definitely know, probably, I gotta give it up
Lips, hips, hair drip down her back (Crazy)
Body frame (Crazy), insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me stop—

She look better than Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO, fly away

So, let's go, go, go, go
Let's go, go, go, go
Let's go, go, go, go
Let's go, let's go

You somethin' different, I'm glad I found you
So pretty, I'll never do anythin' to hurt you21Embed
