12 ContributorsHot (The W) Lyrics
Zaytoven!
Let's get it

The block (hot), my kicks (hot)
This whip (hot), my bitch (hot)
The trap (hot), the pot (hot)
I hit the jack (pot), had to pull a cash out

I'm smoking cheese, I'm rocking bling
There ain't shit, that what it be
LV on my feet, and on my teeth
Open up the pack, and let it reek
This is checkered field T, it's not Burberry
We ain't scared of po-po, word to Tyler Perry
We in dem foreigns back to back, now we on a journey
After my Miranda rights, I need my attorney
Wifebeater like it's hot, but it's really really not
All this well earned ice, that I really really rock
All these damn designer clothes that I really really cop
Niggas pray really really that I really really flop
Gas in the car, I don't ever let it up
Got a foreign out the cut, it was time to rev it up
All green Valentino looking like some 7-Up
I wipe my ass with a hundred, fuck around and tear it up (catch up)
Get that backwards redrum
You wanna smoke, here we come
Loaded with them drums
They go brr-rum-dum-bum-bum
Got the big rubber bands
Feeling like the man
Your bitch can get ran
In the club with some bands
I do what I gotta do, move what I gotta move
Just to get the fucking loot, bitch ain't in my room
All this water, I need a swimming suit, counting up revenue
I just met this bitch but I put fuck her in my schedule
Bitches on my testicles, cruisin down Melrose
Fly by and choo-choo like I'm on a railroad
Baby got an ass on her, damn she shaped like J-Lo
And she got that good grizzle, you a lucky fellow
Yeah, I had to pipe her, cash excite her
Cash get a bitch wet, put her in a dryer
I don't even want her, put her in a fire
She said she dig my jeans, she say she dig my fibre
Run 'em niggas over, put 'em in a tire
Dope got my stove stuffed you can call me Skylar
I just make deposits, you can call me Swiper
I'm in the trackhoe, you're in a viper
(smoking satellites) Amen
(and we wilin) saying
(niggas out here) playing
(we got a strip club) rainingYou might also like1Embed
