29 ContributorsMorris Brown Lyrics
Whether you like it or not, he's back
D-A-double-D-Y Fatt Saxx
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Sharp as a tack like I just left church (Clean)
Bark then attack when the shit won't work (Mean)
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
And everybody wanna know whats really goin' on
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs?
So on and so on
I can go o-on and o-on
And on, and on, and on
Hell yes!

Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (Where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (Ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'
So baby, please believe me
Don't you go (Don't you go)
Baby, no, no, no (Baby, no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

Two dope boyz in the Cadillac, still
'Kast wear the crown on ya Cadillac Seville
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)
Like your DJ got killed
The fire marsh-
Fire marshall (Shut her down; time to go!)
OutKast royalty by design of logo
Wanna count it out loud?
93, 94, 95, 96
Plus a dime, still that fire
Hot like the perm on the back of your neck
Left it in too long, now ya got Cabbage Patch silky
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Bendin' corners like a crowbar, oh so unique
Got the pedal to the floor, but the 4-door just creeps
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Exotic, melodic melodies, yep, we got it
Funkin' for the funk of it and everybody want it
(Roof!) You make a nigga put a dog on it
(Roof!) You make a nigga put a dog on it
Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (Where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (Ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'
So baby, please believe me
Don't you go (Don't you go)
Baby, no, no, no (Baby, no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

I'm tippin' my hat off to ya baby
'Cause you're so fine, blow my mind
I put in the time
Everybody knows you can't let a pretty one pass you by
Without sayin' 'Hi'
I'm so gone over you
And yes, it's true
Baby, do what you do
My nose is open so wide (So wide, yeah)
Lookin' at you such a pretty sight (So wide, yeah)
My heart is on my sleeve (My sleeve, yeah)
And this is how it sounds to me (This is how it sounds)
Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (Where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (Ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'
So baby, please believe me
Don't you go (Don't you go)
Baby, no, no, no (Baby, no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

Baby, you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
We bringin' the church back to their feet
So wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Baby, you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
We bringin' the church back to their feet
So wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby3Embed
