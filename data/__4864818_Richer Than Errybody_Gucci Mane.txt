Ha

One brick, he think he richer than errybody
Two bricks, he think he richer than errybody
Four bricks, he think he richer than errybody
Fresh out, he thinkin' 'bout robbin' errybody
Fresh out, he thinkin' 'bout robbin' errybody
Gucci's a murderer, he got dead bodies
Certified, he cook way better than errybody
He traumatized, he done seen too many dead bodiesI ain't lovin' 'cause these bitches fuckin' errybody
I drop my top, I do the dance, I'm stuntin' on errybody

Drive the McLaren, I'm bendin' corners (Skrrt)
I ride through the six with that burner on me
I'ma get that lil' bitch and that's if I want her
I'ma nut in that ho like a sperm donor
Sellin' drugs, got the feds on us
Brand new XD with the beam on it
I'm lacin' my blunt with that lean on it
Sippin' dirty, if it's clean, then I'on want it
My pockets filled with them dead bodies
YoungBoy thinkin' he richer than everybody
Nigga, play with my shit, I'ma red-dot him
That nigga start snitchin', the feds got him
Got a eight of that Act' in the baby bottle
Got a hundred round clip on the wooden chopper
He got him a brick and he started wildin'
He say he cook better than errybody
I'ma stay with the stick 'cause I know they watchin'
I'm droppin' a bag on errybody
Got a bitch from the 8 wit' a wide body
I think that she fuckin' on everybody
'Til the day that I die, I'ma take narcotics
Bitch, I'm catchin' a cell on a Palm Pilot
Got these diamonds all over my fuckin' body
Like he fuckin' with me? I'ma see about it

Fresh out, he thinkin' 'bout robbin' errybody
Gucci's a murderer, he got dead bodies (Gucci)
Certified, he cook way better than errybody
He traumatized, he done seen too many dead bodies
I ain't lovin' 'cause these bitches fuckin' errybody
I drop my top, I do the dance, I'm stuntin' on errybody

I'm from the Zone 6, so I seen a lotta dead bodies
They drain Brook Lake and they brought out all them dead bodies
I got so rich, them haters got a lot to say about it (Huh?)
These boys so broke, they need to go to church and pray about it (Damn)
I bring that dope to Birmingham and then call it Gucci county (Skrr, skrr)
They put some money on my head 'but they couldn't make the bounty
I was so fucking underground, don't even know how they find me
Feel like Obama when I move 'cause I keep soldiers 'round me
I'm not in the NBA but I be ballin' on bitches (Ballin')
Gotta carry credit cards, my cash too big for my britches
Yeah, I came up out the trenches, I don't fuck wit' no snitches (Yeah)
Niggas stay trippin' 'til some of they friends come up missin' (Guwop)
You ain't never put out on a nigga, then lil' nigga, shut up (Bitch)
I just rocked a sold-out show, I performed for a hour and didn't put my gun up (Let's go)
If a lil' nigga try me and send out a gun down, that nigga won't live to see sun up (Uh uh)
Fuck your bitch and I tip her a hundred (Yeah, yeah)
I show you how to muhfuckin' come up
If you add up my watch and my wrist and my fist, before taxes, I spent a whole hundred (A hundred)
You can go and ask Johnny, he love it, every time he see me, he see money
I pulled up BET with my kids and my baby mama, they like, "Ooh, he be thuggin'"
No, I'm just a real nigga with money
I keep one in the head of that bitch like a bundle
I'm too rich so I just had to switch up my number
You play and it's gon' be a murder like YB
I draw out, you see blood like it's YG (Yeah)
I done told every nigga to try me (Yeah)
Some people compare me to Gucci, I drop some new music and caught me a body
And I don't like hangin' with bitch ass niggas, you gotta be a dawg to sit beside me
My boy got

One brick, he think he richer than errybody  (My dog got)
Two bricks, he think he richer than errybody (That nigga got)
Four bricks, he think he richer than errybody
Fresh out, he thinkin' 'bout robbin' errybody
Fresh out, he thinkin' 'bout robbin' errybody
Gucci's a murderer, he got dead bodies
Certified, he cook way better than errybody
He traumatized, he done seen too many dead bodies
I ain't lovin' 'cause these bitches fuckin' errybody
I drop my top, I do the dance, I'm stuntin' on errybody (Errybody)7Embed
