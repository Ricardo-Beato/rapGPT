4 ContributorsPowder Lyrics
:]
It's like this 28 was meant to be
I'm doing something mean to it
Doing better then any nigga you ever seen do it haten from the fuck niggas
Got a nice ring to it I guess every real nigga needs his theme music

No one man should have all this powder
The watch iced out I can't count the hours
Y'all trippin and killing off the powder
Until then fuck them the worlds ours

Daydreamed of bein king pined
You niggas gone king me cause I'm the king then I'm at the kitchen table
Chillin bitches like a crone you bust them bitches wide open sell'em by the
Zone(yeaa)
From beginning to end motherfucka rewind, motherfucka we grind, motherfucka
We grind, and other than that motherfuka we shine

No one man should have all this powder
The watch iced out I can't count the hours
Y'all trippin and killing off the powder
Until then fuck them the worlds ours

Motherfucka where my money he only got half boy on this pussy ass nigga
Know I'm gone spazz let them rocwilders eat'em like some spare ribs I bet
The choppers redecorate his whole crib man, fuck niggas man I second that
Emotion streets so got damn dry they need lotion niggas droppin 4 it ain't
Commin back half of that somebody tell me what's the motherfuckin math in
That. Niggas talkin 15 for a whole half you tell them motherfukas they can
Kiss my whole ass ya'll talkin 30 for a what? You niggas got jokes you try
To set a nigga fuck around and get smoked

No one man should have all this powder
The watch iced out I can't count the hours
Ya'll trippin and killing off the powder
Until then fuck them the worlds ours
