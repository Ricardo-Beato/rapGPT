21 ContributorsPeople Talkin’ Lyrics
Its like finding feathers on a housecat
Lemme take yall somewhere else right now
It's like searching for a needle in a haystack
Lemme get y'all to zone out wit' me, man
(Its a'ight, don't be scared)
Take y'all niggas left and center (zone out wit')
Bullshit

I hear the people talk (I hear y'all)
Whistling when you walk (Y'all hear me)
Your kind is hard to find
Darling, I'm glad you're mine
I hear the people talk (I hear y'all)
Whistling when you walk (Y'all hear me)
Your kind is hard to find
Darling, I'm glad you're mine

Y'all niggas should twist up sumthin
Real real real tight right here
Zone out wit' ya boy
If you don't smoke, grab you something to drink
Mix it up right
If you don't smoke or drink
Man, just light up an inscense
Fuck it
Close ya eyes... Vibe wit' a nigga
I want y'all to really hear me
You might also like
I speak through music, I reach you dudes
We can get deeper in the dirt than cleat shoes
I refuse to lose
I peep you creeps three months in advance
I see right through ya, judas
The man that I am and damn you don't know
The harder you go at me the harder I flow
Let's do this
I'm just a mirror reflectin' your image
The minute you switch up your face I pick up the pace
There's nothin' to it
Pull hammers from my waist
We can clap at this amateur pace
If that's what's crackin'
Or we can play this on "All Madden"
Can you even fathom not havin' a fear in the world
I'm cool in my afterlife
If I'm readin' these chapters right
Please what have you, I breeze through Matthews
Bleed if I have to, you cowards die a thousand deaths
Fake fucks face-down on your housing steps
Are y'all even gettin' this message?
I ain't bein' aggressive
But if you testin' my life then, shit, I gotta answer
Gotta cut off the cancer, young'n, pull your pants up
You gettin' too big for ya britches
You fuckin' wit' a dude that did it wit' digits
Breathing's a privilege
Don't you know when you're defeated?
Won't you though? Throw in the towel
I'm better with vowels
I'm a man of principles; damn-near invincible
In my own mind now that my soul's aligned
I didn't know before now my role's defined:
Take hold and control what's mine
Come and get me!
Come and take my life, you comin' wit me
Come and try to take me for granted
I'll take you off this planet
Dammit, man this is the gift from God
This ain't happenstance
And your arms are too short to box
Plus we knuckle up unorthodox
You can't take me off my grind, get off my cock
Whatchu thought? It's the Roc
I hear the—
I hear the—
I hear the—
Back in the mix of the scuffle
Since '86 I was sick with the hustle (Woo!)
Get a couple of chicks to touch you (Woo!)
Feather-weight fucker dont ever hate on the brothers
Heh-heh
Thought I was playin' but you niggas'll stop now
I ain't gotta sell another record in my life
The Blueprint 2, baby! (Mm-hmm)
See y'all in November (Oh shit!)
I hear the people talk (C'mon)
Yes sir and when you walk (C'mon)
Your kind is hard to find
Darling, I'm—Embed
