Uh, as the king and the queens gather the cheese
No fees, you count the bodies
Jeez, runnin' the streets
Told all my opps, "All my life, it's been troublesome things"
We can go faster, chapters, won't hold back
Niggas see where we at
All of my shooters, my goonies a team
Some shit always seem, I'm ready for action (Yeah)

Get some relief (Hey), spark up the leaf
Call up my niggas, we live out our dreams, hey
God got his hands on me, believe
Rumors are cheap (Hey, hey), do it for V
All of them days that I couldn't eat
Brodie keep watchin', I know that I'll reach, reach, reach (Reach)
When the Vamps get on the scene
When I whip the X I'm on a winning streak
Steppin' next, you've never seen
