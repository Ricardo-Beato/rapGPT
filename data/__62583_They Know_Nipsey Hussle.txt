18 ContributorsThey Know Lyrics
Can't stop this money marathon but they gon' try regardless
When you go as hard as Hussle they gonna pay you homage
Add my jewelry up, 100,000 dollars
Plus I got the pink slips to that foreign shit that I be drivin'
Built my road to riches off of lack of options
Out the trunk of my blue Cutlass with my back to Slauson
Now my car's fresh off the lot and hoes got low mileage
Flying out, getting paid 10 thousand a show, I'm in
2A with my seat back and my window up
Thinking 'bout the funny niggas that done switched it up
We made some plans, most of 'em stuck
So tell me one good reason I should give a fuck

They know, still cleaning up on the road
Living fast and sip slow
Spending cash to get mo'
They know, keep a gun everywhere I go
Riding round getting dough
Living fast and sip slow
They know, still cleaning up on the road
Living fast and sip slow
Keep a gun everywhere I go
They know, still ride around getting dough
Livin fast and sip slow
Keep a gun everywhere I go, they know, they know

Tattoos on my face, tattoos on my neck
Pistols in my stash, one button make those eject
Niggas hate, no effect
Can’t get close enough to touch so hoes throw me sex
Posted, Don't sleep 'cause I won't slip
Won’t lose 'cause I won’t quit
Life is hard, yeah no shit
But I’m a real nigga so I don't bitch
That go for my whole clique
Self made, I don’t owe shit
Only ride to my own shit
I’m so fly, I’m on shit
I mean so fly I don’t know shit
My offence ain't got no kicks
I don’t touch guns, they got no prints
And I’m so fly, I got no tints
Riding round without no rims
Why? 'Cause I did that and like '06 but they know this

They know, still cleaning up on the road
Living fast and sip slow
Spending cash to get mo'
They know, keep a gun everywhere I go
Riding round getting dough
Living fast and sip slow
They know, still cleaning up on the road
Living fast and sip slow
Keep a gun everywhere I go
They know, still ride around getting dough
Livin fast and sip slow
Keep a gun everywhere I go, they know, they know
Yeah, that’s right, that’s right
Nigga don’t grind, nigga don’t eat
That’s life, that’s life
Yeah, see I was on the road but I’m back right
TMC, this that, right?
New shows booked and new tracks right
Yeah, every nigga out here act like
But just a few of us live that life
You know first class and got racks, right?
Yeah, and we just sticking to the facts, right?
Rich before rap, got crack right
Lost everything then got back right
Yeah, so let’s sip slow to this fast life
We gon' do the same thing today that we passed out from last night
But it’s cool 'cause my stacks right
If I’m in the club then it's packed tight
People lie but my stats right and in my last life I was a flash light
Nah, I’m just sayin' though I'm that bright
Don't even make sense like a black light
How I came put the city on my back, no nigga cosign
Guess I’m just that tight
But it’s a marathon, run a lap life
My young nigga Hoggy got that flight
And niggas ain’t tryna fight Fatz, right?
And Blacc Sam got the MAC, right?
They know, still cleaning up on the road
Living fast and sip slow
Spending cash to get mo'
They know, keep a gun everywhere I go
Riding round getting dough
Living fast and sip slow
They know, still cleaning up on the road
Living fast and sip slow
Keep a gun everywhere I go
They know, still ride around getting dough
Livin fast and sip slow
Keep a gun everywhere I go, they know, they knowEmbed
