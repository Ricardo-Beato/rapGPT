7 ContributorsPoppin’ Lyrics
Let me take it to the flow that made me motherfuckin' famous
Back when me and Shawty Redd was in the basement makin' bangers
I like ridin' with that forty, I live motherfuckin' dangerous
How you poppin' with a mothafuckin' section full of strangers?
How you poppin'?
How you poppin'?
How you poppin'?

You ain't motherfuckin' poppin', got these motherfuckers fooled
Probably slippin' in this motherfucker now without your tool
Man, these niggas hustlin' backwards make no motherfuckin' sense
Got twenty chains on, still payin' fuckin' rent
Mr. Impossible, Tom Cruise when I stunt
Bitch, my motherfuckin' bills 'bout a quarter-mil' a month
T-t-t-tryna count another M, nigga, roll another blunt
Just like Usher, "My Way," I do exactly what I want
How you poppin'?

Let me take it to the flow that made me mothafuckin' famous
Back when me and Shawty Redd was in the basement makin' bangers
I like ridin' with that forty, I live motherfuckin' dangerous
How you poppin' with a mothafuckin' section full of strangers?
How you poppin'?
How you poppin'?
How you poppin'?

Ain't no arguin' with these niggas, ain't no goin' back and forth
They know this plain-Jane Dweller motherfucker cost a Porsche
Said they seen me on the cover of the motherfuckin' Source
Yeah, I swear this too dope, came with a motherfuckin' horse
Yeah, I'm straight up 'bout that dirty, lil' raspy when I speak
Damn right, she my type, yeah, a classy little freak
Stand up, bend it, let it ride, yeah, I grab them little cheeks
Baby like a waterslide, yeah, she damage them sheets
How you poppin'?

Let me take it to the flow that made me mothafuckin' famous
Back when me and Shawty Redd was in the basement makin' bangers
I like ridin' with that forty, I live motherfuckin' dangerous
How you poppin' with a mothafuckin' section full of strangers?
How you poppin'?
How you poppin'?
How you poppin'?

How you poppin'?
How you poppin'?1Embed
