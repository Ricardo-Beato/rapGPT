7 ContributorsSoul Food (Commentary Version) LyricsSo, next song is "Soul Food," so how this verse came about almost two years ago, when I wrote this record, the first half, I was- um, on tour, and I remember it being in the front of the tour bus and just looking at the open desert and just kind of writing this rap. Uh, Kebu from Atlanta originally did the first rendition of this song, um, with the sample that we later replayed, um, that's when I brought in DJ Khalil... and it was kind of just the fun, braggadocios-ness of hip-hop, yet really beginning to tell my story as well - Just in the flow, the cadence, kinda just showing off skill, um, but still telling that story and painting the picture of where the album conceptually was headed
Then, on the second half, uh, that's where, you know you really get into, uh, just the mental state of a hungry emcee, you know, releasing his first album. So for me, um, this song is just damn near six minutes of hip hop, you know, the emcee - Who I am, and how I want to be perceived.... As an artistYou might also likeEmbed
