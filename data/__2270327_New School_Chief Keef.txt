26 ContributorsNew School Lyrics
Do right, ayy
Do right
Do right, ayy
Do right
Bang, ayy
Bang, bang

I fuck the bitch she doin' right
Bad boy, rude boy
Heavy money in my pants, boy, your money too light
One plus one equals two, yeah, you're right
Bitches come through and fuck me like it's It’s two of I
Keep it cool, boy, you boy, one boy, two boy
One hundred-thousand dollar car, I can get two for it
Pull up onside of you laughing, I'ma jerk new boys
I fuck with all the old school rappers, I'm a new school boy

I'm smoking dope, you smoking on the fu, boy
I'm riding fours, rims look like four lil boys
I’m smoking Os, I smoke out the Ps too, boy
I’m sweating like I got a fever, jewelry be the flu, boy
You should know, we don't fuck with new boys
I treat these niggas like the bottom of my shoes, boy
I want a boat but I bought a coupe, boy
And bought a four, so when I get tired of two, boy
I switch it over, hop up in my four door
I’m going dumb, more money I get bored more
Since I'm the captain of the ship, I tell your ho to board
Ayy bitch, I'm the score, you better not be boring
You might also like
I fuck the bitch she doin' right
Bad boy, rude boy
Heavy money in my pants, boy, your money too light
One plus one equals two, yeah, you're right
Bitches come through and fuck me like it's It’s two of I
Keep it cool, boy, you boy, one boy, two boy
One hundred-thousand dollar car, I can get two for it
Pull up onside of you laughing, I'ma jerk new boys
I fuck with all the old school rappers, I'm a new school boy

She better top me right, she just got off two flights tonight
She want the pipe, but I heard that cool bite, I'm cool Ike
What you worried bout? Nike, just do it right
Bitch, I Glo, chandelier, Christmas lights, pool lights
I be flexin' so damn hard, I think I need two mics
I be doin' so damn much, I think I need two lives
Remember having fight nights, now I'm having food nights
I eat all the food, fuck a fool house, it's fool nights
Remember having pistol fights, now I'm having food fights
Now we having rack fights, now we having jewel fights
Now we having pool fights, you know mine better than yours right?
No need for no mansion fights 'cause I got my own, aight?

I fuck the bitch she doin' right
Bad boy, rude boy
Heavy money in my pants, boy, your money too light
One plus one equals two, yeah, you're right
Bitches come through and fuck me like it's It’s two of I
Keep it cool, boy, you boy, one boy, two boy
One hundred-thousand dollar car, I can get two for it
Pull up onside of you laughing, I'ma jerk new boys
I fuck with all the old school rappers, I'm a new school boy4Embed
