71 ContributorsHi-Definition Lyrics
Gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(You street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition)
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition)

And my return (yeah!) is more like a re-up
I hold a whole like a tea-cup
World in one hand, while the other hand throw the peace up
My other hand throwing "We" without the e up (Westside)
I got like five more, man, I'm something like Shiva
In that Fall of Rome Number Four Deluxe
See, I've been around the world like the gnome
But I come from a zone where the homes are beat up
The folks, unknowns, and the stones all meet up
Police tap my phone, got my songs on speaker
Say he spat the poems, got their domes all geeked up
To get up on they thrones and become young leaders
Oprah put it on my culture, now, if that ain't wrong
Imus got it from the rhymers, now, if that ain't blown
They gave my man forty-four, now, if that ain't long
I put it all on my shoulders, now, if that ain't strong
I made it out alive from the streets of the west side C-H-I
Now, if that ain't home, you better tell 'em
You might also like
Gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(You street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition)
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition)

And in my flyness, I've become the hero and the sidekick
The rider and the nigga that'll ride with
In your ear like the maker of the "Vivrant"
Assalamu Alaikum to the maker of the "Vivrant"
Them other niggas I don't vibe with
Now I was 'bout three when the eyes went
But I could see everything that you trying to be
You can't hide it
While you coming out your throat like a Heimlich
I came up out the belly like an Hype script
Only my circumstance revised it
Hijacked the role and went and shot the pilot
I'm trying to go public so I can get to private
Then send Busy to go and get the pirates
Then hit Africa, try to fix the virus
Go back to the hood, tell Huggy, "Open the hydrants"
R.I.P Stack B., I'ma keep you alive, kid
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful
F-N-F and S-N double O-P
Gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(You street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition)
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition)

Lupey it's Snoopy, let's go wild
Tiptoe through the door, do it doggystyle
And tell all my chicks in Chi-i-cago
Lupey hit the Lotto, Snoopy hit the bottle
Dolemite tight, they bite, they might follow
Take this chill pill, lil nigga swallow
Recital is very homicidal
The big screen will capture it, 'cause it's high-definition
Listen, cooking collard greens in the kitchen
Them alphabet boys on a mission
If you ever get cash, you better get it quick fast
'Cause nowadays, niggas get to snitchin on yo' bitch ass
Even your boys best believe in them toys, out your game
Specially when a nigga know your real name
Blam blam with the blammer
Smile nephew, you on candid camera, film at eleven
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful
F-N-F and S-N double O-P
Gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(You street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition)
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition)2Embed
