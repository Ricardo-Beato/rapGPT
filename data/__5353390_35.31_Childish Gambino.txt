Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo

Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
Bustin' out bales, I've been bustin' all day
Bustin' out bales, we were sellin' that hay
We been movin' that snow, I was ridin' that sleigh
Double cup C's, had to put them in the safe
Got the semi on deck, .45, AK
Servin' up fiend, I remember that J
Brought his daughter to the house, I was cryin' all day
L's rolled up and I'm packin' that heat
12 roll up and I'm slappin' them feet
He was only sixteen, he was lookin' at three
Now he lookin' at nine, pray to God he don't speak
Water drip rich, so we gave 'em that leak
Bales got my baby mama nails on fleek
I was seven years old, daddy thrown in the clink
Said, "Life ain't fair, everybody gon' cheat"

Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo

Chicken coupe, chicken soup, I got the wave
Move so smooth like butter, like shea
Crime don't pay, I ain't heard what they say
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, ayy (Ayy)
Cotton ball white like hen house floors
Could've been broke, this the life I chose
They was in school, I was stirrin' that pot
Daddy couldn't come home, I was takin' that spot
Life move fast, like a movie, so quick
Dark-skinned beauty got a booty so thick
She a down-home chick, she'll hit that lick
Had to drop my old girl 'cause she think that she slick
I ain't seen him in a minute, so I think he might flip
Had to hit him with the stick, man you niggas ain't, woo
If I couldn't move bricks, I don't know what I'd do
I ain't worried 'bout mine, you can worry 'bout you
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo (One, two, one, two, three, go)
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way (Hey)
I'ma show y'all how to move this yay (Hey)
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo
Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way (Hey)
I'ma show y'all how to move this way (Hey)
I'ma show y'all how to move like this
I'ma show y'all that a move ain't, woo

Little Foot, Big Foot, get out the way
