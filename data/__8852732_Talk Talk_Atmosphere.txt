6 ContributorsTalk Talk Lyrics
I can see we're thinking about the same things
I see your expression when the phone rings
We know there's something happening here
No sense in dancing 'round the subject
Wounds worse when it's treated with neglect
Don't turn now, there's nothing here to fear

You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
Set your secrets free

Silk degrees we're dancing in the same vein
Loose lies and fully entertained
I always knew we would wind up here
All these calls are making my eyes tear
Suddenly last summer is so clear
They always will tell you what you want to hear

You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
Set your secrets free
You might also like
You look like a shiny star
Trapped in a tiny jar
Ain't nobody got the time for scars
Looking at that mirror behind the bar
I respect your reflections
Aside from a few exceptions
Notice the majority authority
Be stepping into traffic with bad directions
I don't wanna sound like another typical escapist
But I won't protest if you wanna deviate away from the basics
If you think it'll help, we can celebrate your pain and your patience
They said Hell is made out of self-deprecation
Dressed up head to toe but never felt so naked
So fortunate there ain't nothing to forfeit
And a torch gotta light it's own course, I guess
Nobody ever told you about the vultures and the hornet's nest
I know you wanna move forwards
But you feel like an ornament
And everyone acts so supportive
The distortion sounds disproportionate
Talk to me
You can talk to me
Set your secrets freeEmbed
