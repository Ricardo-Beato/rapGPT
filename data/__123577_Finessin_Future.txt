One thing about me, I know how to get it out the mud nigga
Fly shit only
Rags to riches
I ain't looking back
Yeah, F.B.G
We global now nigga
Paying dues

Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we came up from nothin'
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we went from rags to riches

Whipping up that Frank Lucas, cooking up that Young Poochie
Beamer coup with a clear view, got 'Rari with the clear view
Trapped out, I'm on CNN, spaceship I done went to Mars
Gotta model bitch who can take the dick, got a gutter bitch who can take a charge
Went to Paris on a weekday, and I'm coming back in a couple months
Everyday I wake up, I'm drinking lean, I'm smoking blunts
Dropped out of my high school, then I went and copped me a drop top
Got residue on my dreadlocks, my whole style unorthodox
Trading in my hand scale, started selling them big bells
30 bricks by 30 bricks, I could sell a nigga some oatmeal
Sell a nigga some horse feed, cashing out for a hundred pounds
Sell a nigga some A-1, I'll cook it up for you right now

Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we came up from nothin'
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we went from rags to riches

Credit card my swipe game, I strike off like lightning
Fuck with me, my lick game, I'm hitting licks excite me
I'm taking off like MJ, my check game like Nike
Anytime I get that cash, that cash make me hyphy
I'm jumping off my products, stacking up my dollars
I stay chasing that guala, ain't no turning up my collar
Represent my city, nigga want game gotta pay pesos
That pink inside my Styrofoam, got yellow bones on my iPhone
Running up like a treadmill, conversation gotta pay bills
Everything I wear nigga is Ferragamo in public
High top Margiela's, thousand dollars for a sweater
Money talk no pressure, everything disrespectful

Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we came up from nothin'
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we went from rags to riches5Embed
