One for the paper, two for the money
Girls get money...

I don't know what's going on, baby?
What the hell is going wrong, baby?
Used to take me to dinner, used to take me shopping
Now you're asking me for my paper
It's my money, boy my money
I bet you'll never ever get another dime from me
No you can't use the phone, baby
I think you need to get your own
Was looking for a man to hold me down
So how did I end up with you? (yeah, with you)
And as hard as I try
Sometimes is getting hard, paying all these bills
The note on my car, so I don't need no broke broke boy, trying to holler
So baby shut it up till you show me the dollars

One for the paper, two for the money
Brand new bag, new shoes, yeah, I want it
All my girls fly, girls getting money
All my girls fly, girls getting money
One for the paper, two for the money
Nails did, hair did yep, yep I want it
One for the paper, two for the money
All my girls fly, girls getting money
You might also like
Nope I ain't checking for you broke ass niggas (Uhn-uhn)
Kim only checking for the dope boy niggas (Bet!)
No, no, no, I'm not a gold, gold digger
I'm just trying to say I got my own dough, nigga
6'2" spans, you know the grown folks nigga
Niggas like Scott, they got they own boat nigga
No middle man, have your own coke nigga
Title to the dopes no car, no nigga
Can't pay my rent with your compliments
And I don't need a man with no accomplishments
No whip, no job, no credit
Me and you is like Alzheimers, forget it!
If you was my sugar, I'd be diabetic
Your game like a old book, I already read it
It's money on my mind boy and you just headache
I need a man with the full package like fed ex
Kim lil' bitches, Mafia, La Bella
Money old like champagne in the cellar
Boy you need to split like a cigerella
You ain't treating me like an ATM teller
So fuck your little cheese, I got my own chedder
So when they make it rain I open up my umbrella
Dior glass slippers, call me Cinderella
Your bank account like these new artists, undeveloped
One for the paper, two for the money
Brand new bag, new shoes, yeah, I want it
All my girls fly, girls getting money
All my girls fly, girls getting money
One for the paper, two for the money
Nails did, hair did yep, yep I want it
One for the paper, two for the money
All my girls fly, girls getting moneyEmbed
