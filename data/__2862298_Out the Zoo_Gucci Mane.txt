20 ContributorsOut the Zoo Lyrics
Listen to this track bitch
Woah, Wop
Hah, Wop
Woah, sheesh
Burr, toy
Skrrt, Wizop

I take the good with the bad, and the bad with the good
The plug sent the goods, so I had to flood the hood
The plug sent the bag, then I offed that too
That made me a bigger asset to the plug
But tell me how you feel when your plug tell on ya
Your partner in crime, own thugs tell on ya
Talking 20 years, 30 years, 50 years
In the cell feeling drunk like you drunk 80 beers
Homicide though, genocide when I ride
When we die, only God know where the bullets fly
In my Hummer truck, bullets coming through my car door
I got contract killers staying at my condo
Got a hole up your folk cause they sure ain't bluffin'
Gotta vest up cause I sure ain't ducking
Standing in the cold on the corner, Flat Shoals
Sold his soul to the devil for a Mac-11
100 bricks of pure coke, white like heaven
My Mexican, Catholic connect doing confession
Sitting in the pen, son just turned seven
I progress then regress and this shit is getting depressing
But I count my stash 'fore I count my blessings
And I load my weapon 'fore I eat my breakfast
The skreets keep talking and the snitches keep telling
Your whole life can change in a motherfucking second
You might also like
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo
They playing games with me when they know that I'm a fool
Set it off like Queen Latifah, give me the loot or I'ma shoot
You nincompoops so rude-a-poo, you tuti-fruit, you through
I'm an animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Gucci Mane La Flare, you prolly seen me on the news
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo

I might manic, I go in a panic, don't see nothing but red
Off my meds, I can't sleep cause I hear voices in my head
This lil devil on my left shoulder say "shoot him in the dreads"
While an angel on the right whisper "just shoot him in the leg"
I admit that I might need some help, I guess I made a step
Man they think I need a shrink cause I fear God but don't fear death
I'm so selfish, I bought 80 pints to drink 'em by myself
A swimming pool full of drank, I dive in like I'm Michael Phelps
Louis glasses, Ferragamo belt, I'm Gucci Mane XL
YSL with the new Gazelles that match my blue Chevelle
Bitches laughing like I'm Dave Chappelle cause I stay fresh as hell
Zone 6, Zone 6. You don't like it? Kill yourself

Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo
They playing games with me when they know that I'm a fool
Set it off like Queen Latifah, give me the loot or I'ma shoot
You nincompoops, so rude-a-poo, you tuti-fruit, you through
I'm an animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Gucci Mane La Flare, you prolly seen me on the news
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo2Embed
