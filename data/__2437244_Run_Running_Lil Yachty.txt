Oh
Lil Boat, yeah, oh (oh)
Yeah, oh

Young nigga just ran the sack up
Young nigga just ran the sack up
Young nigga just ran the sack up
Young nigga just ran the sack up
Young nigga just ran the sack up
Young nigga just ran the sack up
Run my sack up
Run my sack up, hey

I think I just raised the leverage
Purple codeine in my beverage
I'm from the 6, that's where I stay
Fuck with my gang, you gon' get slayed, woah
And I promise everything on me is good enough
He can't be NAZ 'cause that nigga not rich enough, woah
And I can see it in his eye that nigga is broke
I be laughing at his jokes, I be fucking on these hoes
I spent everything I have just to make it right back
A nigga never gon' be sad
You might also like
'Cause I ran my sack up
Ran my sack up
Just ran my sack up, woah
Oh

I'm making my way, I'm making my
Making my way, I'm making my
I don't even got no time
To waste money on these dimes
I'm making my way, I'm making my
Making my way, I'm making my
These niggas broke, they can't hang around me
They can't hang around me, unless they run they sack up

Run my sack up
Run my sack up, woah
Hey


We keep on running it up
We keep on running it up
Aye, aye, aye
We keep on running it up (keep on, keep, keep)
In this game, I'm running, yeah
These niggas keep running from us (running, running, running)
We keep on thumbing, yeah
'Cause we keep on running it up, oh
We keep on running it up
I can't even stress it enough
My pockets just ain't fat enough
They say, "Lil Boat, you changed"
They say, "Lil Boat, don't forget about your fam"
When you get to the fame, I need me 'bout three rings
Cause I'm just not flexing enough
And these niggas, they not hating enough
But trust and believe
I'm on my gang, I'm not sleep
I'ma take care of my brothers, woah, make sure that they eat
Niggas act like they don't see when you rise above them, woah (aye)
We gon' be alright (oh)
Oh, running it up11Embed
