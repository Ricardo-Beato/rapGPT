14 Contributors2 Way Street Lyrics
Well, I shot some deer, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere
Due to rap's wider ratio, satellites to Nato
Hillbilly drawers flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately, wife piece back in New York
And I'm starvin'
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scopin' Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie, I was extremely tempted
(To what, Rick?) To discharge in a sister
Next thing, in the dressin' room, "Pardon me, mister"
Yes, I said cautiously, "Crazy, but possibly you could sign
Your name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me"
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, "You can press down hard on it"
Now, my hand browsin' her South end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
(Rring!) Loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talkin' so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no tellin' what it might do to her
"I love you", forced to say, "I love you back, too" to her
Any thought of gettin' pussy was doomed too
"You got a wife?", anniversary comin' up soon, too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
"Don't get me wrong, it's not like you're not cute" (Uh-huh)
I'm wrong for mistreatin' her, the wantin' to skeetin' her
"I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya"
What an angel overcomin' his wrongness
The moral I am tryin' to get across in this song is
You might also like
If goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realize early, it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
If goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realize early, it's a 2 way street, kid

Casually seatin' with some thick chords eatin'
With my album playin' at a big board meetin'
"I love this!"
Being the coolest and the ruffest
A big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment
Poundin' was inevitable
She said to me, "Rick, I think your album is incredible"
The way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I
"You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye"
"Well, I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, comin' from a woman of your stature"
I mean, who could resist the Don head?
Start caressin' Rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats to set the emperor
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my weddin' band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, "I can't do this as much as I'd like to, miss"
An angel overcomin' his wrong, kids
The point that I am tryin' to get across in this song is
If goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realize early, it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
If goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realize early, it's a 2 way street, kid2Embed
