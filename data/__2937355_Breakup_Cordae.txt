15 ContributorsBreakup Lyrics
This for all my, uh, fellow people out there who, who just out there
(P. Soul on the track)
Yo-yo, yo-yo-yo-yo
Slow ride with it

I swear I hate you but I love you the same
You help ease all my troubles, help me go through the pain
And if it were not for you I'd be going insane
But for real you need to stay in your lane
I mean I love so much that I be eyeing you out
And when my lips touch yours I fly high in the clouds
And you always wake the neighbors, baby, you just too loud
But you always calm me down, that's why I keep around
But it's time for change where our paths will criss-cross
You made me fail that drug test, baby, I'm pissed off
Conservative big boss, you know my persona
Why you always on my sack, girl, that is a honor
I mean I'm gon' off the ganja, girl, your powers are magical
And the statement that I'm leavin' you is honestly laughable
The different view you show you me of the world is impractical
'Cause honestly exposure is a trait I'm attracted to
But change is needed and you know it's truth
Because that's the one thing that's more potent than you
Remember when we was alone and I would flow in the booth
The inspiration you gave, it made show and improve
And for that I'm so thankful, and you know that grateful
And if everyone tried you the world wouldn't be hateful
But you got your own faults, it ain't no lying at sin
You fuckin' up my community, kids try you at ten
Now let's try this again, second time we round the troops
Your impact is amazing, people die for a ounce of you
You even make 'em try a hashtag but I'm pounding you
But damn the way you the make us go crazy astounding boo
But always got benefits, you making my niggas rich
And quite a few go to jail for you so you splittin' it
Member days we'd be getting kicking it, we'd be watching the stars line
You even let start to sell you out through the hard times
Never let me go broke, I kept bread in my pocket
So I stop the using you and I used you profit
And for that I'm so sorry, was no reason for shopping you
I can't believe I pimped my main girl to a prostitute
But you make niggas rob and shoot and you ended a block or two
And you limit potential you make me wonder what I could do you make some grow addicted so it ain't no more stopping through
'Cause me in blowing in this rap shit is not optional
So girl we threw, I'm sorry I got to do this
And if I choose it you know my choice is the music
So I'm saying goodbye, you just apart of my old life
I knew for a couple years, knew rap for my whole life
So baby it's overYou might also like2Embed
