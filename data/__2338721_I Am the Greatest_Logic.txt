I am the greatest
(Someone with power, someone with power)
(Someone would dare)
(Someone with, someone with)
(Someone with, someone with power)
(I am the greatest!)
I am the greatest

Fuck 'em, I will never love 'em; I'm way up
Bitch, you know I been above 'em; I stay up
Steppin' to me tryna talk it out
Knowing goddamn well
There ain't a fucking thing to talk about
Hol' up, bring it back now
That ain't no way to react now
You was talking all that shit
But where it's at now, huh? Where it's at?

(I am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup; you get none
Like wassup, motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, from me, like wassup
(I am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
You, Hol' up, wassup; get none
Wassup, motherfuckers get no love, from me
You might also like
Okay now, what the fuck they talkin' 'bout?
It's like they never heard the words
That came up out my mouth
It’s like they just wanna discredit what I’m all about
I be in the studio, the motherfuckers fallin' out
Yeah, you know we balling out, peace and love
I represent all of the above
You fuck bitches and get money, that's wassup
It's all good, but all these people do not give a fuck
And now I bet they bitchin' cause my flow switchin'
Tryna tell me what to write, up on some fan-fiction
Can't they just be happy I no longer have to face eviction?
That I'm livin' out my life
I'm livin' out my inner vision right now
I be on my Big L braggadocios rap shit
I could flow on anything from Premo to that trap shit
Sellin' out shows, I'm on that shit
Late night, dark night; crowd going batshit

(I am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, wassup; you get none
Like wassup, motherfuckers get no love
Hol' up, from me, like wassup
(I am the greatest)
Motherfuckers get no love
You, Hol' up, wassup; get none
Wassup, motherfuckers get no love, from me
(I am the greatest)
From me
Like wassup, like wassup
(I am the greatest!)
