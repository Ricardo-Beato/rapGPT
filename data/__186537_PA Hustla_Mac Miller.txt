13 ContributorsPA Hustla Lyrics
Yeah
Haha
Haha

They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smokin' piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas, uh
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smokin' piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas, uh

Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon with no profit?
Broke as fuck, sittin' with an empty wallet (Haha)
One dude lemme come in, boy I got this
Everybody jumpin' around like it's a mosh pit
I drop that hot shit (Hot shit), you drop nonsense (Nonsense)
And my money long like the center for the Rockets (Yeah)
I get that chronic, that Cali weed, roll a swisher, pass to me
Smash a beat, work of art, masterpiece (Uh-huh)
Game on lock and key, nobody stoppin' me (Chyeah)
Got some haze and Patr√≥n, 'bout to pop a bean (Haha)
Now I'm rollin' like a sixteen-wheeler
And my money fat like its sixteenth meal, bruh
Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper, that's the game I'm after
Gettin' cheese like we play the Packers, cake and batter
So be careful 'fore you hook to the IV
I be chillin' in the P-to-the-I-T (Haha)
You might also like
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smokin' piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas, uh
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smokin' piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas, uh

My swag official like a referee (Yeah)
No one on the plane is stayin' fresh as me
Boy, I'm dressin' clean, denim jeans sittin' low on my waist
And haters get a cloud of smoke blown in they face
Uh, my fam beside me, fans behind me
Sorry, ma, but it's money over punani
I'm super fresh (Fresh), make your lady lose her breath (Breath)
It's hard not to take a Ralphie but I'll do my best (Haha)
Rock your head and do your step, move it to the left (Left)
Where you can find me posted up in my Gucci vest (Yeah)
Boy, I'm gettin' paid (Paid), then I'm gettin' laid (Haha)
Don't tell the hoes at the party that I'm in eleventh grade
Ain't nobody out there fresh my age and you best believe
That's why I got twenty honeys sittin' next to me (Haha)
Child celebrity, gotta be me
'Cause my swag stayin' clean like a washin' machine
Fuck y'all
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smokin' piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas, uh
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smokin' piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas, uhEmbed
