34 ContributorsGet Up Lyrics
It's 'bout to be big shit poppin' by the time this shit is droppin'
Stoppin' not a option, I'm addicted, it's a problem
This way of life, sex, drugs, rock and roll, on the road
Feelin' blessed, performin' for sold-out shows
You rappers talkin' shit, what you know 'bout those?
What you know 'bout spittin' bars and the whole crowd goes? (Yeah)
It's unbelievable, these people say I made it
Throwin' down a little Henny, can't believe that I don't chase it
Life goes on, days get brighter
I'm feelin' like I came in with my haze, no lighter
So I'm lookin' for the missin' piece
Goin' down in history for rippin' beats
Smooth game, sweeter than a Krispy Kreme
You tune into my station, hope you listening
Turn it up and follow on my journey as I live my dream
All-natural Whole Foods that lay you back
Have you straight chillin' in a dope mood
And some shit is happy like a show tune
This a brand new world, I can show you (Yeah)
Some people still have no clue
But they can look at all this cheese that I produce

In a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)
In a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)

Hey
Ayo, I'm fast lane switchin', rap game spittin'
Chillin' with some sour, got a bad dame twistin' (Yeah)
These people think I'm goofy, say I'm Max, they trippin'
'Cause life a comedy like my last name Griffin
Livin' for the moment, blowin' potent, overloaded
And my swagger, call me Old Spice
Yeah, the kid is so nice
Smokin' in the whip, chillin', duckin' from the po-lice
So bright, you no lights, I'm shinin' like a strobe light
Leave a show with money, and I always count my dough twice
Most Dope general, and that shit is fo' life
My mama taught me well, so I even treat these hoes right, I'm po-lite
Workin' in my office, but no Dwight
Coke-white skinded, no light dimness
Me, who I am, plain sight for these bitches (Yeah)
And I ain't even tryna fight with these bitches
I don't got time to spend a night with these bitches

In a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)
In a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)
YeahEmbed
