5 ContributorsLearn About Me Lyrics
In the VIP at the ceremony of masters
It's the OG Brown, the street broadcaster
Broadcasting live from the city of the motor
The  of record of corner-store reporter
Street law enforcer
Nigga drop dimes get hit with two quarters
And thats a 50 cal nigga
Had your ass smelling like a burnt TV dinner
Niggas study in the streets, learn your lesson
I done did more dirt, sold rocks like Epsom
I done turn more niggas like Salt Lake Edison
Side piped out nigga puffing on medicine
Ride seven mile with about seven thou'
Bout to meet up with Chip$ go out to bail out
Three bitches call them Destiny Child
I'm a grown ass dream birth Destiny Child
I'm OG y'all still need a car seat
The sound of the D I'm Detroit heartbeat
City under lock and key
Y'all niggas ain't street y'all don't want beef

I don't know you but you might know me
And if you don't know nigga, better learn about me
I'm known everywhere, niggas know about me
If you don't know nigga, better learn about me
You might also like
Danny Brown in the streets like a light pole
Whip same color as the lizard from Geico
Serving D since the days of damaging
South wind Detroit, serving yay to Spanish
Nigga, I'm straight from the block
Done Gator city life, I'm putting rappers in shock
Block hot like Cajun food and most niggas soft like baby food
I see you niggas study and move
But y'all niggas fake, can't do what I do
Nah, nigga it's crunch time
I do it for my niggas locked down with no sunshine
Keep gas in the jar with Swishers rolling up like ten in our car
Think I'm soft, motherfucker come test me
You copping used cars, bout to cop a jet-ski
Puffing toxics, higher than a cockpit
Been getting money since Hancock Rockit
Blaze in my pocket, eyes on the profit
Bout to take over, y'all niggas can't stop it
