7 ContributorsNever Had a Bad Day in My Life Lyrics
Yeah
Hahaha, ha
I be tryna tell these niggas, man
I just be tryna tell tell 'em
Haha
Yeah, uh-huh
Look, yeah

Rose gold AP with no ice
Swear to God, yeah, I bought that bitch twice
And my future lookin' bright, Ice Spice
Never had a bad day in my life
Could've did ten years in the pen
So every morning that I wake, it's a win
Big glass of rosé, no ice
Never had a bad day in my life

Tomorrow morning, bitch, I'm jumpin' on a jet
Big dog, yeah, I'm gon' need a vet
Need me there, then I'm gon' need a check
Fuck it up, yeah, it's gon' be a wreck
Rich nigga in some thousand dollar sweats
7/11, that's a thousand dollar bet
Baccarat, yeah, I'm smellin' like a bag
Big Ben, I'm in the back just like a cab
Turned my auntie back room into a lab
Turned two four ways into a half
Got my GED in jail and my favorite subject math
Ballin' like Nowitzki when he played for the Mavs
So fuck what you heard, I ain't stressin'
Everything about me is a blessin'
God with me every day, got protection
Type of nigga that's anointed while he flexin'
You might also like
Rose gold AP with no ice
Swear to God, yeah, I bought that bitch twice
And my future lookin' bright, Ice Spice
Never had a bad day in my life
Could've did ten years in the pen
So every morning that I wake, it's a win
Big glass of rosé, no ice
Never had a bad day in my life

Yeah, I tell 'em health is wealth, nigga
Ain't doin' what you're supposed to, blame yourself, nigga
Niggas don't want to help, help yourself, nigga
'Til you swimmin' in the money, Michael Phelps, nigga
Sky is the limit, nothin' less, nigga
Me, this pot and this fork, We The Best, nigga
Eight rooms, ten baths, yeah, I woke up with a smile
Shower fit ten, I'm just glad I use dial
Lawyer on retainer 'case we gotta go to trial
In my grandma kitchen like I work at Mr Chow's
Safe in the closet, hide it right next to the towels
Used to get 'em out in Texas, now the plug is Kevin Liles
Millionaire before I signed, nigga
If it's ever a debate, I got time, nigga
Know a few niggas owe me for some nines, nigga
If y'all ain't speakin' up, I need mine, nigga
Rose gold AP with no ice
Swear to God, yeah, I bought that bitch twice
And my future lookin' bright, Ice Spice
Never had a bad day in my life
Could've did ten years in the pen
So every morning that I wake, it's a win
Big glass of rosé, no ice
Never had a bad day in my lifeEmbed
