5 ContributorsStanding On Stage Lyrics
Ay you know when I stand on that stage
I really stand on that stage this my blood
Ok then

I'm standing on the stage look like a fucking bell
I'm standing on the stage looking like a Panamera
I'm standing on the stage looking like that fish scale
Who the fuck that on that stage nigga that all I play
I'm standing on that stage looking like a bloody male
I'm standing on that stage looking just like ysl
I'm standing on the stage looking like a Panamera
Who the fuck that on that stage nigga that all I play

Fish scale maserati ridin round in little bitty
Hundred city start with chicken in the hood pull up with it
We don't play around I come around we lay em down
I lay em down, a hundred pounds
I stuff em down and ride around with it
Fifteen thousand for the small d(s) ain't no crown
I got these mother fucking miles but i'm just shining like
Crown in it. I got petrol, I got birds full of 87
H2o on the pounds in the fucking hummer
Coca cola, that's the coke on yellow all butter
True blood y'all like nigga sup
You might also like
I'm standing on the stage look like a fucking bell
I'm standing on the stage looking like a Panamera
I'm standing on the stage looking like that fish scale
Who the fuck that on that stage nigga that all I play
I'm standing on that stage looking like a bloody male
I'm standing on that stage looking just like ysl
I'm standing on the stage looking like a Panamera
Who the fuck that on that stage nigga that all I play

King Sean!!
Ola Playa king Sean for you haters standing on stage looking like a
Hundred of them double 6. Some might come out premature
Water within my water with me or Bentley 
Looking like a thousand grams of that fish scale or a thousand
Pounds of that og but you better think about approaching me
Boy I never sell cheap and never did 90 but I catch that bitch
I might fuck the shit out Oprah Winfrey but we keep on smiling
But we  them like Kelly Rowland
Standing on the stage boy I feel important
But iâ€™m feeling like a thousand grams of Franklin
Thousand grams of  bitch on stage looking like Keyshia Cole

I'm standing on the stage look like a fucking bell
I'm standing on the stage looking like a Panamera
I'm standing on the stage looking like that fish scale
Who the fuck that on that stage nigga that all I play
I'm standing on that stage looking like a bloody male
I'm standing on that stage looking just like ysl
I'm standing on the stage looking like a Panamera
Who the fuck that on that stage nigga that all I playEmbed
