7 ContributorsProblem (Too Shiesty) Lyrics
(CashMoneyAP)
Hot sum'
Fuck nigga diss and neva pop nun'

I’ma hot sum', that's why these niggas tryna mop sum'
Pussy ass nigga, all that dissin' neva pop nun'
I wouldn’t let ‘em hold that glizzy If he neva shot nun'
Every nigga round me wit it and we all rock sum'
Slow down Montana, I let the window down and spray round
All my niggas know go to hitttin’ back to back right after my K sound
Lil' bitch I'm known for to get it poppin' and keep that four-pound
On yo’ front porch that .40 get to knockin and blow yo door down
It's four of us smokin' personal blunts with our own nine
Five of our own bullets gon bust yo dome yea that's on time
Get the burner on even them home alone bitch don't come inside
When I say it's up on nun but get it on cause bitch I'm bout mine
Puttin' cash on his brand new AP put money on mine
For gang sake no onе can save me, I watch the blood risе
This nigga diss me then I kill em', and make his pop cry
Tryna cross up times with the whole system, and gain a third eye

These niggas don't like me I'm so shiesty, I'm a fuckin' problem
These niggas be bitin' they just like me, that's a fuckin' problem
These niggas wanna fight me keep that pipe by me I up and pop em
This nigga deadly as the reaper they can't fuckin’ stop em
Shawty think I'm stupid as a fuck but she just wanna dollar
I ain't ran it up or gained yo trust to take away yo problem
She ain't got no love, but what the fuck I think nun wrong about it
I was thinkin' bout it from your point of view let's talk about it
I just wanna fuck, slidin' in them dooley trucks
Reachin’ for a drive, gettin' high, bitch we movin' up
Get euthanized from the skies tryna kill or duck
A hunnid rounds when we slidin' you can't run from us
You might also like
Diamonds shine put a brand new chain on me I won't take it off just hit ‘em right
For to leave a stain on em they gon stretch that boy at the light
Swear them people changed on em they all cut feel I can't make it right
I can't put the blame on em, I just reminisce through city lights
I just went spent fifty grand at Barney’s, bitch I’m rich as fuck
Drank head, bust pints all in the mornin’
Didn’t even pop a flat I’m leaning right
This bitch tell me if you want it, pay to buss yo fuckin’ shit tonight
This bitch keep actin like she want it, want this dick you gon get hit tonight

These niggas don't like me I'm so shiesty, I'm a fuckin' problem
These niggas be bitin' they just like me, that's a fuckin' problem
These niggas wanna fight me, keep that pipe by me I up and pop em
This nigga deadly as the reaper they can't fuckin’ stop em
Shawty think I'm stupid as a fuck but she just wanna dollar
I ain't ran it up or gained yo trust to take away yo problem
She ain't got no love, but what the fuck I think nun wrong about it
I was thinkin' bout it from your point of view let's talk about it
I just wanna fuck, slidin' in them dooley trucks
Reachin’ for a drive, gettin' high, bitch we movin' up
Get euthanized from the skies tryna kill or duck
A hunnid rounds when we slidin' you can't run from uss, oh, naw, nahEmbed
