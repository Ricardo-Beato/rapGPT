9 ContributorsU Kno It Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Nigga, the streets need me right now nigga
Trey, they need it right now nigga
They need some motherfucking trap or die shit nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah

(?) pocket, boy you know it
And I'm the trending topic, boy you know it
Got cameras at the spot, boy you know it
Drum on the Glock, boy you know it
That bitch ain't got no top, boy you know it
Water whipping block, boy you know it
And that bag on the way, boy you know it
Got 'em throwing up to trey, boy you know it

New whip alert, new whip alert
Drop head Wraith, feelings gon' be hurt
Served that raw shit and I ain't talking sushi
Bad bitch, treat her like a groupie
Aventador, Batman in the parking lot
400 Degreez, bitch the block is hot
They say the street cold, that's why my neck is froze
I'm chasing money, you niggas chasing model hoes
Blue hundreds, pussy ain't gon' pay the bills
You in the county jail, that pussy ain't gon' keep it real
Set the streets on fire then I got a deal
And we ain't got no deal if we ain't got a seal
You might also like
(?) pocket, boy you know it
And I'm the trending topic, boy you know it
Got cameras at the spot, boy you know it
Drum on the Glock, boy you know it
That bitch ain't got no top, boy you know it
Water whipping block, boy you know it
And that bag on the way, boy you know it
Got 'em going up to trey, boy you know it

Quarter block, got it jumping like a pogo stick
Drop the 28, then I gave 'em 56
Carolina better I get a 36
And you know that shit
Stay popping big shit on a lil bity bitch
Mini Glock folded with the lil bity clip
Ordered 3.5 and I blew it
Main man turned state, bitch I knew it
Main man that paper work, ain't no back and forth
Took a plea deal he ain't gotta go to court
So many sparklers they gon' burn the ceiling
Summer '05 bitch I blew a million

(?) pocket, boy you know it
And I'm the trending topic, boy you know it
Got cameras at the spot, boy you know it
Drum on the Glock, boy you know it
That bitch ain't got no top, boy you know it
Water whipping block, boy you know it
And that bag on the way, boy you know it
Got 'em going up to trey, boy you know it1Embed
