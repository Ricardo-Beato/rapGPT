Walk up in the kitchen, see saran wrap
I know what to do with the saran wrap
Bricks, they wrapped up in saran wrap
Trapping out the bando with saran wrap
Saran wrap, saran wrap
I know what to do with the saran wrap
Saran wrap, saran wrap
Got them bricks and them chickens in saran wrap

You can get a chicken wrapped like McDonalds
I’m trapping, I’m selling the fishes, I’m working at Benihanas
The birds they fly from Japan, man I can’t wait when they land
I’m unwrapping the saran
The Js go crazy, I’m weighing the baby like 1980s
I pull up, gold rings on, in a drop Mercedes
Your bitch bad, she in the kitchen, her wrist go crazy
Don’t try to tell me I’m a gram short, nigga I just weighed it
My niggas is animals, eat you up like cannibals
I play with so much saran, Tony Montana
I skkrt in a Phantom, excuse my manners
I’m whipping up batter, I’m balling like Battier

Walk up in the kitchen, see saran wrap
I know what to do with the saran wrap
Bricks, they wrapped up in saran wrap
Trapping out the bando with saran wrap
Saran wrap, saran wrap
I know what to do with the saran wrap
Saran wrap, saran wrap
Got them bricks and them chickens in saran wrap

Jamaican redbone bitch with me, she wicked
I done dropped the top on my car, now it’s naked
Got a blunt stored with like four grams of cookie
In the kitchen whipping whipping whipping whipping
Beating them babies up like they was getting a whipping
Gucci had on mink, his back look like it’s crooked
I got this wicked watch on me, call me a 50
I keep that chopper with me cause the game’s so wicked
I hit the gas smash out the lot, now man I’m twisted, twisted
Ganja smoke, I know y’all niggas smell me, smell me
Ain’t no thing that no one else can tell me, tell me
I got so many man I’m so talented, I’m wealthy

Walk up in the kitchen, see saran wrap
I know what to do with the saran wrap
Bricks, they wrapped up in saran wrap
Trapping out the bando with saran wrap
Saran wrap, saran wrap
I know what to do with the saran wrap
Saran wrap, saran wrap
Got them bricks and them chickens in saran wrap1Embed
