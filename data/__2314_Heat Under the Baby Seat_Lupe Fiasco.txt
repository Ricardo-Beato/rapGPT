13 ContributorsHeat Under the Baby Seat Lyrics
Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop, told her lay down on the floor
"Put the cookies in bag, take the pennies out the drawer!"
Little Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots, and black hat
He going to blow away the bully that just pushed his ass
Little Joker got a gun he bought on the street
To go and kill the niggas that beat him up last week
Cause he don't let go of none of his past beefs
Bullets flying out the window, shells landing on the seats
Little Sarah got a gun from her Uncle Sam
She got armor-piercing rounds and her gun don't jam
She got laser-guided rockets, she killing to go to college
She thought it was an insurgent, it was some old man
Now, you can get guns on the internet
AK's, Glock nines, intratecs
So when you see shorty don't disrespect
Watch 'A Better Tomorrow' and play Grand Theft Auto
