3 ContributorsIntro (Gucci 2 Time) Lyrics
I'm fresh off that Eighty-Five North
Comin' to take this shit over
Two-eleven
It's the monopoly, bitch
Fuck you thought?
I'm wearin' that crown this year, nigga
I dare you to come get it
Gucc', talk to these niggas
Love Dinero, The Mixtape General in this motherfucker with Gucci 2 Time this mixtape
Yo Dinero, it's your turn, is you ready, nigga?You might also likeEmbed
