Chronomentrophobia
The fear of clocks
The fear of time
Yeah

High as the cost of living
Ohh
I take what I've been given
Pastor say, "Be strong"
Ooh, yeah, hey
I ain't got time, leave me alone
Ain't that much time left, I've got to funk you now

Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia

Lord be having mercy on my soul
I'm having the impression that my life gon' be a bowl
Of cherries, but it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975, never thought I'd make it this far
Still battling in this racial war
Tryna find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go, I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books; let's stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good; you enter my hood, you won't be finding much
Hope that when I'm gone, y'all remember this
What we stood for: "Fuck that fame and that glitz"
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
And got to be more careful, know what corners you be bending
Revelations, getting impatient, and now, I'm dead
Remember what I said; I'm gone, bow your headsYou might also likeEmbed
