13 ContributorsAmbitionz Az a Fighta LyricsThe next heavyweight champion of the world

I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stopping me
So why you suckers keep boxing me?
Wanna see me cuffed up and call the cops on me
On a mission to be champs since they let me free
I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stopping me
So why you suckers keep boxing me?
Wanna see me cuffed up, call the cops on me
On a mission to be champs since they let me free

Prepare for combat my adversaries crumble
Face it I got a reputation for damage busters get ready to rumble
They lock me in a cell had me trapped in a livin' hell
Though not guilty I'm still in jail
Brother I serve my time like a soldier
Maintain composure
My shadow boxing I fight to the death bustin' boulders
Every boxer with a pair of gloves
Best give up love
Here's a man from the makings of a thug
A lethal weapon mind sharp
And in my heart there's a wish
To shake the world with the flurry of my black fist
Now once a high school drop out
Now I'm the million dollar champ who's the next to get knocked out
Straight out of Brooklyn I'm world wide y'all all know me
Droppin' all that come before me
No one can hold me
And uh
You might also like
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stoppin' me
So why these suckers keep boxin' me
Wanna see me cuffed up, call the cops on me
On a mission to be champs since they let me free
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stoppin' me
So why you suckers keep boxin' me
Wanna see me cuffed up, call the cops on me
On a mission to be champ since they let me free
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stoppin' me
So why you suckers keep boxin' me
Wanna see me cuffed up, call the cops on me
On a mission to be champ since they let me free
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
Next heavyweight champion of the world
