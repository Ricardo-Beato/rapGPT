111 ContributorsICONIC Lyrics
Shout out to that boy Slim Shady for all the love, yeah!
(Sinatra)

Tell me what you know about real life
Tell me what you know about dark nights
Bitch, I'm Bruce Wayne in the game
You just perpetrating from the sideline, what it feel like? (Huh)
Metaphor game too silly, punch lines way too silly
Fuck a milli', now I'm comin' for that William
Hold up, wait a minute, think about it, that's a billi' (Woo!)

God damn, boy, you know I'm puttin' in the work
I'ma get 'em, I got 'em and now they all hurt
I'ma let 'em know, I never let 'em know
They never seem to know that I am a master (A master at work)
Bitch I'm all up in it, come and get it, you could never get rid of it
Every bit of it in this motherfucker
Like I'm in the middle of little Italy, and all this shit was never given to me
That's just a fallacy told by the enemy tryna get ahead of me
They dead to me, everybody dead to me
Everybody know that Bobby will body anybody
Like Gotti the Gambino, from Maryland to Reno
We know Tarantino a killer but the Young Sinatra
Got you by the neck and the spirit the second they hear it
They fear it as soon as they get near it, everybody revere it like
You might also like
Tell me-tell me-tell me what you know about real life, real life
Tell me what you know about dark nights, dark nights
Bitch, I'm Bruce Wayne in the game
You just perpetrating from the sideline, what it feel like—feel like?
Metaphor game too silly, punch lines way too silly
Fuck a milli', now I'm comin' for that William
Hold up, wait a minute, think about it, that's a billi'

Everybody know that boy Sinatra, he the king now!
Nobody want to step up in the ring now
I sacrificed my twenties now that money ain't a thing now!
Now that money ain't a thing
Everybody know that boy Sinatra, he the king now!
Nobody want to step up in the ring now
I sacrificed my twenties now that money ain't a thing now!
Now that money ain't a thing

Everybody talk about my race on socials
Make the boy wanna go postal
Since I went triple plat'
I only identify as bi-coastal
I don't live life like most do (Like most)
Never did the shit I was supposed to
Not a lotta shit you could say about me
Yeah, my hairline faded but my bank account'll roast you
Tell me—tell me—tell me what you know about real life, real life
Tell me what you know about dark nights, dark nights
Bitch, I'm Bruce Wayne in the game
You just perpetrating from the sideline, what it feel like, feel like?
Metaphor game too silly, punch lines way too silly
Fuck a milli' now, I'm comin' for that William
Hold up, wait a minute, think about it, that's a billi'

You already know what that is
Young Sinatra, icons inspire icons
Gold chains wrapped around my neck like pythons
The drip way, yeah

Yeah! Greatest alive, I'm the greatest alive
I'm the greatest at being me, ain't nobody seeing me
So, check it like CMB, that's word to the DMV
I'm straight from the basement, I made it like a villain, I'm hated
Word to Jermaine, this shit just ain't been the same
Never simple and plain like a bullet to the brain
I'm blowing minds, yeah, I gotta kick shit with this rhyme
Second I spit it, so divine, that's word to your mom
Sweeping these rappers up like it's a chore, who want more?
I'll leave anybody two times four
Dropping pounds in London like I lost weight
My mindstate is like a freight when I rhyme, check the state of mind
Yeah, my train of thought is never off the track
When I drive it, so stop it I'm killin' 'em like a virus
After they dead I'm still in 'em, who feelin' 'em, everybody now
It's never nothin' like the first time, nothin' like your first rhyme Nothin' like getting that nut in for the first time
That's the type of shit they never tell you now
Bitches come and go, I know, I know, you can't fuck with this flow
Bobby Tarantino, get the C note, oh yeah, there he go
Tell me they love it, they want it, they need it
I never been defeated, no, never given up
Do what I do, how I do gotta live it up
This shit right here on the real, I can't get enough
God damn, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Went from gettin' close to the gang
To sipping champagne on a plane
Do what you love in life and never second guess it
Even when haters protest it now
You ever wonder what it means to
You ever wonder what it, uh
You ever wonder what it means to finally live in your dreams?
Then realize that everything, it just ain't what it seems?
Uh, yeah, I thought I wanted to be the greatest alive
Until I realized that being the greatest is just a lie
Like the opening words in this verse
That as soon as they disperse, make other rappers converse
And plot to put in you a hearse, real talk, fuck rap
I hate and I love it 'cause it's so negative
Everybody selfish, nobody wanna give
A helping hand to the next man, well, fuck you then
Fuck your ethnicity, we all one
'Cause when my last album dropped, you know we all won
Yeah, that shit went number one, so everybody won
I said that shit went number one, so everybody won (Yeah)52Embed
