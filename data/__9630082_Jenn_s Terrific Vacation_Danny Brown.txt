Who's that peeping in my window?
I don't really know what they here for
On the corner just built a Starbucks
I was just looking for a come up
Right there used to be a crack house
Now it's an organic garden

Tell me what to do when the block gets slow, and the money get low, but the rent rise up
White folks popping out the blue, they done tore that down and made that to a Whole Foods
Landlords looking for a payday
Now it's rental scooters where we used to sling yay

What you what what you what you
What you gon' do?
We move in, move in, move in, you movе on out
Where you gon' go?
We movе in, move in, move in, you move on out
What you gon' do?
We move in, move in, move in, you move on out
Where you gon' go?

Cameras on the corner, now they feel safe
Wrong move, hook, have a field day
Damn, they made that a dog park
Hoes sold pussy right here like Walmart
I used to watch for them parked cars
Now it's just white girls drinking on White Claw

What you what what you what you
What you gon' do?
Tell me what to do when the block gets slow, and the money get low, but the rent rise up
White folks coming out the blue, they done tore that down and made that to a Whole Foods
Landlords looking for a payday
Now it's rental scooters where we used to sling yay

Rent due when I'm 'bout to stack dough
Eviction notice on the front door
Across the street built new condos
Talking about 3 Gs for a two-bedroom
Y'all better check my head soon
'Bout to have a nigga out here with a loose screw

What you what what you what you
Tell me what to do when the block gets slow, and the money get low, but the rent rise up
Nowhere to go when they telling you no when there's nowhere to go where we gon' end up
They all looking for a payday
Now it's no sunshines, and the skies grey

What you what what you what you
What you gon' do?
We move in, move in, move in, you move on out
Where you gon' go?
We move in, move in, move in, you move on out
What you gon' do?
We move in, move in, move in, you move on out
Where you gon' go?
What you what you what you what you
What you gon' do?
What you what you what you what you
Who's that peeping at my window?
I don't really know what they here for
On the corner just built a Starbucks
I was just looking for a come up
Right there used to be a crack house
Now it's an organic garden
What you what you what you what you
What you gon' do?
Where you gon' go?
What you gon' do?
Where you gon' go?
What you what you what you what you
What you gon' do?
What you what you what you what youEmbed
