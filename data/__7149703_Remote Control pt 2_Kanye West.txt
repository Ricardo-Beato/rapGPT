Please don't ask again, who's up in the van?
They my only fans
I was in my hovercraft, had another laugh
How you roll with them? When you know I'm him

Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control, like a CEO
I thought you should know

On my Instagram, it get outta hand
Why you so mad?


He got it on remote control, like a CEO
Feelin' like the man, feelin' like the man
I was in my hovercraft, floatin' down the path
God just grabbed my hand, had a bigger plan

He got this on remote control
He got it on remote control
'Trol
Woah-woah, woah-woah
You might also like
I just, oh, I owe you a load
I live on the Titanic (Oh), I can rock your boat (Spider)
Hoppin' out the brand new Rolls (Skrrt, skrrt)
Hoppin' out the brand new Rolls (Skrrt, skrrt)
Jеsus sent me brand new clothеs (Skrrt, skrrt)
Wrist still thirty-two below (Yeah)
I want my mob ties to shine (Hah)
I could caress your mind with the right time (Time)
Don't you give your love up, this is the right sign (Sign), sign (Yeah)
I treat you lovely and righteous and kind (Hah)
And we'll be lastin' with another 'til we die (Yeah)
I'd give you kids at the drop of a dime (Dime)
Oh-woah, told the **** fold my clothes (Fold my clothes)
Take it to the light like a strobe (Yeah)
Taking me to court like O (Taking me to court like OJ)
Paparazzi sleep at my door, I just thought that you should know (Sleep at my door)
I get frozen like the North Pole, don't you freeze up on a pole

He got this on remote control like a sink in gold
He got it, no fight, no more meds, twilight in the game
He got it on my hover craft, have another laugh
Pop on a handstand, twilight in the man

He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control, like that's to know
Should know
You not understand, I am not your mans
See, I'm super, I got plans, trips across the land
Diamonds dancin' on my hands, Cudder in demand
All in pink like Killa' Cam, holy ****
Watch 'em go, baby like what she see, hey
In the evening, it's the time, and it's right, hey
Takin' it solo, lose the bag, it's disco, hey
Just a-just a doin' damage plus some damage, you know, it's a thing
And we ridin', it's a little bit of liquor and we slidin', it's on
And we 'bout it, say goodbye to the worries, baby, so long
Feelin' she love my shine, oh
**** color outside the lines, I am so out of-out of control
And I'm fallin', glowin' in the mold
And she said she understands the code, see, we play our roles
This is how it goes, innocent, ooh
And I'm tryna find you in my dreams, ooh
See, I'm just a creature in the night, she gives me what I like
Electric through my bones, feels so right

Ooh, ha-ha-ha, mmh, splendid
Simply delicious, oh, ha-ha-ha
I am the Glob-glo-gab-galab
The shwabble-dabble-wabble-gabble flibba blabba blab
I'm full of shwibbly liber-kind
I am the yeast of thoughts and minds
