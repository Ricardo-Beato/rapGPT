17 Contributors50 Niggaz Lyrics
It's legal to kill the black people
It's legal kill black people
Ain't that some shit?
It's legal to kill unarmed black people
It's legal to kill unarmed black people
That's fucked up
That's fucked up
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police

50 young niggas sellin' crack for a livin'
Tryna buy a Benz and a flat television
Single income and he tired of the feelin'
"Momma, I'm a man," gotta show her that he meant it
It's a cold ass world, gotta show 'em that he get it
Watch a good lil' boy turn into a cold nigga
He ready to die just to show 'em that he wit' it
So he put it on his mind, gotta get it how you live it

One Shot got life, Zimmerman got acquitted
Talkin' 'bout a carjackin', we talkin' 'bout a killin'

Wonder why we never have faith in the system
Look at young niggas like a waste of existence
And when we do make it, look at how they try to twist it
Become the world champ, and then y'all enlist us
Get rich off of rap, y'all search us for pistols
It's like it ain't no respect 'til we burn up the buildings

Could you just accept if we murdered your children?
Would you just accept if we murdered your children?
Would you just accept if we murdered your children?
Would you just accept if we murdered your children?

50 young niggas sellin' crack for a livin'
Tryna buy a Benz and a flat television
Single income and he tired of the feelin'
"Momma, I'm a man," gotta show her that he meant it
It's a cold ass world, gotta show 'em that he get it
Watch a good lil boy turn into a cold nigga
He ready to die just to show 'em that he wit' it
So he put it on his mind, gotta get it how you live it
Petey Whack got life, Zimmerman got acquitted
Talkin' 'bout a gun case, and we talkin' 'bout a killin'4Embed
