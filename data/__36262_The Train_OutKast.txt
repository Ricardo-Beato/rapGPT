19 ContributorsThe Train Lyrics
All aboard
Or, are all y'all bored?
It's good to have y'all back now
Ladies and gents
Y'all already know what it is
(God don't make no mistakes)
(God don't make no mistakes)

Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
'Twan ain't always in a vibe for spitting, I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kinda, sorta
'Cause when I saw her, I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy, so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared, dog
Back in '94, that was the motherfucking year, homeboy
Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck, they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen mine, now let's deliver to the masses

It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high
You might also like
Welcome to my life, I think its time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with
Now on ATLiens, we was killing it
And then my auntie passed, she was like my mother, I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die, I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and granddaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's your birthday, even on your worst day
Live it like the first day, I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know 'bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I, I be on that kryptonite, that means I can't be hurt
(Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I got to go...)

It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(Know we been through a lot, and I ain't perfect
But I swear to you I'm a changed man)
Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(From the caboose)
And now it's time to say goodbye, they should've turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
You can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga Big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
Cus when your faith is in the right place, see, he ain't gon' let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy, stop!!

Before you say you can't hit goal
Please, no excuse this time, don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go
(I can take it from here, ladies; y'all done a good deed tonight)

It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high4Embed
