This the last days to the rodeo
Last night had me down in the back, comatose
Don't think sunshades and a pill gon' help
Once I'm gone, can't tame myself (Myself, myself)
Mamacita, 'cita, 'cita
You know I really need ya
Need ya, need ya right now
She get freaky when the light's down
The shit's crack, no way niggas could pipe down
With the head first, got her straight out of the nightgown
Nothin' like the light-skinned mamacitas in H-Town
They got them pornstar big booties
Let me film it, then shoot it
3D money, no illusion
Depending if I'm feelin' bougie
Might hit your line, bitch

Had to cut my phone off
Bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper (Brrr)
Boy, I'm in Colorado smokin' California reefer (Ha)
Hey, the bitch so bad
Caught a ticket 'cause I really wanna meet her (Ha)
