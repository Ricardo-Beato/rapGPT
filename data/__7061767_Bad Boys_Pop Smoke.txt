Ah, rr, ayy, ayy, ayy, woo
Grrt, bah, lemme see some

When the goin' gets tough, the tough gets goin' (The tough gets goin', yeah)
Opps in the streets, get shot by police, I'm tellin' a dead man's story (Ooh)
So much trouble out there, the way that they playin' not fair (Fair, yeah)
We're doin' what it takes just to survive (To survive)

Bad boys (Bad boys)
Bad boys (I'm bad), bad boys
Bad boys (Bad, bad)
Bad boys (Bad), bad boys

Look, this Glock up on me holds 6-O ('O)
Have 'em dancin' like Calypso ('So)
I'm a big belly Woo, boy
My stomach look like a hippo ('Po)
Tell the bottle girls, "Shake it" (Shake it)
Bring the bottles of Belaire (Bеlaire)
Oh, we can't smoke in thе spot (Nah)
Still put the gas in the air (Still feel the gas in the air)
Nigga, I'm from the Floss where we get the money (Ah)
That's on the gang, I don't care what you do (Nah)
Get to the breesh, takin' your malls
Where I'm from you gotta stack like a Jew
I'm the big woo, I got guns in the coupe
Talk out your mind, you get robbed for your jewels
No, you ain't gang, I'm big 092
When you walk in the spot, nigga, you better "Woo" (Woo)
You might also like
When the goin' gets tough, the tough gets goin' (The tough gets goin', yeah)
Opps in the streets, get shot by police, I'm tellin' a dead man's story (Ooh)
So much trouble out there, the way that they playin' not fair (Fair, yeah)
We're doin' what it takes just to survive (To survive)

Bad boys (Bad boys)
Bad boys (I'm bad), bad boys
Bad boys (Bad, bad)
Bad boys (Bad), bad boys

Not for the politickin' or discussion', brodie gon' rush 'em
Send shots to his chest, now his chest got buttons
You said it's my problem, my nigga, start dumpin'
Tryna live righteous
We done came up, now niggas don't like us
Shake up the room
I ride for my brother, man got the heart of a lion
The streets never loved nobody
Ain't lookin' too good but it's hot like the tropics
They shoot you for dead
Look at the coroner, count all the bodies
Yes, we're fightin' to survive
We ain't fuckin' with you
When the goin' gets tough, the tough gets goin' (The tough gets goin', yeah)
Opps in the streets, get shot by police, I'm tellin' a dead man's story (Ooh)
So much trouble out there, the way that they playin' not fair (Fair, yeah)
We're doin' what it takes just to survive (To survive)

Bad boys (Bad boys)
Bad boys (I'm bad), bad boys
Bad boys (Bad, bad)
Bad boys (Bad), bad boys2Embed
