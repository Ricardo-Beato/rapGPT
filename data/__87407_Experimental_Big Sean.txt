Uh-huh
Yeah
Woah, woah, woah
Shit, boys, damn

I'm feeling experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into?
Tryna cope with all this shit I been through
These substances is fucking with my mental, my mental
I'm so experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into?
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking with my mental (Trippy, trippy niggas, trippy)

Big blunts of that cookie (Mhm) ducked off in that Phantom (Mhm)
Can't no nigga do like me (Mhm) this life I live outlandish (You know it)
Bunch of hoes in my mansion (Let's get it) gettin' trippy off them bars (Bitch)
I don't do no handcuffin', toss 'em to my dawgs (She yours)
Bout' to start a bank, all this money that I make (Cash)
Sour Diesel smoking, Memphis nigga getting paid (Cash)
Bunch of bad bitches (Bitch) beggin' Juice to fuck (Let's go)
Drinking 'til I throw up, smoking 'til I'm stuck (You know it)
Loud kush, you can hear it when I walk by (We smoking)
The room is movin' side to side, I'm feelin' hypnotized (We trippy)
Getting faded in the Phantom, ain't no stopping a riot (No phrasing)
These niggas smoking dirt (Pussy) actin' like they high
(High, high, high, high, high, high, high)

Rollin' weed while I'm sexin' (Sexin') rollin' weed while I drive (Swerve)
Rollin' weed while I'm rollin' weed, gettin' high when I'm high
I be gettin' high when I'm hot (Hot) gettin' high when you not (Not)
Gettin' high on the low (Low) gettin' high, oh my God (God)
I just ate a edible-edible, swear to God I feel incredible
Swear that my texting is no longer legible
I got the pussy you put on the pedestal
Tell her to leave and come bring me back revenue
Gettin' paid down, down, down to the decimal
Medical vegetable, I'm so professional, my life's a festival
I'm just so messed up though in the mental (Mental)
I feel like I just jumped out the window (Window)
Rollin' OG Kush, purp and indo (indo)
Right here outdoor in the Endo, weed is my crescendo
Okay, so now we rollin' (Rollin') and she just popped her a pilly (Do it)
Got her feeling all silly (Do it) rollin' paper from Philly, whoa
I'm feeling experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into?
Tryna cope with all this shit I been through
These substances is fucking with my mental, my mental
I'm so experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into?
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking with my mental

Yeah, she asking me questions
Even though she know I don't know (Bitch)
Her pussy the best
And she give the best blowjobs on blow (Whoa)
She love the way that I dress, and the way that I stroke
She said she never sipped lean, I said, "I never did coke"
I'm good, I'm smokin', I'm leanin' (Leanin')
I'm tryna stay focused (Focused)
Got my locs on, them chiefin' (Chiefin')
Hope these mollies ain't bogus
We got hoes in the front, got lean in the back
Gettin' head in the back, got fix in the 'Lac
Got Xannies on deck
Bitch, take these shots to the neck, we gots to connect
We off in this club, purple Sprites like it's nothing
Bitch just told me she ain't coming home with me 'less we fucking
And she got a friend (What?) and they got some Ms (What?)
Please don't mention yo' nigga 'cause I don't care 'bout yo' man
Now me and two hoes, we on, let's eat these shrooms 'til they gone
Now we having a threesome in the whip on the way home, gone
I'm feeling experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into?
Tryna cope with all this shit I been through
These substances is fucking with my mental, my mental
I'm so experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into?
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking with my mental7Embed
