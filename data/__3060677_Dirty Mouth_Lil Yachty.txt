66 ContributorsDirty Mouth Lyrics
Man, I'm on some shit right now
I'm on some, some, some rich nigga shit
Some millionaire shit
'Cause lot of these niggas is pussy
All these niggas is broke
I know these niggas is not doing what they pretend to be
Suck my dick, bitch

I don't really care about my enemies
My new crib came with amenities
You gotta pay for my energy
You gotta pay for my ohh, ehh
Don't make me pop up the trunk
Don't make me two hand the pump
Don't make me call up my bro
Pull up in that junk and go dump, dump, dump
I dress so these niggas can see me
I know your lil' bro wanna be me
I know your lil' sister wanna freak me
That's probably why you wanna shoot me
That's why your auntie is a groupie
Send me pictures of her coochie
She said they nicknamed her juicy
'Cause she keep a wet pussy
Pussy nigga don't push me
I pull up deep, not just me
I brought a brand new chain
That shit dance like N-Sync, Justin
I saw your Rolex, brother
That bullshit started rustin'
None of you niggas impress me
None of you niggas would press me
I get more pussy than Preston
My niggas bang red paisley, that's for real
I made a full million off my deal
I made a full 5 out the next
Stupid bitch tried to front on my name
I screenshotted every single text
Bitch I bite like a T-Rex
My future bitch look better than my next
My next bitch look like a top model
She suck dick like a baby bottle
You might also like
I'ma tell you like this, man
Youngest nigga in this motherfucker, man
I'm not askin' for your respect
I give a fuck if you fuck with me, nigga
I got M's, nigga
I'm talkin' 'bout the letter before N, nigga
M's, bitch boy

I didn't ask for respect, no
All I care about it my check
Louis Vuitton on my sneakers
My main bitch a diva, she is a dick pleaser
Uh, I never miss like I'm Curry
Yeah, can't eat that pussy if it's furry
My bitch pussy pink just like Kirby
My bitch suck it up just like Kirby
She drives whips like it's Kentucky Derby
She tote pistols so no one can hurt me
Don't even try it though
I hit your mama at the Hyatt House
Then I offered her Waffle House
That bitch could never see my penthouse
Shit that's just a fact
I nutted all on her back
I nutted all on her tracks
Slid my black card through her cracks
Nasty young nigga, I'm all in it
Posted on the block in a ball fitted
Posted on the block with the same niggas
I got that guap and it change niggas
Rappin' ass niggas love Dracos
I love the AR 'cause its range different
Ain't supposed to talk about guns
'Cause I gotta lot of shit goin'
I was trying to be the nice guy
Until these niggas thought I was hoein'
These niggas thought I was pussy
I had to show 'em I'm 'bout it
I put that bitch on my Snapchat
Watch how she start feelin' clouted
She gon' suck everyone around me
Fresh as hell like I wash laundry with Bounty
I can't front like I didn't come from my county
I know where I'm from, I'm my daddy's son
I never switched up one time
Pick up that back end now it's ice time
This boujee bitch said that she's hungry
Well stupid lil' bitch it's rice time
