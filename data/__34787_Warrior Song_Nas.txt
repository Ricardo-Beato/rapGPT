40 ContributorsWarrior Song Lyrics
Uh, if I can teach somethin' so be it
And hope somebody learn somethin' from it
And give it back

They can't break me or shake me
They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith is with Satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto medleys, so now they wanna dead me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it
I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
Y'all bunch of backward gangsters
Y'all signin affidavits
Snitches with smiling faces, got you blowin trial, I hate this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind of weird and it's scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I see clear to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive, how did I make it this far?
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh
You might also like
This is a song, for my warriors (A warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (Definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

Like King Nasir fightin' the British regime
I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost and they broke
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have kid
I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to body somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold

This is a song, for my warriors (A warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful
If you was me all this pain I'm feelin' would bend and killed you (I'm a warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause (I'm a warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh

This is a song, for my warriors (A warrior) to my warriors
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (Definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Warriors, baby, KrucialKeys! Braveheart y'all
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words: Never give up
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, y'know keep marchin'
Yeah yeah yeah, you never give up
To all my warriors, haha
Braveheart, Braveheart
