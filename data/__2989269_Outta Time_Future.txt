61 ContributorsOutta Time Lyrics
Super
I see you makin' hella noise, but I ain't enthused, ah
Feed me Don, Don, Don, Don Perignon

Gotta be in a rush, I can't be runnin' out of time (Out of time)
What you mean what's on my mind? (What's on my mind? Cash)
Federal Reserves on my mind, no (Freebandz, ayy)
I got the plug online (On my line, huh)
Go crazy, lavish, put the spaceship on Davins, yeah (Huh)
Compellin', you can hear the guns yellin'
I can't take no vacations, I can't lose (Huh)
We poppin' mollies and they watchin' like parole (Huh, woo)

I see you makin' hella noise, but I ain't enthused (I ain't enthused)
Kidnap, no flinch (Flinch), I'ma set back and reminisce (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck that bitch, she got a love for water whippin'
Zone six nigga ridin' in a V12, that's too Venice (Yeah, woo)
I don't wanna show â€˜em no slack (Slack), I gotta get me a sack (Pluto)
Takin' their clean batch (Batch), still fighting my demons
I'ma drop my top, get some, I mean this (I mean my top)
Shawty give me that mouth while I make a scene with (Super sloppy)

Who knew I'd get this much attention?
Be cool before you get put on suspension
P.I.M.P., gettin' that Monica Lewinsky
Chain on freeze, wrist on Jet Skis
You might also like
I'm gettin' frustrated and all for us
You see I bought the Bentley truck for us
I put in some hours every single night
Somewhere in the clouds, done lost sight
Khaled put a whole nigga on ice
Fucked on a gold digger more than twice
For the crazy bitches, glance sheisty
Had a crazy wrist, I didn't ice it

I'm infatuated with shinin'
I'm infatuated with shinin' (On my line, brr)
I'm infatuated with shinin'
Give you motivation at it's finest

Who knew I'd get this much attention?
Be cool before you get put on suspension
P.I.M.P., gettin' that Monica Lewinsky
Chain on freeze, wrist on Jet Skis

Go crazy, lavish, put the spaceship on Davins, yeah
Compellin', you can hear the guns yellin'
I can't take no vacations, I can't lose
We poppin' mollies and they watchin' like parole
Gotta be in a rush, I can't be runnin' out of time
What you mean, what's on my mind?
P.I.M.P., gettin' that Monica Lewinsky
Chain on freeze, wrist on Jet Skis7Embed
