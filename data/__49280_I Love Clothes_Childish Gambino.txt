I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Nigga, I'm the capper
Rapper slash not actor
Cause I could never act the part of being fakey
You should really thank me
Who else would do this shit?
All that fucking wishing and waiting
These niggas are mistaken
You don't speak my language
Dressed like I'm Cambridge
Bowtie make me Muslim
Switch it for suspenders
Two at least
Clickin' through on hypebeast
Thom Browne, Hells Bells, Kitsune, Jay L
I don't wear shit unless it got a logo
Now it's time to go and walk around SoHo
All high schools showing out, Pay less
Man fuck that, yo I earned this

I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothes
You might also like
Go to TOPMAN, that's the hot spot
Check Kanye's blog for the high tops
Check shake appeal lookbook right quick
Bape hooking up with Ambush, thatâ€™s sick
Sperry top-sider with a black trim
Pink leather jacket, gotta get him
New t-shirt and I put it all
On a charge card
Burning through my Goyard
And it's so dumb, but it's so tight
Ain't nothing like new shoes every night
And it feels so good in the new jeans
And the new shirt, it's addicting
I'm an addict, I don't want help
I'mma die in my brand new Louis belt
But not Louis, it's too gaudy
Check the lime green frames a girl bought me
Billionaire Boys Club, I'm living it
One shirt, eight dubs, I'm spending it
Got shoes that I know I won't wear
And the problem is I don't really care
Got money, but nothing is forever
Every time I'm out to buy a new sweater
By 211 I'll be dead broke
I'll be the homeless dude in a peacoat
I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothes2Embed
