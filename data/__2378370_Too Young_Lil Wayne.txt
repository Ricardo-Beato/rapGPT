50 ContributorsToo Young Lyrics
No Ceilings

I walk in, I walk in, I walk in with goons
I'm parkin' Ferrari, I started like "vroom"
I'm staggerin', I'm flaggin', I'm actin' a fool
Pour up, yeah
I'm sipped out, I'm knocked out in my house all day
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up, like "ayy"
I pull up, I pull up and I fade away
That's NBA, yeah

Uh, I used to have braids but I still got the hoes, yeah
I loosen my brakes and I still got control, err
I remember the day that I got the Azure, mm
Back when them hoes was wearing Juicy Couture, yeah
Back when niggas was still wearing Velour, eh
When shit got out of hand, my hands was full, I'm
Going through some shit, yeah, but you know I ain't broke up
Just talked to Ms. Cita, she told me, "Stay focused"
I said, "Alrighty then," gotta make up my mind again
Fuck the bullshit, the fake and the counterfeit
Gotta shake it like Iverson, gotta take out my pocket lint
And make something out of it, like a scientist
Be creative and confident; no vacation, just power trips
Limo tint, limo tint 5 percent, Louie V moccasins
Treat her cat like a lioness, I’m on my Mufasa shit
Yeah, I'm saucy like pasta, bitch, I'm talking all kinda shit
Yeah, and I got that Flakka dick, them bitches be out of it
And I be OT with my bro T and Lil Hoody and Skateboard E
And that's my niggas, we fly niggas
With shotguns under both wings
We going up, pouring up
These niggas be ho-ing up
Ain't no peace, we chop off both fingers
I got that dope dick, your bitch is a dope fiend
I got the tattoos, all I need is the nose ring
Pour party at my place, more codeine than chlorine
Spraying at your head like some fucking Afro Sheen
You might also like
And I'm a Martian, I'm marching on the stars and moon
I come through in something without a roof
Staggerin', I'm flaggin', I'm reppin' Suwu
Yeah, Blood Gang
Look, I hop out, they watch how I hop out the Wraith
I spend it, I spend it, make it back next day
I pull up, I pull up, and I fade away
That's NBA, yeah

I’m my mama’s son
And when I started thuggin', I was young
When I started cussin', I was one
Mama put that soap on my tongue

And when I started hustlin', I was twelve
And then I started pumpin' like the Shell
And when I started fuckin', I was young
And when I started cuppin', I was sprung
And then I started druggin', it was fun
Fuckin' with that honey, I got stung
And when I go out clubbin', I be numb
Started out from nothin', just some crumbs
Started up from nothin', just some crumbs
And now I got a bakery, yum, yum
And now I see the fakery, now I see the snakery
All I got is two words: blum, blum
