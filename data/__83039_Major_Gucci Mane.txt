9 ContributorsMajor Lyrics
I stay fresh everyday, like a model at the Magic show
I'm drinking out the bottle with two models at a fashion show
Four niggas be like Gucci Mane, remember from a long time ago
I smoked so much weed that I don't even have no time no more
I got them stupid bands like five, six, seven, I can't even count no more
No hopping out, no sporting no more, I'm hustling like I'm selling dope
Niggas take me for a joke and shit but I find it hysterical
I'm thirty  then I was like ten years ago
Ten broads with me, they're fine you see, they know they cover Maybelline
Catch your friend, it ain't a dream, It's Gucci Mane come join my team
Uh oh, uh oh, no I'm not from Orlando
I just got that magic stick, I'm balling like the pros do

Is it my favor that I save her, independent grind so major
Basketball players is neighbors
Might of paid for it but there's nothing really major
Independent balling like the majors, major
Major, paper, ice game glacier
Getting major paper, I be balling like the majors
Major, basketball players is neighbors
Politicians trade in favors

Wooh Da Kid I do it big, everything is major
Hello to the big leads, goodbye to my haters
You can stack Louie shoes, imma' stack paper
Similar to a fat boy, cause I'm caked up
Wait, stop, baby just relax
You don't need your car keys, my shofer handles that
She's flexing like all this shit, just don't amaze her
Never been a super hero so I cannot save her
Bricksquad records, yeah we get dough
Ink drops on the paper, made that money
Grow
It's feeling like the 90's, I'm getting dough
For Gucci, I burn you and leave you dying slow
You might also like
Is it my favor that I save her, independent grind so major
Basketball players is neighbors
Might of paid for it but there's nothing really major
Independent balling like the majors, major
Major, paper, ice game glacier
Getting major paper, I be balling like the majors
Major, basketball players is neighbors
Politicians trade in favors

It's a flavor foul, every time I leave my house
Iced out, bling blaw wow, slide you out
And I don't love her, she don't love me, she drives me wild
Chain out, take my car, cause she whining now
It's Gucci time, Bricksquad, yeah my goons allowed
And I'm noxious, I'm crazy, they so thugged out
They got them choppers, them carbons, you riding bitch
I'm getting dressed with Gatorade like I won the pennant
On the pennant for the million, quarter million, half a million
Whole ticket, whole ticket, gotta get it, gotta get it
Like the real niggas did it when they did it, when they did it
When I say that I serve my city like tenants

Is it my favor that I save her, independent grind so major
Basketball players is neighbors
Might of paid for it but there's nothing really major
Independent balling like the majors, major
Major, paper, ice game glacier
Getting major paper, I be balling like the majors
Major, basketball players is neighbors
Politicians trade in favorsEmbed
