I'm givin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs
Jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs, unravelin' facts
And gravel in cracks to find babblin' Max, gafflin' tracks
I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butter Fingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right

Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter
Caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' limelighters
I think we live an era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon his resolution
By usin' a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
Talkin' that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it and will have a referee in it
Every minute, so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented
Come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
Eminem is headed skyward
For those who thought that I would
Make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas
And showed you all how wack you was
I meant it as a diss
‘Cause you don't posses the pizzazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you addin' fuel to the fire, I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical
To my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchantin' rhythm romantically
Freakin' vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here

’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right32Embed
