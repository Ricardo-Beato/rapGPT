7 ContributorsMysterious LyricsWe started in 1997 and finished in 1999
She brought you 'The Rain', 'Sock it to me', 'Beep me 911'
Now it's a new year
Not the year two G but the year three G
She's a bitch
Definitely the bitch-to-be right about now
That's right
Timbaland, Missy Elliott, bring to you the future
And I am Morpheus
If you go to your local phone booth
You can find out what I have to say next
