6 ContributorsWaddle Lyrics
Can't talk about money
That ain't really fair
He talkin' to his girl
But she lookin' over here
Smokin' on his mid
And he;s drinkin' him a beer
Bubba's got a blunt
Put some kush up in the air
(Yeaah)
And I'm like pass me a bottle
I don't want your girl man, I'm finna pull a model
Ladies' man shawty, I'm a young dun dodda
Them thangs on my waist
So I walk with a waddle

I walk with a waddle
Walk with a waddle
My jeans hang low 'cause my pockets fulla guapa
My chain hang low 'cause my ice fulla water
I walk with a waddle
I walk with a waddle
A whole lot a swagga
I'm a young dun dodda
I walk with a waddle
I walk with a waddle
See us in the spot
We don't dance we just waddle
Walk with a waddle
Walk with a waddle
You might also like
Get any bitch I want
Cut it like a schwag
I walk around with 20 grand in the gucci bag
All my niggas G's
Ya'll just hella fat
We move em by the three's
(Y'all just sellin' bags)
I been gettin' rich
I heard you niggas mad
I heard you niggas broke
I heard you down bad
You need to work it out
Go on to your gym class
We been workin' out
Droppin' off them gym bags

I walk with a waddle
Walk with a waddle
My jeans hang low 'cause my pockets fulla guapa
My chain hang low 'cause my ice fulla water
I walk with a waddle
I walk with a waddle
A whole lot a swagga
I'm a young dun dodda
I walk with a waddle
I walk with a waddle
See us in the spot
We don't dance we just waddle
Walk with a waddle
Walk with a waddle
I'm stayin countin' gualas while I walk into the kitchen
My rang and my watch told my necklace I was trippin
I hit 'em with a holla
I'm down for a shotta
I walk it like I talk it Gucci actin' like a balla
My iced out doggie same size as a yorkie
But if you touch this dog tho, the owner start barkin'
My iced out doggie same size as a yorkie
But if you touch this dog tho, the owner start barkin'
The owner start barkin', the owner start barkin'
I'm hooder than your boyfriend
Richer than your husband
Wabble with the bottle
I'm a East Atlanta scholla

I walk with a waddle
Walk with a waddle
My jeans hang low 'cause my pockets fulla guapa
My chain hang low 'cause my ice fulla water
I walk with a waddle
I walk with a waddle
A whole lot a swagga
I'm a young dun dodda
I walk with a waddle
I walk with a waddle
See us in the spot
We don't dance we just waddle
Walk with a waddle
Walk with a waddle
Yuuuuuurrrrm!
It's borin'
Block wake us up, no clock, we snorin'
Six rings on you can call us Robert Horry
Still bust supremes down Zone 6 cornin'Embed
