We only smoke fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
We only smoke fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
We only smoke fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
Don't give me no bammer weed
You know why? (You know why?)
Tell 'em why (Why?)

Nigga, 'cause I'm (Snoop)
I'm all of the above, I'm a freak of nature
I'm Snoopy D-O-Dub
Nigga, 'cause I'm (Snoop)
I'm all of the above, I'm a freak of nature
I'm Snoopy D-O-Dub
Yeah, let's C-walk on 'em

Ain't a lot of niggas got what Snoopy got
Ain't a lot of niggas walk up in the spot
Smokin' on that lemon drop
Four or five bitches and they body hot
We should make they body rock
Snoopy on that player shit, you're not
Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
Now which Backwood I'm gon' light up
Turn it right up and get the party crackin'
So gentlemen, nothin' but all bad bitches, welcome 'em in
Smoke a little fire, let it begin (Ah)
Ready for a kush shotgun
But I'm watching niggas, don't wanna have to pop one
That's my weed, nigga (What?)
Hit 'em with the bop gun
Money talk, drop some
Don't like it? You can leave, nigga
California drippin' in my low-rider
Hit the switch, bounce, then it go higher
Def Jam, don't give a damn
Rollin' Backwoods by the gram

Nigga, 'cause I'm (Snoop)
I'm all of the above, I'm a freak of nature

Let's C-walk on 'em
Yeah, now B-walk on 'em

Now, if we talkin' about fire
We talkin' about that weed to get you higher
My weed exactly that weed the buyer
Leave happy then come back, lookin' for the supplier
Where that nigga Dogg at?
VIP with the golf hat
No sticks, no seeds, and I'm off that kush
Black Impala, push up the block
Smokin' on heavyweight, bitch, and it don't stop
Don't quit, don't trip, I gotcha
Get a bar from the smooth Black Frank Sinatra
I sit back and watch ya hit the weed one time
Know you on the dance floor doin' the cha-cha
I got the fire, to the limit through the wire
King Kush, they call me sire
Smoke with the boss, I'ma get you higher
With Snoop Dogg, ain't nothin' flyer
We only smoke fire3Embed
