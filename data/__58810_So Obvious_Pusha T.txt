21 ContributorsSo Obvious Lyrics
I see you supplying the strip
I'm supplyin' the hits
These niggas been fiendin' for this shit
Push!

In one short year, I've turned dreams to nightmares (Hah)
Let the gods of the game know I'm right here (Bangladesh)
To you new muthafuckas, Buzz Lightyears
Ahead of y'all, so be careful on that tightrope (Yeahh)
I inspire all the rappers that you might quote (What?)
Lookin' down on you niggas like white folks (Haha)
You're entitled to believe all your high hopes (Uh huh)
When you can fool anybody with the right hoax (Who run it?)
Let you sing to 'em, emotionally cling to 'em
With no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em (Wake up, niggas)
Weakest niggas throwin' shots, I just lean through 'em (Blap)
I just laugh at 'em, fuck is he doin'? (Hahaha)

I just wanna flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Hah)
I just wanna flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Yeahh)
I just wanna flip it (Yeahh)
I just wanna sell it (Yeahhh)
It's so obvious in my clothes you could smell it
You might also like
Take a glimpse of my life as I walk through it (My jeans is heavy)
Powder everywhere, like I drug the chalk through it (Forty racks in my pocket)
Catty-corner penthouse as I park-view it (We scatter big boy rise, nigga)
Hit the jackpot; bulls-eye, dart through it
Music; I talk through it, it's an art to it (Tell your bitch to come in)
Let the critics praise, let the charts do it
As I burn through this money, no thought to it (What'chu lookin' at?)
80 cents could save a child, but I ain't opt to it
I just shop through it; cook and chop to it
Move Heavy D (Dope boy shit); I should wop to it
We got our own thing; drop the top to it (Wooo)
This is block music; Waka Flock to it (Push)

I just wanna flip it
I just wanna sell it (Yeahh)
I just wanna flip it (Flip it)
I just wanna sell it (Sell it)
I just wanna flip it
I just wanna sell it
It's so obvious in my clothes you could smell it

I'm so raw, runnin' from the law
A nigga got rich from what you snort through a straw (We supply the block)
Here to raise the bar; chain, no flaws
Say it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw
In that two-door, no rims on the car
The hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw
See what I saw, the best gettin' better (Dope man, dope man)
Look, but can't touch; I'm a muthafuckin' leper
Q-dog steppa, Stomp The Yard better
K-I-L; I'm just waiting on a letter
Oh, there it is; let the triple beam measure
Re-Up is the gang and we bettin' whatever (Yeahhh)
I just wanna flip it (Push)
I just wanna sell it
I just wanna flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Hah)
I just wanna flip it (Yeahh)
I just wanna sell it (What?)
It's so obvious in my clothes you could smell it

Push, you need a hit, nigga, come see me
Bangladesh
Dope man, dope man
Pusha T
