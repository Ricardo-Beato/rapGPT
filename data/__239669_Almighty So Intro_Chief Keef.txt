Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all motherfuckers motherfuckers
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up (To the feature presentation, we back motherfuckers)
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up (DJ Scream)
Turn up, turn up, turn up (My nigga Chief Keef, Scream, Scream)
Turn Up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn Up, turn up (A.K.A Sosa)
Turn Up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up (A.K.A Almighty S-O)
Turn Up, turn up, turn up, turn up (HoodRich, bitch)
Turn Up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up (I hope y'all motherfuckers ready)
Turn Up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up (This as good as it get, man)
Turn Up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up (Ayo, Sosa let's get to business)
Turn up, turn up

Chopper go "graah graah", run up
Fuck with Almighty So get burnt up, straight up
If you ain't gettin' guap by now, turn up
Got thirty shots in this ning and it get hot like a furnace
These fuck boys know where I come from
That O Gang, bitch, or that no gang, bitch, ain't worried about none of 'em
That little thot, got a pom-pom
And I'm Almighty So, so you know that I'ma fuck it up
Got a verse for a key, twenty for a pound of weed
My niggas in the field, always blowing out a G
Everybody blunt steady going over me
I just sipped a pint of lean, it just put my ass to sleep
You ain't getting money man that shit sad to me
I get so much money that these niggas mad at me
I'm too busy at the top and I don't give a fuck what nigga after meYou might also like4Embed
