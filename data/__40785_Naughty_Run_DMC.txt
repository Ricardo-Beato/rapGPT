3 ContributorsNaughty Lyrics
And I say.. the brother's about to get naughty!
Rockin you on down.. to the last.. STOP!

See them on the corner, scheamin a scam
Makin plans beat the man that'll put him in ?amb's?
Cut for the loot to group, hit a troop or bank
No thanks to the brothers in blue
Freeze stay at ease, nigga get to your knees
Seen cash in the back, about a hundred G's
Step to the next, got a scam with checks
Cold stole a bankroll from plenty of ?? then
Up to The Ave., a cab to the lab
To make a stop to drop off the money in the bag
And then send a friend that's been down
To do a job to rob a brother in town
Livin and givin a damn, two different things
The brother dig diamond rings
It's not about makin the money, but the money is taken
Shake em down, flip em out, then break em
He'll break a leg, to get the money
A diggy diggy don't forget he'll break a law, seen
Ain't a damn thing funny bout a nigga named Sonny
But the brother's about to get naughty

Starin and tearin in my direction
Selection is vexin, I brought protection
Suspicious, frisk us, ? has to diss us
Scoldin and holdin me 'gainst my wishes
Searchin my ride, my body, my soul
Tryin to find some kind of substance control
Maybe someone is carryin a gun
No, nothing, no one has none
Gloomy and sorry when I come clean
Yo officer, what does this mean?
My system is loud and I draw a crowd
Not only King, I'm black and I'm proud
This ride is mine, do you mind if I own
So stop tryin to rob mines and leave me alone
The officer said I saw you before
Comin out the door of a grocery store
I said to my partner there goes a man
And he's got a trouble starter, inside his hand
My man Eric Blam said stop on the cops
And then what the Blam said, you're sure to get shot
Now they ignore me cause you saw me with a 40
He thought the brothers were about to get naughty
	The brother's about to get naughty! (4X)

How ya livin on the ill side, makin a livin
Driven, never givin a damn about the women and
If this is life, your wife, you're livin trife
For spite you hit the pipe every night and just fight
You're naughty, make a girl get physical
She get loose for juice and then you diss her
Pull and take another girl on a escapade
A trip around the world a what a mess you made
Another lady, gravy, maybe you're crazy
You see ? ?? today, you don't faze me
But gettin kinda hectic on the power tip
A brother gotta pay no matter how it get
Face the facts, base the crack
Taste the stacks last, and these suckers are back
So when you see the company that claim to be
The truth you done get raw, see
Check out the three, Run-D.M.C
And the brothers about to get naughty!
	The brother's about to get naughty! (4X)

Open up the door and let the brothers in
Cause it's a sin, if we ain't down, on what's happenin
Yo what's up, you don't like the way I walk
Or I guess it's, just the way I talk or are you prejudiced
Invited to the show, threw on my afro
Jumped out the limo, get to the front, you tell me no
Yo I just came to mingle, watch the earrings jingle
Grab a cutie rub-a-dub 'til it tingle
But you wanna single me out, but I ain't did that
Check me, I ain't strapped, pull the barricade back
I'm comin in black, I know you're hard dick
Six foot bodyguard, but why should I be barred
Yo, yo, pass the 40
Cool T, Hurricane, Run and D's about to get naughty..
	The brother's about to get naughty! (4X)Embed
