Quack, quack
Uh
Uh-huh
Uhh

I'm chillin' for an hour, smokin' weed, watchin' Worldstar
Benz in the garage, pro'bly gotta drive your girl car (Ooh)
You ain't a rapper if my homies never heard y'all
I just spit a punchline, smile then they bird call (Brr)
Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball (Ouch)
Dealin' with some shit that really don't concern y'all (Nah)
Punch a fan if he get a fuckin' word wrong
Wavy, givin' you some shit that you can surf on (cellphone)
Findin' me a bitch I can swerve on (Swerve on)
Frank Thomas, homie, 'bout to put the hurt on (Hurt on)
Your bitch a night light, in bed she turned on
Roll some weed, tell her burn one, burn one

Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one (Burn one)
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one (Yeah)
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one

Yeah
I used to give a fuck about success
Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress (Yep)
Hope she down for butt sex (Yep) it would be a cum fest (Yep)
Uh, sorry, that's some shit I had to confess (Uh-huh)
Crazy-ass bitch doin' 911 threats
Came in the game smokin' Newport Hundreds
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit, gold on my outfit
Surrounded by this pussy I'ma drown in (Drown in)
You got that wet pack, bitch, come and gimme that (Come and gimme that)
You know we wanna know where them titties at (Where the titties at?)
Got 'em gassed, they be askin' what I'm cookin' wit'
Have your little brother ask your moms what a pussy is (Uh)
Corruption, stuntin' at the function
Your girl pussy smell like Sour Cream & Onion (Ugh)
Pay attention, you gon' learn somethin'
Roll that weed up, burn one

Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one (Uh)
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one (Woo)
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn, burn, burn one (I think I fucked it up again, but whatever)16Embed
