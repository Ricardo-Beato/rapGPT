Uh, look

I got that sit 'em down feeling
Get up, can't sit around feeling
I got that drill 'em now feeling
Get up and drill 'em now feeling
Lightning, thunder, I got a drill 'em now feeling
Back out, brush 'em, no, I can't sit around feeling
I got that sit 'em down feeling
Get up, can't sit around feeling
I got that drill 'em now feeling
Get up and drill 'em now feeling
Lightning, thunder, I got a drill 'em now feeling
Back out, brush 'em, no, I can't sit around feeling

Lightning, thunder, put 'em under
Back out, brush 'em, I got that drill 'em now feeling (Uh)
I got that cash out feeling, I got that touchdown feeling
I got that back out, get 'em, if you gon' run up wit' 'em (Uh)
Big .38, hawk 'em, big Benz, ain't no walking
I ain't really with the talking, I got that drill 'em now feeling
I got that run 'em down feeling
I got that kill 'em now feeling
I make 'em spin around spinning
Know my gun get around, get 'em

I got that man down feeling
I got that yellow tape feeling
Bullets gon' penetrate feeling
I got that drop them rakes feeling
Tell that pussy nigga move up
I spent fifty on a jeweler
Niggas know that I be jeweled up
Don't make a body go missing
Niggas know that I be tooled up
Glock-30 with a ruler
Since a youngin', been a ooter
Niggas know that boy a shooter
Don't make me go smooth up
823, sanctioned
Everybody know I'm woo'd up
That's a Ruger with a Ruger
That's a shooter with a shooter
I got that sit 'em down feeling
Get up, can't sit around feeling
I got that drill 'em now feeling
Get up and drill 'em now feeling
Lightning, thunder, I got a drill 'em now feeling
Back out, brush 'em, no, I can't sit around feeling
