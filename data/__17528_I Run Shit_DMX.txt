Man are you for real?
You niggas can't be fucking serious
You not for real. you gotta be playing
You better walk away
I run shit here, Y'all just sit here
Do y'all niggas know what it took for me to get here
I'm gonna stay here, earn my way here
You can fuck around if you want but we don't play here
We get through that, run right through that
That's how we do that, y'all niggas knew that
Two albums in one year three albums in two
Didn't I just fucking tell y'all niggas that's how we do
You wasn't even fucking listening when I just said
What I said, you get that, what I just said
I run shit here fuck y'all niggas
Jail what I said I used to duck y'all niggas
Motherfucker I'm grown and that's all to it
Y'all leave a child on his own and I'm gonna do it
Fuck I done did it, shit it
You ain't even half way close to being with it forget it

I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
You might also like
I run shit here, what's my name
Getting' down for real fuck my fame
Played too many games and the games gone catch up with you
Fame niggas make stretcha catch up with you quicka
You that nigga oh for real you that nigga
Let me show you how we do that nigga
See, y'all cats are small cats
And niggas like us aren't gonna believe that
We takin all that fall back
Get down, lay down, sit down
Stay down, head round. Hey now
Does a nigga wanna get a little off his mind
I'm a nigga that will hit a nigga off his time
Go off his spine, brains in the air
Flames to the hair cause the game ain't fair
And i'll take it there fuckin' with the right one baby
Got that, we tryin' to light one baby

I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
(Big Stan)
I've done shit here my guns spit here
Y'all might live here but I run shit here
Blood sweats and tears for years just to sit here
Think I'm about to let you niggas get here
Cowards are stupid if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position watch a quick a nigga lose it
Make you get all my shit and have you fearing for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
I'm a big boy baby I don't play with you thin niggas
Getting my hands dirty when there's beef I send niggas
