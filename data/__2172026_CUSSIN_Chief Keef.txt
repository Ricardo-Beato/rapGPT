11 ContributorsCUSSIN Lyrics
Ayy
(Ace Bankz on the track)

Ayy, I be kush smokin', car ridin', ayy
Lot of guap in my pockets now, ayy
Niggas disrespect, then we knock 'em down, ayy
Big guns, trees, they knock 'em down, ayy
So high, I take a helicopter down, ayy
Show you how I make this fuckin' chopper sound, ayy
Them niggas opps, no, we don't fuck with them, ayy
Got ignorant guns, it's gon' up at them, start cussin'

'Member standin' on the block, my hand was on my Glock
Ready to slam it on an opp and give him all I got
Now I got hammers on the block and drugs on the block
Cops got cameras on the block, they tryna catch us off
Untrustworthy ass bitch, they tryna set us up
Lil' dirty ass niggas always stealin' some
Dirty 30 ass with me and he'll hit you up
I got my jewelry out and my hammer tucked (Bang)
I got some niggas with me, come through, blam it at you
Shoot him, him, him, him, and then her (Bang)
'Cause niggas was steady talkin' and we didn't know nothin'
And when the feds grabbed me, man, I didn't know nothin' (Bang), ayy
Catch you snoozin', then it's done with you, ayy
I hope you got your gun with you
Got thirty shots full of lead, but you gon' hold number two (Bang)
Came on your bitch face like my nut do what cucumbers do (Bang, bang)
You might also like
Ayy, I be kush smokin', car ridin', ayy
Lot of guap in my pockets now, ayy
Niggas disrespect, then we knock 'em down, ayy
Big guns, trees, they knock 'em down, ayy
So high, I take a helicopter down, ayy
Show you how I make this fuckin' chopper sound, ayy
Them niggas opps, no, we don't fuck with them, ayy
Got ignorant guns, it's gon' up at them, start cussin'

No Versace, this belt fourteen hundo', ayy
Opps livin' on a prayer, Bon Jovi
Like a cigar, I catch an opp, I'll smoke them
Like who is these niggas? I don't know them, ayy
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe them, ayy
Catch an opp, 'bout to tote him, ayy
Don't know if I'll let go of him, ayy
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, I know it's him, ayy
He ain't shootin', I can't roll with him, ayy
That's my Glo Gang, that's my bro and 'em
Yes, I tote things, and I'm blowin' them, ayy
Leave you boppin' like Kemo and them
I just had a baby and I'm keepin' him
He already got a name, his name is Beef Filling
Bitch got in my car like, "What kinda seats is them?" Ayy
You know BMW my people 'nem, bang
Ayy, I be kush smokin', car ridin', ayy
Lot of guap in my pockets now, ayy
Niggas disrespect, then we knock 'em down, ayy
Big guns, trees, they knock 'em down, ayy
So high, I take a helicopter down, ayy
Show you how I make this fuckin' chopper sound, ayy
Them niggas opps, no, we don't fuck with them, ayy
Got ignorant guns, it's gon' up at them, start cussin'3Embed
