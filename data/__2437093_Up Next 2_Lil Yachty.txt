Uh, ayy, uh
Lil Boat (Chubba), Chubba, Lil Boat, Chubba
DigitalNas in this bitch
You know what I'm saying? Niggas see a young nigga, know what I'm saying? Nigga gon' act like they don't see a young nigga
These niggas see a young nigga
These bitches see a young nigga, you know what I'm saying?
Nigga shine, nigga flash, you feel me?
My nigga Ian up in this bitch, you feel me?
What's popping? Niggas know what's going on, nigga
Nigga see how I'm coming, you don't want a problem
Uh, ayy, uh

Boat boy just copped him some diamonds
She gon' suck my dick 'cause she like how I'm rhyming, it's all about timing
Got 22 bitches on standby, they fuck when I say so
Can't talk till my case closed
I'm hot like a pepper
Don't ash in my whip, bitch, it's basketball leather
Which nigga you rather? It better be me
Maison Margiela just for my black tee
Can't fuck with these niggas and all they rap beef
Got a Tec for a hundred, I'm feeling like money
My mouth looking sunny
These niggas look funny, so I keep the chop
I'm new and these niggas hopin' that I flop
I'mm flop in that pussy, it better be gushy, it better be hairless
Me and Kpreme beat your ass with our bare fists
When I get on, I'ma fuck me a Heiress
You might also like
24 karat that'll fuck up my teeth
Pussy so wet that it fuck up the sheets
Catch me posted right there on the street
Pocket rocket right under the seat
Wish a pussy nigga would try me
In the kitchen whipping up the heat
Catch Purpp, get his ass beat
Smoking purp and then I ash it
50 band jugg, then I cash it
Fucking your hoe, then I pass it
Purple and lean, that my passion
Make it disappear like it's magic
Don't come to the 6 where it's tragic
Bricks wrapped up in elastic
In Europe with a bad bitch
And all we smoke is that cabbage

I'ma hot box in the drop top
Now the coupe look like a crock pot
Old school cubes in my ear
Damn, they looking like Macintosh
Flyer than an albatross
Rims chopped like applesauce
I don't pay the pussy what it cost
Diamonds look like tear drops
Play with squares like hop scotch
Rims so above the rim
No And1, but anyone of you niggas cross me, I'm up in it
Dump in it, huh?
I'ma catch a body like a cheerleader
I'ma die fly like Aaliyah
R.I.P., I'll see ya when I see ya
40 thousand dollars on the coat
It ain't even cold, I'ma call PETA
Whip it up with the eggbeater
Whole band on one sneaker
Another band on the other shoe l-l-like a nigga on house arrest
Chop the hit, you decompress, raising bars like bench press
Had to get the shit up off my chest, hey, hey
Yuh, ayy, woah, damn, ayy, yuh, ayy

Had to get this shit up off my chest
Sendin' shots, you might need a vest
26 for a nigga neck
Water diamonds jeweler straight from Fiji
When I'm on my money, I look like a tiki
If you got a problem, nigga, don't you tweet me
I'm a real nigga, Lil Boat don't do Hilfiger
15 hundred for a still picture
Saint Laurent, nigga, these ain't Jordans
Crib fill of clothes like I'm hoarding
In the air while you niggas boarding
If the cake right, I'ma stick a fork in
Hahaha
That damn Lil Boat, he's something else, I tell you
Yeah, that DigitalNas something else, too
Well, I guess, uh, we gon' go holla at Yachty a little bit
He's, uh, he's-he's more emotional, you'll-you'll see what I'm talking about12Embed
