52 ContributorsThe Yes and the Y’all Lyrics
Jiggy-jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages
When bible page verse tidal waves begun (Water won)
I wrote the book that shook America to splinters
In a winter wasteland icicle-bound barren township
Call Baron Münchhausen and proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig
Delinquent sinking like a paper tugboat well beneath your holidays
Beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty
I'm a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag
It's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels
To the Riverside Park Tunnel people claim last lifeform standing
Carbon based pardons ain't enough
My stilts truly personify this urbanite flea circus
We urchins merkin on daily
I catapult brain opera past basic
Tear my own face off in the finale, stick around it's ill
Diabolic Prodigal Son spill grimace
If you had one more eye, you'd be a Cyclops
Which explains missing the premise
Bliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh, die
Kiss the finish, piss the villagers the fuck off
Pete Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
Aes Rock might've smoked one too many dimes in his time
Now, where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother?
Probably gathering your sheep with all these other motherfuckers
Struck twice in the same place by a moody Zeus fishliner
Smackin the third clear out the park
Going gone (To infinity and beyond!)
I rocked for a flock of Chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers
Hermit crabs and New York city sewer aligators
Keep your Honalee dreams out your homily
I deal with tangible goods
And avoid manufacturing food for landfills
I've seen friends bow to needles
I've seen needles bow to records
I've seen boughs break
I've seen God bow and make the clouds shake
I've seen the proud break
I've seen a lot for a blind soldier
Who tattooed a cityscape on skin to blend in
The rats travel by night and fight the waterbugs
I'm here to pull the three-prong on this prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice
Add a hatchet slice for kicks
And so that God-awful Frankenstein scar on your style can someday be a story for my kids
Life's hard, life's easy
Life's everything in between
Life's Peachy like James and the Giant
And I keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it
And I keep casting my line as long as these fish will bite it
And I like it (Don't try it like that)
You might also like
"Yes wild is love
That's the way it goes though....
Maybe I should just give up or stop trying
But life is so uncertain, so short
I've got to keep on searching
And wherever it takes me, I've got to go"

Bantamweight temper tantrum, decrepit anthem
Set a low goal, I arrive late
I'm here to scrape a cog clean till the funk machine
Imposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother
(Oh you got heart?)
I hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates
Like these here drunken little archers miss more than they calculate
The falcon hates the mockingbird
The farmer hates the drought
I hate em all, I kick the bottom brick out shouting "Yes y'all"
And blow the village out perspective (Aesop!)
Do you take this makeshift Candy Land cult-classic bastard style
To be your lawfully wedded head trip
To embrace throughout sickness, health, electrical storm
Fire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow? (Hell no!)
I'm balanced, personified phantom to the bone
Walkin like a Jabberwocky
Scalpin a pair of one-way tickets to shadowboxing
It’s just like Christmas with a shallow stocking
Like this (I'm just trying to milk the mileage)
You drop science like Don Herbert with liquor in him
Soundin' off like senior citizens sitting at Bingo parlor bickering
Yeah, it's kinda funny, isn't it?
How I can build while you just sit there and bitch about your syllabus
 4x
Dwarfed by the lights, bewildered by the fanbase
Bound by an idea, skeptical of the handshakes
Skeptical of the handshakes {*repeat to fade*}2Embed
