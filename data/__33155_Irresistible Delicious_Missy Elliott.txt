It's entertainment time! Woo
Got Missy Elliott in the house, got Slick Rick in the house
We doing big things here kids
Hip-Hop's finest, Slick Slick Slick Rick an' M
 Slick Rick an' M
Go Missy, go Missy, go Missy, go Missy
 Slick Rick an' M

Excuse me Mr. Lawrence, you look nice
Simply delicious, Missy want some kisses
Let's go to the crib, get cosy in the nude
And treat me like a prostitute
Now pardon me sir, I'm such a real lady
Ride in Mercedes to make the bitches hate me
Cruise up and down one-two-fifth
Looking for a guy like you to get with
{​*beat changes*}​
I seen this cutie pie, so I pulled beside him
Seen the size of his feet, so I couldn't deny him
Might as well try him, the freak that I am
M dot S-E always grindin'

Please don't think I'm crazy (Ooh)
But boy you are super fine
Do it to you, do it to you (Thank you, Missy)
Irresistible delicious (Ooh, holla!)
Enough to make me lose my mind (Lose my mind)
You know I really want it (Slick, Slick, Slick Rick and M)
You know I want it, yeah
Don't make me wait so long
Oh, don't make me wait so long
No longer will I pretend (No)
(Missy, Slick Rick in the house)
Let's get it on cause we both grown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
Intelligent, delicate, watch how the fella get
Bump into my homegirl in Miami, Missy Elliott
Green blush on her eyelid, hi Miss!
Gave honey a hug I feel her touchin my privates
Aw shuck I guess, main course is in I said
You know I'm married?
-- Yeah and what's that supposed to mean?
-- Proposition for you Ruler
Proceed on
-- Well I got a track I need you spit a mean 16 on
-- You with it?
Down to bless one and I left one
The Hit Factory, later on around eleven
With my notebook, and pencil, I slides on in
I see her looking mighty sexy and the lights all dim
-- Have a drink
The booze and the karmy go oddly
After having a drink I start to feel unusually horny
Swelling stone, or well writ poems
Busy pounding like I'm trying to break off pelvis bones

Please don't think I'm crazy (Slick Rick's in the house, ooh)
But boy you are super fine
Do it to you, do it to you (Thank you, Missy)
Irresistible delicious (Ooh, holla!) (Slick Rick's in the house)
Enough to make me lose my mind (Lose my mind)
You know I really want it, you know I want it, yeah
Don't make me wait so long
Oh, don't make me wait so long
No longer will I pretend (No) (Boss of the females)
Let's get it on cause we both grown (Recognise, recognise)
Excuse me sir, oh gosh you look young
But old enough to get it to get yo' head sprung
Sit down relax, it's soft here on my couch
Or give me hands strictly you might get turned out
Cutie pie, 'til I sit beside him
Nice shoe size, how could I deny him
Big bankroll to help me retire
Me and him together smell like big empire
Don't treat me like a prostitute
Unless you're giving me some money making sure I look cute
But don't treat me like a prostitute
Unless you're giving me some money making sure I look cute

Please don't think I'm crazy
 Please don't think I'm crazy (Ooh)
 But boy you are super fine (do it to you, do it to you)
 Fi-fi-fine
