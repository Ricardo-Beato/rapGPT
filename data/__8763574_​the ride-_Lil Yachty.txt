Hoo, uh, don't ask no questions on the ride
Makin' eye contact is suicide, yeah
When I'm alone with my thoughts, I'm terrified
That's why I need you here, just by my side, yeah
A quick zoom to the moon, come along and ride, yeah

Baby, if you scared of heights, just close your eyes
It get lonely at the top, baby, come inside
Baby, bust it open for me, don't be shy

Hoo, uh, don't ask no questions on the ride
Makin' eye contact is suicide, yeah
When I'm alone with my thoughts, I'm terrifiеd
That's why I need you here, just by my side, yеah
A quick zoom to the moon, come along and ride, yeah

Feel my void (Fill my void), feel my void (Fill my void)
Feel my— (Whoa, fill my)
Feel my void (Fill my void), feel my void (Fill my void)
Feel my—

I feel empty, riding on E
A shopping spree may fill the V, V as in void
Speaking of void, I may avoid all of my boys
That doesn't work, it's unemployed, now I'm annoyed
All of the things I once enjoyed doesn't bring joy
It just bring noise, it just bring noise
It just bring noise, it just bring noise
It just bring noise, it just bring noise
It just bring noise, it just bring noise (Nice)

When I'm alone with my thoughts, I'm terrified
That's why I need you here, just by my side, yeah
A quick zoom to the moon, come along and ride, yeah
A quick zoom to the moon—

Come along and ride, yeah3Embed
