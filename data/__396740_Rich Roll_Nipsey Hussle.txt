9 ContributorsRich Roll Lyrics
Mental Instruments

So tell me what it do, lil' baby, baby (Tell me what it do)
'Cause we can rich roll tonight (We could rich roll)
We can rich roll tonight (We could rich roll)
Tell me what it do, lil' baby, baby
We could rich roll tonight
We could rich roll tonight, woah

I watch them other lane dudes play their cards first
Tryna buy the  hopin' that their cards work
I'm in my own zone, still I'm in a grown mood
She off the wet Ros√©, I got my 
I got my own spot, leaning with my own two
Stepping to the music 'cause yeah, that's what the  do
She gon' choose herself if she want to
So when I address her I just ask her one question

Tell me what it do, lil' baby, baby (Tell me what it do)
'Cause we can rich roll tonight (We could rich roll)
We can rich roll tonight (We could rich roll)
Tell me what it do, lil' baby, baby
We could rich roll tonight
We could rich roll tonight, woah
You might also like
I like the stylish clothes you wear
I like the way you do your hair
It's just the little things you do
So lil' baby, what it do?
The club going, lights slow
I'm off the right vapor
Wrists look like a lightsaber
Waving like "Hi, haters"
And please excuse my hiatus
You know, Johnny's tryna knock us down
And  with my latest
But still I stand tall like a skyscraper
I got to ball so I can get to that in brown paper
I know, they hate me 'cause I shine daily
I tell them, start grinding, quit stargazing
So bitch, that's life and I'ma die chasing only two things
Big money and greatness
So if you sick of this fake shit
Hop your pretty ass in my car, let's get wasted

Tell me what it do, lil' baby, baby (Tell me what it do)
'Cause we can rich roll tonight (We could rich roll)
We can rich roll tonight (We could rich roll)
Tell me what it do, lil' baby, baby
We could rich roll tonight
We could rich roll tonight, woah
I am a man of my word
I done took it to the top
Far away from the curb
I heard that opposites attract
I'm a hood  and I know you like that
I am a man of my word
I done took it to the top
Far away from the curb
I heard that opposites attract
I'm a hood  and I know you like that

Thirty on my left wrist
Fucking with the extras
All out of champagne, looking for the exit
Tennessee for dinner, baby, you can be my breakfast
Nah, the Clicquot got me talking kinda reckless
I'm feeling your protection, more than you expect it
I could take adventage, but I choose to respect it
Let's just fade our separate ways, slight exit
Only to return like taxes, Huss

So tell me what it do, lil' baby, baby (Tell me what it do)
'Cause we can rich roll tonight (We could rich roll)
We can rich roll tonight (We could rich roll)
Tell me what it do, baby, baby
I wanna rich roll tonight
Can we rich roll tonight?
