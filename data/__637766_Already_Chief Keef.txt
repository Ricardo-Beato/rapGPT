This bitch gave me top (Already, already, already)
I'm 'bout to spend this guap (Already, already, already)
I'm 'bout to send some shots (Already, already, already)
I think I seen a opp (Already, already, already)
I think I seen the cops (Already, already, already)
Played that shit already (Already, already, already)
Smoke straight for breakfast (Already, already, already)
Flexin' get justice (Already, already, already)
Cops tryna breathalyze (Already, already, already)
But they know I'm high

Already fat, too much food in my belly
It's already got one, I seen it, I get it
She already askin' me a hundred and one questions
She already gave me top, I'm gone, no second guessin'
They already gave me guap, I ain't goin' back flat, man
They already gave me lot, I ain't goin' for less, man
I already sprayed me Glock, I ain't gettin' finessed, man
I already played these cops, they ain't finding my weapons
Already, already, they call ready, already
She gon' give me top, guess what? My balls ready, already
And I gotta ball so yes I'm ball ready, already
I'ma ball 'til I fall, I guess I'm fall ready, already
