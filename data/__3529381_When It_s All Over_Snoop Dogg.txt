5 ContributorsWhen Itâ€™s All Over Lyrics
I should wear it
I should wear a crown when it's all over
When it's all over
I should wear a crown
I should wear a big ol crown, yes
When it's all over
When it's all over
I shall see his face
I shall see his face
When it's all over
Over, yes
Over, over, over
I'm gon spread, I'm gon spread gon spread, gon spread my wings
When it's, when it's, when it's, when it's all over
When it's all over
I'm gonna put on my robe
Tell the story how I made it over, how I made it over
This is my story, this is my story
Can't wait to cross the river
How I made it over, gon wear my crown
I'm gonna put on my robe
Tell the story how I made it over, how I made it over
I'm gonna see my Lord, my father, my sisters, and brother
I, I, I, I, shall
I'll get home, home, homeYou might also likeEmbed
