I get stacks, pockets fat
I'm Penny Proud, Kyla Pratt
Tic for tat, we back to back
I'm gettin' chauffered around, and I'm relaxed (duh)
I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto
I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto

I'm in the Range, eatin' snacks
I'm in the back, like Barack
Like Mrs. Michelle, I ring bells
These the new Jordan's, can't you tell?
Class in session, grab a chair
You made me flex, how do you dare
I'm with my girls, at a fair
Hit a duck, and won a bear
I need you to add this up, grab a calculator
Could've rapped a whip Barbie beat, but I got more flavor
Get fly before you're higher, super sharp like a taper
She don't like me, I don't blame her

I get stacks, pockets fat
I'm Penny Proud, Kyla Pratt
Tic for tat, we back to back
I'm gettin' chauffered around, and I'm relaxed (duh)
I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto
I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto

I'm Mr. Otto, I'm goin' Pablo
I hits the models, I gets the bottles
I'm goin' psycho, nothing's recycled
Look how my ice glow, charged like a rhino
Well other than bool, I'm super cool
You can't stand me, get you a stool
We back to back in foreign's, no more rules
You gotta make investments and stop buyin' shoes
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

I get stacks, pockets fat
I'm Penny Proud, Kyla Pratt
Tic for tat, we back to back
I'm gettin' chauffered around, and I'm relaxed (duh)
I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto
I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto
I get stacks, pockets fat
I'm Penny Proud, Kyla Pratt
Tic for tat, we back to back
I'm gettin' chauffered around, and I'm relaxed (duh)
I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto
I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lotto, I hit the lottoEmbed
