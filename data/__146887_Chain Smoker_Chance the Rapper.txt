If this is my last sh- my last shit
Uh, it definitely be mad important
And it would have to sound like a Prince song

Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfucking, motha, shut your mouth
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfuckin', motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth

Somebody pray for the god, oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit, rappin', trappin', trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died, yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain't tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last Chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint
You might also like
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfuckin', motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth

This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit (Igh)

Why toss my filter when she saving my life?
The same shit that kills us, always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dealer, God know who he be
Truth be told, he juiced me, introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh-oh-oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire, flyer on the wall, I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night, in the sky I get higher, higher

Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfucker, motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth
This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit (Igh)

I'm still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfuckin', motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth
Igh!124Embed
