17 ContributorsTasteâ€™s State Lyrics
The sure shot, miss sex pot, straight shooter
The best round, miss flesh brown, who bang beauty?
That brand newbie, my clan cuties, who Jing Lee?
Off eight doobies and champagne, and pressed grapes
The best made, the checkmate, the checkmate
The best babe especially, I'm taste's state
The princess of pretty, the belle of the prissy, you dig me?
The moisture is plenty, you got nothing for me then get me
The pick of the litter, these bitches is bitter
Banksy is better, these bitches is dinner
Throwing my letter, Banks clearly the winner
Notice the grave on the breast
Scraping the plate
You know how I play

Healer, winner, bring it back on rewind
There's no time to heal her, take her back, rock yo' spine
Pussy whore, talk your shine
I can see how we in great shape
Flatlining everything and this bitch is my taste's state

Yo
The boisterous bully with lyrics to master the creature
I chop up and get to you niggas like slicing a pizza
The cypher gets deeper
Yes, I line niggas up like a zebra
Dominal diarrhea, niggas no lie it gets deeper than
Rhymes is a keeper
Bitch, we scorching it hot like a fever
Fuck what you talk, your bitch a thot and she'd like me to meet her
Cooked every boil up in the pot while the water will heat her
Smoking some OG in the drive while we blanket your street up
And basket your meat up
And throw away the auxs and casket your 3 up
And bury the boxes, my loose screw niggas
And let em freeze her (brrr)
Bitch, I demolish and disrespect niggas
Now fuck the responses that's how we do niggas
You might also like
Healer, winner, bring it back on rewind
Theres no time to heal her, take her back, rock yo' spine
Pussy whore talk your shine
I can see how we in great shape
Flatlining everything and this bitch is my taste' state

I be-be minding my B, yah, B yah
Playin' some old Aaliyah
She lickin' me on my ear, ear, ear
See ya, s-see ya see ya as we rollin' r-rollin, b-ballin'
Won't catch us on the bleachers, we leaders nigga
They schemin', these niggas they peepers
Broke niggas be pocket watchin', them bitches be thieves
You can catch me stuntin' s-stuntin' frequent
Your baby father's a skeez-a
They creep in my DM's
They wanted this creepin'
Come catch me on weekends, nigga
There's something I mean it
I'm leaving you lickin' nigga
Like what were you thinking?
I'm speaking that different nigga
I'm getting that benji, I'm getting them dividends
I'm Rocky in Harlem, probably my Juelz be dripping nigga
Come plunge on the water homie
Fish scale in the kitchen, nigga
The hickory, dickory dockity schiffy
The finest in China, the whitest on the block with the remedy
Healer, winner, bring it back on rewind
Theres no time to heal her, take her back, rock yo' spine
Pussy whore talk your shine
I can see how we in great shape
Flatlining everything and this bitch is my taste' stateEmbed
