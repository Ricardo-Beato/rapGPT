5 Contributors1st We Blaze It Up LyricsI have been listening to the radio lately
A lot of these capers making these rap love songs
I got one I wanna do, my nigga huh huh, yeah
Now my nigga Joseph on the track
I'm gonna start mine off like bitch dig this
One move, two look, three little breezes
All in line, fine, trying hit my breezy
You ain't the dog, they dont believe me
They want me to talk that talk, Im like fear sissy
Now you know its me
But you drink down, grab your coats and roll with me
We are going to the palace where I lay my head
Said the ten room house with the make bed
You are really rolling with a player
Who found his nails and takes care of his hair
But enough about me, let us talk about you all
What do you all prefer? The cats or dogs?
Jeans or skirts? Music or movies?
Tom and Jerry? Shaggy or Scooby?
Groovy, you can use me and abuse me
And we can do the hoochy coochy in my Jacuzzi
First we blaze it up
When we do, it stays. What is up?
Said you can't get enough
The one we dont do act like
First we blaze it up
When we do, it stays. What is up?
You said you can't get enough
The one we dont do act like
After the party, yeah yeah
You know I felt like blowing to let you know how I was feeling, let me get back to flowin
Im goinig on a little journey
Would you like to come and join me?
Cause I got a lot of room for your time to consume for ya
Man, this is really some ill shit
A pimp ass nigga like myself to deal with
Baby girl, can you feel this?
The niggers is fake and Snoop Dogg is the realest
You with me its like wee
I get it how I live and I make it how I want it
Somebody told me a long time ago
If you got a better flow so I guess I am gonna flow
So proceed with speed
So you can have what you want
Just name what you need
First we blaze it up
When we do, it stays. What up?
Said you can't get enough
The one we dont do act like
First we blaze it up
When we do, it stays. What is up?
You said you can't get enough
The one we dont do act like
After the party, yeah yeah
Are you in the mood for some Marvin Gay
Or you just wanna cruise through LA
Let me kiss you on your belly
And take a few flicks of your slay
I know you like it when I turn into a freak avoid
And you momma thinking I was just your home boy
You know Im down with the D-low
I hope your baby daddy dont try to pull a D-bow
Wait notice, everywhere that we go
I know Im just bullshitting girl, you get peoples
You got to have some joy and some laughter
To each and every relationships chapter
Now, in the beginning you will feel the rapture
Its easy to capture, let me know what youre after
