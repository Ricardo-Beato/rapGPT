Ya'll dont wanna see them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
You know i dont pop pop at the bar
But i might send pop pops through your car
Ya'll dont want them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
Who is that kid with the jewels in his face
With the tools in his brace
Put the tool in your face

Got the police the hustlers and the gangstas nervous
And all these little rappers on basic service, I'm knowin
I ain't the hottest nigga out got that fire though
You gone have to put your hottest nigga out
And i ain't talkin bout when the partys over
I'm a moltov cocktail bicardi thrower
Fifteen karrot bezzled out bigari holder
Size ten alligator skin Mari loafers
And I'm just like the cops, word to the life
Cause i serve and protect
Wit a bird and a tech
And when the lights on
Gotta merge to the right
Sixteen drop in new jersin with rice
Or in chicagow with the truck
Or in the Ne-va-da with the luck
Or in lala with chuck
Or in Ghana gettin' ducks
Or in Jamaica speakin' patois in the huts
You might also like
Ya'll dont wanna see them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
You know i dont pop pop at the bar
But i might send pop pops through your car
Ya'll dont want them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
Who is that kid with the jewelry on his arm
With the fury in his palm
Got the fury all along

Fiasco fiasco
Send shots ten blocks
Split tops i rent cops
And bend blocks and Benz drops
I been hot now shake spot
Or take shot like hen rock
My gridlock on big blocks that miss not that a
Tip yachts and flip drops
So spit out the hip hot
The wrist watch rock don't risk it watch in the ristwat with chics who sip ---
Livin so cris pop my clique cop pot
Your clique get kidknocked
Your clique stop
We spin knots
Send hustler to my hustlers locked in jin pop and they able to switch spots there is not
Stand back hand clap kick stomp
What you in pop
Bust m's put you inbox
I'll push box dog
You push my r
Its L U when I tell you
All ya'll
Ya'll dont wanna see them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
You know i dont pop pop at the bar
But i might send pop pops through your car
Ya'll dont want them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
Who is that kid with the jewelry on his arm
With the fury in his palm
Got the jewelry all along1Embed
