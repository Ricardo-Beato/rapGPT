36 ContributorsBig Things Lyrics
Get yours nigga
'Cause I'ma get mine
In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to y'all
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killers crawl
And snitches call police
On these niggas, and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Better slow up
Before you get your ass sewn up
Nigga never gon' grow up
Drinkin' the Henny
But he know he gon' throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? Future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace, chasin' the papes
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things
You might also like
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners
I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style I'ma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I rap and y'all stop and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop
I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things (ill)
Gotta get my life together man (uh huh)
'Cause now I'm into big things (big things)
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you (nah not no more)
'Cause now I'm into big things (fuck y'all)
You know I can't do that shit no more (why?)
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you (why?)
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners (why's that?)
I'm into big things (uh)
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

I go past y'all (UH-HUH)
Y'all got the glass jaw (UH-HUH)
And when I hit it, admit it
Y'all on ya ass y'all (UH-HUH)
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gunnin' for dough
You want to score
But you really don't know how to to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not forever
At least to 140
Pray for me, I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown off Berry Gordy
Good God
Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
'Cause now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things6Embed
