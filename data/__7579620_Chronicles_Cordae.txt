Yeah, uh-huh

I'm on this road, and I'm not sure where my heart is headed (Mm)
And if you left me now, I know how far I'd regret it
Told you once, tell you twice that I'm indebted, huh
But I can't waste no time, you know my time is precious (Hey)

Hit up Eliantte for that diamond necklace (Hey)
Tell me you don't need shit, girl, and I'll respect it (Ooh)
I'm on the road too much, shit kinda hectic
Telling you what's on my mind, don't use my thoughts as leverage (Hey, huh)
I been travelin' 'round these crossroads (Hey)
Gotta compromise somе shit but that's a small toll (Huh)
Crazy when we first met, wе was lost souls
But I know I gotta grow
I lace my bitch in the best, give her designer sex
If I fucked up, I'm sorry, here's fifty racks for the stress
Not easy to impress, always wonder what's next
I go as deep as I can and make her shake like tourettes

They say love is no miracle and lust ain't no thing
But trust is something you should know, but we both been through pain
You might also like
I'm on this road, and I'm not sure where my heart is headed (Mm)
And if you left me now, I know how far I'd regret it
Told you once, tell you twice that I'm indebted, huh
But I can't waste no time, you know my time is precious (Hey)

I just need love, I need someone to give me more perspective
You on your grind just hoping, call me when you get a second
Yeah, I don't need no lectures, baby, I just need your presence
And I promise I'm gon' stay no matter where we left it
Time and effort, I just need time and effort
Temptations in my past, got all the times I was tested
You wanna go but just make sure that we stay connected
I know you solid, so I promise you that I'm invested

Love is so beautiful, lust is your skin, yeah
Trust is something you should know if we both feel the same, yeah

I'm on this road, and I'm not sure where my heart is headed, yeah (Mm)
And if you left me now, I know how far I'd regret it
Told you once, tell you twice that I'm indebted, huh
But I can't waste no time, you know my time is precious (Hey)
Richard Mille the 360 'cause you been real with me 360
Street nigga buy all drugs but you made a nigga buy you new titties
I made room, I care to make you love me, not make Shade Room
Ain't scared to say I love you, but to be honest, you can't be someone, ain't worth it
I tried, you tell me I spend my time with all my guys
Knowing we don't spend time
I say I'ma stop but I still do
These gon' be the same ones that's gon' kill for you

I'm on this road, and I'm not sure where my heart is headed, yeah (Mm)
And if you left me now, I know how far I'd regret it
Told you once, tell you twice that I'm indebted, huh
But I can't waste no time, you know my time is precious (Hey)
I'm on this road, and I'm not sure where my heart is headed
And if you left me now, I know how far I'd regret it
Told you once, tell you twice that I'm indebted
But I can't waste no time, you know my time is precious

Don't waste no time11Embed
