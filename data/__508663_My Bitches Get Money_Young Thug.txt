My bitches be running, they chasing that paper
I'll serve you like waiters, I'm high like a scraper
Put a hole in your head, you look like a pacer
I'm sliming, I'm coming, know why I look at you funny?
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
Thugger

I'm cashing out for 100 P's (Sheesh)
Put 'em straight in the trap and then it collect the green (Roll it)
Your bitches want to caress the young slime king (Slime)
Your old man want to arrest me for some slime things
I'm a fucking king cobra (Sheesh)
Thugger, Thugger, not snitching, but I told ya (Told ya)
Catch a trip, now they hit him with that mini chopper (bow)
I'm not talking Africans but they say blocka blocka
I can't-I can't stop
I got young niggas standing on the block
I told him chill but he refused to stop selling rocks
He told me I never need license, he go shoot at cops
Put 'em down, Thugga run round with 100 some rounds
Serving in everyone's town (Sheesh)

I'll serve you like waiters, I'm high like a scraper
Put a hole in your head, you look like a pacer
I'm sliming, I'm coming, know why I look at you funny?
My bitches take money

Thugger

These niggas ain't got no money to dress like I dress
These niggas don't show out and be oh so fresh
Got red bottoms for me and my chick
My camera man got red bottoms on 'cause I'm so rich
My bus driver wearing Louis 'cause I'm Gucci bitch
My chef got on Ferragamos, nigga cook that shit
I got that stupid bread, my mama don't got to want for shit
I bought a hard top Lamb, didn't even want the shit
1017 brick squad, bitch I own that shit
A nigga disrespect me, I can't condone that shit
I got a 10'O clock appointment at the office, trick
And pour a half a pint of lean in that coffee bitch
My bitches be running, they chasing that paper
I'll serve you like waiters, I'm high like a scraper
Put a hole in your head, you look like a pacer
I'm sliming, I'm coming, know why I look at you funny?
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money
My bitches take money10Embed
