6 ContributorsDirty Lyrics
And they all dirty (Ayy look inside the 'frigerator)
My 'frigerator full of sodas and they all dirty (Try to grab me a soda)
My 'frigerator full of sodas and they all dirty
My 'frigerator full of sodas and they all dirty (21)

My 'frigerator full of sodas and they all dirty (Mud)
My young niggas grab them yappers, make 'em all dirty (Blood)
These rappers gettin' old, I swear they all thirty (21, 21)
And I'm ballin' on these niggas like I'm James Worthy (Woo, woo, woo)
Aqua VVS diamonds on my neck and on my wrist (21)
I'm loyal to the gang, we ain't gon' fall out 'bout no bitch (21)
I'm sippin' on that mud like I got bronchitis (Like I got bronchitis, 21, 21)
And I'm boomin' shit like Al-Qaeda (21, 21)
Christian Louboutins, that's the wave now (That's the wave now)
Balmain jeans, that's the wave now (That's the wave now)
Tom Ford frames, that's the wave now (21, 21)
I'm rockin' out these chains like I'm a slave now (Bling, blaow)

You know them crackhouses was my playground (21, 21)
Talkin' down on the real nigga, get you sprayed down
I be runnin' out the bags, I don't play around (I don't play around)
I pick that backend up and then I turn around (21, 21)
These niggas switchin' sides, switchin' gangs now (Gangs now)
I used to sell crack but I got fans now (I got fans now)
I never asked a nigga for a handout (21, 21)
I get that cheque and then I split it with the fam now (21, 21)

Niggas don't wanna see me win and I know it (I know it)
Why I get that cheque, grab that cheque and I blow it
Fucked his baby mama first night, she was starstruck
That shit that's on my hip gon' wake you up, nigga Starbucks
She gon' suck a real nigga long, she got lockjaw
That money come and goin' back and forth like a seasaw (21)
Made me spill my double cup, that shit had me T'd off
Bitch I'm from the 6, you run up on me, blow ya knees off

My 'frigerator full of sodas and they all dirty (Mud)
My young niggas grab them yappers, make 'em all dirty (Blood)

And I'm boomin' shit like Al-Qaeda (21, 21)Embed
