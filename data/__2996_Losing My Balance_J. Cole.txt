43 ContributorsLosing My Balance Lyrics
Yeah, ugh, yeah
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, ugh
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, ugh
Yeah, ugh
Yeah, ugh

Miss High Profile, caught you shoppin' on Canal (Yeah)
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your makeup like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside, you thinking you the shit (Uh-huh)
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hope that this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
'Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell 'em "Go deep" like Cunningham
And you just let 'em OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it

Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance
Girl you losing your balance uh, yea
Don't slip and don't fall, uh
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on, uh
Don't lose your balance (Yeah, ugh)
Don't lose your balance (Ugh)

I look around at my city, this is Sinville
That boy 11 years old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wonderin' if we in hell
Or why do cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm 'bout to lose it, I just had another friend killed (Damn)
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul, I asked it "When will
This shit change?" It said, "Boy, just use them pen skills"
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you 'cause you my brother, so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals (Uh-huh), you niggas better dream (Yeah)
I know the hood raised you but it's bigger better things
And for those that passed, I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh

Yeah, and don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
My nigga, don't be losing your balance, uh, yeah
So don't slip and don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on (Yeah)
Don't lose your balance (Ugh)
Don't lose your balance (Yeah)
Ugh, I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal, I'm a
Sucka for love I guess, won't catch her up in the club 'cause she ain't into that (Nah)
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect (Uh-huh)
Other men would sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame 'em, did the same when I saw the ass
Matched with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homies beefin' 'cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang (Ugh)
They tell me that it's foul how a chick can make me switch
But man I can't help it dawg, her mind got me whipped

I think I'm losing my balance, uh
I think I'm losing my balance, yea
She got me losing my balance, uh
She got me losing my balance, yea
But I, I won't slip, nah, I won't fall, ugh
Just a get a grip and hold on, ugh
Losing my balance (Uh-huh)
