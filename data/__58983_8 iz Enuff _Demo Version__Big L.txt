8 Contributors8 iz Enuff (Demo Version) Lyrics
Ayyo folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin’ this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast when my Smith-Wes’ blast
So jus’ dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don’t get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smoke ‘cause these knuckles hurt
I’m from the alley not the valley
I’m hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I’d rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don’t hang with jive pals
Adiós, ghost, I’m five thous’

Flave it’s always easy for new bait
Taken here to groove quake
Make ya more addictin’ than tube steak
‘Cause when I work a line, nobody’s jerkin’ mine
So bring the noise an’ I’ll poison like turpentine
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass rubber, your rhymes left trash gutter
I’ll leave chumps done, don’t come with some junk son
‘Cause I’m makin’ flave niggas cool for consumption
I’m more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it’s too late for that lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow up
Sour luck, niggas got popped an’ swallowed nut
You might also like
On the mic, I rip the scene right
Terra just caught wreck, so I guess I got the green light
Niggas know about Herb McGruff
I’m on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
MCs are live but I’m mad liver
Ayyo my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this an’ get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice an’ peas
(Herb can you fight?) Yo I’m nice with these
Put up your dukes, then me an’ you cook raw
‘Cause I stand tall an’ kick ass like a football
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I’m the fuck up outta here

Ayyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I’ma melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews ‘cause I'm bad news
In a mad move I'm servin’ brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this an’ get your body blown
‘Cause I'm a no maricón for poems and slidin’ hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Ayyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin’ melon got niggas gellin’
Ayyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon
Yo I’m bustin’ chumps like a Glock ten, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill ya show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail kids get nailed and read Braille when they fail
Yeah and I’m nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, ayyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that’s sawed off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
For dissin’, you’ll come up missin’, like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like flesh ‘cause they sections say they slaughter son
Talk about nines an’ tecs an’ never shot a water gun
But Killa Kam I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease ‘cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin’ at least
Twenty police deceased, it’s the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats an’ black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain’t no light looks, you fight crooks
Left an’ right hooks, if you front, get your life took
I'm havin’ nail sharp pains in my brain like a hell raiser
I'm blazin’ trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin’ but lead
Boom bye-bye then find another batty boy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call ‘em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein’ heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up to keep my head straight

I should never rhyme ‘cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
‘Cause they know when I start droppin poems
That I be knockin’ domes, poppin’ bones and sendin’ niggas hoppin’ home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin’ to see me, nigga, bring a cast an’ crutches
And niggas, I don’t need a gun for you, none of you
‘Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my number two
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn they motherfuckin’ ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, ‘cause it's a fact friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a mac ten
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm ‘bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin’ it tough
Peace to Big L, ayyo, eight is enoughEmbed
