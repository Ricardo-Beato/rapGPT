I just- I just don't- I just- I just- I just don't know
I- I- I just- I just don't- I just- I just don't know what to do
I just- I just don't- I just- I just- I just don't know
I- I- I just- I just don't- I just- I just don't know what to do

I'm back, nigga, wassup? "Hop, how'd you get your buzz up?
I heard you signed over your soul to the Devil, is it true?" Nigga, shut the fuck up!
In my heart there ain't much love, so if you get bashed then that's tough luck
FV doin' shit so big, haters, I'm on your side now, nigga, fuck us! It's Knock Madness
Yeah, I'm back up in this, I'm a real nice nigga but I rap with vengeance
Only got bad intentions and I'm lookin' for a new mouth that my nutsack can fit in
I look like an idiot to grab attention but my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses
It's bad for business, I'm lackin' senses, feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension
Stepped in this bitch to wreck so don't disrespect
I promise that it'd be a big regret
I'll twist ya neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch
I chop niggas up, yeah, I learned it from Tech
I got hoes all over that wanna give me dome
They all yellin', "Hopsin, you turn me on"
But I feel like it's the Devil tryna get me, woah
And I don't wanna do it, nigga, send me home
Nigga, I'm so cool (Cool), but I feel so low (Low)
See, I got a crew (Crew), but I feel solo
I cruise (Cruise), but the wheels don't roll (Woah)
You feel what I'm sayin'? (Uh?) Shit, neither do I (Nah)
I'mma give you niggas one more album then after that
It's peace out, man, I'm leavin' you guys, you know why?
You might also like
The world made me feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah yeah)
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hopsin is doomed, locked in a room, spaced out like a little pop of the shrooms
God lit a fuse, now I gotta make a decision and I don't really know which Hopsin to choose
I'm a big wreck, did you not get the news? I made a million bucks but did not get abused
How did I manage to get robbed from the truth? Maybe I should've never went and dropped outta school
"It's not that bad, you're okay, kid, cheer up!"
But I got a life that I ain't too sure of (Yup)
Swagger lookin' just like Ace Ventura
Can't look at myself, I might break this mirror (Shit! Fuck! Fuck!)
I'm paranoid, I panic over every little scary noise
See, when I go to pick up the phone and tell friends about it
They won't answer 'cause they're annoyed
I'm like "Ugh..."
I put a porno on 'cause my life ain't awesome, man (Yeah, yeah)
Jack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again (Yeah, yeah)
Then repeat the cycle
Can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on
You don't know how many fuckin' demons I know
Maybe I should go and try to read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)
I don't even like rap, only thing I wanted was just to be cool (Be cool)
And hang out with a group of friends and solve mysteries like I'm Scooby-Doo (-By Doo)
But I got way more than I bargained for
You can't kill when your heart is sore
I'm so mad I could start a war
So fuck Hopsin, man, I don't even know who I are no more
I feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If ya got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Holler at your boy if you know somebody

Man, y'all niggas tryin' to kill my vibe, lately don't nobody feel my rhymes
Dizzy blowin' up, tryin' to steal my shine, I'm all outta ammo, my skills just died
But, "Oh my God, I love 'Ill Mind 5'! The one where the dumb skippity bums get high
That there changed my whole entire life, you make more tings like that, I'll buy!"
Well, I got news for you, my screws are loose, I'll tell ya
This rap thing here's what I used to do, now I'm movin' to Australia
When I go ghost, I'mma get a house on the Gold Coast, yellin' "YOLO" on a couch, feelin' so dope
Livin' low pro so these foul niggas don't know, I'll be struttin' around like "Hell yeah"
Man, I'm losin' my mind! But y'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme
See, I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin but I get depressed when the two intertwine
Truthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be
Nobody cares so I use the beats
To talk to so I lose the heat
I'm cut bad and the bruise is deep, is there anything you can do for me?
The world made me feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If ya got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Holler at your boy if you know somebody

Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Holler at your boy if you know somebody
Holler at your boy if you know somebody63Embed
