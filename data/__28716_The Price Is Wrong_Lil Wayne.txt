11 ContributorsThe Price Is Wrong Lyrics
She stole my heart, she ran away
Now I'm heartless, so fuck her anyway
We got along, she got away
The price is wrong, but she gotta pay

We used to be the coolest couple back in high school
High school, my school, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now she going out with some nigga named Michael
Okay, rifle, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We used to be the nastiest couple on the school yard
Backyard, your yard, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But now you just a nasty motherfucker, baby, who are
You are, you are, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And everybody know that the tables turned (Yeah)
And what you gonna do when the tables burned (Yeah)
And now you all up in my face
Pleadin' your case, and I'm like
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, ok-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay

Now I'm heartless, so fuck her anyway

She used to be the cutest ever up in my class

But now she kissin' any motherfucker with a hall pass
So she skippin y'all class, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I used to be the baddest motherfucker in the lunchroom
Classroom, her room, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But now I graduated from you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

And everybody know that the tables turned (Yeah)
And what you gonna do when the tables burned (Yeah)
And now you all up in my face
