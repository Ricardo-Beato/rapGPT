4 ContributorsRidinâ€™ in My Chevy Lyrics
Ridin in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light
At the light, I got kush in my blood
Sippin Remy keep it pimpin with my pinky off the cut
And all the people when they see me like, "Snoop, turn it up!"

When I'm ridin in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light
At the light, I got kush in my blood
Sippin Remy keep it pimpin with my pinky off the cut
And all the people when they see me like, "Snoop, turn it up!"

I'm in my zone muh'fucker
Get stuck in the ribs by a old bone crusher
Two-tone leather with the soul of a hustler
Tryin to stack mayo, stealin clothes from my brother
People wanna know am I close to my mother
I'm a premature baby, I'm ahead of the others
Yes, I'm aware of the gutter
Ahead of my time, the game's gettin smothered
I stay on the grind but it's only gettin rougher
Niggas think I'm playin 'til they smokin like a muffler
'Bout to take flight, the lane open on you bustas
Catch me if you can in a world full of suckas
Niggas keep simpin, they wanna be Usher
Until they get their eyes and coffin closed by the usher
Them punches won't work, you need mo' muster
Lord lay him down, he need no sufferin, nigga

Hmm, on my road to riches
I done seen a lot of roaches and bitches
That's why the Dogg keep, goin the distance
But niggas don't know when to listen, that's why I load ammunition
And stay in touch with my competition, I'm in touch with my composition
Roll a blunt, it's the kush, yeah we got prescriptions
Just a G5, no encryptions
Pick a side, yeah you know we Crip'n
And through my eyes I see the world different
100 G's to record wit him, hit the gas give me more engine
This is somethin that was born in him
No game for a bitch, just forfeit him
I'm in tune, give me more rhythm
I let the bullets and the swords hit him
All P's like a Porsche emblem
Now make dead with the mortician
Nigga, this Bigg Snoop Dogg you best to listen
Ya heard me?
