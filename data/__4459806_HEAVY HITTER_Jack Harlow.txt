22 ContributorsHEAVY HITTER Lyrics
Ah, tell me what the, ah, ah, ah
Oh, you got me sounding good too, ayy
Will Will

Okay, tell me what the deal is, you know I'm the illest
She from California, said she don't know where the 'Ville is
Shout out to the hometown, I know that they gon' feel this
When I hit the club, I walk in with a small village, and
Nothing's off limits
When you got the sauce, you know they running off with it
Now she actin' freaky, she was coming off timid at first
But I guess it really wasn't authentic, yes, sir
Now she got me, ooh, doin' somersaults in it
Know these fellas always talking but they weren't involved with it
I like me some women, not a bunch of sausages
I put in the work, I know that some of y'all didn't, yes, sir
And they come in all sizes, uh
We got new horizons
I guess I might as well dive in
No, it's not surprisin' the way you switched up
I used to kick it with the kids that rocked that Osiris
Used to rock a patch like a pirate
The garden still private
Drama got a Bentley, let me drive it
I'm a heavy hitter, Darryl Isaacs
You might also like
And we rocking from side to side
Tell me now if you're trying to ride with me
You know I can find some time just to get
In tune with you, ayy, ayy, ayy
Used to be the one that I idolized
Now I can't see you the same as I used to
I guess I need me a ride or die
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too

Late nights, head hurtin'
Open up the red curtains
You don't love me, you just networkin'
I'm still trying to be the best version of me
I got a whip plus room in the front seat
And it's so up-scene
She make me look like 2010 Kris Humphries
Y'all been getting too comfy
I been spending my time going off
Just in case you're wondering, never just one drink
Eighty proof all up in my bloodstream
Used to talk shit, now I wonder what they must think
Blame it on the crushed dreams that we used to all have
All I know is that we can't fall back now
And we rocking from side to side
Tell me now if you're trying to ride with me
You know I can find some time just to get
In tune with you, ayy, ayy, ayy
Used to be the one that I idolized
Now I can't see you the same as I used to
I guess I need me a ride or die
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too

Do too
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too
Do too, do too
I know you get, sicker, games, too
Know you get, know you get, know you get
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too3Embed
