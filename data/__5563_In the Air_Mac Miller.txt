19 ContributorsIn the Air Lyrics
They know it, but I do, I do (Okay)
Fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude (Uh-huh)
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air

I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air

Hey, everything good right now
Little bit of molly make the boy bite down
Thinkin' I could finally figure out my style on the stage
Lookin' at a big hype crowd
(They go insane when I run out on the stage)
'Cause we don't give a fuck, don't need to act our age, hey
When I'm old, I'ma spend my days
Layin' with my girl on the beach in the shade
Have every single thing I can name
Thank God everyday I don't sleep in the rain
Blessed with some success, so I'ma try my best to
Live my life right, when I see God, he'll be impressed 'cause
I've been on my grind, thinkin' I'll be fine if I take my time
Workin' so hard, might break my spine
So all y'all see this face of mine
There's different ways to shine, I'ma find my own
Know when I disappear, I'ma find my way back home 'cause...

I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air

Days go by, and I think that I
May be goin' crazy, maybe lose my mind
Lookin' at a constellation
Me and God have a conversation
God and I, sorry about the lingo
Just kick it in the cut, playin' bingo
I be all over the beat like Ringo
Look sweet, honey bee gonna sting though
I'm here, wanna do my thing
You can roll no matter who you bring
Like your wifey wanna lose that ring
I don't pay her no mind
I just want, I just want, I just want the paper
Bring the game, just a little more flavor
Say, "What up?", take a flick with a hater
Throw a deuce like, "See you later"
Ha, that's funny, all I really want is a little cash money
Then life gonna be so sweet
Nah, it ain't a hotel, ha-ha-ha
Yeah, nah, it ain't a hotel
I'm next, shh, don't tell, ha
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the airEmbed
