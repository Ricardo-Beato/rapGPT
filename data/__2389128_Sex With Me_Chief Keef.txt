18 ContributorsSex With Me Lyrics
In Beverly Hills, riding 'Raris
Shawty said she wanna do some Molly
I told that bitch that I do ecstasy
Now baby, is you gon' have sex with me?
In Beverly Hills, riding 'Raris
Shawty said she wanna do some Molly
I told that bitch that I do ecstasy
Now baby, is you gon' have sex with me?

Riding 'round Miami on cars
What I'm in? That fucking red 'Rari
Then I take a trip to Lil Haiti
Hop out, the zoes on my safety
I was riding in a coupe
Me and Bally too
Then Ballout done brought a tool
Then we hit that other mall with a scope
Danced in it too
And I'm taking tours
I won't show up to your show
Unless you talking 'bout some rolls
I want fifty G's
You ain't got fifty G's, please
Don't talk to me
Bitch, don't offer me
Got thirty fucking G's
Bitch, I got thirty in my jeans
I spent thirty on some weed
Ship it up to the city
Windy city
Got my thirty up on me
And the birdies up on me
You heard it's on me
They know that it's on me
You might also like
In Beverly Hills, riding 'Raris
Shawty said she wanna do some Molly
I told that bitch that I do ecstasy
Now baby, is you gon' have sex with me?
In Beverly Hills, riding 'Raris
Shawty said she wanna do some Molly
I told that bitch that I do ecstasy
Now baby, is you gon' have sex with me?

I told 12 Million, Glo up
Don't get slow bucks, get Glo bucks
You be on the Glo tour bus
And we got about fifty shots
And we got about fifty thots
Think we just seen 'bout fifty opps
Time to let off fifty shots
Can you get 9 shots like 50?
Bitch, I turn a penny into 50
G's, ayy
Got young jeans in my jeans
Got that heat in my jeans
Got your bitch in my jeans
She tryna suck me
She tryna love me
I ain't got time for lovey
All I got time for is money
In Beverly Hills, riding 'Raris
Shawty said she wanna do some Molly
I told that bitch that I do ecstasy
Now baby, is you gon' have sex with me?
In Beverly Hills, riding 'Raris
Shawty said she wanna do some Molly
I told that bitch that I do ecstasy
Now baby, is you gon' have sex with me?3Embed
