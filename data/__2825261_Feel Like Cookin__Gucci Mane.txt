Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Egg beater shawty make the crack rock cook it
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Egg beater shawty make the crack rock cookies

Shows ever slow up, trap always bunking
Stupid guap stupid dope, fat, always cooking
Folks in our business the feds keep lookin'
Linebacker goons hit hoes like Keith Brooking
Don’t call my phone pussy nigga that shit took
I’m a crook, I can get ya knocked off for a rock
I put pills on the block, got them deals on the blocks
In the kitchen over egg beater standing over pots
When I drop it one time, Man I call that shit the drop
63 grams dawg come and get it while its hot
60 hours later and a nigga still cooking
Couple million dollars later and a nigga still crooked

Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Egg beater shanty make the crack rock cook it
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Egg beater shawty make the crack rock cookies

Another club gone another eighteen bands
The trap house so hot need eighteen fans
Push so much dope I need eighteen hands
18 years old working 18 pans, 18 grand, times one times ten
Got 18 blocks then I got my ass in
If they put me in the pen then I’mma try to jump the fence
Cooking dope like a fool got some off white tan
And some bricked up white and some straight drop glass
Give a stretch to a blast it’ll put you on your ass
Give a brick for the cash charge you seventeen bands

Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Egg beater shanty make the crack rock cook it
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Egg beater shawty make the crack rock cookies

I feel like I live club trapping got me iced up
Digi scales right up, Jacob watch bright up
Old clique right up, club owners invite us
Gucci king midas, call me your highness
Cooking up a nine up, Gucci Mane love to re up
Early morning d up, whipping up a three some
Gucci stepped it up dog, but its still powder
Cooked up crack got the money and the power
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cooking
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cooking
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cooking
Egg beater shanty make the crack rock cook it
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cooking
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cooking
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cooking
Egg beater shanty make the crack rock cook it3Embed
