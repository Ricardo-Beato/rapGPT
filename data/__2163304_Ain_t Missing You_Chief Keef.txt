40 ContributorsAinâ€™t Missing You Lyrics
Bang bang
Gang gang
Bang bang
Gang gang
Bang bang

I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

I was sittin' at home, I was rollin' a blunt
I was thinkin' 'bout you been dead gone
Got a call from my boys like, "Your cousin is dead"
I was like, "He couldn't had his head on"
I be suited, I be booted, ready for anything
Give me the TECs then I'll hit home
I pull up, get that check, when I leave best believe
On the freeway I'm headin' home
I done partied, I done sipped Bacardi
Rollin' with Blood, we done crashed all the parties
We done rode Ferraris, rode Lamborghinis
Now only thing that I care about is breathing
Why I go hard, Blood be the reason
Wouldn't want me to quit even if I was bleedin'
Gotta take charge, every four seasons
Every month, every day and every weekend
You might also like
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

I bet you remember posted on the block
All we knew was shots
We ain't really know about the guap
All we knew was Glocks
I remember when you called my phone tweakin'
You got your first deal, you was geekin'
Remember when I got my first deal, I hit you on the phone
Like for now I am Chief Sosa Yeezus
You was like, "Nah you're Almighty"
Almighty don't like nobody
Shootin' .40 cals, now we gettin' 40
Bands for a show and we stay 'til the morning
God chose us, and gave it up
Dead or alive, niggas still hatin' us
It's the end of the quarter, I'm a rock with sticky D
I'ma pass the pall to you and you can hang it up

I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
No matter what I might say
No matter what you might say
No matter what I say
No matter what your friends say
No matter what our friends say
No matter what, what I say
No matter what, what I say
Just know this, I miss you Big Glo56Embed
