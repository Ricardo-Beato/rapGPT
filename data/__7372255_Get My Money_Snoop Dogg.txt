5 ContributorsGet My Money Lyrics
(ProHoeZak music)

Get your ass off TikTok, doin' that nasty dance
Bitch, get my money (Uh)
Get up, get your ass off IG (IG), all in the camera all day
Bitch, get my money, bitch, get my money (Uh)
Get it good now, turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Turn that shit off and shake your ass (Woo)
Turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Get my money, bitch, make it fast

Break bread or fake dead and kill it back
All greens, by all means, we into that
Front, back, run it up, now run it back
For a repost, cuz, I need a hundred racks
Top dollar, hip-hop, the Impala
No bark, all bite, Rottweiler
Test him out, stressed him out, no
Popped him out and stretched him out, oh
(Get it good now)
Time keeps slippin'
These bitches in my DM but I can't pay attention
They wishin' and itchin', a message to you bitches
If you really wanna shine, get up off that timeline
TikTokin' with no money in your pocket
On the 'Gram all day, girl, stop it
I'm tryna get you some game, you lame
You bitches love doin' somethin' strange for a little change
You might also like
Get your ass off TikTok, doin' that nasty dance
Bitch, get my money (Uh)
Get up, get your ass off IG (IG), all in the camera all day
Bitch, get my money, bitch, get my money (Uh)
Get it good now, turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Turn that shit off and shake your ass (Woo)
Turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Turn that shit off and shake your ass (Woo)
Turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Get my money, bitch, make it fast

Na-na-na-na-na-na, I fucked your baby mama
(What up, though?)
Nevermind that, find that correct angle
He's a squareâ€”bitch, I'm a rectangle
Don't be a stranger to danger, my anger ranges
Filter to filter, your face is changin'
As strange as it is
I keep makin', you keep shakin'
(Get it good now)
Rollin' through, you're scrollin' through your phone
Thirsty trap, you thirsty rat, you're wrong
First to clap, I snatch your purse and gone
Knick knack patty wack, take that bitch home
The way that she dance, I'm gon' take that bitch home
Show her my zone then I make that bitch moan
This how we dance when we hear this song
Don't take your phone, you won't be here that long
Get your ass off TikTok, doin' that nasty dance
Bitch, get my money (Uh)
Get up, get your ass off IG (IG), all in the camera all day
Bitch, get my money, bitch, get my money (Uh)
Get it good now, turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Turn that shit off and shake your ass (Woo)
Turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Turn that shit off and shake your ass (Woo)
Turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Get my money, bitch, make it fast
Turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Turn that shit off and shake your ass (Woo)
Turn that shit off and move your ass (Uh)
Get my money, bitch, make it fast

Make that money, don't let it make you
If you hustle like Dogg and you get it times two
Def Jam Records, nigga, thought you knew
Make that money, don't let it make you
If you hustle like Dogg and you get it times two
Def Jam Records, nigga, thought you knew
(Get it good now)Embed
