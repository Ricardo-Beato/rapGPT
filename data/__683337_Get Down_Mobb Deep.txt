6 ContributorsGet Down Lyrics
Background
In the background
Uh (Uh, uh)

I get you up, stick you up, cut you up
Gut you up, hit you up, touch you up
Bust you up, fuck you up
La dada di, yeah do
A million rip riders all draped in blue
Now follow my lead, all ya'll fall on your knees
Hands up to the sky with your head down low
Hopin' and wishin' I miss you with the chrome four-four
Prayin' for my enemies 'cause them not know
Oh no, here comes the bad guy
I spit the truth like your rabbi
Ain't no witnesses the way that I been flippin' this
Now what's infinite is I'm magnificent
And I mob deep everywhere that I been
Shouts out to my homies in the motherfuckin' pen
Yeah, still off the juice and gin
Twenty years later, cousin, and I'm at it again

Off top, guns pop, infamous Mobb Deep
We get down, baby, we get down
Off top, panties drop, honeys wanna roll with me
It's going down, baby, it's going down
Off top, guns pop, infamous Mobb Deep
We get down, baby, we get down
Off top, panties drop, honeys wanna roll with me
It's going down, baby, it's going down

Yeah, I hear a lot of noise in the background (Background)
So who I got to attack now? (Now)
I'm more wilder than this rap crowd (Rap crowd)
Talkin' out your ass, leave you assed out (Asses out)
I'm mob all day nigga (Nigga)
Front on my niggas, I let it spray. nigga (Nigga)
Hammer on my waist, know that way bigger (Way bigger)
Hit you anorexic like I'm way thicker (Thicker)
Stay in your lane, son (Son)
That wasn't you from day one (From day one)
Out wildin' the drug money we cake from (Cake from)
Out wildin', profilin', it ain't nothin' (Nothin')
Long story short niggas know what it is
And what it ain't, put the hammer to your ribs (Ribs)
And ain't nothin' 'bout it glitzy (Glitzy)
'Til the wheels fall of or the feds come get me (Get me)

Off top, guns pop, infamous Mobb Deep

Off top, panties drop, honeys wanna roll with me
It's going down, baby, it's going down
Off top, guns pop, infamous Mobb Deep
We get down, baby, we get down
Off top, panties drop, honeys wanna roll with me
It's going down, baby, it's going down
New York nigga, hoodie rap, never say weak shit
On my worst day, I get off, nigga, I eat this
Best niggas in rap, that Mobb Deep shit
I'll spit a vicious verse, you bite, you be teethless
I live a vicious life, trife and real devious
I leave you outside butt naked like a hedonist
I insist, make a move, flinch
Please, nigga, I am dyin' to use this
New toy I bought fresh out the plaster
Revenge, fucker, like I'm fresh out the bandage
Back from the dead, thought it was a wrap, huh?
May lead caps hit your head like a Mac truck
I am too good
They labeled me a legend and I'm right where I should
I'm right where I'm supposed to, lampin', holdin' my dick
My feet up, talkin' on the phone with my bitch
Another hundred thou', do the mathematics
Another man down, killin' these rappers
Do the mathematics
Another man down, killin' these rappers

Off top, guns pop, infamous Mobb Deep
We get down, baby, we get down
Off top, panties drop, honeys wanna roll with me
It's going down, baby, it's going down
Off top, guns pop, infamous Mobb Deep
We get down, baby, we get down
Off top, panties drop, honeys wanna roll with me
It's going down, baby, it's going down
Off top, guns pop, infamous Mobb Deep
We get down, baby, we get down
Off top, panties drop, honeys wanna roll with me
It's going down, baby, it's going down
Off top, guns pop, infamous Mobb Deep
We get down, baby, we get down
Off top, panties drop, honeys wanna roll with me
It's going down, baby, it's going downEmbed
