Shimmy, shimmy, ya, bitch, I get money like ODB
Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, I'm finally eatin' good, no EBT
Shimmy, shimmy, yay, do this every day
Never play, bottles on the way, sip somethin' and stay up
Ya— bitch, I get money like— ya— get money like ODB
Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, I'm eatin' good, no EBT
Ya— never play, bottle— play, bottles on the way
Sip somethin' and— sip somethin' and stay up (Ayy)

Fuck how you feel, I'm breakin' the seal
Just got out my deal, I'm keepin' it real
A quarter million, that's my automobile
That thing in the glove, I need it concealed
Why I gotta rap like this to get y'all to pay attention?
I ain't mad at the money I got, but some of y'all just don't got attention
To detail, broke niggas shop retail
Buyin' Goyard on a resale
Fuck all that, I'ma rap where the— rap where the heart at
I've been buildin' this shit from the ground up
Fifty Ms what I'm— Ms what I'm worth if I round up
'Cause I do— 'Cause I do
Fifty M's what I'm worth if I round up
'Cause I do what I love

Shimmy, shimmy, ya, bitch, I get money like ODB
Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, I'm finally eatin' good, no EBT
Shimmy, shimmy, yay, do this every day
Never play, bottles on the way, sip somethin' and stay up
Ya— bitch, I get money like— ya— get money like ODB
Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, I'm eatin' good, no EBT
Ya— never play, bottle— play, bottles on the way
Sip somethin' and— sip somethin' and stay up (Uh, uh, badmon!)

Yeah, came a long way, I went from EBT to BET
Had to spread love the Brooklyn way, that's word to B.I.G. 
Face ID the only thing I need to hit the VIP
They be like, "Wait, who that be?" (Bitch) That be Himothy
Shimmy, shimmy, ya, when I'm shakin' up the enemies
Ooh, I like it raw, when I'm faded off the Hennessy
Tell me who want war? Watch me turn 'em to a memory
I am not the one, I'm just the one that they pretend to be (Yee, yee)
When I'm gone, they gon' remember me (Yee, yee)
What the fuck you think you tellin' me?
Five bitches faded off the 'caine, I call 'em Danity
Bitch, I think I'm ODB, I might just plead insanity

Shimmy, shimmy, ya, bitch, I get money like ODB
Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, I'm finally eatin' good, no EBT
Shimmy, shimmy, yay, do this every day
Never play, bottles on the way, sip somethin' and stay up
Ya— bitch, I get money like— ya— get money like ODB
Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, I'm eatin' good, no EBT
Ya— never play, bottle— play, bottles on the way
Sip somethin' and— sip somethin' and stay up2Embed
