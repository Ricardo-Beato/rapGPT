4 ContributorsThis Is Not Supposed To Be Positive... - Intro Lyrics
This is not supposed to be positive
This music is negative because the streets are negative
Ya know?
So, in the record, you're gonna hear violence
You're gonna hear aggressive behavior by individuals that lived that lifestyle out
Ya know?
That's like tellin' somebody like Stephen King
"well make a horror movie with a happy ending"-
They don't have happy endings, it's a horror movie
It's supposed to end horrible
See?
And this is what I do, so people are gonna - that like me - are gonna be really shocked when they hear my new record
Cause its gonna scare the shit out of 'emYou might also likeEmbed
