12 ContributorsReflections Lyrics
Look at your face
When all I could see was myself looking back at me
Reflection
And all I could do was think about sleeping next to you

What would it take to make a woman like you
View a wolf like me for what I really might be
Listening to lyrics, only hears what I allow
You gotta try and make me testify for here and right now
Let's have a confrontation over a cold one
I'll give you conversation just to see if you can hold 'em
I play so dumb
Because I know some of these star-struck small talk art fucks is no fun
I'm the blood type that goes straight for the guns
Like before you even spoke already knew what your love's like
So what you thinking?
Because I'm thinking we should jump into your ocean
Let's go girl, this ship is sinking


Now there's no reason to lie, I've had a lot of lovers
In my reality, it's impossible to avoid it
But there's one reason for life: gotta provide some supper
Gonna build a family just to watch someone destroy it
Do you really think you really wanna get to know me better?
Don't you see the drama? Don't you feel the pressure?
Don't get me wrong, it would be my pleasure
To sing a song that could remove your shoes and your sweater
Bartender, let me get a shot of Beam
Cause this girl over here is trying to get me out my jeans
And she doesn't seem to believe I'm just another thief
Came to take a piece and make you stutter when you breathe
Now girl you too smart to be a tour mark
Set to play correct from the start with your pure heart
And when you're all alone, I'll sing into your phone
If you don't know the words you can make up your own
You might also likeThe first time she met the devil was at First Avenue
Went backstage with him into the dressing room
Sexy ego trip, taller than expected
About six foot three
Seemed to thrive on his misery
Critical, observant, big words
Sweaty hair, sunken eyes, and thick nerves
She said "I'll make him smile for the simple fact that he needs it
I'll make him smile just so I can kill it, and eat it"
You look like you were built for me
You talk like you want to steal my drink
You kiss like you already came
And that's a "Lifter Puller" line for those without any game
It's like damn baby
You know you can't save me
But you should still tell your people that you're leaving with the band
Maybe you can show me your hustle
Neither one of us would be so lonely
If only you would come over here and hold me
I caught you trying to hide your smile behind your glass
But all of your secrets become a swing set when you laugh
And all of your regrets that you're carrying or burying
Don't mean a damn thing if there's nobody to share them with
We've been following each other all night now
We ought to be all over each other like right now
I don't like crowds, let's take flight now
Cause that face that you make
Reminds me of my life now

"Only trying to find myself inside of you"1Embed
