43 ContributorsLabor Lyrics"This is labor" {*Echoes*}
{*Sample cut and scratched*}
Who put the monkey wrench in well-oiled perfectionist emblem
Just to watch these monitors spit white noise through your office space
Automater, I infect jolly gene pool descendant clown-clusters
Brushing dust mites off your starving art revolution sound jugglers
Delinquent friend from brick habitat
Bob, weave, stick, move, fence
And pause somewhere in the middle for slick invention
This years brain crops spread spectacular, I ain't mad at ya
Don't stay mad at the caliber (I twist characters like Twist characters)
Tally up the alley cat aggression in this Doug E. Fresh infested
Mess of bass line lust and automatic b-boy Krylon can combust circuit
Working these war pig cyphers with Ted Striker stability
And kamikaze chivalry
I alone noble in a worm food feud
Walking dead generation
Ain't nobody asking for your patience
The grand opening holding me to face the fact
I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else
(Talk about labor)
Fantastic planet urchin putting work in
Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversion
Apologies won't lure me to the communal sob story
Nor will I sacrifice live style to benefit jury temperament
This old Green Goblin web cutter butts up against
Crayola daydream landscape spitting bedlam. Dead 'em
Charge the villagers nickels and nicotine to watch him fed to
One disgruntled kraken at high noon
We'll sell popcorn beer and balloons
I got an inkling this gon' be the one the children bicker over
It's that Warriors vs. Baseball Fury element
To glitch his motor sensory development
I am a star, really
That Big Bang bastard's back with a one-way ticket to beat street
This all is like, relevant to human kind supply/demand ratios, man, learn it
I work past the surface
I work on what I love, I work to service all my burdens
And I'll work until this here little flat line closes the curtainsYou might also like13Embed
