Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
Talk to me
Talk to me, yeah

Ladies love cool Nas with a tight fade
And I ain't make it past the ninth grade
And I ain't need to have one diamond to bag a dime (Yeah)
And I ain't need a dollar to holler, I made her mine (Yeah)
A rich dude' wife stayed on my block talking to me
Like she ain't scared to get knocked, and she wore all this jewelry
What she see in me? She look like Sheila E
She looked like she could be ten years older easily
Her name was - oh well, I don't kiss and tell
But she must've ran her mouth
'Cause every time me and her man cross paths (What's that?)
It's tension in the air, he probably doin' the math
Late night, she ventin' to me, say he doin' her bad
And I ain't feel a way about it (Yeah), told her pray about it
When I crush and she go back home, I hate the silence
Writin' in my notepad, flippin' through soul samples (Uh)
Not knowin' I could get caught in a whole scandal

A serious situation we all go through
Yeah, we all go through (We all go through, we all go through)
A serious situation we all go through
We all, we all (Uh, it's too serious)

I ain't have to drive a Rolls and I took off her clothes
I ain't have to have a house and I was strippin' her down (Yeah)
I was switchin' 'em out, (Yeah) ig'nant amounts (Yeah)
I guess that's how I was movin', can't say I was proud
Since the days of public school when I was a scruffy dude
I ran with the troubled youth (Yeah) had shorties and lovers, true
Many had got jealous before I was top sellin'
Before I had touched a million (Okay), few niggas caught feelings
Few niggas bought pussy, few of 'em bought gifts
And I ain't do none of that, she blew me a soft kiss (Mwah)
But now she want something more, I'm ready to call it quits
The one I'm with right now, who I'm gettin' lost in

A serious situation we all go through (A serious, yeah)
(Yeah, we all go through) We all go through (Said we all go through)
A serious situation we all go through
(When I risk it all for you)
I said, a serious situation we all go through
(Yeah, we all go through) We all go through (We go through)
A serious situation we all go through

Anything can happen now that you're my baby
Yeah, I be gripping on you crazy
Haven't we all, I was havin' a ball
Oh yeah, a serious situation, we all go through, yeah
Damn, mami, you sexy
I love the thickness, I'd bite you too
Don't act like that with a back like that, uh2Embed
