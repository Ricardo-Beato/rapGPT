3 ContributorsThanxiety LyricsI exhale like I'm breathing out for those without the option
I do believe in monsters that's why I never treat you like a monster
What kind of offering will you be offering
There's really nothing keeping you from leaving with your sponsors
There must be something in the waters
I'll meet you at the faucet and we can keep it talkative
Tell me all about your positives make a couple promises
That's how I got lost in your awesomeness
But I'm the oppositе of flawless
I'm just a sack full of testosteronе and confidence
I was my momma's kid I never felt anonymous
Sometimes you gotta stop and try to smell your own accomplishmentsYou might also likeEmbed
