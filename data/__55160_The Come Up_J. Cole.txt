32 ContributorsThe Come Up Lyrics
I'm on The Come Up
Chill nigga, don't run up
A yellow nigga, finna rise and shine like the sun up
My mind on that paper, I ain't trying to wife the slut up
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't trying to wipe a crumb up
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up
Uh, don't shed a tear if a nigga might get done up
But, just say a prayer if a nigga might confront us
'Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up
You coming to the 'Ville? You need to get a license from us
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up
No pain no gain, my nigga, I just numb up
I blow brains, Cobain a nigga if he jump up
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up
This is cocaine on flame, baking soda and water
And if you feel that then I guess I sell crack, get it?
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy
Shitting on niggas like a nigga was still a baby
Carolina nigga shout-out to the 'Ville that raised me
So many hoes whipped, you would've thought we still in slavery
And niggas still sleepin' they feelin' lazy
Uh, a killer maybe, you make me I will
Cheat me on my scrilla, I send you to meet Dilla
From them NC streets where the beef they deliver
And the clip is on E 'cause your chest got a fill up
While a nigga like me is just getting head like a pillow
Bread like gorillas getting bred
So long as my momma and my niggas getting fed
Fuck what a nigga said, man, I'm Fayettenam bombing
'Cause hatred is flattery you bitch niggas is charmin'
Who the fuck you harmin'? Boy, ya'll niggas is charmin'
And I'm armed and waiting for a target
You fucking with the best like Carmen
Aw shit, pardon a nigga for departing
I'm just getting green like a yard or a garden
A nigga finna blow while you niggas is false alarmin'
And just think, man, I was raised on ramen
Chicken noodle soup, now I'm filet mignon-in'
I promised my momma I was coming to make this money
And I swear I'm going to kill the nigga that try to take it from me
You might also like
Yeah, that's real talk, nigga
It's J. Cole, nigga
Therapist whatever the fuck you wanna call him, it don't matter
You know, I'll make y'all niggas understand man
I know you can't believe yourself right now
You thinkin' this niggas from the south, hahaha
He can't spit, how the fuck is he so good?
Open your eyes motherfucker, can you see? Niggas on top
Yup, we on top7Embed
