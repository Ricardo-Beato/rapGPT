50 ContributorsI Got You (Always and Forever) Lyrics
Five, six, seven
I got you, you've got me
I don't care what people might say
I know you know
I've got you
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Do it for the 1-9 love, 1-9
For the 1-9, for the 1-9 love
Do it for the 1-9
We do it, we do it for the 1-9 love

Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with a grain of sand
Or leave it all up to me, I got you always

Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always

We do it for the 1-9 love, 1-9
For the 1-9, for the 1-9 love
Do it for the 1-9
We do it, we do it for the 1-9 love
We do it for the 1-9
Ooh, I've got you, oh-oh-oh

Ayy, call me Young Mister, Mister Tongue Twister
Niggas couldn't touch the flow if they was playing Twister, right
A minute in it, they turn to Sonny Liston, right
It's plenty of pullin' up, I'm gettin' blisters
Ever since I kissed her
Everyone seem like they got something to say
Like the day after the big day
Is supposed to be super bad like we won't stay
It's supposed to be super scary like we don't pray
We treat the bad advice like bad breath
Either give a compliment or couple mints, depends what we have left
Findin' good news in the bad press
Tell 'em break a leg like an actress, hit with a jab step
1-9 love, that's forever, it'll never stop
1-9 Love, that's a record I'll never drop, uh
1-9 love, that's a one time love
That's a one time, one time, every time it'll be the
Lot of folks share they opinions
Same folks so easy offended
One thing I'll always remember
They here today, but we'll be together forever
Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with (Take it all with), a grain of sand
Or leave it all up to me (Leave it all up to me), I got you always

Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always (I got you, oh-oh-oh)

It's been a minute, I've been messin' with ya, I could never switch up
Turn my life around, I'm tryna go to Heaven with ya
I would sit there in the waiting room together with ya
Magazines, pat my jeans, have a beverage with ya
Count my blessings with ya
They prefer success less than when we stress, bet
Forget about all the drama and the comments they left
Out rightly fine, the bottom line is right on top of they text
You gotta remember that the enemy is not of the flesh
You gotta remember that our imagery is made from the best
So pray for the best
Hands high, caught the garter, caught the Hail Mary
Married, tossed the veil, moved to Fort Lauderdale
1-9 to 9-1, that's the goal
9-1 dash, that's the soul
Can't keep track of lies that they told
So extra in the background, that's they role, but
Lot of folks share they opinions
Same folks so easy offended
One thing I'll always remember
They here today, but we'll be together forever
Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with (Take it all with), a grain of sand
Or leave it all up to me, I got you always

Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always

I got you, you've got me
I don't care what people might say
I know you know
I've got you always1Embed
