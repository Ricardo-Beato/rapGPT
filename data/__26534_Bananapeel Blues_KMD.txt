Mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm
Yeah this here's blues joint
A lot of brothers don't like this joint
Cause it might not be funk or funky (teach anyway, teach)
It's more tribal
And speaking to my only two real tribes out there now
With the help of the Kause, yo Kause y'all with me? (yeah yeah)
Hmm? Aight, so we feel to build open, the bananapeel blues
Check it
The original man is the black man true? (true true true)
Presented to the youth, is more than nuff proof
But when one mixes truth with a goof
Caused this contradiction and confusion so I raise the roof (raise it)
Tongue to truth, it may sound like a good hand to feed from
But follow this lead, we need to find what's true indeed
Some get caught up in the thought of intellect
And say he helped us, when it's his lumpless butt that got us in this mess
What a monkey (teach, gwan teach)
I said a lot of brothers might not get this cause it ain't funky
Sure enough we ain't gonna be played by no monkey
See because the monkey fits the shoes
In these bananapeel blues (ain't that somethin, ain't that somethin)
Y'all with me? (yeah yeah)
You might also likeTwas once said to remember that the soul is see-through
How true we'll soon see as I check to what's written
(check the script and read)
Let's see uhh Genesis chapter two verse seven
"Man became a living soul" so where's my man getting this
Actual force, probably that same old can
Or barrel of monkeys who call me and you a soul man
And call my food a soul food
Yeah I'm sposed to have soul, yet I'm uncivil and cruel
And I come from apes, yet this monkey rapes
And I'm a babboon, then soon to be coon
And when I know this, I'm labelled a lunatic
Racist rebel crazy Muslim
Now face this monkey
Truth is truly what pays me
And can a Muslim be fooled (not nowadays bro!)
And can a quote unquote monkey be reformed (now cipher!)
Yeah, and while me and you is warmed by the sun
Most of all life or in existence, uhh I take this instance to ask
If the monkey man was so pure why can't he endure (uh-huh)
The sun which is the natural source for all living (uh-huh)
Without giving up his life to cancer
And three-fifths or less is the dancer
Wrong answer
Yeah wrong answer says the Kause
And while his still skin rumples and wrinkles
Zee L exposes a monkey's uncle (what's up with a monkey's uncle)
(speak the truth)
(it's smooth, it's smooth, I like this beat)
(To the Gods out there, peace to the Gods)
