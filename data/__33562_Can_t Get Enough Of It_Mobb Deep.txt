32 ContributorsCanâ€™t Get Enough Of It Lyrics
QBC
About to take over your area
Yo

Left to right, protect the life, guard my castle
I'm goin' at you, take it to the gats if I have to
It's the hassle, jealous thugs I suppose squeeze
Turn that ass to Swiss cheese, leave permanent holes
And to them hoes, you know how it go, no dough
'Cause they subject to wakin' with cash and go crazy
Yeah, they bangin', baby
Havoc representin' for them niggas that don't trick
Ladyless, just associates
Appropriate, no doubt, but bust it
I love this rap shit, got me fillin' mad clips, but half is
Them fake rappers, but they damn good actors
From population, through the math, I subtract a
You hear no laughter, QBC the thug factor
You niggas ain't worth the punch, back smack ya
Pitbull attack ya, and half-snap ya
Kodak moments I capture
Like an escaped convict
Pearl Harbor, bomb shit
Handle B-I, on some calm shit
You might also like
I can't get enough of it, the rough shit, grenade lyrics
My appearance is thug, rap slug ritual
Every dollar got a nigga's blood chiseled, the slug sizzle
Pistol-whip tight, night monopoly
Four 380s in the prophecy, the bigger I got
Handle B-I, smoke a CI, snuff a CO
Can't you see, I'm the total, vocals is low blow
Barely sociable, rare form, the man from now on (Now on)
Toe-to-toe complex, the next expert, who's in control?
Episode, you can't control your fascination
Illa's the name, two guns that look the same
Frame of thought change, first we live, then we abort
Cloth Polo Sport, catch a nigga on his sports
Talk crack, I'll leave you jacked, crap format, I'm hostile
Wild out for snakeness equals foul
General G, blowin' judges in the trial

Yo, the NYC M-O-B-B thug shit (And that's my shit)
I can't get enough of it
Either fuck with it or don't fuck with it
Catch us in a middle of the crowd crazily bent
When my cats attack, you got your knot split, ayo
I can't get enough of it
Either fuck with it or don't fuck with it
Catch us in a middle of the crowd crazily bent
When my cats attack, you got your knot split
We out to win and that's it
We out to win it like this
It's like this, kid, ayo
We shut it down like the Muse
And blast like fresh TECs out the box
We outbox, get suplexed
Take notes, nigga, best check the index
Look over anything that you might've missed
You overlooked the part with some unified terrorists
Pirates, straight off the ship and mad starvin'
Anchored to land and now we runnin' wild, poundin'
On imbecile niggas who ain't got they feet grounded
Precise, astonishin' shots split your skin's top
We sent pops, catch you from two blocks
Don't run up on you chargin', with hot shit, he felt it, alarmin'
Shockin', surprisin' shit, left you crawlin'
Dangerous, huh, and ready to rock
This man's hot, your flesh start to boilin' hot
Rhymes solid like a lead pipe that bleeds your knot
Knot-headed niggas get knocked out a lot
Kick down your chain-locked door, we raise spot
My clique got a deadbolt lock, you rather not, dude
Stormin' through the crowd, part the sea, comin' through
Spill my over-proof, it's drippin' from my temple
Lay on the wall and watch all y'all
You can't injure a ninja who crept and took fall
Surrounded by crime cats, time for tap jaws
Leave red stains on clothes, carpets, and floors
Ayo, we bang like the Tunnel and jam like broke gats
One hundred and oh, nigga, go check the stats
QB, yeah the name hold weight and ring bells
All you niggas shook and it ain't hard to tell
Major clientele, the infamous cartel
Catch a buck-fifty, them stars, we scar well
Hard luck, got gassed up and starstruck
Then got stuck in one stroke, the Mobb clutch
Laid up, sippin' all types of shit, get ya chick bent
Talk the bitch to death 'til there's no info left
Homicidal clepto, like the lye leaf, I'm petrol
Regulate the Metropolitan, niggas gettin' bodied in
In the lobby, and lock the door, it ain't safe, kid
Take it how you take it, grab a hold and embrace it

The NYC M-O-B-B thug shit (Yeah, that's my shit)
I can't get enough of it
Either fuck with it or don't fuck with it
Catch us in a middle of the crowd crazily bent
When my cats attack, you got your knot split, ayo
I can't get enough of it
Either fuck with it or don't fuck with it
Catch us in a middle of the crowd crazily bent
When my cats attack, you got your knot split
We out to win and that's it
We out to win it like this

That's my shit
