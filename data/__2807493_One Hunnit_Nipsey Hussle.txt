14 ContributorsOne Hunnit Lyrics
Been through everything, see it on our faces
Go against the grain, hundred rounds waitin'
Been around the world, hustle all places
But that '85 Cutlass is my foundation
Slauson Ave, nigga, but my hoes LACES
Palisades bitches, let me showcase you
Drive down the block, see my bro's faces
Keep it one hundred, nigga, no fakin'
Keep it one hundred, nigga, no fakin
Keep it one hundred, nigga, no fakin

Ballin' for real, I'm talkin' big money
Hundred thousand a show but that's my rent money
Four thousand a pound but that's my smoke budget
Fuckin' off at the mall, that's 'cause these hoes love it
I've been ballin' for a minute
I'ma grind, that's my motto 'til I get it
Full time, if you follow my commitment
You'll shine, nigga, that's a promise, make a killin'
Afghanistan in my spliff, red dynasty in my vision
Built this shit up from nothin', congratulations, you did it
I'm valet with a bitch and we at the Beverly Center
Sunlight hit them Rolex VVSs make a prism, glitter (make a prism)
On her face, two C's on her waist
Gold spikes on her heels
Purse match, she for real (she for real)
Me basic, Famous and Naked
Black Saks Fifth tee, prolly playin' Blue Laces in the Six
Bitches that strip fallin' for the Crip
She want me for my money, I tell her suck my rich
Make her fuck the clique
Then I lace my Chucks and split
I'ma RSC for real and I ain't never loved a bitch, nigga (Bitch, nigga)
Got money but I'm never one to switch
Live life under pressure but I never budged a inch
And real niggas be like, "Hussle, do your shit"
Hoes ask me if I ever was a pimp
What you think?

Go against the grain, hundred rounds waitin'
Been around the world, hustle all places
But that '85 Cutlass is my foundation
Slauson Ave, nigga, but my hoes LACES
Palisades bitches, let me showcase you
Drive down the block, see my bro's faces
Keep it one hundred, nigga, no fakin'
Keep it one hundred, nigga, no fakin'
Keep it one hundred, nigga, no fakin'2Embed
