35 ContributorsRunning With a Ghost Lyrics
Picturing your face and now the moment's lost
I saw your silhouette under all of the noise
I think I'm losing it inside these empty walls
I thought I heard your voice, I thought I felt your touch
Well I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Well I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost, yeah

(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
You're done for me
You used to keep Lil Boat company
I used to put no one over you
You keep every nigga under me
I used to rock a Metallica t-shirt
You would call it the thunder tee
I stung you hard like a bumblebee
Now I'm left dead with no sympathy
I fucked up, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miss my fingers running through your hair
Your bed time stares
Oh your lips would gliss even when you glare
You said you feel it in your chest so scream it like Ric Flair
Let me know it's there
Tell me, do you care?
You might also like
Picturing your face and now the moment's lost (gang, gang, gang, gang)
I saw your silhouette under all of the noise
I think I'm losing it inside these empty walls
I thought I heard your voice, I thought I felt your touch
Well I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Well I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost, yeah

(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Don't run from me
Brothers back home, they gon' gun for me
I stay the night, keep you company
Just keep it real and don't front on me
You get out the shower and jump on me (drip)
Still drippin' wet from the shower beams (wet)
You smokin' half of the sour dream (smoke)
I count up, knots, we the money team (gang)
I'm up, now you know it
I won't believe it until you show it
Ball like Moses (yeah)
Stop playin', just focus (okay)
Flood your crib with roses (yeah)
All them other niggas clowns
Them niggas bogus
They scared to approach ya
All these bitches roaches compared to you
They don't amount to anything you do
'Cause girl, you stay true
That's why I'm running for you
I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Well I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost, yeah2Embed
