38 ContributorsTake My Life Lyrics
I hope you pussy muthafuckas die
Wish death upon they soul until they burnin' in a fire
I'm the illest mothafucka breathin', fuck yo rhyme or yo reason
Fucking over yo issues, it's kill-a-ho-nigga season
I made my way, way, I found my road, road
Bar-arada-da, I made my own, ho
YUGHHH , you ain’t ever have shit local nigga?
Woo, how the fuck I owe you local niggas?
I’m a global nigga, Champs-Élysées shopper
Looked up to Eric B and dope dealer, chain rockers
Where was you when I was bleeding
Disappointed and battling my demons
I just want to ride Italian leather, acting like you don’t know me
Euro designer palace, fuck my bitch on Missoni
And I feel…

And I feel like they want to take my life
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth
And I feel like they want to take my life

It ain’t enough that I struggle through my career
Less appreciated when I was part of a pair
Pushed an envelope full of truth like I was dared
Depiction and the depth was the proof that I was there
It’s no question in my origins
Photo album full of Polaroids they’re still pointing in
Couple million records sold, still say I’m poisoning
Seven different SIM cards, bringing all that mortar in
Brick by brick nigga, all you add is water in
We ain’t got to touch hands nigga, put your order in
I just want to float through clouds Hermes seams on my towels
No overly gaudy shit, just the diamonds on the dials
Woo, and I’m still buying mo’ guns
Mo’ money, mo’ murder nigga, choose one
You might also like
And I feel like they want to take my life
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth
And I feel like they want to take my life3Embed
