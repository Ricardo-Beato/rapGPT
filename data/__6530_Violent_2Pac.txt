They claim that I'm violent just 'cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin' fits 'cause I'm not buyin' it
Defyin' it, envious because I will rebel against
Any oppressor, and this is known as self-defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
'Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The Underground Railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told 'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate, you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist 'cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker, censor this
My words are weapons and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you claim that I'm violent

They claimin' that I'm violent (Them a call us violent)
Fuck a damn cop (Them a call us— call us)
Just because we play what the people want
They claimin' that I'm violent
Fuck a damn cop (Them a call us— call us)
Just because we play what the people want
They claimin' that I'm violent
Fuck a damn cop (Them a call us— call us)

The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man 'cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, "Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?"
He had the nerve to say I had a curfew (Do you know what time it is?)
Get out the car or I'll hurt you (Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you)
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete (Ayy, man, ayo, ayy, man, just come on)
(What you doin man?) They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked (I'm out), he tried to run (Freeze, nigga)
I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped, so I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Givin' him a taste of trading places
And all this 'cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
Frame up, but I came up
Now they claimin' that I'm violent
They claimin' that I'm violent (Them a call us violent)
Fuck a damn cop (Them a call us— call us)
Just because we play what the people want
They claimin' that I'm violent
Fuck a damn cop (Them a call us— call us)
Just because we play what the people want
They claimin' that I'm violent
Fuck a damn cop (Them a call us— call us)
Just because we play what the people want
Fuck a damn cop (Them a call us— call us)

As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (Uh-oh)
Then a gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around, it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (Damn), now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away (Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here)
They called for backup and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start (Damn), we in deep shit
So we jumped out (Come, on, let's take the cop's car)
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we through sprayin' then we steppin'
This is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust (What's next, man?)
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One thing for sure, tommorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me (Pass me a clip)
Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin' them a reason (A reason) to claim that I'm violent
They claim— They claim— (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop (They claimin' that I'm violent)
Just because we play what the people want
Fuck a damn cop
They claim— They claim— (Them a call us violent)
Fuck a damn cop (They claimin' that I'm violent)
Just because we play what the people want
Fuck a damn cop
Violent (Them a call us— call us— them a call us)

Just because we play what the people want
Fuck a damn cop (They claimin' that I'm violent)
They claim— They claim— (Them a call us violent)
Fuck a damn cop (They claimin' that I'm violent)
