6 ContributorsToo Many Lyrics(Verse)
Parked behind that bottle, last night trippin
Jewelries drippin, 20 chains, yea 2 million
A lot of bad bitches in here, so many
I see a lot of fuck niggas, man theres too many
Drinkin hard, going hard, had too many
I bought one shot but gave that girl 5 20’s
She said you overpaid me, that’s too many
I spend my money like I want, bitch that my business
Hunna killas in the club, with me 2 many
Too many bad bitches, couldn’t fit em in my Bentley
You see the watch I got on cost 2 20
It’s hard to bring out all my racks cuz it’s so many
A lot of girls want me, theres so many
You wanna talk to me nigga then talk with me
New school so clean, had to untint it
You roll your blunts too skinny but that's yo' business
(Hook)
Last night I had a ball, they were too many
Couldn’t fuck em all, they were so many
Gucci down the draws, it was so many
Got a ball for my dawg, gave him too many
I’m tryna spend it all, nigga no limit
And they say it’s no business like show business
Yea I’m swimming in the money, yea I flow in it
It’s a whole lot of sharks, brought my gun in it

Did a feature with a nigga last week, got a bird out it
Left, banged my rims on the curb, but I ain’t worried bout it
Niggas say the squad getting money, I ain’t heard bout it
Country nigga remix, yea I took 1/3 out it
Gucci Mane swag fuckin nervous, bitch she curious
She skip 3rd period, I fuck her on her period
Tried to the girl to suck my dick, she wasn’t hittin it
Asked her, "do you wanna make a flick?", she wasn’t interested
Asked her do yo man got a car that ain’t limited?
6 car garage, yea the cars, yea they immigrant
This chick got this bitch spyin on me a 
I’m intrigued, got a rich dick to share with a lot of bitches
Ferrari Spyder itchin down the street like a caterpillar
Too many gas bags, duffle bag like we body builders
He got tattoo, tears, but that boy is not a killer
Not a killer, not a dealer, call that boy not a nigga
(Hook x2)
Last night I had a ball, they were too many
Couldn’t fuck em all, they were so many
Gucci down the draws, it was so many
Got a ball for my dawg, gave him too many
I’m tryna spend it all, nigga no limit
And they say it’s no business like show business
Yea I’m swimming in the money, yea I flow in it
It’s a whole lot of sharks, brought my gun in it1Embed
