Feel the magnetism between us (The mic)
Growing stronger and stronger (The mic)
Why don't we do it? (The mic)

I was in a case out of state
She was thirteen and good, we had a hotter date
It was just a number, she never told she was knocked up
By the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up
My aunt came and got me, and steadied the block
We bounced to the yeti, and I'm ready to rock
With no attachments, feelin' a little loose
Blowin' up in every spot, we had a little juice
Probably the Dom or the Afghani bud in me
We played the stage, standin' by the speaker and suddenly
Who tapped me? I'm 'bout to get real ill
Already ripped the whole club with Metal Face's steel wheel
What a sweet surprise, her with the fly eyes
And fine, she pulled me to the sidelines
The mystery shot up with strong words
She was an intelligent wisdom and a songbird
I met her last week at the same place
She stepped to me, the same way at a no shame pace
I'm off-guard, her game had me choked up
Checkin' me, play testin' me 'til I spoked up
Seven whole days and nights and not a word from you (Not a word)
I was worried, I thought I woulda heard from you
Stranger, you know I never get enough of you
How you be comin' through (The mic!)
Myself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three
In my earlier days they showed me things new to me
So we knew mad brothers who they had hit off
They even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off
When slovenly two smile and I'm scopin' her
Switchin' off three times a night made them more opener
So you could love Allah or leave him the hell alone
Message from my godfather, solid gold telephone
Many of my men went up in smoke
While trickin' with these chickens and ended up broke
You find out who's ya mans when you broke
Like a bad joke, it's funny when you on you got mad folk
I played the middle man in every little scam
Some as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam
I find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers
Walk upon me speaking with they stinkin' mouth (About what?)
About this and that from sneakers to hats to gats
Freak chicks with the cooty cat raps
And it's that cool the dice at that
I'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat
I play the back, steady on the humble
But be right up front when we get ready to rumble
I gave her breath control, ask her who she learned off
Coulda took her back to the crib, somehow was turned off
Me and you was overdue
From gettin' together, baby
I always knew our love was meant to be (The mic)

Feel the magnetism (The mic) between us (The mic)
Growing stronger and stronger (The mic)
