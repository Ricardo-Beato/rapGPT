45 ContributorsWay Back Home Lyrics
Uh, you can be who you want to be
But rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no faking me
'Cause gettin' out this shell is real
I don't know where I'm headed next, but
Man, I can't even fake no more
Surrounded by lies and bullshit
Nigga, I can't even take no more
See, I woke up havin' a bad day
And I gotta get the dollar any faster way
'Cause a nigga growin' up never had shit
I was actin' way too passive
I've been up and down, 'round and 'round
Tryna find my way back home
Gone too long, drownin' out
Still gonna play that song

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, Annie, are you right?
Never got that text back from the other night
Let me tell you something that I really know
I was down bad, up on my ass, I had to go
Okay, sometimes I know I'm dead wrong
So I just put it all in these songs
Shit, I'm still just finding myself
Finding myself up out of this zone, nigga
Wish me well, jezebel, get out of my sight
I excel, then I sell shows out for the night
You might also like
Uh, you can be who you wanna be
But rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no faking me
'Cause gettin' out this shell is real
I don't know where I'm headed next, but
Man, I can't even fake no more
Surrounded by lies and bullshit
Nigga, I can't even take no more
See, I woke up havin' a bad day
And I gotta get the dollar any faster way
'Cause a nigga growin' up never had shit
I was actin' way too passive
I've been up and down, 'round and 'round
Tryna find my way back home
Gone too long, drownin' out
Still gonna play that song

Tryna find my way back home
I been gone 8 months out the year so far
Made a wrong turn on the dark road on my way back
Crossed through a couple toll roads, had to pay tax
Back and forth, I been fuckin' back
Had to get a bag, had to bring it back
Shit so different now, had to readjust
Ain't too many people that I could trust
Keep to myself, ayy, spend this shit all on myself, uh
Where would I be without self? Uh
Look in the mirror like, "Boy, you look good"
Yeah, that's right, had to pick up myself, uh (Pick up myself)
I'm doin' me, you should do you, fuck everybody else
Don't need nobody else
Uh, you can be who you wanna be
But rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no faking me
'Cause gettin' out this shell is real
I don't know where I'm headed next, but
Man, I can't even fake no more
Surrounded by lies and bullshit
Nigga, I can't even take no more
See, I woke up havin' a bad day
And I gotta get the dollar any faster way
'Cause a nigga growin' up never had shit
I was actin' way too passive
I've been up and down, 'round and 'round
Tryna find my way back home
Gone too long, drownin' out
Still gonna play that song11Embed
