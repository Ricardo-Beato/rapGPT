16 ContributorsTHE APPLE & THE TREE Lyrics
Hey, look here
I don't, I don't know
I, see, I like I told Nicole
I said, "Hey, I done got on the witness stand and lied my ass off"
So, so your daddy goin' to jail for tryna shoot somebody
I said "Now, now," I said, "You do—"
I didn't even know I had did that
I had forgot I had did it, I was looking for her
Now, now, I-I had to be kind of out of my mind
But I was angry, you know? Sometimes when I got angry, I didn't think
Well, I, I done went over to somebody house, I knew the girl
I took a peek in the house and everything, but I'm over there lookin' for somebody
You know, tryna get a nigga, you know what I mean? I'm like, "Shit"
And they said, "Y'all 'member the time you came over our house, girl, lookin' for so-and-so?"
We didn't even know what to do, we like, "Damn, she at the door, ain't gon'— ain't gon' open it"
Dude, I'm like, "Damn, I must've been real stupid"
But I'm just sayin' to the point where I'm tryna make up where I came from
You know what I mean? You know, I was singing in the choir with a gun in my purse
So don't go there with me
Don't tell me, what, I don't care what you want, you deadYou might also like4Embed
