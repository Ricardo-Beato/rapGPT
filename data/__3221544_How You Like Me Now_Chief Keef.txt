16 ContributorsHow You Like Me Now Lyrics
I'm actin' brand new, how you like me now
Car got autopilot, have it drive me 'round
I take that bloody money and have it wipe me down
And if you want some smoke them folks gon' short you down
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
Them bitches laughed at me but they like me now
Blue face hunduns, how you like me now?

I'ma get a feast, you can have a seat, stuntin' casualties
Hit LA, 'cause in Chiraq, it be hot as Greece
Treat a bitch, how she like me now, told that bitch to flee
She a flee, I'm a fuckin' beast, walk up by a creek
In the trap, what you want a P? Go come with that fee
Takin' trips, and I'm gonna see what you'll never see
Bitch I turned out everything that I planned to be
Ain't no success with Plan A, then it's Plan B
Ain't no maybe with this gang shit, it's a guarantee
Man these bitches all in my hair, like some Pantene
All I need is the biggest firm to defend me
Couldn't box no fucks to give, so I left it empty
You might also like
I'm actin' brand new, how you like me now
Car got autopilot, have it drive me 'round
I take that bloody money and have it wipe me down
And if you want some smoke them folks gon' shut you down
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
Them bitches laughed at me but they like me now
Blue face hunduns, how you like me now?

Nigga you a dork, and I'm very important
Goin' Randy Orton, police get behind you, that don't mean abort
Hit the scene, hoes, bunch of green, bitch lets fill a pint
Touchdown, one for the team, that's what they like to see
Kanye, slow down, drive slow
How you like me? I'm a dog what's the petco
Get my feet down, it's so comfy
Smell some slices, in a bakery, I'm going Kimbo
Dehydrated, I need Fiji
Touch remote to the TV
Hit the arco like habibi
You see that foreign? It's 250
Lets see who all leave the parking lot when we start pullin' out
And this thoinky so damn loud it's like I cannot put it out
I'm actin' brand new, how you like me now
Car got autopilot, have it drive me 'round
I take that bloody money and have it wipe me down
And if you want some smoke them folks gon' shut you down
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
How you like me now
Them bitches laughed at me but they like me now
Blue face hunduns, how you like me now?Embed
