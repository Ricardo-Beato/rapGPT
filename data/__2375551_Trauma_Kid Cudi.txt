When I was eleven I saw my dad's corpse
Innocence lost, hanging on the front porch
How do I deal?
I saw my dad's corpse
(Hmm-hmm-hmm-mm)
When I was eleven I saw my dad's corpse
Innocence lost, hanging on the front porch
How do I deal?
I saw my dad's corpse
(Hmm-hmm-hmm-mm)

Hmm-mm-mm

When I was fifteen I saw a friend's corpse
Innocence gone, love and a blowtorch
How do I deal?
I saw a friend's corpse on the way to school (Hmm-hmm)
When I was fifteen I saw a friend's corpse
Innocence gone, love and a blowtorch
How do we deal?
I saw a friend's corpse on the way to school today
