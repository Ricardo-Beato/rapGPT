17 ContributorsRain Man Lyrics
Big booty skrippas!

Rain rain rain this way
That's what all the strippers say
Rain man, go away
That's what all these haters say
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
YEAAAAAHHHH (x6)

Most big booty strippers like me
A good kush burning nigga like me
Old dope cooking nigga like me
VBS, don't bitch I'm icy
Now I could probably fuck her for the free
I gave her five hundred just from GP
A little flashy baby I might be
But them other niggas nothing like me
Gucci made it rain on her (on her)
Then he swung his chain on her (on her)
Then he hurricaned on her (on her)
God damn he put the thing on her (on her)
Now shawty got an ass on her (on her)
And I'mma pop some bands on her (on her)
Young OJ, that's my little bro
Any bitch that he wants, I pay for her
You might also like
Rain rain rain this way
That's what all the strippers say
Rain man, go away
That's what all these haters say
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
YEAAAAAHHHH (x6)

Gucci made it rain on her forehead
Told the waitress to bring some more bread
She asked to hit the kush, I told her "go ahead"
Probably tinted Versaces or the Dolces
Super Cali kush it's expadoceous
Crazy-colored karats, did you notice?
Multi-colored Jacob, baby focus
Kush by the bag, baby smoke it
Now it ain't hard to tell that I'm rolling
Get money in the 6, see I'm posted
I buy my own CDs and my posters
I make it rain, but its only for promotion
Rain rain rain this way
That's what all the strippers say
Rain man, go away
That's what all these haters say
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
And I'm a rain man
And I can make it rain
I make it thunderstorm
I make it hurricane
YEAAAAAHHHH (x6)

And I can make it rain (x8)Embed
