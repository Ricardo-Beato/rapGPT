It's Gucci
Y-E-T
It's Wizzop
M-M-M-Murda
Burr

My bitch ring cost 2 M&M's and I ain't been out a year yet
My wrist is sick, its terminally ill, it still ain't found a cure yet
You burning all your bridges nigga I'ma call you Bridgette
You acting like a bitch, you mad cause you ain't made a hit yet
Someone come and stop Guwop, ain't found a volunteer yet
This trap rap that influencing the world man Gucci pioneered it
I just vacuum sealed a couple mill, I know real niggas feel that
Gucci can't retire cause he ain't made a hundred mill yet
Keep on talkin' slick, I send my shooters where you live at
Pow, pow, pow, put that pistol where your grill at
Lil mama sucking it like she love me, I ain't even pay the bills yet
I was worth two hundred fifty thou', didn't even have a deal yet

She braggin on the dickin' down, we ain't even done it yet
He bought it 'fore I whipped the shit man I ain't even spun it yet
Water in it, water whippin', it ain't even dry yet
Quarter flippin, in the kitchen, workin' with the pyrex
She braggin on the dickin' down, we ain't even done it yet
He bought it 'fore I whipped the shit, man I ain't even spun it yet
Water in it, water whippin', it ain't even dry yet
Quarter flippin, in the kitchen, workin' with the pyrex
You might also like
They bring the money to me man, the work ain't even came yet
It's like they got umbrellas out it ain't even rain yet
Grr, that dog food and she can't find no vein at
Grr, mob rules might tie you to a train track
You leasing that don't even got the title, Jack
She peepin' that, that's why she didn't invite you back
You got midget arms, you swing, I don't even fight you back
I'm a tiger you's a lame, I get no stripes for that
Drop me in the jungle where the lions at (grr)
I come back with a lion jacket with the matching hat (grr)
I call you Raphael cause you hang with a sewer rat
I can't hang with no informer, I'm too hood for that

She braggin on the dickin' down, we ain't even done it yet
He bought it 'fore I whipped the shit man I ain't even spun it yet
Water in it, water whippin', it ain't even dry yet
Quarter flippin, in the kitchen, workin' with the pyrex
She braggin on the dickin' down, we ain't even done it yet
He bought it 'fore I whipped the shit, man I ain't even spun it yet
Water in it, water whippin', it ain't even dry yet
Quarter flippin, in the kitchen, workin' with the pyrex
