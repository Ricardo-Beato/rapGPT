15 ContributorsFace Lyrics
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, nigga, bang nigga, gang nigga
Bang, bang, bang

I went and grabbed the K
Just to spray it, told a nigga Andale
I went and got the cake
Just throw it in this bitch face
I went and got the racks
Just to go put 'em in a bank
I went and got the racks
Put 'em in my pocket, not the safe, nigga
I pull up, come from skate, nigga
Up these Glocks, start skating, nigga
Put yo lil' body up in a lake, nigga
Shoot everybody up in the way, nigga
FN by me for these fake niggas
I blow a nigga ass down today, nigga
It's a homi' on the way, nigga
Pistols get to bussing at your face, nigga

Woop woop, woop, there go the cops (There go the mothafucking cops)
Bloop bloop, bloop bloop, there go the Glock (There go my mothafucking Glock)
Soowoo soowoo, there go the bloods
There go the cuz, there go the crips
But I got my pistol up on my hip, gang
My niggas' gang (Kuku, kuku)
There go the gang, there go my gang
Pistols go bloop-bloop, bloop-bloop
Bang bang, there go them thangs
You in your crew
Hitting the range, hitting the range
You niggas fufu, you niggas fufu
Niggas is lames, you niggas is lames
Rolling in the two-two, in that two-two
That's a coupe, that's a coupe
Rolling with the zoo-zoo and with the zoo-zoo
And that's the crew, and that's the crew
All I do is loot loot, all I do is loot loot
That what I do, that what I do
I smoke TuTu and I smoke Tooka too
What do you do? What do you do?
I'm rolling in the coupe-coupe, in the coupe-coupe
Me and the Louie, me and the Louie
I'm rolling with your boo-boo, your boo-boo
And she kneeing me too
All that fish shit, I boop boop
She won't be seeing me too (Hell nah)
And the silencer go sooh sooh, sooh sooh, sooh sooh
She won't be hearing it too

Just to spray it, told a nigga Andale (Bang, bang, bang)
I went and got the cake

Just to go put 'em in a bank
I went and got the racks
Put 'em in my pocket, not the safe, nigga

Up these Glocks, start skating, nigga
Put yo lil' body up in a lake, nigga
Shoot everybody up in the way, nigga
FN by me for these fake niggas
I blow a nigga ass down today, nigga
It's a homie on the way, nigga
Pistols get to bussing at your face, nigga

Cops grab me
They want some answers, I want some ganja
I ain't telling, where my lawyer? Where my mama?
I ain't bailing, nigga ain't no mothafucking snitch
Nigga ain't no mothafucking bitch
Catch your ass after work, get hit with this clip, bitch
Swear these cops ain't shit without they badge, they some bitches
And I swear I ain't shit without that mothafucking cash, I know, I admit it
I swear I get that mothafucking cash, I blow (I spend it)
And I roll right pass yo mothafucking ass, I know (I get it)
You ain't talking 'bout mothafucking cheddar, got Beretta, hit you in your leather (Bang, bang)
The bitch gave me sloppy toppy, I told her get some Listerine and then get it better
Popping on a lip
Baby your heart saying skip
From O-6-4, it's no fifth
Remember posted up on the dip
I went and grabbed the K
Just to spray it, told a nigga Andale (Bang, bang, bang)
I went and got the cake
Just throw it in this bitch face
I went and got the racks
Just to go put 'em in a bank
I went and got the racks
Put 'em in my pocket, not the safe, nigga
I pull up, come from skate, nigga
Up these Glocks, start skating, nigga
Put yo lil' body up in a lake, nigga
Shoot everybody up in the way, nigga
FN by me for these fake niggas
I blow a nigga ass down today, nigga
It's a homie on the way, nigga
Pistols get to bussing at your face, nigga3Embed
