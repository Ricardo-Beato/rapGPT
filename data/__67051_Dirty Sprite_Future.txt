33 ContributorsDirty Sprite Lyrics
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time, "That drink will kill you"

One, two cups keep my ice cool
Three or four zips have me leaning like a fool
Purple Sprite on top of ice
I'm rocking ice on dirty sprite
I feel real nice to be precise my jewelry on, high as a kite
I'm space cadet
I drink a check
I spit a check
Got much respect for Pimp C bitch
Hold my bitch, my bitch say why I'm on purple shit
My purple stuff stay in my cup
Got drank on me I pour me up
Texas oil got me spoiled
Red and Yellow, I'm leaning hard

I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time, "That drink will kill you"
You might also like
I wake up leaning from last night
I drink my lean for breakfast
I'm on that Waffle House cup
RIP to Chad Butler
I got my favorite drink with me it taste just like some kool-aid
Pour me up a 3 or 4 gone have me leaning sideways
Well listen cold with Screw up kit we be leaning always
Drinking all day, drinking tall cups, I don't give a fuck
I'm trued up with two cups
They shook up with Dirty Sprite
Promethazine can't get enough
Till I O.D, you know what's up

I'm moving slow, the lights ain't bright as they supposed to be
My eyes heavy see what happens when you fuck with me
I think I lost my heartbeat for a second and a half
I'm on that Easter pink-flavored Sprite dirty flag
My ice in my cup filled up to the brim
Drink university even the teacher was a pimp
Church tabernacle drinking coffee like a pastor
Two cups filled with lean, we some Dirty Sprite bastards

I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time, "That drink will kill you"9Embed
