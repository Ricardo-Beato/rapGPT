I was broke
I was just at home
Now I'm on the road
Talking to Usher at The Grove (Yeah)
Rocking Balmains, these ain't Joe
When I'm in DC, they call me Moe
Always got the pedal to the floor
I got everything up in the store

That's just coke up in her nose, that ain't no boogie (Yeah)
Looking at that girl, I really shouldn't (Huh?)
Looking at that girl just like I wouldn't (Like I wouldn't)
Looking at that girl, and then I took it (Yeah)
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab it like I'm Tuddie (Skrr)
Nowadays I'm getting money I don't worry (Yeah)
All my enemies and my opps, they getting buried (Huh?)
All my enemies and my opps, they getting buried (Yeah)

Yeah, uh
I won't speak, yeah
Red bottoms my feet, yeah
My bitch on fleek, yeah
Lil Uzi a beast, yeah (Yeah)
No more (No)
I don't want to play no more (No no no)
I don't want no heartbreak no more (Yeah)
I don't want to wait no more (Yeah)
Ayy, rocking shows (Huh?)
I might get a lake house with a boat (Yeah, yeah)
I might rock all white just like the Pope (Like the Pope)
I might rock all white just like the stove (Like the stove)
You might also like
That's just coke up in her nose, that ain't no boogie
Looking at that girl, I really shouldn't
Looking at that girl just like I wouldn't
Looking at that girl, and then I took it

Nowadays I'm getting money, I don't worry
