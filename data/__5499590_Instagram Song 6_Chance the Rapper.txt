You got the right idea, girl
You got the right plan
You got the right kid, girl
You got the right man
I want an IKEA
Wanna get those nightstands
Turn to one night stands
To a fucking life plan

Thank God for you
And if you forget
I'll thank God for you
For you

Tell me whats the thread count
I want so many kids
They need a buddy system
And a head count
It'd be some dead clowns
I'm from the wish a nigga woods
I want the kind of smoke that make the swisher switch to woods
Papa don't preach
I acquire niggas that got carpets
Plastered in bleach
I'm a mobster but I still pronounce
The salad Caprese
I take most of the water up out the ramen
So it's kinda like a pasta Capisce?
I'm a dolphin that breached
You a dolphin that's beached
You a coffin that breathes
You be coughing and bleed
You a foster kid
I offer help to orphans in need
I would never send you off
You better off
You might also like
I Thank God for you
And if you forget
I'll thank God for you
For youEmbed
