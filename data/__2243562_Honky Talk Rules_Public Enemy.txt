I let the entire world know of your problem
But let everybody also know of your crimes
But you don't want to fix this world by solving
Rather have the earth singing to your lies
I'm just tired of your talk
Tired of your talk
You can keep it
Y'all can keep it, keep it, keep it
Your honky talk rules
Screw your rules

I'm tired of their style
Got y'all turnt up break and say, "Wow!"
Worldwide shuttin' down all of their game
You don't know we're in the hall of fame
Tell all the young people who don't know
Who dig in that pocket - If you don't know
And go Google
Learn about truth
Then we gonna raise the roof - You better ask somebody
It's the time to salute the youth
Yeah

It's the honky talk, honky talk
Honky talk rules
Uuuh, baby
Bounce - come on, bounce
Come on, bounce
Come on, bounce

Bounce - come on, bounce
Come on, bounce
Come on
I got to say:
It's the honky talk
Honky talk rules
Bounce - come on, bounce
Come on, bounce
Come on, bounce
It's the honky, honky, honky, honky talk rules

All you got is your money
Only thing that y'all can stand on
Shutting my culture down - it ain't funny
See y'all peeking to the break of dawn
I'm just just bragging
Yes I'm boasting
Toast to the blues
So I gotta ego
I got to say yo
Learn little something
Y'all don't know
Those of y'all ready
I tell them now
So let's go
I tell them now
You? You tell me something, that you think I don't know
Think again, yeah
Well, well, well, well

Honky, honky, honky, honky talk rules
Honky talk, honky talk
Honky talk rules
Uuuh, baby
Bounce - come on, bounce
Come on, bounce
Come on, bounce
It's the honky talk, honky talk
Honky talk rules
Uuuh
Bounce - come on, bounce
Come on, bounce
Come on, bounce
I got to say:
It's the honky talk
Honky talk rules
Uuuh baby
Bounce - come on, bounce

It's the honky, honky, honky, honky talk rules
