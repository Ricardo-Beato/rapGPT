Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
"Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it"
She replied, "Oh, yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life"
*Gunshot*

Is it wickedness?

Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote
"And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'"
Oh, please, ugh, I don't like itYou might also like109Embed
