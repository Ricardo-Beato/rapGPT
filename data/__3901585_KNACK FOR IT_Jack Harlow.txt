11 ContributorsKNACK FOR IT Lyrics
Off the backboard
I was thirty-minutes, he was hopping off the back porch
Tell me what you bad for, tell me who you good to
I'ma need a magazine or something I could look through
I been waiting
For, you to break up with your man
I seen him all on the 'Gram and I ain't really a fan of y'alls
Situation, you gon' get tired, real tired tryna' make sense
Of how the fuck my day spent
Do you got issues with me?
Tell me right now before you get rude with me

She got a knack for it
Even my best friend done fell in love with her before
Ain't gotta act forward
I know what you on, you should know that I done been here before

You need a passport
So when I'm on the road you can pull up, girl, with me on the tour
That sounds fire, takin' out the trash when you pulled up outside
I was lettin' out sighs of relief that I still got some more time with the scenes
Prayin' on, any sign of a weakness
I ain't trippin' in the least bit
You got problems that you need fixed
I got me a couple too, I know what you mean
She was disappearin', I ain't notice a thing
It might be better that way
You might also like
She got a knack for it
Even my best friend done fell in love with her before
Ain't gotta act forward
I know what you on, you should know I done been here before
She got a knack for it
Even my best friend done fell in love with her before
Ain't gotta act forward
I know what you on, you should know I done been here beforeEmbed
