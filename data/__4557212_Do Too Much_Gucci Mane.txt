4 ContributorsDo Too Much Lyrics
My trap right beside you, you know you wanna rush
You know you wanna touch, and I know you wanna fuck
But you say I do too much, you say I do too much
You say I do too much, you say I do too much

I be in my own lane hoe
Somewhere with the bag tryna get a bankroll
Chacing a bitch is something I can't do
When I pull up on the scene, you not getting payed like I do
Chop his head off, and pull a caper
And you ain't nobody, if you ain't having haters
OG gass and Kush, all kind of flavors
I sip a pint a day, my nickname should be Mador
Let's toast, let's have a feast
Fuckin with my dogs who don't take no time in the least
And we don't keep eating, till we obese
Sippin Lean, cuffin hoes, no, please

My trap right beside you, you know you wanna rush
You know you wanna touch, and I know you wanna fuck
But you say I do too much, you say I do too much
You say I do too much, you say I do too much
You might also like
Mama say I do too much
But no, I ain't did enough
I trap like beside you
I forgot to aline you
You fuck with a trap star
And I got bars for you
Forign cars for you
Risk my life for you
Ain't no declining you
Fuck you mean I do too much?
Geseppi when we steppin, matching Rolexes
Now your friends saying you do too much, you got X friends
They know I'm water whippin
And get it out the kitchen
I won't say no if you tell me I can't hit it
Designer everything
Luie, Gucci, Prada, Fendy
Priceless lifestyle, perchis, I can for me

My trap right beside you, you know you wanna rush
You know you wanna touch, and I know you wanna fuck
But you say I do too much, you say I do too much
You say I do too much, you say I do too much
She say she sick of me
I don't know what to do
This bitch wildin out, why the fuck you calling, dude?
And she call P erlior
That's my side bitch, why the fuck you bugging her?
For real, I don't do the social networks
Come on, you gon get your fuckin feelings hurt
His pants are sagging, him being the first
Gotta stop what you're doing, it'll only get worse
This trap life I'm living, so exquisite
It's hard to keep up, I'm in all 4 lanes switchin
She trippin, she fell in love too quickly
I know you excited, I know you like this

My trap right beside you, you know you wanna rush
You know you wanna touch, and I know you wanna fuck
But you say I do too much, you say I do too much
You say I do too much, you say I do too muchEmbed
