19 ContributorsAbout the Game Lyrics
Ho, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy

Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her

It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

It ain't about the rims on my truck (No)
Ain't about the ice on my watch (No)
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game (It's about the game)
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch (No)
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game (Bout the game, uh)

When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)

It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)

It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game (Southern smoke)6Embed
