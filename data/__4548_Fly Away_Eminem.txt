Some people ask me where I been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe
I'll fly away (Fly away)
It ain't nuttin' in the way so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
And ain't nuttin' else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon'
Die today (Die today)
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
(Down below, yeah, yeah) Yeah
There's nuttin' else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Oh)
Yeah, there's nuttin' in my way so I may as well
Fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away
Yeah

Got my self-esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hangin' off of my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nuttin', boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leavin' you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands, it's Play-Doh
I ain't back to play, though, they say he died in a fatal
Car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie, you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup inside your crackers
I can carry rap till my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin', I just
Couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic, so I went back
To the lab, that's where I been at, when
Some people ask me where I been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe
I'll fly away (Fly away)
It ain't nuttin' in the way so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
And ain't nuttin' else to say so I may as well
Fly away

I took a hiatus, haters, now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fuckin' shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles, I'm the *explosion*
You ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs, cocksucker
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm
My puke's hotter than you
You're soft, I use fire to cool me off
I told 'em I'd grow up one day and show 'em I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw 'em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowin'
Yes, I'm livin' the dream, homie, can't nothing compare
I’m so up, I’m stuck in midair, I’m lovin' it, yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy, they afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me, now I'm slappin' 'em back, hey
Fuck it, we're slap happy, yeah, okay, now I'm talking some smack, ayy
And I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind sight? What the track say?
Some people ask me where I been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask what me I think and I say maybe
I'll fly away (Fly away)
It ain't nuttin' in the way so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
And ain't nuttin' else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon'
Die today (Die today)
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
(Down below, yeah, yeah) Yeah
There's nuttin' else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Oh)
Yeah, there's nuttin' in my way so I may as well
Fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away
