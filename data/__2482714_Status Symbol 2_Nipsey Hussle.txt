All these jewels that I spit
Fools will get chipped
Can't change the game cause there's rules to this shit
When you follow suit whole crew will get rich
I'm the proof check the motherfucking views in this bitch
Yeah, as I cruise in my 6
Need a 100K a show that's my muse when I spit
I'm the type to make the news when I trip
Prolly be my downfall a short fuse on a crip
And I'm working on my temper put some jewels on my wrist
Cause I'd rather be that nigga on a cruise with my bitch
Boat dock, only food is a fish
On the coast to Greece nigga where the views is the shit
Follow me home come and view the abyss
Take a walk with me take your tool just to take a piss
It ain't safe tell a nigga get a grip
Hard headed niggas gotta take a bag to take a shit
Where if you let a nigga mark you out
You labeled as a bitch
Can't take a strike back so niggas ain't taking shit
They see you with it prolly take a nigga shit
If you got that on your record prolly take you for your chick
Disrespect you infront of your kids
Treat you like the broad that you is
That's on God and my kid
Imma have you gone with the wind
Stop them games where they start begin
Lion heart in my brim
And nigga it get dark in the den
Question is homie with the sharks can you swim?
Smell fakes, smell pussy, smell fear
Killer instinct we can tell what's pretend

I be getting to the money
Ain't a damn thing funny
You can see this cash all on me
I'll be on it till I'm dead and gone, dead and gone
After that then I'm heading home, heading home
I be getting to the money
Ain't a damn thing funny
You can see this cash all on me
I'll be on it till I'm dead and gone, dead and gone
After that then I'm heading home, heading home1Embed
