8 ContributorsRelax With Pep Lyrics
Relaxed with pep

My styles will move, I'm calm but deadly, heat up but cool
I'm rough as a right hook but still look smooth, even when I'm unseen
I show and prove - women, I give 'em pain and still soothe
As I'll put you down but I'm hard to put up with
Swell up like helium but I can make it fit
I'm taking what I want and make you wanna give it here
Provoking you to flaunt, you get the idea
Got it, gone, my schedule is packed
My day is laidback 'cause I'm ahead of all that
Then I can relax 'cause I'm before my time
I hand you a manual before the rhymes
So you can catch up and keep up and move right along
The day is kind of off but I can get it on
I'm taking it step by step and when the night is in depth
It's cool cause I'm relaxed with pep

Relaxed with pep
Relaxed with pep

I enchant a riot with a quiet storm
Is it the way I parlay or the knowledge being born?
All praises due to the magnificent, most high and magnificent
From him, I was sent with intent
To invent new ways for better displays for better days
No more crimes, I got rhymes and it pays
I'm prepared to take mine and get mine
And I can protect mine either with a rhyme or a nine
A silent rage but if amplified
Rhymes multiply, it's hard to provoke when I
Put a mode in effect, the episode's correct
Reload and you don't know what code to respect
I get swift and changeable, adapt and master
But still remaindable, rap gets faster
Reacts and projects, attracts and it get
To the max, it's in depth, it attacks but it's relaxed with pep

Check one, then I'ma check another one too
The R's brand-new so you can view a few
I got an exquisite exhibit, explicit
Is it a whizz-kid or Kid Wizard? Well, is it?
Relax, I'll track, out lap the half stepper
Here come the right one baby, I'm Dr. Pepper
So check the Richter scale,  rhymes overload
Blow up and explode abrupt and reload the code
You can't pinpoint or locate the rate
Or evaluate the up-to-date
Stayed upfront, laid back, coming off on track
Girls want some of this because I'm all that
Sweat the concept as the ep's in depth
As the track is kept, you can't intercept the step
Reacts and projects and attracts and it gets
To the max and in-depth, it attacks but it's relaxed with pep

Relaxed with pep
Relaxed with pep
It's relaxed with pep1Embed
