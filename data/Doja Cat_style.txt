You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' high for
Men that like to do the things to remain that guy who
Need someone who's sweet and not gon' shoot to make that high note

And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby I got everything and so much more than she's got

And it's such a typical thing

You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player, I don't think I'ma play with you, uh-uh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her, why don't you just stay with her?

You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm tryin' to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?

First impression of you is you really like to party
Swirlin' all up on you 'cause you know I wanna dance
Let me cordially invite you to this party in my pants
How you got me sprung and don't say sorry in advance?
Show me all your tatts, not just the ones that's on your hands
Who's your designer?

Everything about you look like it's on purpose
God was workin', probably took some extra time though
Ayy, all up in my curves like a puzzle piece, mmm
Jigsaw, let me see your muscleses, mmm
After we fuck, I'ma wanna cuddle
We could take it to the kitchen
I'll be on the island, come and eat, mmm
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable
It's only natural
I could tell when you locked the door
Just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
(Anxious, you can't take it)

When can we take off all our clothes?

Baby, when you fought me at the door
Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?

Now I barely need ya
Do what you do best and be alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die alone
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be alone

Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to let you wander
Now you're an afterthought, I lost ya
And now you want me, babe
You want me, but it's bye
Givin' mе reasons to fly
Pack up my shit and be wise
Jump in thе ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like, look what you threw to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you're right

Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need a answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than 'needs control,' cherish it

Look at me, look at me, you lookin'?
My taste good, but I just had to redirect my cookin'
I coulda been an opener, I redirect the bookin'
I readed all the comments sayin', "D, I'm really shooketh"
"D, you need to see a therapist, is you lookin'?"
Yes, the one I got, they really are the best
Now I feel like I can see you bitches is depressed
I am not afraid to finally say shit with my chest
Lost a lil' weight, but I ain't never lost a tushy
Lookin' good, but now my bald head match my
Lookin' good, but now they all sayin' that I'm ugly
Boo-hoo, my nigga, I ain't sad you won't fuck me
I'm sad that you really thought your ass was above me
You're lucky 'cause I just paid your bill with a reply
I just made your money pile knee-high
I just made your stats peak, now you got a blue check

I paid all my respect to those who taught me how to make it
And now I reap the benefits with no confrontation
Y'all fall into beef, but that's another conversation
I'm sorry, but we all find it really entertainin'
'Cause we all wanna see them slip and fall right on their faces
And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation
Not be in it, but ain't the bad press good?
The disrespect's real, how this Patek look?
Pull out the checkbook, now why yo' neck crook?
I never learn to "superstar" from a textbook
Talkin' 'bout, "She fallin' off, why she get booked?"
Man, I been humble, I'm tired of all the deprecation

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Here's another one about you
Baby, I wanna gush about you
I wanna be the stubborn crust of barnacles upon you
If you were to become a middle-American farmer
I'd read up on every vegetable and harvest them around you
Not to be too much, but I am always me around you
But when you lеave, I'm movin' very awkwardly without you
I have nеver met a man who gets it like you do
Precious as you are
You're cursin' out your mirror, you're takin' it too far
You need to see it clearer, I've seen it all before
I wanna be there for you when the going's gettin' hard
When you're feelin' like the lowest thing that no one even wants
I wanna write you poetry and jokes and even songs
I hope this lasts forever or at least 'til we a hundred
Please know how much I want this

Hot towels with a mocktail by the ocean
Top down with our ice shinin' like a snowman
Cook you a crab boil that reminds you of New Orleans
Don't give any time of day to these cokeheads
We too busy gettin' experience and explorin'
I wanna take you overseas and stop by in Paris
And watch you taste the cheese
Take you to Buly and get you smellin' sweet
In love with you, je suis, I love you, mon chéri
And if you feel the need to dip and take a breather
Just know that I will wait or that I'd never leave
I'm givin' you space, givin' you cover, uh-huh
