34 ContributorsStill Shininâ€™ Lyrics
Fresh out the motherfuckin' pack
Yo, yo

To all my niggas uncivilized to civilized
We cook the shake, move the weight across the tri-state
Them jux niggas bring the shook up out the crook type
Special deliver, sendin' shots through your Ac' Vigor
My Infamous Mobb get on they job
The truth gets revealed like we W Fard
Some shiesty New York niggas thirsty for cheddar
You shinin'? You get your jewels taken with your Hill sweater
Keepin' these rap fans like crack fiends
Until we re-up and put more Infamous up on the rap scene
Mix the coke rhymes with beats just like baking soda
Albums is G-packs selling across foreign waters
My Mobb picks is like dime bricks
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit
Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top, kid
And once we all on top, ain't no stoppin' it
I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam
Stupid, a hundred niggas form around me
Like forcefield, pull out and use the gun like shield
The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the hill
Beware of quiet niggas laying in the cut (For what?)
Patiently watching, waiting for a come-up
Get your spot took, we rob land like white man
Plans to overthrow your whole shit while shakin' your hand (Motherfucker)

Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing

Nine-six to the motherfuckin' year two-G
The Mobb got it locked with the master keys
Word life, combination to the safe, it's on
Get that loot, motherfucker, spread love when you on
The 41st got the heat for them niggas that thirst
Yes, divine nine shine, put that ass in line
Regulate, I'm only here just to take what's mine
My clique combine, dangerous minds done bust the outline
A half a man generatin' grands
Kid, you know how I go, only fuck with fam
That's why you're lookin' from the outside in
Wonderin' how we bubblin', hustlin', breakin' days in
Grimy motherfuckers, gettin' info from your baby's mother
Got her pillow talking while that ass is sleepwalking
So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live
You better be on point when you walk in the rest
Your broke ass probably don't got a vest
So I suggest change your location is best
'Cause I'm coming through army fatigue dressed
Blessed with hollow tips, yes
To burn through your dirty-ass Guess
(Yes, still shinin', still climbin')
Ayo, your timing was way the fuck off, what is you tryin'?
This faggot-ass cat should get clapped for even tryin'
He tried to confront me, but only faced iron
Put holes through your shirt like Jamaican clothes
Fuck the myths, but science and numbers is how I live
If we ain't gettin' mathematics, somethin' got to give
Broke all your fucking life with no will to live
There's no way to live, resort to Plan B
Start to sticking, strongarm robbery and icepicking
It's sneak vicking, it's cold outside
I think it's past time for me to grab the clapper and take mines
You follow what I'm saying? It's like leading the blind
Trying to voice a clear picture of this life of crime
You slow learners'll understand in due time
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we trying to eat
And put that fly shit on my back
And bless my feet with some new and improved, spectate or make a move
Hesitate or regulate, it's on you

Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still climbing, still shining
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
What?
Nine-six, motherfucker
