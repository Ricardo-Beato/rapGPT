Wheezy Beats

I can tell these nigga's scared, the way they talk
Gold pyrex, I put diamonds on my fork (Skrrt, skrrt)
Pull up on your block, white chalk (Yeah, yeah)
Chopper bullets skate, Tony Hawk (Yeah)
I'ma cut your fingers off if you shout (Yeah, yeah)
Pop a perc', hit the cup, nigga, pause
Hundred round drum, 'round of applause (21, 21)
Bitches know I got that bag, Santa Claus
I drink lean and I pop Xans (21)
Slaughter Gang, we the Glock clan
Poppin' molly, nigga, Santan' (Yeah)
I'm back on that bullshit again (21)
I wanna fuck your best friend (21)
I just went a bought a brand new Benz
Bitch, I came from the bottom
We was starving, we was robbing

Mind your business, bitch, mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch, mind your business, bitch
We ain't with that friendly shit
That friendly shit, that friendly shit (What?)
That friendly shit (What?)
Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash
Another toe-tagged nigga laying in the grass (Grass, grass, grass)
You might also like
Five shooters in the back of the Uber, nigga, and they ready to shoot (Pew, pew)
I tie my laces, I dip in that bag, nigga, and I take me a blue (Boot up)
I'm the Slaughter King, nigga, I don't give a fuck about you (Bout you)
You get you some money, you get you some fame, these bitches gon' come out the blue (Say what?)
Bullet holes in my body, paranoid, I'ma pop it
If you snitchin', I'ma pop it, wrong move, I'ma drop it (Bah)
.15 in my sock, trappin' at the bus stop
Came from a nickel rock (A what?), now I got a whole block

Mind your business, bitch, mind your business, bitch
Mind your business, bitch, mind your business, bitch
We ain't with that friendly shit
That friendly shit (What?), that friendly shit (What?)
That friendly shit (21)
Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash
Another toe-tagged nigga laying in the grass (Grass, grass, grass)9Embed
