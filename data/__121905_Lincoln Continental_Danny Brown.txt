19 ContributorsLincoln Continental Lyrics
I'm the president, I'm the mayor, ho
That bitch my first lady, I tell her where to go
I'm in the brown house, taking a doodoo
I smoke that ew-wee, that Peppy la Pew
I'm going cookoo, see I done fucked up
Another mother there, some shit gonna get a cut
Them budgets fucked up, I say that it gone change
And now we fucked up, I'm asking y'all for change
Bitch we gon go to war, donâ€™t give that oil up
I have your kids on the front line getting fucked up
They getting chopped up, they eating cold cuts
They starving on the block, they talk 'bout it ain't no work
Ain't no health care, I snatch your medicare
I got your baby home alone and ain't no daycare
Cause I'mma get mine, if I snatch your kids
What the fuck you thinking, I'm a politician

Got me plotting, got me plotting
Got me thinking, got me thinking
How can I come up and get myself a Lincoln

I'm a Continental, Contin... Continental

I'm the president, I'm the mayor, ho
That bitch my first lady, I tell her where to go
I cheat all on that ho, with the secretary
I skeet out on her blouse, that head is legendary
I lie to anybody, and smile up in they face
I drink that wine up, and say I love the taste
I show up at the banquet, I get my swag on
Them white niggas grinning, they get they fag on
Now I'm on some other shit, I'm at the hotel
With a bunch of hookers, they yelling go head
Don't worry they all gay, them hoes is coke heads
Next day on the paper sniffing coke, I knew them hoes would tell
But see I get them votes, because I know some rappers
I do a remix, y'all on my dick after
I throw a press conference and say some bullshit
Then take a couple flicks, now I'm out this bitch

Got me plotting, got me plotting
Got me thinking, got me thinking
How can I come up and get myself a Lincoln
Got me plotting, got me plotting
Got me thinking, got me thinking
How can I come up and get myself a Lincoln
I'm a Continental, Contin... Continental
I'm a Continental, Contin... Continental
I'm a Continental, Contin... Continental
I'm a Continental, Contin... ContinentalEmbed
