You like Amar'e Stoudemire with dreads
Bobbleheads, chatterboxes flappin' but I got a lot 'em fed
Common head cold-level, minor setbacks, minor threats
To blockin' it's kinda Steph, step back
Ya shit is not knockin' like the feds
Don't get your head cracked lackin' common sense
On a whim I felt it, in mi casa you don't got no wins
Just to match the losses I don't have in your gym
Opposites attract opulence, the mud wouldn't stick
The sun make it so my soul's crumblin'
They dug it when they was young
More than one hole in one with no mulligan
Sellin' kids culture with death, circlin' like carrion
The more the merrier, phone got you livin' vicarious
Ice melting 'cause it's so hot
The veil lifts, the pain salient
Niggas started choppin' at the road blocks
As far as tracks, we goin' off
Brought the stroganoff beef, holy war
You know it's not unique to your boy at all
It's comin' out the teeth
Streets flooded like the pants weren't touchin' the sneak
They rain dancin' on this, no, they stomp
On all accounts, paid the cost to see this far
I'm not on board with the board you try and lead me on
I'm pullin' strings, it's time to let me off
The cook'll singe you
Protect your neck and don't forget the heart
We upper echelon with it, that's what they're checkin' for
I'm getting fed a conch fritter
I'm duckin' when the quiver launch missiles in the dark
Miss me with the glib remarks, switch hitta
Keep the innings long, niggaYou might also like9Embed
