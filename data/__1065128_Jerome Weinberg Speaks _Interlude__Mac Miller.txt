2 ContributorsJerome Weinberg Speaks (Interlude) Lyrics
"Boo! Fuck this dude! You're a clown"
"Good afternoon, Class of 2010. My name is Jerome Weinberg (ha ha). I'm running for Class President this year, because I believe I can bring positive things to the student body (Wow). My opponent, as you might have already heard, is Mac Miller (Cheah). Now... I know, he's the rapper, he gets all the ladies (Damn right) and he's that popular guy, but do you really want somebody running your school that smokes that much marijuana? Is that safe for your environment here at school? I've been in the bathroom and seen him lighting those Dutch Masters in the stall and that is not cool. So vote for me and not for weed. Thank you. Again, Jerome Weinberg."You might also likeEmbed
