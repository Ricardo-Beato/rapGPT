3 ContributorsDrug Dealinâ€™ Muzik Lyrics(Verse 1)
I fucked my money up
I bought another Rarri'
That's right Ferrarium
Least that's what they gon' call me
You know what I'm thinkin
Park it by the Lambo
But my garage is closed, it's all that it can handle
Watching me some Scarface
Breaking down this kilo
They ask me what the lick read, 1 triple 0
Pull up in something crazy, just like a superhero
Them boys they got that bullshit
You know that Coke Zero
If you ain't ridin' with me, it's 1-800-FUCK-YOU
Don't make me get them things out
You know that I would love to, love to, come through, something new, brand new
Aim it at the front porch hit everybody but you
(Chorus)
YEAAAHHHH, get into it, get into it, get into it
YEAAAAHHH, that drug dealin muzik
That's how I do's it
(Verse 2)
See my chain just sittin there
That motherfucker lazy
It say shit to the girls like
I know you see me baby
One time for my AK
That motherfucker crazy
And every nigga that owed me
That motherfucker paid me
And every day I'm iced out, gatted up, tatted up
Take that money right out the bag
Throw it on the floor then we add it up, add it up
G Stack Here, G Stack there
Sofa over there by the wall?
That right there my G-Stack chair
Too much money I can count it better when I'm high
I ain't bout to miss shit so I guess I'm sleeping when I die
You might also like(Chorus)Embed
