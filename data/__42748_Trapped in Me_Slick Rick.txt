6 ContributorsTrapped in Me Lyrics
Yeah kid..

Well first of all, sit your, cause I'm Victor
The Ruler decorate a record just like a picture
Slicker licker isn't this vigorous
Motherfucker too Don Suave for any nigga it's
I sold that offender
Short killer note is that I wrote a tremendous
Old neighborhood chow, now Rick vow
Even rich niggas must bow now
Extraordinarily handsome, grandson
Pack your bags, suitcase out the mansion
Any time that you wish that - I flow that
A whole bunch of big shots bums, now you know that
Opinions, wifepiece - hers fat
You wish a rapper could be better than perfect
Candidate, who talk shit anyway
And this is what most bitch walk this planet say

Ricky your rappin is trapped in me
Ricky your rappin is trapped in me
Your rappin is trapped in me
Your vocals is trapped in me
Your voice gets trapped in me
Your lyrics is trapped in me
Your vocals is trapped in me..
You might also likeYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fecal sick of it, through the thick of it
Even my cat like, "Ricky you the nigga kid"
Certain rappers earned thou aren't shit
Watch them nigga ass squirm now in front Rick
How dare you figure it out one come fair
Nigga career, buried now somewhere
Gladys Pips and off her, force her
Even back when I was the fattest shit the world saw
DJ, attack the eight track
White black motherfucking men RCA jacks
Royal, holla me, all y'all
Know I lead you, follow me, all four
Centerpiece, narrow in the shit ass
White House bounces off the power that the kid has
While other rap plundering under ya
You incredible, unstoppable wonder you
Candidate, who talk shit anyway
And this is what most bitch walk this planet say

Ricky your vocals is trapped in me
Rick your voice gets trapped in me
Ricky your lyrics is trapped in me
Ricky your rappin is trapped in me
Rick your voice gets trapped in me
Ricky your style gets lost in me
Ricky your lovin gets trapped to a T
Eyepatch and kneel, don't well that's a heel
Can't even go to the bathroom mat for real
Vision, won't patch eye kiss of the
Three gay niggas pushing up like prisoner
Can't stand and the Ricky is organic
On the real, got too much style for this planet
Woman hard mark, old charcoal nigga
Don't make me get the jewels start sparkle
Anytime you hear the La-Di-Da-Di start
Bitch underwear been flung off the body part
And find, they assembling grand rhyme
Can't find, I'm overwhelming to mankind
Why discrepancies erupt to
And play with intelligence you cannot measure up to
Candidate, who talk shit anyway
And this is what most bitch walk this planet say

Ricky your rap gets trapped in me
Ricky your vocals get trapped in me
Rick your voice gets trapped in me
Ricky your lyrics get trapped in me
Ricky your lovin gets trapped in me
Ricky your style gets trapped in me
Ricky your lovin gets rocked in me..Embed
