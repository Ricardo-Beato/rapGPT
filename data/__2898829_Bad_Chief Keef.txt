Bitch, O'Block, bitch
Smoking out yo dead homies
Thirty boppers for a opp (Bitch)
Fifty round or a hundred, y'all know how we coming
Big guns, they long body
Smoking out the 448 (Let's get it)
All we do is get money (Catch up!)
All we know is pop tags (Catch up!)
All we know is rock shows (Sosa baby)
All we know is run them bands up (Let's get it)
Green guacamole, check out my new Rollie

I'ma bad motherfucker, swish, I'ma splash brother
Ice on me, colder than Chiraq weather
I'ma bad mamba jamba, and I keep a hammer
Wanna see a nigga dead, wanna see me in the slammer
I'm so badass, fool, I can buy a school
Shawty send me nudes, I ain't wearing Trues
I'ma bad motherfucker
It can crash, motherfucker

Cracking cards, you lil fraud
The ink in this choppa still pass pipes
I’m pulling all nighters, I’m not tired
You can see me from afar
Grab a pound of smokes then I roll it up
Take your block and I blow it up
Got in her back and I tore it up
Adobe Lightroom, how I'm gloing up
My wrist like water
Now I got more money than my father
Like El Chapo, bitch we kill your honor
I pass the streets with flying colors
You might also like
I'ma bad motherfucker, swish, I'ma splash brother
Ice on me, colder than Chiraq weather
I'ma bad mamba jamba, and I keep a hammer
Wanna see a nigga dead, wanna see me in the slammer
I'm so badass, fool, I can buy a school
Shawty send me nudes, I ain't wearing Trues
I'ma bad motherfucker
It can crash, motherfucker

I get this swagga from my mama
Grab the bullets for my llama
Ride right or wrong with my partner
Burger king I got that whopper
And I'm on some playa shit, facial cleanser with cucumbers
Like Tadoe I'm counting blue bummas
Smelling just like some new money
My chain looking like a 
All this loud I can't hear you (dope)
The cops is all outside, money and bitches there too
Baby I'm so mellow, won't go slow yellow
If you catch me sleep, one eyes open though
This bitch heads a freak, we're up in a suite
Gat, when I sleep, I feel like Memphis Bleek
What hand you rolling with? Im feeling like I'm Beans
Pass me the throne, I'm feeling like a king
I'ma bad motherfucker, swish, I'ma splash brother
Ice on me, colder than Chiraq weather
I'ma bad mamba jamba, and I keep a hammer
Wanna see a nigga dead, wanna see me in the slammer
I'm so badass, fool, I can buy a school
Shawty send me nudes, I ain't wearing Trues
I'ma bad motherfucker
It can crash, motherfucker1Embed
