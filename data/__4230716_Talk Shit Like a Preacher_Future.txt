Word
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob

I designered my sneakers, yeah
I done fucked my teacher
Talk shit like a preacher (Talk)
On the corner with a beeper (On the corner with a beeper)
Never sat in the bleachers (I never did)
Ball harder than a player in the game
So fresh it's so illegal (Fresh)
I'm in trap hall of fame (Woo, woo)
Cartier my eyes (Cartier my eyes)
Trap 'til the sunrise (Trap)
Wanna hit it on flight (Hittin' it)
Tryna get me a vibe (Get me a vibe)
Put your head on my pipe (Head on my pipe)
Make the card go swipe (Card go swipe)
Made the car go skrrt (Skrrt)
Got light blue lights (Light blue lights)
You might also like
I wrapped in saran (I wrapped in saran)
I fucked it, I'm payin' (Fucked it, I'm payin')
We go to Japan (We go to Japan)
We shop when we land (We shop when we land)
And I got a 4-4
Strapped up, goin' loco (Cuckoo)
Makin' over the Richard Mille
Gettin' fresh like photo (GoPro)
Uh, I am the original bop (Uh)
I spill it up, they gon' mop (Uh)
Pink diamonds like a crack rock (Uh-huh)
Exotic bitch on my Black Card (Huh)
Ching ching, she done hit the jackpot (Woo)
Please, please, make sure you keep that MAC cocked (Huh)
Lowkey, Richie Rich don't tick-tock (Huh)
Hot, hot, hotter than a matchbox (Huh)
King Pluto came off the back block

I designered my sneakers (Huh)
I done fucked my teacher  (Huh)
Talk shit like a preacher (Huh)
On the corner with a beeper (Huh)
Never sat in the bleachers (Huh)
Ball harder than a player in the game (Huh)
So fresh it's so illegal (Fresh)
I'm in trap hall of fame (Trap)
Cartier my eyes (Swoop)
Trap 'til the sunrise (Swoop)
Wanna hit it on flight (Swoop)
Tryna get me a vibe (Get me a vibe)
Put your head on my pipe (Head on my pipe)
Make the card go swipe (Card go swipe)
Got light blue lights (Car go uh)
Made the car go skrrt (Light blue)
Pink diamonds like a crack rock (Uh-huh)
Exotic bitch on my Black Card (Huh, huh)
Ching, she done hit the jackpot (Woo)
Please, please, make sure you keep that MAC cocked (Huh)
Make sure you keep that MAC cocked (Huh)Embed
