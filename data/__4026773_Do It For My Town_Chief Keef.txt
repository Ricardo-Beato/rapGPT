11 ContributorsDo It For My Town Lyrics
I'm Chief Keef, shawty, niggas know how we bang
You might lose your life, shawty, fuckin' around with me
Salute me when you see, you know how I get down
When I'm in the studio, yeah, I do it for my town
Do it for my town, do it for my town
Like a light pole, yeah, I do it for my town
Do it for my town, do it for my town
You know how it go, yeah, do it for my town

Do it for my town, I'm the hottest in the game
You get the burnin' picture, I'm the hottest game
Motherfuckers know my name, say it two times
You said you a boss, in your head you lyin'
Nigga, say it two times before we kicked down your door
And we gettin' to the dough, from the ceiling to the floor
I'm Chief Keef, bitch, I ain't no snitch
For the hoes runnin' after me, I trip them on this get
 a load of this,  I had them all
Blow your head on the wall, don't forget I'm a dog
I do it for my town, I be in them streets
Shawty, tell me what you see? All my niggas be with me

I'm Chief Keef, shawty, niggas know how we bang
You might lose your life, shawty, fuckin' around with me
Salute me when you see, you know how I get down
When I'm in the studio, yeah, I do it for my town
Do it for my town, do it for my town
Like a light pole, yeah, I do it for my town
Do it for my town, do it for my town
You know how it go, yeah, do it for my town
You might also like
I do it for my town, salute all my dead mans
This is to my dead friends, never catch me slippin'
Motherfuckers trippin, so I do it for my town
See how I get down, so I do it like my town
And off the loud I'ma spray and off the lean I'ma awake
And I do it for my town, bitch, I'm rollin' like skates
Got a plan then escape, roll up some more and get gone
I'm the man, get gone, I demand this dome
RIP to Big Keef, miss Keta and Lil Moe
Kush we spent good dough, pow, pow, get low
Phony ass niggas, goddamn, miss me
Make this chopper chop you down then blam his face

I'm Chief Keef, shawty, niggas know how we bang
You might lose your life, shawty, fuckin' around with me
Salute me when you see, you know how I get down
When I'm in the studio, yeah, I do it for my town
Do it for my town, do it for my town
Like a light pole, yeah, I do it for my town
Do it for my town, do it for my town
You know how it go, yeah, do it for my townEmbed
