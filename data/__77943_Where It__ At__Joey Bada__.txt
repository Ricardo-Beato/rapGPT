Aye, what it is? One time, what up?
Aye, what it is? One time, what up?
Aye, what it is? Two time, what up?
Two time, two time, what up?
Aye, what it is? One time, what up?
Aye, what it is? One time
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

Let's get down tonight
I think I might blow a whole pound tonight
So shorty, hit me with the spot, and if it sound alright
Then you know I'm in the house
Let a nigga run his mouth, it's goin' down on sight
I'm always down to fight, ain't duff a nigga in a while
No bluff, ain't no church when you're livin' in the wild
I was hidden in the crowd, rippin' on some loud
'Til I seen the sucka nigga dick-lickin' on my style
Wow, must've been the material linen
Whole night, kept him in my peripheral vision
All I gotta say is the word and imperials get him
Word to my pops, I know niggas known for serial killin'
But back to the women, they tryna catch me slippin'
So I gotta pack a Mag' to stop venereal venoms from enterin' my system
If it ain't my moms or my 'sis then, I cut 'em in the system
You might also like
So tell me where it's at, and I'm in that spot
(So what you wanna do?)
I said so tell me where it's at, and I'm in that spot
(We got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at, and I'm in that spot
(So what you wanna do?)
So tell me where it's at, and I'm in that spot
(We got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at, and I'm in that spot
(So what you wanna do?)
Tell me where it's at, and I'm in that spot
(We got a lot to come true)
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

Yo, let me tell you what I'm livin' like — same shit, just a different night
Super bad chicks and they all up in my crib tonight
'Bout to get down, I'm tryna get up in the tights
So roll the indo right and I can show you what them bitches like
They just wanna come and have fun
Told this little hun she could come, but don't touch my funds
I might get crazy, I might bust a gun
So just gimme some more, and I might bust a son, might bust and run
They said love will come knockin' at my door, well, I guess lust must've rung
The dutch touch the lungs and it was on
Had her beggin' for the dawn 'til the crack of dawn
Then I passed it off to Kwon
I said it gotta be the swank if it ain't the rank
'Cause some pull hoes like how dreamers pudo
Hold up, let me pull ove'
Told her to hop in then put it back and drove and hit it out-park like Al Pujols
So tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot
(So what you wanna do?)
I said so tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot
(We got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot (Yo, fuck you, Joey)
(So what you wanna do?)
So tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot
(We got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot
(So what you wanna do?)
Tell me where it's at, and I'm in that spot
(We got a lot to come true)
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

She's so enticin', derogatory thoughts when I'm citin'
Slangs to get her wet
And I heard you're overflowin', I could test the waters like sea men
And I heard you like semen? "Sí, man"
Well, let me slide through, I know you're feelin' the kid
'Cause these nonchalant lines is lettin' me in
'Cause on contrast, I could see us lovebirds, it's in plain sight
And am I right, 'cause I heard you like the international lovin'?
On a higher scale, when I mean scale, I do it well
Let me go deeper, feel like I'm doin' it well
Word on the street, you actin' like a bastard, can I be you daddy?
You can hop up in my Caddy, and I heard you got the fatty
Yeah, cellurite
Just remember it's amazin' how I come up on the track
So duck and weave, and please believe my side effect is shakin' knees
Damn, here I go again with the suggestive themes
So tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot
(So what you wanna do?)
I said so tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot
(We got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot
(So what you wanna do?)
So tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot
(We got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at, and I'm in the spot
(So what you wanna do?)
Tell me where it's at, and I'm in that spot
(We got a lot to come true)10Embed
