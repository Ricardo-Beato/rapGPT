 designer, nigga breaking the code
He used to be high, but he done went ice cold
Gotta break my car down when I get on the road
If you going to a show, then why you riding with ?
Cause I juug in every stait, I got cakes to bake
Bad bitches to fuck, I got money to make
Ain't no limit on my hustle, it's a paper chase
, then went back to the stage
I'm the man in the streets, I'm the president
Fuck food stamps, I'm giving out quarter bricks
Get every gutter bitch 
Me and FEiN feending for them Ben Frranklins

Ben Franklin, Ben Franklin
Me and FEiN feending for them Ben Franklins
Ben Franklin, Ben Franklin
Ben Franklin, Ben Frankklin
Me and FEiN feending for them Ben Franklins

Was all in my room, 
Diamonds black like 
 whiter than Marshall
Saran rap  Imma tax ya
This Kush and this , forgive us, we bout to 
Panaramma get a pussy wet
This lifestyle, you know she took a jet
 took it back
 best head ever
Plus our spot, you can cook it 
My book and my street smarts 
 sell pussy, sell dope
 got the yacht, not no motherfuckin boat
 in bandanas
1017 and FEiN,
