2 ContributorsGame Over Lyrics
I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over
And don’t forget to tell 'em that I told ya
I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over
And don’t forget to tell 'em that I told ya

Said I'm going in shawty I got this little niggas
I'm lighting mama baby's daddy I'm doubt these little niggas
Still acting like they in or out these little niggas
I survived many magic in my house these little niggas
See I ain't tryin’ to brag I ain't tryin to boast
And since we talking that guess who sold the most
Yeah, damn right not even close
I'm the type of nigga to re-up could buy a boat
And when I say boat just so I mean a yacht
We talking about those cars just know that I got a lot
Yeah, no nigga just know I got a lot
I'm a trampoline nigga just know I flip before I flop

I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over
And don’t forget to tell 'em that I told ya
I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over
And don’t forget to tell 'em that I told ya
You might also like
They ask me why do I never stress cause I'm the best
Hello world you're rocking with Young so fuck the rest
My Aunty Mother let me borrow a kiss and I never miss
She always used to clean up behind me love her to death
I used to busy off on the block with the crack heads
I rather do that then sleep in a packed bed
Talking about so much pee stains wish I was dead
Wish I could sleep aside this bitch wish I was ten
You don't know that my nigga I'm bumpin’ that Slick Daddy
Thinking how could get my son the rich daddy
I could sell me some dope, I'm writing some dope lines
And that's how you kill some birds with one dime

I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over
And don’t forget to tell 'em that I told ya
I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over
And don’t forget to tell 'em that I told ya

I'm in The A-Town fitted that's blue with the red Benz
I'm a holla TIPs with me just and him just us in the black ?
I got them Martin Lawrence stones in my ear them bring 'em streets
Last time I looked down I was buying for two weeks
I was once the MVP in the Triple Beam Team
And push the Lamborghini that's Listerine green
What the fresh that bitch was clean
Must’ve suffered from a little PMS that bitch was mean
I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over
And don’t forget to tell 'em that I told ya
I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over
And don’t forget to tell 'em that I told yaEmbed
