Uh-huh
That's right, Carter 3, come on
Yea, yeah
Walk with me, come go with me
Yeah
It's Lil' Weezy, baby, hahaha

And I'm just lightin' up my...
La, la la la la la la (Yeah)
La-la-la, la (Yeah, yeah)
La, la la la la la la (One-seven)
La-la-la, la (Cash Money, Young Money)
Tell the story

Born in New Orleans, raised in New Orleans
I will forever remain faithful, New Orleans
I thank you, New Orleans—thank you, Hollygrove
That's been my hood since a snotty-nose
I come through the hood, suicidal doors
I used to come through the hood on the handlebars
Gat in my draws, money in my pocket
Crack in my jaws—I hope it don't dissolve
And you know I'm ducking Five-O and my moms
Young'un' quick to go off, like car alarms
Now, the young'un' keep his mind on the Parmesan
Them other niggas ain't eating, like a Ramadan
Spit the shit that make you feel it in your chromosomes
Got some money, put my whole damn corner on
Young Carter Part 3, I'm the cornerstone
Eagle Street, keep it going 'til homies home
And I'm just lightin' up my—

La, la la la la la la (Yeah)

La, la la la la la la (Can I kick it?)
La-la-la, la

Can I kick my story to y'all?
My glory in God, my faith in my flow
I pray that I go where no other rapper has
And when you're rappin' as—
Vivid as I, your limit is the sky, so I
Study B.I., I bang 2Pac
I hum Aaliyah, and Soulja Slim was a leader
Who am I not to follow greatness?
I give these MCs hell like they all atheists
Tell them hatin' niggas, "One!" like they in The Matrix
And tell the cops I can buy my own bracelets
I'ma keep the paper running, like a pair of ASICS
Used to sport the Gucci Bucks, nigga, no laces
Striped Polo, five-pocket Girbaud
Mama got her tubes tied and rocking dolo
I used to have the starter jacket with the logo
And the hat—me, myself, I had the N-O: that's the Saints, nigga
La, la la la la la la

It's Lil Wayne, I'ma shine in the rain
Now, nothing gets cleared without me signing my name
I'm just headlining the game
Won't quit until I'm A-Rod in the game
They riding the bench, they not in the game
I misplaced the key to the lock and chain
My spot remain, like a bleach stain—or cranberry
It's Murder She Wrote like Angela Lansbury
I remember being small, man
New toys when my mom would win the card game
Got my gifts before Christmas, then have to wait for them
I had a ten-speeder, scooter, and a skateboard, haha!
Then, we moved to the suburbs
Me and lil' Toya Johnson was lovebirds, aww, man!
And I swear, I feel born again
I'm in the building, like the audience, just lightin' up my—
