Roll the windows up
The block is hot
Blowin' westcoast green while the speakers knock
And we about to cause a scene like fuck the cops
Man we glowin' like the beams on my drop top
Roll the windows up
Let the base hit, crack a bottle of patron let me taste it
Split the swisha up the middle its basic, wild out we gone all get wasted

I used to ride on alpinas, up and down Slauson, 18 with a scheme ta', simply get my cream up
Tryna to get my loot so I can floss on them bitches, black 745, Rick Ross on them bitches
Bulletproof with the chrome exhaust on them bitches, triple gold Cuban links I'm Raekwon on them bitches
Listen, Slauson Ave is what the game missin, niggas bang for a livin' and retire to San Quentin
That's why my only mission was contradict to statistics
Make it out, double back, with a pot that niggas can piss in
Or release the window we can throw it at em
But for now just roll em'up so I can blow the sour

Roll the windows up
The block is hot
Blowin' westcoast green while the speakers knock
And we about to cause a scene like fuck the cops
Man we glowin' like the beams on my drop top
Roll the windows up
Let the base hit, crack a bottle of patron let me taste it
Split the swisha up the middle its basic, wile out we gone all get waisted
You might also like
Yea, let your top down, turn your beat up
Go and spark the L, throw your dubs up
Comin to the west? you gotta go through us
Have communication, or get ya' ass bust
Yea, our motivation got us feelin' like we can't be touched
Slauson, can't you tell? we don't give a fuck
We gettin money round here, they wanna lock us up
Secret society all we ask is trust
Real niggas and we neva gonna change up
Not for money, na homey cause it is us
Slauson boys don't talk don't speak much
Roll around in something foreign with the windows up

Roll the windows up
The block is hot
Blowin' westcoast green while the speakers knock
And we about to cause a scene like fuck the cops
Man we glowin' like the beams on my drop top
Roll the windows up
Let the base hit, crack a bottle of patron let me taste it
Split the swisha up the middle its basic, wild out we gone all get wasted2Embed
