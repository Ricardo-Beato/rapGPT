*Repeated during the Intro*

Yeah see a track like this, (Worldwide)
This is, like, you gotta put this in story form
You know what I'm saying
You gotta say this, like it's a story
You know what I'm saying, like
We're telling the kids the story
 x2
I never change
It's just part of the game
Cause everything stays the same, (What you saying?)
Everything stays the same,(What you saying?)

Triple team
Not so secret money machine
I.R.S, all in their chest
And that's gangster
Got my brothers banging with anger
Looking like family
Acting like strangers pointing fingers
At that ring of fire
Them government gangsters
Your presidents lying
Time tested, intrude with a wire
Government shots a nigga with an F'ed up trial
And that's gangster
Thieving, Robbing, Hustling, Pimpin'
Killin', Dealin', Bustin'
 Cause you ain't rushing
So what's up with that
Who, Why you fussin' (Worldwide)
You might also like x2
I never change
It's just part of the game
Cause everything stays the same, (That's gangster)
Everything stays the same,(That's gangster)

Cool Hand Luke
Bashed and browned stone
Got to stop the monkey
I uncle'd Dale Jones, (haha)
Haters mad in their case standing
Public enemy,  I'm a Black Planet
Hit the drove while I read the scripture, (sold 25)
Don't say I sound dope
Fans taking pictures
No I don't got the work on me, (uh uh)
Doing what they can to throw dirt on me, (That's gangster)
 Snake eyes on the dice
Married to the streets
Now they throwing rice
Got that hustler spirit, DNA spliced
Died here once, No way I'm dying twice
 x2
Don't be a 
Caused them crime free 
Dying is easy
You ain't got to be ready
Life is hard
Robbing for a living
They stealing days
Like they stole thanks giving
Now that's gangster
So these lyrics be simple
For my brothers and sisters
And anyone listening
New generations are getting ready for prison
For bitin' at the hand thats hit em
Ready to die?
That sounds like quitin'
And if you don't know why
Hear what Im spitin'
Thieving, Robbing, Shootin, Hustling, Pimpin'
Killin', Dealin', Bustin', (rock on)
