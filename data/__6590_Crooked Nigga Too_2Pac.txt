48 ContributorsCrooked Nigga Too Lyrics
Yeah, nigga
Yo, 'Pac
That's right, hahaha
Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything
Yeah
Niggas just wanna know
If you still gon' be on some crooked-ass nigga shit

Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
Ain't nothin' new, so, I do what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK-47 layin' on my hips so I don't trip
One motherfucker from the Underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
Yo, why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch, the motherfuckers got a beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are three feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin' the finger at police, onstead of them mothafuckas blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when the punk motherfuckers get to trippin', I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
You might also like
It's all up to you
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (Oh)
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (Oh)
Ooh, you can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too

You know, you really can't say that you blame niggas
Fuck bein' tame, set a flame, time to aim triggers (Uh)
Tupac'll spark a revolution, fuck the constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from Souh Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at each other (Fuck, no)
That's my motherfuckin' brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover
And all the bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (Fuck that)
Genuine draft, guns and ganja and my fucking TEC-9
They know their scared to see us sober (Ah)
Stop drinking King Cobra, and niggas will take the world over
Itâ€™s all up to you (Up to you)
Blame the Korean, blame the Jew (Fuck that)
Or be a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (Oh)
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (Oh)
Ooh, you can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too

Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes, G
They got my homies in a jail cell
Now it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nothin' but love for each other
So, motherfucker, make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop, see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step, or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back, keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and, ooh
You can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (Oh)
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then, I gotta do what I do, and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (Oh)
Ooh, you can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too5Embed
