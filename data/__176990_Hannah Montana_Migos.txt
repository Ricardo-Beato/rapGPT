Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
I got molly, I got white
I got molly, I got white
I been trappin', trappin', trappin', trappin' all damn night
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
I got molly, I got white
I got molly, I got white
I been trappin', trappin', trappin', trappin' all damn night

Hannah Montana I'm sellin' them bricks out the Phantom
Got Hannah Montana I'm drinking the lean out the Fanta
Glaw, Glaw, Glaw, fuck nigga got anna
Got your bitch, she white, Hannah Montana in a Panamera
She a college girl, but her wrist Katrina
In the kitchen, and she bakin' like Anita
Hit the club, diamonds shinin' like I'm drinkin' Margarita
I'm in London with the plug, gettin' the same car as the Beatles
Got bricks in the Audi, the Hannah Montana, the molly go crazy
Got Lizzie McGuire, Got Lindsay Lohan and I can't forget about Katy
I keep the white like the 80s, I keep the white like I'm Shady
Put the white rims on the Mercedes, young nigga feel like Pat Swayze

I got molly, I got white

I been trappin', trappin', trappin', trappin' all damn night

Got your main bitch on the Hannah, she droppin' and poppin' no castles
I'm smokin' on gas like tobacco, I'm drinkin' on lean taste like Snapple
In the V.I.P. rollin' a cord, passin' out mollies to foreigns
They poppin' 'em like they some Skittles, 2 bitches one me, Malcolm in the middle
Hop off up in the new Bugatti, cameras flashin' paparazzi
She poppin' that capsule, no Nazi
I'm twistin' the rock like I'm Rocsi
She sweatin' like she ran a mile, she soakin' wet she need a towel
She suckin' her lip, bitin' down
She moanin' and makin' them sounds
She came while she suckin' me now
I'm lookin' at her like damn
Hannah makin' them go bananas
She fuckin' and suckin' on camera
Pop a Hannah, she got stamina
My jag, still a Panorama
I'm beatin' the pussy like Michael, I call her Dirty Diana
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
I got molly, I got white
I got molly, I got white
I been trappin', trappin', trappin', trappin' all damn night
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
I got molly, I got white
I got molly, I got white
I been trappin', trappin', trappin', trappin' all damn night65Embed
