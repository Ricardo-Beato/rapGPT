1 ContributorThe Shit Mane Lyrics
You alright, my nigga?
Nigga, you die for the cause nigga
You know what this is
This is Los Angeles (what it is)
G-Gang capital of the nation

And you can see him if you slow down now
Alright y'all!
I want y'all to put your hands together
Is that him? (Ice Cube)

Ice Cube mutherfucker, with my nigga C-Toons
The C stands for Crazy, yeah nigga we loose
And we been saggin', before Bin Laden
Been braggin' 'bout his first underground cabin
An you been faggin', like a ciso dragon
