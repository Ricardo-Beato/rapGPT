8 ContributorsShine On Me Lyrics
Yeah
In the words of John Lennon, nigga
In the end, it'll be okay
And if it's not okay, it's not the end
Yeah
Gratitude, nigga
Let's go

Woke up this morning, it's a blessing (Blessing)
Every loss I had in this game, it was a lesson (Lesson)
Had a few complaints last time, I better check 'em (Woo)
Plug doin' yoga and shit, they like to stretch 'em (Haha)
Fucked around, lost it all, had to go back and get it
Everything I avoided, had to go back and live it (Damn)
Parking lot Lenox Mall, fifty blocks in the back
Saw them lights in the rearview and had an asthma attack (Yeah)
All I heard was the sirens, all I saw was the lights
Yeah, my nigga, it's over, you lived a hell of a life (Woo)
And just like that, they drove right past me
Two duffle bags of that clean, and, yeah, that would've been nasty, blessed

No matter how hard this shit get, just shoot for the moon
'Cause even if you miss, you're still amongst the stars, yeah
If your dreams don't scare you, you ain't dreamin' big enough, baby
Yeah, shine your light on me
Let's go
You might also like
All praise the most high (High)
You know how many Glad sandwich bags I had to tie? (Damn)
Really ain't no wins in this game, still gotta try
Yeah, Carlo White feel what I'm sayin', he in the sky (Woo)
Shoutout to Westside Bell, they let my dog out the pen
Get 'em four by ten, I guess a win is a win (That's right)
He used to slide through the 'yo, I used to slide him a five
I'm a full-time hustler, I just rap on the side (Haha)
And I had big hopes, yeah, I had big dreams
I ain't openin' shit, don't like to use that beam (Nah)
All praise to the most, I used to chase down fiends (Woo)
Helped me dodge that cell so I can live my dreams, blessed

Came so far, we ain't goin' back, baby
Some walk down this path, if you and the devil ain't never came face to face
That mean y'all walk in the same direction
Grateful, gratitude, yeah
Shine your light
Gratitude, niggaEmbed
