6 ContributorsPut Some Wood In Her Lyrics
I'm gon' put some wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put some' good in her

Ooh, he fat, he fat, I don't want you bitch
Ooh, he black, he black, but I don't need that bitch
Ooh, she fat, she wet, I don't want that bitch
Better move, get back, like that, now tell that shit
Huh, she wet, she wet, I don't want that bitch
Huh, she wet, get back, I don't want you bitch
You wet, you wet, I don't want that bitch
Said ooh, he fat, he black,  I don't want you bitch
I'm Big Guwop and I talk that shit
Pull that shit cause I got that shit
Got that scrap and I tote that scrap and I keep that scrap and I shot that bitch
Cadillac just to paint it black
I'm a big dog, they killed that kid
Average rapper would've said keep that
But I'm so high I can't even spit it
Guwop  got a Chinese bitch
And the bitch don't do, never buy me shit
How many hoes want to buy this dick
Cause I'm selling this dick, got ice in this dick
She said ten, other ho said twenty
Gone to the girl with the black and white Bentley
Shawty want to freak me, fucking on Peach street
Balling so hard that I feel like Meechy
Excuse me, I don't use this 
Took her to the closet, fucked her right where the broom be
Here's a room key, baby girl you can meet me
We ain't got to talk, you can freak me discreetly
Wet where the wheat be, your man is a weakling
Know I fuck you but he still want to meet me
Badda bing bing bing where your jeep be
24k, bling bling where my teeth be
Acting like you know me, nigga I'm an OG
Can't wait to show a nigga what a nigga showed me
Met him at the BP, robbed him for the BP
DC nigga rob a nigga on the GP
NBA money like CP3, this season I'mma get an MVP
Since I ball like Kobe nigga all the players envy me

I'm gon' put some wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put some' good in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put some' good in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put some' good in her
I'm gon' put some' hood in her
I'm a back breaker

I'm a neck bender
I snatch your hair and I know you like it
I could spot a freak so that makes me psychic
And I don't like niggas you ain't got to like
Too turnt up, I just turn turn turn, I keep turning nigga
Burning up all this dope dope dope, yeah keep burning nigga
You niggas ain't got no ho, no no, now y'all niggas still broke
You niggas ain't selling no dope dope, you niggas ain't seeing no 
That boy ain't got no dope, no, man that boy trap so slow
I just fucked his main ho, she said she don't even wanna ho no more
Happy , it's gone man
You alone, get sad dog
Call your phone, got packed pages
Getting back massage, from your main lady
I'm gon' put some wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put some' good in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put some' good in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put that wood in her
I'm gon' put some' good in her
I'm gon' put some' hood in her
I'm a back breakerEmbed
