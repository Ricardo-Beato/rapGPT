Easy does it
These bitches ain't bussin' shit, these bitches busted (Hey, yeah, busted)
You know this box is like my watch, this shit flooded (Yeah, yeah, ah, flooded)
What's the price? These bitches want it, tell 'em, "Up it" (Hey, hey, up it)
Without the money, I don't budge, what's the budget? (Yeah, yeah, budget)
You niggas gotta be on something, what's the substance? (Hey, hey, yeah)
You hoes brokе, get the cane, gеt the crutches (Yeah)
I give 'em face, give 'em body, give 'em luscious (Hey, hey, ah)
What's the price? Up it (Yeah, ah)

I don't even know how I'm getting through the airport, packin' 'round all this heat (Hey, hey, yeah, packin' 'round all this heat)
I like my hair to my ass and I like my niggas down on they knees (Hey, yeah)
Y'all hoes getting rolled like a chauffeur
Fucking for cool points, nothing to show for it (Yeah, yeah)
He want a rider but ain't bought a car, how you expect me to show up?
Only man I chase been dead for a long time, face on the front of this paper, ayy (Yeah, yeah)
This pussy bougie, this pussy choosey, pussy don't do no favors
Every time I peep hoes moving like me, I gotta switch it up
But the shit don't never hit quite like this 'cause your budget ain't big enough

Big drum, no percussion (Brrt)
Back up bitch, you buggin'
Beat a ho face, don't need no brushes
Double Ds in my brassiere (Yeah)
Face is top tier
First to watch my story but don't like me, bitches weird
Known to stand on all my business
I don't walk around with tension (Yeah)
If you gotta make fake pages to say it, that's mental illness

Ayy, bitch, I'm up and my bag right (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pussy and my abs tight (Abs tight)
Always going up on my fee like a gas price (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
On these bitches throats 'til they get red-eye like the last flight
Way I dog these niggas, had to be one in my past life
Ayy, baby, without my name these niggas nothin', they should thank me
I'm a gangster but I'm such a fuckin' lady (Lady)
In the mirror and it's clear why they hate me
Up the price, pay me

Ayy, easy does it (Yeah)

You know this box is like my watch, this shit flooded (Yeah, yeah, ah, flooded)
