124 Contributors6 Man Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

Boomin out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will'
6 Man like Lou Will'
Two girls and they get along like I'mâ€” (Lou)
Like I'm Lou Will', I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix, and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no-fuckin'-body, I run my own shit
I told you, thought I told you, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like MacGyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

Yeah, work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Young, but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas' souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly 'cause I'm from the snow, with all my WOEs
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no love'
And I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced, it's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
You might also like
Yeah, work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift
(Lou)
If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
I've never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby, don't worry, I know that they got me (6ix)284Embed
