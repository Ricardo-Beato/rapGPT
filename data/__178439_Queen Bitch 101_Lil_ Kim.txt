10 ContributorsQueen Bitch 101 Lyrics
Lil' Kim headlining the show, y'all better line up
And if your sitting down, get your behind up
She got her own class, y'all better sign up
Now hit 'em with some Queen Bitch 101, girl
Lil' Kim headlining the show, y'all better line up
And if your sitting down, get your behind up
She got her own class, y'all better sign up
Now hit 'em with some Queen Bitch 101, girl

It's Queen Bee, Sex in the City
Representing up top, brought the block wit' me
Custom Versace dress, showing one titty
In Brooklyn, New York, grimey and gritty
Men see the vide-oh, and go lick the TV slow
I show 'em things, they never seen before
Cause the way I move, is so flexible
I'll try anything, Imma try sexual
The blindfolds and handcuffs, a bit rough
When my thighs wrap around his head, like earmuffs
Doin' freaky weird stuff, talk tough, face down
And step into the Queen with the diamond laced crown
The Jewel of the Nile, I'm romancing the stone
I said "look bitch I got your man on the phone"
But you can swing through, if you want a peep show
Just bring a hun'ed grand and some Veuve Clicquot
You might also like
Lil' Kim headlining the show, y'all better line up
And if your sitting down, get your behind up
She got her own class, y'all better sign up
Now hit 'em with some Queen Bitch 101, girl
Lil' Kim headlining the show, y'all better line up
And if your sitting down, get your behind up
She got her own class, y'all better sign up
Now hit 'em with some Queen Bitch 101, girl

I'm a superfreak, I'm superfreaky-aah
You know I want it, so give it to me-aah
I'm Miss Prada and Chanel, Gucci as hell
Voulez-vous-coucher with this mademoiselle
I sell sex high price, the rap Heidi Fleiss
In Iceberg jeans, that ass looks mighty nice
And this is the fabulous life of Kim Jones
I got chinchilla covers on my flip phones
To match with them furs, baby got back with them curves
A female matte, with makeup on my words
Flow, mascara and blush
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
Comparison, what? Ain't nobody close to me
I'm on top, right where I'm supposed to be
And now, haters all kiss my bikini wax
And if you've seen the facts, you know the Queen is back!
Lil' Kim headlining the show, y'all better line up
And if your sitting down, get your behind up
She got her own class, y'all better sign up
Now hit 'em with some Queen Bitch 101, girl
Lil' Kim headlining the show, y'all better line up
And if your sitting down, get your behind up
She got her own class, y'all better sign up
Now hit 'em with some Queen Bitch 101, girl

It's my birthday, so go and get the cake
You can have it, you can eat it, just lick the plate
Cause the taste is great, and my panties are edible
Incredible, Natalie Cole, Unforgettable
How are you? Big squirt, little muscle
Keep grindin' I got a non-stop hustle
And don't quit, you can't push without pull
And you know you can't talk, when you got your mouth full
Now put your face in it, and just nod your head
Go on work it on down, too my thighs and legs
Put your face in it, no bitch can see me
Got the whole block buzzin', number one Queen Bee
Put your face in it, men gather round
Laid back, hypnotized, I'm the talk of the town
Put your face in it, get right or get gone
It gets no realer, fake bitches go home
Lil' Kim headlining the show, y'all better line up
And if your sitting down, get your behind up
She got her own class, y'all better sign up
Now hit 'em with some Queen Bitch 101, girl
Lil' Kim headlining the show, y'all better line up
And if your sitting down, get your behind up
She got her own class, y'all better sign up
Now hit 'em with some Queen Bitch 101, girlEmbed
