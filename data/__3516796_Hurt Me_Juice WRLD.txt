Enviyon on the mix

Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip, off the drugs, I'm swervin'

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex-girlfriend keeps calling my phone
But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried
All alone, did it on my own
So I show no mercy, I show no mercy
With my bros, but I got my pole screaming
"Please don't urge me, please don't urge me", yuh

Screaming, "Please don't urge me"
And fuck these hoes, all they do is irk me
I smoke my dope and I pop my perky
And lock my phone 'cause these hoes be lurking, yuh
Yeah, these hoes be lurking
A bad lil' bitch with her hips so curvy
I drive my whip, off the drugs, I'm swervin'
She ride my dick, off the drugs, she swervin', woah

Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip, off the drugs, I'm swervin'

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex-girlfriend keeps calling my phone
But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried
All alone, did it on my own
So I show no mercy, I show no mercy
With my bros, but I got my pole screaming
"Please don't urge me, please don't urge me", yuh (Yuh)

Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip, off the drugs, I'm swervin'36Embed
