18 ContributorsBlue Bentley Lyrics
It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
Two
I won't deny it

Two girls, same city, both wanna stay with me
I bought the plane ticket, say my life ain't litty
Say my life ain't litty
Two-story high ceilings, two-door blue Bentley (Two)

Zero bonds, so the women gon' be deep tonight
I'll proudly spend a hundred fifty G's, it's light
Chain walkin' on water like Jesus Christ
Should I do the gators, Nikes, or Adidas stripes? (Two)
It's been a good day, but tonight, we goin' bad
Whole squad causing terror, shout to Joey Crack
This a different lifestyle, how long can you last?
She wanna come with me, it depend on how she act
I'm different, we don't bank at the same bank
Shorty know she good when she with me, it's a safe place
For real, I can only send a lo' if you won't tell
I can alley-oop your whole career 'cause I'm known well (Two)
When she land, she let the whole city know
Then hit the room and send me a twerk video
She be all on her gritty flow
Met her headed to Coachella in Indio
Other one had a BnB, she fifty though
In my business, they wanna stick they nose
Think I'm wildin' like Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo
I'm a gentleman, open the car door, holdin' hands
They both hit my line, I might crush 'em like soda cans (Two)
You might also like
Two girls, same city, both wanna stay with me
I bought the plane ticket, say my life ain't litty
Say my life ain't litty
Two-story high ceilings, two-door blue Bentley (Two)

She ready, she sendin' nakeds through the text
Is your ex territorial? 'Cause, yo, I'll call her next
Put her down in L.E.S.Â 
Two-tone Maybach, it's a 580 S (Two)
Two girls, same city, both wanna stay with me
I bought the plane ticket, say my life ain't litty
Don't say it was all of my fault just 'cause your girl left you
She be comparin' us both, she know I'm more special
And she tryna show me the text thread
Said you lookin' desperate, I made the exit
My favorite found a shirt from my new one inside the bedspread
Asked me who it was, I said, "It was a girl I just met" (Two)
I can't be your lover
I'll leave they head fucked up like none other
Coi Leray says, "Girls is players too"
That's why I do 'em how I do 'em, then I'm makin' a move
I guess, soon, I'll be jumpin' the broom
Until then, keep 'em comin' in twos
I'll be right here when the datin' climate improves
These days, some girls be slimy as you (Two)
Two girls, same city, both wanna stay with me
I bought the plane ticket, say my life ain't litty
Say my life ain't litty
Two-story high ceilings, two-door blue Bentley (Two)
