Huh?

I like my yummy yellow (Yellow)
And that ass feel like Jell-O (Jell-O)
Shorty lightskin and tatted (Tatted)
Ass fat, so I grabbed it (Grabbed it)
I gave her this dick and I lasted (Lasted)
No rubber, no plastic (No plastic)
You know how to get right, mama (Mama)
I gotta get my baby (My baby)

She know my worth (Worth)
Kissin' on my jewels, fuck a nigga out his shirt
No time for holdin' hands, she holdin' my worth
Baby, pop that pussy and everything but a Perc'
I'm lovin' her good, makin' sure she never hurt (Hurt)
She lickin' my wood, never too classy to slurp (Oh)
Look me in my eyes when you tell me that it's mine
Told her I'm too playa, I can't fall for the lies
I know, baby (Baby)
That you a bad lil' somethin' and that ass, it drive me crazy (Drives me crazy, huh?)
And I swear that nothin' else faze me
You might also like
I like my yummy yellow (Yellow)
And that ass feel like Jell-O (Jell-O)
Shorty lightskin and tatted (Tatted)
Ass fat, so I grabbed it (Grabbed it)
I gave her this dick and I lasted (Lasted)
No rubber, no plastic (No plastic)
You know how to get right, mama (Mama)
I gotta get my baby (My baby)

It's Pop Smoke (Pop Smoke), she know my worth (My worth)
Young flossy nigga, she know I'm in my Birk' (My Birk')
She zippin' down my pants, I'm takin' off her shirt (Her shirt)
Kissin' on my neck (My neck), liftin' up her skirt (Her skirt)
I'm fuckin' her good, makin' sure she cum first (Cum first)
I had to get it in before she went to work (Oh)
All I need is weed and Henny (Henny)
No chaser (No chaser)
Can't nobody replace her (No)

I like it when she make me miss her
She make it stand up like a missile every time that I kiss her
You know it's the thighs for me
White toes, sundress, make you cry for me
Ooh, get you wet, wet, wet
Ooh, bend your back like that
Ooh, baby, just like that
Didn't know you could shake that ass like that
I like my yummy yellow (Yellow, woah)
And that ass feel like Jell-O (Jell-O)
Shorty lightskin and tatted (Oh, tatted)
Ass fat, so I grabbed it (Oh-woah, oh, grabbed it)
I gave her this dick and I lasted (I lasted)
No rubber, no plastic (No plastic, no rubber)
You know how to get right, mama (Get right, mama)
I gotta get my baby (My baby)

So yeah, my lady, my baby
No, no
Woo back, baby12Embed
