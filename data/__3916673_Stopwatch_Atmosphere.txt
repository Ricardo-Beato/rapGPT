8 ContributorsStopwatch Lyrics
Yes, and I guess, it's just a sign that I'm a pessimist
But life is limited if time is how you measure it
Nobody's innocent
Let's quit pretending such
Just let it finish up so this message can self-destruct
And I don't know my high from low anymore
I'm just trying to do my best
Trying not to get carried off the floor
Climb down the fire escape and throw the mask in the trash
We drowning in a tidal wave from a bath tub splash
And when they finally try to harvest a colony
It's probably when everybody is around an olive tree
It's likely gonna be too late to crown a hero
But we can make a statement making party at Ground Zero
And I can do this to ya all night long
But I, no matter what, I'd still be doing ya wrong
And when I'm strong enough to break out of my eggshell
I wanna hear the ladies yell like I've aged well

We fought ourselves we think we won
We taught ourselves to reach the sun
Took a chance going against the odds
We don't die, we won't even stop, watch
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
You might also like
And now I
Now I believe I've got the right of way
To make a brighter day
Instead of wasting life away
Waiting for lights to change
You not seeing me
I'm swallowed by the scenery
Camouflage my injuries
Channel all my energies
I leave room for the lens to shift
Should've predicted or presumed that you'd be sensitive
But every story needs a conflict, and ours is
I can't find a fuck to present you with
And baby it's the same song whole world singing it
Some of us just humming along some of us really bringin' it
And if it fires up a fraction of the sleeping giant
May we live long enough to see the times that redefine it
And I'm certain all that pain is for a purpose
Makes no difference who's the first one to write their name up on the surface
Some day your work will find its way to get observed
It's just there's too many words and nobody's getting heard

We fought ourselves we think we won
We taught ourselves to reach the sun
Took a chance going against the odds
We don't die, we won't even stop, watch
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop then you won't get caught
If you don't stop
Just take me as I am
Just take me as I am (oh yeah)
Just take me as I am (oh yeah)
Just take me as I am (oh yeah)
Just take me as I amEmbed
