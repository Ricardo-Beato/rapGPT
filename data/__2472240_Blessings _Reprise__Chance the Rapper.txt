163 ContributorsBlessings (Reprise) Lyrics
Oh, I-I, I-I, I, I-I, I-I-I-I

I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as mama's hands
Running water standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold like Nat King
I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous, unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label, pro-famous
I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me, but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shorty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public
I speak to God in public, He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must've missed the come-up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes
You might also like
I made it through, made it through, made it through
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming (It's coming, coming, coming)
So are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready for your blessings? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready (Are you ready?) for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready (Are you ready?) for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready (Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo) for your miracle? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready (Are you ready?) for your blessings? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready for your miracle? (Aw, yeah)
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
You ready, big fella?35Embed
