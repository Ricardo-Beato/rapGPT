27 ContributorsShe Said Lyrics

I guess everybody needs somebody to love
You can't leave love lonely
Cause being naive to it you can just lose it like that
See kisses for bruises don't make it heal back
It be's the sex appeal that's from the next and not necessarily the sex and
One might appeal to the intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type of chemistry
That flairs when her desires on fire
Quick is the fuse, another loves for hire

And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish
And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really going down
Up on the North side of town
Of course I bought a quarter pound
Of bomb hemp, feeling alright like Johnny Kemp
On a Friday night
Looking right cause my shit is tight
Blazing blunts to city lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights
Bounce to the House of Blues then I slid in free
With tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans, and no ID
Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the fizace
Of an epp with an iz-ass more amazing than grace
So I waste no time to kick my line
I say, "How ya doing?" She say, "I'm doin' fine"
So I commence to macking to baby to see what's cracking
So maybe I get her back at the cabin and start attacking
Threw back a shot of yack and started jabbering
Jibbing, fibbin, and ad libbing just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed, bumping some Isley
Thought I was about to spread the thighs but she surprised me
When she said, "Oh like that? You know I don't get down."
I know my homies gonna clown cause I let her stick around whenâ€”

And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish
And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish
Now Daddy's home
But she's been waitin all night so we could be all alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Trying to build something real, working fingertips to the bone
So much love's gone astray that it won't be coming home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouette beneath the moon
And she said, if satisfaction's guaranteed
Nothing else could come between the flight of a new love baby
Maybe we could be cool
Instead of sharing this here ship with the fools
You know that, right now, right now, right now, baby
Right now, right now, right now, baby
And she said
I'll give you the world if you want it
I'll give you the world if you need it baby
And she said
You know that she said
And she said
