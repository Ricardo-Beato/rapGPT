They will try and lock you up
Drag your name down through the mud
Afraid of all that you'll become
'Cause that's life here in America
So they will try and keep your mouth shut
Take your words and twist them up
Afraid that you will change the world
It's just life here in America
(Wheezy outta here)

It's really no way they can catch 'em
He far gone, you gon' need a couple jet lifts
Keep it real with niggas, yeah, the kid been passive
Global access off a motherfucking ad-lib
Yeah, mama, I done made it, no more DatPiff
Superspeed on the E-way, the Benz a 'Cat, yеah (Skrrt)
I was caught up on somethin', but now I'm back, yeah
I just almost had threw away likе eleven years

Psst, psst, ayy, my nigga, watch 'em drive-by
Better ride by, we get killed for a side-eye
Twelve demand respect or else they killin' 'til we all die
But not mines, we ain't small fries, yeah
See one of my whips, you better not run up with that rah-rah
This shit in my genes, I'm just like my dada
She don't smoke, but she say tonight she need a jump off
Skrrt, skrrt, I've been in the Benz with the frog eyes
You got checks as long as I could bring the smoke out
You a vegetable, nows all you do is smoke out
She want me to get her ass to where it poke out
She got hips so now it's hard to grip both sides
She tryna turn up on that dick and let's get both fly
I know a real throat killer but she so shy
She got her hand in my jeans doin' no jivin'
I told her we'll be at the crib in like four, five

It's really no way they can catch 'em
He far gone, you gon' need a couple jet lifts
Keep it real with niggas, yeah, the kid been passive
Global access off a motherfucking ad-lib
Yeah, mama, I done made it, no more DatPiff
Superspeed on the E-way, the Benz a 'Cat, yeah (Skrrt)
I was caught up on somethin', but now I'm back, yeah
I just almost had threw away like eleven years

I don't think it's hard to love me
I'm tryna embrace your lifestyle, baby
I'm tryna upgrade your watch and car keys
I don't floss, I don't like to floss my lifestyle

It's really no way they can catch 'em
He far gone, you gon' need a couple jet lifts
Keep it real with niggas, yeah, the kid been passive
Global access off a motherfucking ad-lib
Yeah, mama, I done made it, no more DatPiff
Superspeed on the E-way, the Benz a 'Cat, yeah
I was caught up on somethin', but now I'm back, yeah
I just almost had threw away like eleven years1Embed
