73 ContributorsHands Up (My Last) Lyrics
Yeah

Uh, let's get fucked up
On the road to riches, you're just a speed bump
Funny how the heater make a nigga freeze up
We smoke a tree down 'til it's just a tree stump
That Eastside nigga, bang on you bitches
I'm goin' at your neck, strangle you bitches
Got a long-ass list full of bad-ass bitches
And I stay burned out like a bad transmission
I'm on, like the lights, I light up
The kush, knock out, Tyson fights, I'm talkin' 'bout
Ass and titties, Sex and the City
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for "Forget it"
I'm lovin' my shine, sippin' on fine wine
Up in some fine dime, then she give me Einstein
Young Money, motherfucker, yeah, we picked a fine time
I'm a seventeen, nigga, bitch, I don't mind dyin', man
I just ended up on e'ry bitch's sex list
Genie in the bottle, get a motherfuckin' deathwish
Thugga in this bitch, he say, "Fuck y'all niggas"
Breakin' buds down the size of a football nigga
Red beam, gimme the light, no Sean Paul, nigga
Let Nina bust in your face, like a porn star, nigga
Yeah, I keep a Brian Pumper, no homo
The shit I'm on got the world movin' in slow-mo, man
I told Mack I was gon' do it
Above the law, but under the influence, man
I was on my skateboard, "Kick Push" swagger
Got my girl to the room, got behind her like a shadow
You might also like
I had her ass up in the air
I swear I got, swear I got the
Largest clip in the world right here in my gat
Yeah
And I wish a nigga play, I'ma bust a nigga ass
Hate Young Money? Then fuck you in the ass
187 and a hockey mask
Haha
YMCMB gon' ball 'til we fall
And it's fuck all y'all
Haha
Ball 'til we fall
And it's fuck all y'all
We straight, Sorry 4 the Wait

Yeah
I'm boolin' in this bitch
Yeah
Shoutout to my nigga, 
Shoutout to my lil' brother, Capo
Shoutout to the big homie, Game, shoutout to my nigga, Menace
Shoutout to my nigga, Top Dawg, my nigga, Jay
Yeah, uh
Five, I see you
Matter fact, I be you, nigga
Yeah
Shoutout to all my 
You already know what it is
If you under the 
Fuck with me

Swag is stupid, man
Stupid Macknupid, man
Carter 4 comin' soon, yeah
Sorry 4 the Wait
Sorry 4 the Wait
 I be you, nigga
Hands up in the air
I just want the, I just want the baddest bitch
Up in the world right here in my lap
Yeah, ha
Fuck with a nigga, man
It's Young Money 'til I die
We run this shit
