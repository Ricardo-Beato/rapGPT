9 ContributorsHeysus Lyrics
It's Guwop
Freethrow

Nigga better bring his best, nigga better bring his best
Nigga run up, I guessed it
By some long, that nigga was flexin'
All my dope I stretch it
Used to get the bricks from Texas
Nigga just got off the exit
Am I gon' pay or just finesse it?
Gucci Mane, I'm from Bouldercrest but I still used to hang on 
Keep a revolver like a nigga in a western
Been locked up so many damn times but I still ain't learn my lesson
If the jug by 12 didn't care about 7, still walk around with my mac-11
I'm a dope cook and professor
Skrt skrt, this ain't no hamburger helper
My uncle is my tester, free Jerry Chester
Got a show in San Diego, but the bricks still comin' on schedule
Got tha' handcuffs on yo' baby momma but Gucci Mane can't arrest her

New car; no roof
Fuck you and yo' hoe too
Jesus piece on my chest but I get the bricks from Heysus
Hector Camacho, ass niggas, y'all niggas ain't bulletproof
The nigga standin' next to you with it too?
Fuck you and that nigga too
New car; no roof
Fuck you and yo' hoe too
Jesus piece on my chest but I get the bricks from Heysus
Hector Camacho, ass niggas, y'all niggas ain't bulletproof
The nigga standin' next to you with it too?
Fuck you and that nigga too
You might also like
A nigga run up on gwop
Nigga gon' get popped
Nigga gon' get mollywhopped
Hit with a champagne bottle
My young niggas so crazy
Half of the time, don't listen
Half of the time, they trippin'
50 percent, prison
90 percent, yo' bitch with me
100 percent, that scrap with me
Young nigga bought 8 chickens
4 clean, 4 missin'
Yo' girlfriend so ugly, I don't even know why the hoe strippin'
You might as well just start pimpin'
Put that bitch on Ol' Dixie
Got two pints, so I'm big sippin'
Got a show in Mississippi
Oh this David Banner, hometown
If I'm there, it's my city
And tell him that I got fire with me
All my nigga's gon' die with me
You can walk over like you big bad
But when I shoot yo' ass, you gon start limpin'

New car; no roof
Fuck you and yo' hoe too
Jesus piece on my chest but I get the bricks from Heysus
Hector Camacho, ass niggas, y'all niggas ain't bulletproof
The nigga standin' next to you with it too?
Fuck you and that nigga too
New car; no roof
Fuck you and yo' hoe too
Jesus piece on my chest but I get the bricks from Heysus
Hector Camacho, ass niggas, y'all niggas ain't bulletproof
The nigga standin' next to you with it too?
Fuck you and that nigga too
Fuck you and that nigga tooEmbed
