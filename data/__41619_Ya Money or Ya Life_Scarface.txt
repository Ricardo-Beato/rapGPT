7 ContributorsYa Money or Ya Life LyricsOne up for the hustlers and two times for the mathematics
Long as I can grind I'm scratching
And jacking cause money's got a funny way of finding
The routes thats coming out your account when you stop your grinding
And blindly got you on a major chase for paper
And now you got your eyes on my vault tryin' to take the paper
The vapors will leave niggas wit dreams to face satan
I'm pacin' with infa-red beams just waiting
Hatin' and I don't cause the conversation
He spoke wit his killer but now he's got to face him
Racin cause off in these streets you ain't promised tomorrow
So if you bring pain I bring sorrow
I warn you ain't never been down to die slowly
And surely got niggas down to die for me
You owe me and I want it all and that's that
Bitch you got to pay wit your life not scratch

Don't want no money
I want your life
Don't want no money
I want your life
We straight negero subtractors gettin down ain't no factor
We just like boys in the hood wit no actors
Jack you got niggas down to come find you
And heat your ass up and leave your yesterdays behind you
Remind you a niggas definition means killa
If he out of paper he gots to go bring the skrilla
Stretch you ain't never seen drama like I can bring it
I'll wet you and leave you face down for no reason
I seen it- ain't many ways that you can change it
I'm dangerous society got me stamped so I'mma blame it
I'm aiming a fifty cal cannon at the planet
And stampin' if any motherfucker left standin is stranded
And I want it all and that's that
Bitch you got to play wit your life not scratch
You might also like
If any nigga at the top of his game then you can't hate him
Just watch for niggas who thinkin they game but you can't fade them
I'll cross spray you you fakin your moves and I'll play you
Ya ball playa, ya come with your goons and Ill spray um
I promise the same promise the game promise
When mutha fuckers step on my turf I bring drama
How now you niggas flip the grip check
I'll leave you shipwrecked in the valley of death dry wit your shit wet
I'm down to die for my shit I'll put the hood on it
I got my balls on this shit that put the good on it
I got a strap I call the mind changer
I'm more for realer than the shit that I kick when I feel that I'm danger
I'll leave your family wit a fuck you note
Where the fuck you wrote
You pay wit your life, what the fuck you thought?
