65 ContributorsSept. 16 Lyrics
Here I am, oh
All night, all night, takin' me, oh
Lay awake in bed and I'm alone
(Remembering)
Runnin' through my brain and I'm searchin' for you, oh no
(I'm remembering)
Missin' someone in my life, see, I'm in trouble
And every time I close my eyes, I see her face, see I'm in trouble
No, I can't forget her at all, haunting me
And I'm wishin' you were mine, all for me

Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
I need your love all over me
Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
Oh, I need your love all over me

Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, I need your love all over me
Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, I need your love all over me
Na-na-na-na-na-na, ooh, mmm
You might also like
You're a star, I worship you
Didn't you know? How couldn't you?
As she laughs, sun's shinin' through
You're my drug, my dose of truth
Anywhere, all you
As you lay beside me
Just us two, who knew
You'd be my everything?
(Here I am, oh, here I am, oh)
All night, all night, takin' me, oh
(Girl, you're takin' me, oh, girl, you're takin'â€”)

Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
I need your love all over me
Life goes by
Search for your love wherever it be
Life goes by
Oh, I need your love all over me

Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, I need your love all over me
Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, I need your love all over me
Na-na-na-na-na-na, ooh, mmm
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Na-na-na, na
