19 ContributorsWinter in Prague Lyrics
They told me they need a leader
I told them niggas my feature price
Music mean nothing to me if I ain't eating right
Momma told me better see the light before they cut him off
Fuck what's wrong and right, if it's a gun involved
Then I'm drumming off, nigga
Ricky Ricardo going where only God knows
Beating the block, I'm feeding the block
They want us all broke, women getting they heart broke
Prison is where our dads call home
So we don't see 'em in our homes
But nigga we from Long Beach
So Dre and Eazy never been our heros
And California niggas that see plays is weirdos
Lying like a mothafucka
Soon it's gon' be niggas dying like a mothafucka
Fry 'em like a mothafucka
I'm sick in my thoughts and sick in my soul
Never let a bitch in my heart nor a bitch in my home
Why care about a broad when all my family gone
So til' they free the packs fuck true love, I don't believe in that
You run your mouth then I'm meeting that
I won't tweet you back, I'll just see you black out
And leave you passed out, bleeding and shit
Feeding them clips, I'm the Hollow Man
Take a nigga life, he ain't got no plans
We anybody killing, we ain't got no friends (no friends)
Now back to the story at hand
They handed me nothing, I took it in stride
Take a shot at your head for taking shots at my pride
The only son my momma got that she can talk to
So you don't want no problems
That's never been a smart moveYou might also like4Embed
