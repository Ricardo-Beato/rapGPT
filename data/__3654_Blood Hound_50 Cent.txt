53 ContributorsBlood Hound Lyrics
G-Unit, UTP
Hahahaha
G-Unit, UTP, G-Unit, UTP
G-Unit, UTP, 50 Cent
Get 'em Buck, man (Grr, woo)

50 Cent, that's my name, man, I ain't fucking playing
I move on you with that MAC, mane (MAC, mane)
Come off that watch and chain 'fore I blow out your brains
Shells hit your chest, go out your back, mane (Back, mane)
See me, I put in work, man, I been doing dirt
For so long, them niggas get laid out (Laid out)
Niggas run through my crib to holla at the kid
That's when I start bringing them thangs out (Thangs out)
Then we go through the strip hanging up out the whip
Dumping clips off at they whole clique, mane (Clique, mane)
When witnesses around they know how we get down
So when the cops come, they ain't see shit, mane (Shit, mane)
My soldiers slanging 'caine, sunny, snowy, sleet or rain
Come through the hood and you can cop that (Cop that)
I'm sittin' on some change, G-Unit, that's the gang
Come through here stunting you'll get popped at (Popped at)

I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
You might also like
I came in this game knowing niggas gon' hate me
Just for the simple fact they know that I'm a rider (Rider)
I got a hell of a aim, I keep on telling you, mane
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya (Find ya)
When I get lifted, I'm tempted to tear your block up
You niggas can't run 'cause I'm behind ya (Behind ya)
Me and Chili in your city with a couple nine millis
You better stay in line, bro (Line, bro)
'Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it
I love the sound of gunfire, bro (Fire, bro)
Right now we smacking 'em with platinum and they hate it
'Cause we made it, that's what we keep that iron for (Iron for)
I represent it 'cause I'm in it, UTP until I'm finished
Juvenile, they can't stop us (They can't stop us)
And I admit it, I live it, I'll knock a baller off his pivot
With this motherfucking chopper (Baow)

I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
My twenty inches spinning, you always see me grinning
And you hear niggas call me grimy (Grimy)
They hit me with them bricks and I ain't pay 'em shit
I'm outta town, they can't find me (Find me)
When I come back around, man, I'ma back 'em down
I run up busting that TEC, mane (TEC, mane)
If you ain't got a gun and you can't fucking run
My advice is you hit the deck, mane (Deck, mane)
But if you get away and come back another day
My soldiers'll leave you wet, mane (Wet, mane)
'Cause we know where you be and we know where you stay
And we'll come checking through your set, mane (Set, mane)
Man, you heard what I said, now get it in your head
I ain't paying no fucking debt, mane (Debt, mane)
'Cause you's a middle man, what you don't understand?
You's a fucking fake-ass connect, mane (Connect, mane)

I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though16Embed
