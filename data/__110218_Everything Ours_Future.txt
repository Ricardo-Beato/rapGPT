27 ContributorsEverything Ours Lyrics
That money bring you power
Good bales and all that powder
We chokin’ off that sour
And all this money ours
That money bring you power
Them bales and that powder
We chokin' on that sour
And all these bitches ours

I’m leanin’ like I’m on a fifth of Henny
I been turnt like this right here from the beginning
I’m in the space, cause you know sky’s not my limit
I keep some racks on me like I be playin’ tennis
My girl she wakin’ up and she ain’t shop at Lennox
She fly and now we at Bell Harbor and we spendin’
I’m in that Lamborghini, no it’s not no rented
You see this ice on me and all my windows tinted
She want that Rover, I’ma go and put her in it
I'm like Dozier, I’ma gone and jump on in it
She on that Molly Cyrus ain't nobody business
She told her friends and braggin’ on the way I'm hittin' it

That money bring you power
Good bales and all that powder
We chokin’ off that sour
And all this money ours
That money bring you power
Them bales and that powder
We chokin' on that sour
And all these bitches ours
You might also like
I got money, I got power, I was born with respect
I know how them bales look, with your dope I gotta check
Threw a 60 on my wrist, 120 round my neck
Just to flex last Sunday, 50 thousand on a 'Vette
30 thousand dollar Rolly, got it draped up in baguettes
20 thousand dollar flights, Freebandz ridin’ jets
A lot of rappers get extorted, gotta pay for they respect
We record on gold mics ‘cause we don’t make nothin’ but hits
And I got your bitch with me, she the driver on the licks
Six bricks, zone six niggas ‘bout them Franklins
I’m a certified plug nigga, I always got it in
I supply all the drugs, tell me what you tryna spend

That money bring you power
Good bales and all that powder
We chokin’ off that sour
And all this money ours
That money bring you power
Them bales and that powder
We chokin' on that sour
And all these bitches ours3Embed
