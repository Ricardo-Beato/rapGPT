10 ContributorsPieces of the Puzzle Lyrics
Ayo a knight locked up in the cage, I'm enraged
But plenty of time to think of my position
This cop is corrupt, he gotta be in the mix of shit
He set me up so this nigga be fixin' shit
So I took out his competition
So he's my competition, that makes my decision
Easy, he gotta be the lord of the drugs
And that's Bamboo's man, that's where he stands
He played both sides of the fence on some real-real shit
Counterfeit thug, tryna play legit
Seen the bars slide open as I bought off a bail
I seen Bamboo waitin' as I exit the jail
She said, "Please Ton', you gots to go
You can't stay around this part of town." Already know
I'm blowin' bail, headin' up north, free in the country
She gave me a hug and a big stack of money

Sometimes you gotta figure out the pieces to the puzzle
Right in front of your face, stop the hustle
Take off the muzzle, let the dogs bark
Clear your mind, bring the light to the dark
Sometimes you gotta figure out the pieces to the puzzle
Right in front of your face, stop the hustle
Take off the muzzle, let the dogs bark
Clear your mind, bring the light to the dark

My cash missin', my lab different
Where the fuck is Bamboo? She need an ass whippin'
I was told Ton' was home, I'm way past fifth and
Guess it's time to get in my zone, this my last mission
Did what I could do with this pump and I'm like fuck it
Feelin' like Hammer on crutches, he can't touch this
Illustrious, multi movements
I drew the blueprints but now it's time for improvements
Press his peoples, left a message, nothin' peaceful
Shit police do, we could never be a equal
Execution, I get it in, retribution
Best solution, get up close when you're shootin'
Shit for realler, I'm mad raw with a killer
What's even iller, I knew the boss since Thriller
'Til we're even, I guess it's gon' be grievin'
A lot can change in 36 seasons

Sometimes you gotta figure out the pieces to the puzzle
Right in front of your face, stop the hustle
Take off the muzzle, let the dogs bark
Clear your mind, bring the light to the dark
Sometimes you gotta figure out the pieces to the puzzle
Right in front of your face, stop the hustle
Take off the muzzle, let the dogs bark
Clear your mind, bring the light to the dark1Embed
