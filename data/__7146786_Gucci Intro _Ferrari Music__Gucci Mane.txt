Drama, you know how we rocking, man (Uh huh)
I'll make a mixtape every day, man
You know what I'm talking 'bout? Showing out
That's what we do, baby
Bricksquad, baby, we got the best music out here, man (Aphiliates)
If you want to hear what's up, man, tune in
It's Gucci
What's going on? Get your money up, handle your business
My squad is eating, we have the hood on smash right now, man
Coveted morale is at an all-time high baby (It's Gucci)You might also likeEmbed
