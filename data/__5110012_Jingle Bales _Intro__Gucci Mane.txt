Wop
East Atlanta Santa
Jumpin' out the Phantom
Huh, go

Jingle bales, bales on the scale (Bale)
Fish scale same color as (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Tryna duck the feds (Fuck 'em), just bust a nigga head (Bah)
'Cause this nigga tried to play with my bread (Huh? Pussy)
Jingle bales (Jingle), motherfuck 12 (Fuck 'em)
I'ma drop a bag on your head (Wack 'em, kill 'em)
The neighbors won't tell (Nah), and we left no shells (Bah)
It's a dead man 'sleep in your bad (Ooh, go)

Jingle, jingle (Jingle), I'm Kris Kringle (Santa)
Tryna stack my chips up (Yeah), tall like Pringles
The work came darker, the price got cheaper (Cheap)
Coke like Christmas and pints like Easter (Pink)
Wrestlin' with the work, get in the kitchen like Batista (Rrah)
Shake the pot, shake the pot, shake it like a seizure (Skrrt)
Charge your boy the super high, sell it 'fore it's even dry
Gucci the executive (Gucci), but I don't wear a suit and tie
Dressed super fly, I'm too rich for even Uber rides (No Uber)
Can't even go outside (No), everywhere I'm recognized (Ooh)
Gucci Mane a model now, they need me to advertise (Yeah)
Pull up in an Avatar, hybrid with some stupid ice
She stalkin' me, she jockin' me, she watch me like a private eye
Mob guy, wise guy, your boyfriend a small fry (Small)
Drop top, wintertime, 'cause I can't be the fall guy (Brr)
Ballin' till you fall out (Ball), I just tried to buy the mall out (Oh, damn)
You might also like
Jingle bales (Jingle), bales on the scale (Bale)
Fish scale same color as (Skrrt, skrrt)
Tryna duck the feds, just bust a nigga head (Bah)
'Cause this nigga tried to play with my bread (Wack 'em, hoo)
Jingle bales (Jingle), motherfuck 12 (Fuck 'em)
I'ma drop a bag on your head (Damn, damn)
The neighbors won't tell (Nah), and we left no shells (Bah)
It's a dead man 'sleep in your bad (Ooh)1Embed
