6 ContributorsRec-Room Therapy Lyrics
Alright, now, this is how we gon' do this shit
You know what I'm sayin'? Niggas wasn't out in the streets back then when was doing this shit, son
You know what I mean?
Yeah, check the story

I done flushed bags of powder down project toilets
You could've found of me on the steps dusted, unable to call it
Jums in my pocket, the rental was stolen
Tappin' pockets on the local drug dealers just to see what they holdin'
I know niggas with crack vials stuck to they colon
The acid done bubbled up, now they stomachs is swollen
That's just life in the hood, ceramic glass when we baggin' our stash
The ultraviolet haze, we hit it and pass
We toast to the ghosts of old days (Yeah)
Old age, uh-huh
We rap renegades, must stay paid

Get money (Get money)
Get money, Ghost (Get money)
Get money (Get money)
Get money, Ghost (Get money)

Yeah, big fluffed-out Gooses on, Stan Smiths
The housing cops can suck our dicks
We jumping out of convertible matchbox shit
Next drip inhaling, chillin', my throat frozen, my orange brick
Bottles of Cru', bitches with Baby Phats, they swinging axe
They singing, "You still blinging, daddy, now bring it back"
To smoke these rap niggas, honey, I'ma need a match
To bust the game wide open, I'ma need an axe
I juggle this, practice, smuggle heroin in the cactus
Keep it hood, I still go and fuck a fat bitch
Actress, slinging the backs of five Cleopatras
A cocaine chef, I stretch money like elastic
Nigga, my raps is bigger, dynamics with the muscle advantage
Jay Cutler on dust when I blam shit

Get money (Get money)
Get money, Ghost (Get money)
Get money (Get money)
Get money, Ghost (Get money)

Yo, we been bagging since eighteen, kid, Polo rugs on with gloves on
Rented cars, frontin' on winning broads
Gum slow, half moon, leather pants, Avia' days
Keep your hands off my blunt and my waves
Benetton, Superman bomb, everybody in the lobby, we clapping
Hats on, protectin' your moms, you know how we play
Spray somethin' down if the team say
It's on, I dedicate my lines to the PJs
Triple beams, Pyrex jars, smokin' nickel beans
All we did is look mad fly, icicle rings
Whatever, homeboy, you want it? You could get your receipt
A lil' closer, you can sense we got heat
It's only me plus four other ill gangsters
We all anxious
To blow up your block and spank shit

Get money (Get money)
Get money, Ghost (Get money)
Get money (Get money)
Get money, Ghost (Get money)
Yo, I'm down for the get down, hit the town, sic the bloodhounds on 'em
I rip clowns, I flip pounds, I spit rounds
I'm on the prowl, my stomach growl, crushed by the crowd
Rush through Loud Records, drop mushroom clouds
I'm not around, I'm spellbound, I melt down your G-Force with heat walks
Free falling to a bed of money, bet he's hungry
Spread the honey, big head inside the Humvee
Mix lead inside my lungies, spend bread on my dungarees
And such and such, Ghost plugged me with this slut
Bitch, don't hug me, bug me, I'm ugly when I fuck
I'm hard like a jungle hunter, bust off in Heather
Double cross me, lift your boss off your feet, course he's feather
Whatever, whatever, he cried in the Benz
Tennis players get fried, playin' both sides of the ends
Keep your eyes on your friends 'cause they spy for the feds
Watch me rise from the dead, I got ties with the dreads

Get money (Get money)
Get money, Ghost (Get money)
Get money (Get money)
Get money, Ghost (Get money)Embed
