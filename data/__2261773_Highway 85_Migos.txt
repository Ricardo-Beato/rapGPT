Take it back to the nawfside
Migo N.W.A nigga
Woke up quick at about noon, just thought that I had to be on the north soon
Hop in my Bimmer to see my moms, my mom started trippin' 'bout my stinkin ass bong
Stopped at the gas station, get it pumped by the bums
See some niggas I ain't like where I came from
I grabbed my Glock then I dialed one number
Tell my brother that I'm slipping and I'm in trouble
So the nigga I don't like made a move to the right
I grabbed the Glock and point it at him on sight
The nigga to the left told me put the gun down
BOW one round, Uh, its going down
I ran out the store, I can't believe I ain't hit
My migos pull up with macs and sticks
Rel hopped out and let 2 shots off
Then I looked around the corner it's Gwinnett County law
I rolled down the window, it's the officer
Put his nose in my car, and say he smell the herb
He opened up the door and asked me can he search?
Hell Naw, officer you know how much I'm worth?
I'm worth a million

High speed chase, going down 85
Blue and white lights on the north side
High speed chase, going down 85
Young nigga ain't trying to see no jail time
High speed chase, going down 85
Blue and white lights on the north side
High speed chase, going down 85
Young nigga, I ain't trying to see no jail time
You might also like
High Speed chase going down 29
Mama on my line sayin' I'm on Fox 5
I said "you sure Ma?" she said "baby it's live"
I said "Fuck twelve" turn up the alpine
Rockin' down Boggs Road seen a punk ass busta
Got the 38 on me but this bitch kinda rusty
Fuck it i'ma shoot it, if it jam then I'm running
BOW BOW BOW BOW, crumping must be from Oakland
I ran through the cut, 12 chasin' me
Smoking on gas got the best of me
He getting so close, bout to tackle me
I turned around and emptied the clip, get from round me
It's fucked up, niggas in the hood they killing each other
And most of us got single parents, only a mother
Niggas in the kitchen whipping chickens, tryna get butter
Police on my ass cause the Budniks on the Cutlass
Police pull me over got the mac in the back
Wait till he get up out the car and hit the gas
High speed chase down 29
And if I get caught I'm gettin' a lifetime

High speed chase, going down 85
Blue and white lights on the north side
High speed chase, going down 85
Young nigga ain't trying to see no jail time
High speed chase, going down 85
Blue and white lights on the north side
High speed chase, going down 85
Young nigga ain't trying to see no jail time
Once upon a time not long ago
3 amigos by the name of Offset Takeoff Quavo
Stayed on the north side, thats where anything goes
And if a nigga disrespect, he meet the funeral home
Wake up in the morning, thank him cause it's me that he chose
Migo Jerz at the bando with a fork in a bowl
My nigga called me at the park and said its getting too deep
Jumped in my R8 with ostrich seats and hit the streets
Ridin' down club drive feeling myself
I know the block is hot, I'm screaming fuck 12 sparking a spliff
My conscious telling me you tripping Takeoff think I see 12
Damn I shouldn't of served that nigga at the Shell
Now lemme tell you a riddle
Mirror mirror on the wall, what would you do if police told you pull over your car?
Mirror, when do you picture the Migos falling off?
The mirror said you stupid boy, don't ask that question at all
I see red and white blue lights as I look in my rear
Put the gas out, it's Friday and it's smokey in here
Fuck another high speed chase, that's when the hemi kick in
Forgive me for my sins, I ain't going back to the pen
It's gon be a...

High speed chase, going down 85
Blue and white lights on the north side
High speed chase, going down 85
Young nigga ain't trying to see no jail time
High speed chase, going down 85
Blue and white lights on the north side
High speed chase, going down 85
Young nigga ain't trying to see no jail time13Embed
