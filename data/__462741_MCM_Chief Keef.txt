15 ContributorsMCM Lyrics
She say that I'm her MCM (Girl, you lyin')
But I don't wear no MCM (No, I don't)
All I wear is Hermes when I do, yeah (I spent fifteen hundred)
Ridin' around, flexin' on you (Like skrrt-skrrt-skrrt, skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
She posted me all as her MCM (As her MCM)
But I don't wear no MCM (I don't wear no fuckin' MCM)
I spend twenty hundreds when I do (Twenty hundreds when I do)
Bitch, I'm cold, bitch, I'm sick, got the flu (Bitch, I'm sick, I got the flu, MCM)

She say I'm her MCM, I be stuntin'
She say I'm her MCM, I be swaggin' (Swaggin', swaggin')
Hop up in my car and then I drive it (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
I mean I don't drive it, I ride it fast (Skrrt)
Put my feet to the gas (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
Ayy, smokin' on this gas (Dope)
Put your shit in the trash (Throw that shit out, nigga)
Shawty know that I'm the man (She know that I'm the man)
Seen my ice, she like, "Damn" (Seen my ice, she like, "Damn")
Baby, I don't need no fan (Baby, I don't need no fan)
She seen my car, she like, "Damn" (Seen my car, she was like, "Damn")

She say that I'm her MCM (Girl, you lyin')
But I don't wear no MCM (No, I don't)
All I wear is Hermes when I do, yeah (I spent fifteen hundred)
Ridin' around, flexin' on you (Like skrrt-skrrt-skrrt, skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
She posted me all as her MCM (As her MCM)
But I don't wear no MCM (I don't wear no fuckin' MCM)
I spend twenty hundreds when I do (Twenty hundreds when I do)
Bitch, I'm cold, bitch, I'm sick, got the flu (Bitch, I'm sick, I got the flu, MCM)

Tell me now, ayy (Tell me now), tell me now, ayy (Tell me now)
I don't ball, bitch, I Gretzky now, ayy (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
I don't fall, bitch, don't let me down (Don't let me down)
I'm on point, bitch, on every sound (On point with every sound)
I'ma fly up, you take the levee down (Take the levee down)
Always in somethin' foreign, I'm heavy now (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
Spent fifty thousand in True Religion (True, True)
You spent ten thousand, think you just shitted (Hell nah)
Hit Louis Vuitton for my Lou' religion (Lou', Lou')
Then hit Gucci for my Gu' religion

She say that I'm her MCM (Girl, you lyin')
But I don't wear no MCM (No, I don't)
All I wear is Hermes when I do, yeah (I spent fifteen hundred)
Ridin' around, flexin' on you (Like skrrt-skrrt-skrrt, skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
