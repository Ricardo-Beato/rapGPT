2 ContributorsWaves (Freestyle) Lyrics
The product of Reaganomics
Teen parents, failing on a promise
Try to stay modest, hard to live honest
When it's no dollars and you talking with ebonics
Far from a scholar, bad at job interviews
Can't type a resume, dropped out of high school
Tried to go to night school, kept leaving early
Fucking with this thick freak lightskin shorty
Looking for an answer, only get questions
Like I'm in reverse on a busy intersection
Rolling up , close to perfection
Lost in the streets, won't ask for directions
Wanna find corrections, keep doing wrong
Same old song and it don't last long
Tapping out early, submittin' to the streets
But I stay focused, put the words on the beat
But I stay focused, put the words on the beat
I wanna go to heaven, 'cause I'm livin' in hell
My excuse being broke: being in jail
Been broke my whole life and it still ain't fixed
I'ma die tryna get rich
How the fuck you gon' eat, if you can't 
Who the fuck gon' feed us? We can't starve
It ain't good over here
You rollin' up purple but it's wood over here
I lay in bed and think, then I shed a couple tears
Know before noon, I be on my third beer
Go to sleep late but I wake up early
Way I live, dawg, prolly won't see thirty
Wrote my first will when I turned 18
Turnt out ever since I served my first fiend
Hot cup of ramen might last me a day
Broke and ain't ate shit since yesterdayYou might also likeEmbed
