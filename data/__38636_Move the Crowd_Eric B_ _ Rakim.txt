34 ContributorsMove the Crowd Lyrics
Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer, and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind start to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause when I heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd?
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It's simple, ain't it? But quite clever
Some of you've been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause, if not, and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long, 'cause I'ma move on
The dance floor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd

Move the crowd
Move the crowd
Move the crowd
Move— Move— Move the crowd
Move the crowd
Move— Move— Move— Move—
Move the crowd
Move—
Move the crowd
Move the crowd
Ra— Ra— Rakim
Ra— Ra— Rakim
Ra— Ra— Ra— Ra—
Ra— Ra— Rakim

Imagine me with the heat that's made by solar
It gets stronger every time I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving, but eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth is shut
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric B is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent, wise on the mic, I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise is due to Allah and that's a blessing
With knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving

Move— Move— Move the crowd
Move— Move— Move— Move—
Move— Move— Move the crowd
Move the crowd
Move the crowd
Move the crowd
Move— Move— Move— Move—
Move— Move— Move the crowd
Move— Move— Move— Move—
Move— Move— Move the crowd
Move— Move—
Move— Move— Move the crowd
Move— Move— Move— Move—
Move— Move— Move— Move the crowd
Move— Move— Move— Move—
