13 ContributorsWar & Peace LyricsIce Cube the great!!
"He has indicated to us that he has sufficient.. firepower..
To.. blow up the Bradley vehicle..
And in fact his words were
'We are ready for war.. let's get it on'"

War.. "War, and peace"
Sing it!

War and peace... (Sing it!)
War and peace, forever!
War and peace, together.. always!

I'm at the highest peak, still glad the meak is understandin me
Artillery, thoughts of killin me is just a fantasy
The man in me is ready for war, like Holyfield/Tyson IV
A gang against you niggas on the shore
Either or, your whole family is on the floor
Windows breakin all around em, you can't climb this mountain
I'm at the fountain, with my troops
I start screamin at em like Patton, we gattin at you fools!
You might also like
War and peace... (Sing it!)
War and peace, forever!
War and peace, together.. always!

Negotiate... strategy is the key!
I hope they ain't... exclusively after me!
Cause if they are... we gots to be who we be!
And make a star... out of a head enemy!
The papers said... that he died tragically!
They found his head... with no legs and bo-dy!
We made a pledge... to the Dub-S-C!
Bloodshed... if they got no love for peace!
Sing it!

War and peace... (Sing it!)
War and peace, forever!
War and peace, together.. always!

I'd rather break bread than uhh, break your head
Break your legs, have em broken, I ain't no joke
Don't provoke, the gun smoke from the highest Loc
Eternal peace, for my peoples and my folks
My crips and my bloods, criminals and my thugs
Just show a nigga love when I'm rollin on them dubs
Just, give a nigga hugs, we can ride on this piece
Westside for Life but still down with the East
Sing it!
War and peace... (Sing it!)
War and peace, forever!
War and peace, together.. always!
War and peace... (Sing it!)
War and peace, forever!
War and peace, together.. always!
After the haters attempt to blow up his car
We find our hero, Ice Cube, on the ground
Bruised, but not beaten
He pulls out his cell phone.. WITH THE CHIP!
And begins to dial Mack One-Oh
Who's faded and rolling through Inglewood
With Mr. Short KHOP
Words.. are spoken1Embed
