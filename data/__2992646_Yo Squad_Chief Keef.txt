7 ContributorsYo Squad Lyrics
Wow, wow (Ha)
A.O.N
Chief Keef, we in this bitch
L's, kill
Chief Keef

I'll tell you what's real, I gotta get a mil'
I'm all about a buck, yeah, that's what's up
See me in the streets, shawty, I don't give a fuck
Big booty bitch, yeah, she can get it up
Get my money like a doctor, I gotta get it up
Sneak dissing punks, I put them in the trunk
Got this 9mm, yes, shit can go dumb
Want me to blow something? Nigga, let me know something
Chopper let me hold something
And I'm trying to fold something
Got my mans looking out just incase the po' coming
See, these hoes say I'm slow but they go so dumb
Got a big booty bitch screaming "Oblock"
When I'm in your park call me Sammy Sosa
Hit the bitch out the park like Sammy Sosa
And everything Gucci like a pair of loafers
Me and bro god aim at yo squad, bitch

Got engaged to the money now I need a wedding ring
Got some money in my hands then I'm spending everything
I'm a boss, bitch, get lost

Run up on me then I'ma up the drama
I'ma bomb, he gon' jump
'Bout money, can't get caught
Bitch, on Wawa, I put it on God
When I said I'm the man, she said put it on God
So I put it on God to get a few stars
Now we running through a crib and them TV's large
Talking 'bout my niggas, they 'gon need stars
'Cause we too large, the WIIIC be the squad
Glory Boyz be the squad and we stomp any yard
And he can get hit with a pump in the yard
Or he can get jumped in the yard
Everybody got on Timbs and stomp in the park
She see my face, she like, "God"
Now she fucking with the squad
Need that money, swear to God
Chief Keef, play his cards

I'll tell you what's real, I gotta get a mil'
I'm all about a buck, yeah, that's what's up
See me in the streets, shawty, I don't give a fuck
Big booty bitch, yeah, she can get it up
Get my money like a doctor, I gotta get it up
Sneak dissing punks, I put them in the trunk
Got this 9mm, yes, shit can go dumb
Want me to blow something? Nigga, let me know something
Chopper let me hold something
And I'm trying to fold something
Got my mans looking out just incase the po' coming
See, these hoes say I'm slow but they go so dumb
Got a big booty bitch screaming "Oblock"
