4 ContributorsPounds of Purple Lyrics
Got  8 pounds of purple
80 for the  smoking on  purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
80 for the  smoking on  purple

New  coupe dawg, 
Outside of the mansion look like a car lot
 running to the ball like 
25  everytime the kid come out
 45 in the glove box
 the truck stop
 bought it just to make her eye pop
 no use for 
 think  dredlocks
My sniper rifle partner known for giving headshots
Not Omarion, but on my chest it's an ice box
 love me, she have me on her IPod

Got  8 pounds of purple
80 for the  smoking on  purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
80 for the  smoking on  purple

I'm a grown man,  but a fool if 
But I'm cool, cuase this grown  with me
 see them O's on that table
My brother's creeper, for the game, but I made 
 I've been on my own, that's what grown men do
 to your streets like 
 like a baptist, money in my mattress
Love a country girl, juicy booty like a 
, Project not an actor
White girl bringing money, making me the master
Cholo with the baking soda,  one way
Split the coke like it's butter, but this ain't no 
, chopper bullets do spray
3 bullets at a time, means 3 niggas dying
 like a polar bear, 
 stank

Got  8 pounds of purple
80 for the  smoking on  purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
80 for the  smoking on  purple
I'll jack this nigga for all his dope
 racks and a couple of guns
Stashed off in the shotgun house, with black ski masks and 2 gass bombs
Niggas done put a hit on me, all 45, you can find me dead
Niggas be out here with this shit,  Imma break his bread
Somebody shot my girl house up, somebody shot my mama house up
Somebody out here want me murdered, somebody out here trying their luck
Bruh I stay low key in the streets, cause I'm always lerking, look
 I can rob me a rooky
 yeah I took it
Flashing, flashing
Nigga gon be flashing
All these brand new cars, throwing up the cash in
Flashing, flashing
Some niggas ain't having
Money in  then they grab it

Got  8 pounds of purple
80 for the  smoking on  purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
Got  8 pounds of purple
80 for the  smoking on  purpleEmbed
