Sosa baby, G.B.E baby

Cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope

In the AMG, lookin' like I cook dope
Since I'm a fucking pimp, I'ma need a good hoe
Catch your ass lackin', give your ass some good smoke
The bitch up in this foreign will give your ass some good throat
The bitch up in the trap will give your ass a good pack
The shooter ridin' with me get your ass in a bag
Beef ain't really nothin', nah, really it's a snack
Before I made it here, I was runnin' through the packs
Runnin' thru the racks up in Saks, it's a fact
To ride presidential, I done blacked out the 'lac
Put the rover up and I done backed out the back
Told 'em send the fiends to the back house for crack
I hop up out the whip, look like I sell controlled substances
When she see the ice, I bet I leave the bitch like, ''Oh, shit!''
Lookin' like the plug, 'cause I'm really on my boss shit
Trapper on my lap, just in case I have to bust shit
You might also like
Cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope

Got a hundred bags, served all dimes
Got a thousand more of those, call the line
Snowman, I want seventeen fives
Why a dealership tellin' me lies?
Told me that my trunk was up in the front
But it's in the back, bitches think it's summer
Slide the van doors, beat a nigga drum
I promise you won't even see a nigga comin'
'Cause I move like Obama, probably fucked your mama
Saw a bad bitch walkin', she want me to run up
She saw the falcon stripes down the middle of the foreign
Saw the fire out the pipes then Ii knew that bitch was goin'
Don't make me hit your college, fuck your bitch up in your dorm
I don't even know her, too many bitches in my phone
Let me cut this Marvin on, that mean we can get it on
You know bitches love dope, that's why they can't leave me 'lone
Cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dopeEmbed
