Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley
Got blazed before they told stories
I'ma get blazed before I tell y'all stories
I saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died
So he had him cremated
Took his ashes and then made it to a diamond ring
Now he watches his son shine everyday
I just thought about that
While I sit here ashing in this ashtray, yeah

The making of a mad band, intricate stories of DeVante Swing
Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome
But Alex was putting coke in his nose, nigga whylin'
Could be a myth, but I swear that the source was close
Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy
Mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway free-fall from a balcony, he swayze

As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ashtray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me

Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman
Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats
This is what came from their pain
From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange

It's time man (word, it's time?)
Straight up (it's time, man)
Aight, set that shit off (set it off then, nigga)
Set it off (set if off)

Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved me later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin' off the stroll, coughin'
Stitches in they head, stinkin' and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin'
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark—NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve—they bust a U-ey, I jog
To my building—come out later wearin' camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain—strangle men
Niggas gaspin' for air 'til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes—tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant
Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had 8 partners growin' up, 8 turned to 7
7 turned to 6 niggas, got 2 in heaven
6 of us holdin' it, now it's 5 rollin' thick
The 6th one's parole flipped, 5 niggas went to 4 quick
When he went O.T., college life
Converted into gangbangin', 4 niggas still hangin'
Years passin' and slang changin'—3 of us now, 4th nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real—he did the snake shit
Fake shit—beat his ass down
Yo his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown
All I got left in the end is 2 of my best friends
And we all goin' out to the death for these ends
What?

Runnin' round quick to split your mug, it's easy
To score but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin' over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors

(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'mma ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange, show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) A-yo, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch "CHiPs", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out
(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) '92, it's halftime

I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)

Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter

Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play

My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fullies
Brrrat! Cars peel, the East Coast cartel
Rats get their tails snapped and trapped
The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of you
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of falling in the elevator, passing floors
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad-luck prayers
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards getting sprayed up
Sabotaging my makeup, my watches get laced up
Even if they indicted Jacob
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off
Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from an iron
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as hell, and they fucking like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to your hotel, I'm made in this shit
Put a barrel in a capo mouth 'til his scalp come out
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about
King poetic, too many haters to count

'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you
Only if they grind with you or slang for ya
Seen niggas live, laugh, party and die in that very same corner
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable
Private planes landed out in Teterboro, weed I twirl

If niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find
Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard
Where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin' I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
No Half Steppin' with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin'
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork in Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
Your part of the world might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin' with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin' for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin' since Roxanne Shante' made Runaway; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin' nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things
Like, somebody's always watchin'
My life before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled

Growing up surrounded by 'caine like I was Abel
Shit was unstable, now Visionary's the label
Plus Def Jam, know who I am
I’m that motherfucker that do it just ’cause I can (The cannon)
Now I’m on a level that your elevator can’t reach
I got information that the school system doesn’t teach
I got verses that your Sunday service wouldn’t dare to preach
Second coming of Christ flow, they like, "woah"
Rapture you with lyricism, kidnap your soul
And changed your mind like I’m penetrating your skull
I seen shit John Lennon couldn’t imagine
Just me and a mic on a main stage spazzin'

‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
Hip hop just died this morning
Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From "Beat Street" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut24Embed
Look here see, Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal
Found the body dead in the isles
Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad
Guess they'll never play it again Sam
Damn that was my jam, now she's on the lam
She made it out with 200 grand, what a scam
While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
"He said one glance is all it took ya, she's a real looker
They say her old mans a bootlegger
Transporting in any weather and at this rate we'll never get her"
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's getting me tight
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party, "What are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang."
It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said "See you later."
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck
Behind the street lamp was a silhouette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke, says, "The devil got you guys by the throat
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
That's the reason why Eric B. is not president."

Well what do ya say
Ya see?
Ya see?
Ya see?

Look here see, I know you got soul you're trying to hide it
How did you kill a man out in Cypress
One Eyed Charlie, he only hangs with the criminal minded
Says you guys did it doggy style is he lyin'
She says, "Walk this way, I'll tell you a children's story."
We hit the bodega got her a few 40's
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy
The truth came out as we got to her suave house
Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said, "It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady?" She says, "Bill Gates."
What are ya born '77 or '78?
She says, "Nah it goes way to an earlier date
Slave times," claims the slaves said rhymes
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive
Who? "Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave
The Bronx.", now she shows me the cash
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt
She said Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc
Ah-ha!
Ah-ha!

Listen up sweetheart now we gettin somewhere
As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air
But before she dropped the money bag on the floor and died
She said if you really love me I'll come back alive7Embed

Life
I wonder.. will it take me under?
I don't know
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked
Evidently, it's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing ya clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be: Paradise life, relaxing
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six-digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa!
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land

You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait! I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit!
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em, love 'em, baby!69Embed

There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids on how life is golden
So I'mma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See I almost felt a tear drop

When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)
You might also like
Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Caz, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love

When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways

Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)
Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable, it's the end cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past enough of it, aight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25

When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too10Embed
I know you can feel the magic, baby
Turn the motherfuckin' lights down
Esco, whattup? (Whattup, homie?)
I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? (Hahaha)
Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right)
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!)
Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in!
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah, (yeah) we just come outta nowhere

I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, like, "Fuck it then"
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring
Should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely

I'm back in the hood, they like, "Hey Nas" (uh)
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh)
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, "Why"? (uhh)
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh)
To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word
I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in

Uh, uh

They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas too real, Nas, true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's "Fuck Nas"
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I ever make a record, I'll take a check
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with cracks in my sock, 'sleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the craft of the streets
But look at me now

Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce
She gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen

And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual
‘Cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew
She worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back with it, so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snorting and her eyes had bags in it
She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged with bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards

Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid

Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up

Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept

Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth

Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, Glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Beaumount
Otisville, Lewisberg, Fort Dix, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though
Stayin' on my hustle

Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip from the paparazzi
Still playing numbers you can't stop me
Still wearing bundles, and spark weed

Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef
So lead by example or get trampled

Exotic lady eye-catcher, holla at ya, call me the chiropractor
Workin' like Muay Thai class, get perspire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rockin' D Boy, Fila velour in one-ninety black Benz

Young, rich and flashy; young bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes 'til ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids

I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw
To chillin' in wine cellars, sticks and humidors
That's what I call mature
That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest, shit

This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side
Blockin' y'all from goin' to stores and buyin' it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was ridin' with it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs
They said "Nas, why is he tryin' it?"
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winnin'
Forgettin' Nas the only true rebel since the beginnin'
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel
They can't sing what's in their soul
So "Untitled" it is
I never change nothin', but people remember this
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids
With new ideas bein' told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it

No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable y'all, let's go!

Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right

I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me "Plug him!"
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But, uh—a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)

You gon' get everything you ever wanted, baby

Trust

My niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tourin'
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality, then back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood MB cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a Le Tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot, wylin'
Look at the chain I snatched with the medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed, the God done made it home smilin'
Half of the crew? Prob'ly on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners, stick the elevator never thought
Project life would promise nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's Nikes, my motto: look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray, these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you?' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends

One for your wife, one for your freak
Silver-spurs Rolls Royce, too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties, beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style, baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin', "Damn, wish my niggas could afford this"
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers, accountants, investments
Money doubles, triples, protect it: hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried is your familia
Gon' keep your name prosperin' to the maximum?
You should live, there's only one life, that's the physical
Rich or poor or in jail, why the fuck should you be miserable?
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heartbeat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you
The shit you used to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block, gamble Gs on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turned 'em into shopping malls, the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real
Everything must eventually come to an end
So try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better

Hailing from Queensbridge, New York
Is the one and only
Nas
And now, ladies and gentlemen and boxing fans joining us around the world.  IT'S SHOWTIME!
Verse 1:
Spirit of the streets
Walks in the ring
From Brownsville to spar fit
To boxing king
Man or machine, an animal
Physical strength and intelligence
But that type of intellect
Y'all respect
To connect those punches
Still as a kid he stole lunches
To mak'in millions and the hundreds
Chaotic conscience
The rage, the stage, the grander
Had to endorse slander
Took it like a man
Cause the mighty stand alone
In the bigger ring hole
The penitentiary
Barbed wire and stone was amp up
They locked a champ up
Even my brains in handcuff
The robin hood, seasonal santa
And y'all give him nothin to begin with
Dilapidated buildings
The drug epidemics
Historical stories
Pain, love and glory
Mike Tyson
Never see another like him

True legend
His hands was two weapons
Understand this minds a true blessing
Designer jewels and diamond
A modern day Jack Johnson
Flying private jets and fully protect'in
Automized with ladies Godiva complexions
Lots of sex'in
Hung with a lot of stars
Learned a lot of lessons
Between dead homies and best friends
And getting domed out in stretch Benz
Educated from the hood and pestilence
The dead presidents don't see your pockets
You just gett'in
You got a full court press for them
Benjamins, I've seen money be the death of men
It's a warriors world
Only the strong survive
Who's next to try
Who's next to be the next
T-Y-S-O-N
He gave us hope
May the best man win

Peace to the rich lady purse snatcher shot in the back
I know your hunger kid, I know they hung your dad
Burnt ya mama crib, I know that hurt you bad
Minstrel shows, from gold to shackles and back to gold

Bad attitudes, octoroon skin tones
Slave food turned to soul food, collards to neck bones

'Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunnin' when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comin'
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal...
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'

Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, 'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', "Fuck tomorrow!"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans, it's crack, 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peepin' for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin' for Rambo
The cop who got grazed back in the days
Chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop — he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday, he makin' ten arrests, shit!
My nigga, check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten, inspect it
(Already checked it, dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass, real fly with the blonde caesar
Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man, short, slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She do be lookin' weaker now, her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
'Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he's vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
(Yo, let me knock first) Soon as he open, let your Glock burst
They had the chains on, son, hit the lock first
We busted in, the cop jerked, Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders and the monitors
They eyein' us, (Nas, yo, he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down, ayo, the bitch is saved now
She's livin' in a snitch grave now

Shootouts is similar to Wild West

Please God, just save the life that the Devil sold
See, It Was Written, but was never told
Peep the jewels, black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron
Police roll in hot pursuit, tryin' to stop the loot
Fuck Jake, cock and shoot

Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek
To do his two-to-four, niggas show love from all around the board
Peace, Lord, Sony Handy-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, 'cause when you come home, we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape, play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings, we fed the fiends
(Gamble in the back!) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank, lost about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own The Hill
Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel
Something in the air, yeah, Frank returned with Pierre
A gunslinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin', 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each other's faces
With kids and grandmothers around
Frank's only concern was his papers
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad 'cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo, High, get the 40-Cali stainless
Jake is still out, let's make it real and still make 'em niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since '95
Shootouts is similar to Wild West

This is a journey into the world's most largest and notorious projects, Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers
He held a mass appeal and a likkle boy smile
Depressed has a complex, his mouth was foul
You need to stay around, I feel like tellin' some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my mans Lakey and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin' his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ah, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega
Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that
But it's so hard to put a coward's name in my rap
Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin'
But that's Nas always lookin' out for bredren
'Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him
'Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious, kid
Mega, for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way, it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

Nah, we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So now they say

Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
It's like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to help get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy
(Man dick riding Nature) Nothing else to say
Man, Nature moved to Marcy (What? Far)
Backward ass niggas, man, fuck them niggas (Far away)
Go 'head with the program, man, proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, it's just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it

So now they say

I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
I had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you, a check's due for me for your fame
Mega, I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown, "How that sound?" Poor thing
I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A
Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say
(The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)

So now they say

"The Bridge is over," my dick
The Bridge'll never be over, long as I'm alive and breathin'
Braveheart to the graveyard
I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo, P, Prodigy I got love for you, man, I love you, man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle
You can't save everybody
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right, my nigga
Be untouchable, my nigga
So it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real
Ayo, Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit, man
I'm not your father, man
Be your own man, stand on your own two
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga
Or don't even rep this, man
Ayo, Mega you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets, man
Yo niggas is in the grind
Where you be at man? Niggas be buckin'
Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood?
It's disgusting, man, stay out the magazines
Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth
There's no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin'
That means the cowards get out and real niggas stay
Niggas been hating me since I been nine
Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks
I'ma always be the young don
Don't be like the niggas on the other side
Hating me 'cause I'm beautiful
Real niggas in Queensbridge
Y'all niggas come up and get this money and move on, baby

She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how excitin' life is
I used to hang around dudes that use ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met must've been fate
First date — crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept askin' questions how the cash made, how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed, and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raised, kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that
I drop you off home, I call, you hit me back
I wanna dig that, and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids at
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact, I'm kinda hopin' we can stay together, word

I see you dressed up in white, face covered in veil
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwin' rice
And it's the day that your father give you away
To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say, "I do"
Drivin' off in the Rolls Royce, just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the States
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Somethin' in the back of my head say, "Why us two?"
Maybe 'cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together, it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful
Deeper and harder, love layin' new with you
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
It's like days can go by while I'm with you, and I won't even care, word

She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, papi's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums, and those who had crazy chips
'Til one day she decided to flip
It was nuttin' I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talkin' this divorcin' shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake half my car
Half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason, yo, she had me stuck, and I had her in my web too
You my queen, God bless you

Yeah, niggas want to talk about this rap shit
Niggas want to talk about this money
About these cars, these homes, these labels
Clothes, sneakers, big money shit
Now everybody trying to get rich
Now get rich niggas, fuck it

Some rap pioneers be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggas your grandfather's age, they pants still hangin' down they legs, talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, ‘cause they say you ain't pay dues
And 
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places
We on some low level shit, we don't want niggas to ever win
See, everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper, but few flow fatal
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables

Now some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
With their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anything to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses; hungry fucks are moralless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggas, I could've wrote your shit
I had off-time, was bored with this
I could've made my double-LP
Just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks – it got good to ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT?
When they crown you and you rise up to your position

When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition
Carry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition

Now niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
The live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now
From British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, with our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
Because I'm what? Every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up
If I want that or the whole world to peep it
Now carry on tradition
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em, I promise I carry on tradition

When they crown you and you rise up to your position
Carry on tradition
When they knight you, then you go to fight
Go to war, don't petition, carry on tradition

I love you so much, don't ever leave me, I won't let you leave

The hoe turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love with her
I saved that hoe 'cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heartbroken, she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jig, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her cream I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, 'bout to lay something flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped

Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
'Cause when we hump we do it up
Make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slinging all night long, fiending to stroke ya
Seeing niggas with you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money

Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich
I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you?
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you, before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm with you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat with government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional, musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped

Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At The Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars
Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45
'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evenin'
From Nevada where the sun was beamin'
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs "Peace", kept it movin', I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no, that's down low
My baby's drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around, yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower
On the last swing, I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter
Thought about my nine-side Glock
But somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack
Seen wifey layin' with some nigga mumblin' shit
He had one hand on her ass, and she was rubbin' his dick
Toastin' wine glasses, cherry scented candles was lit
Couldn't handle the shit
Searchin' for words — I found none
Without a sound, I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through

Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face, was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
"Son, you home early — they wiped you out that quick?"
I said, "Nah," showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, "Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' — and probably still is
Snuck in my crib, some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me"
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20G's on a ring I would've hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front, when I talked he had jumped
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock — Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze
We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide
Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots, couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger, cocked the Glock and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said "Amen"
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer
Held her close, squeeze the toast
Said to her, "Now unto God, we elope... we elope"


Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
"What you up to? The cops gon' bust you."
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, "Nobody leavin'
Everybody—"

Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch them
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, "Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play."
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded "cool," but told me out here this how motherfuckers—
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change38Embed

They never realized how real Nas is, so decisive
It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your prime-time
Food for thought, or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit
My thesis on how we creep quick
Fucking your wife, that ain't no secret
It's mandatory — see, that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handled for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping, they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages
Winking at some female cops with cocked gauges
Really, it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap, then I'd be sticking you
The MAC inside the Triple Goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just C.R.E.A.M. or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own in this ghetto inhabitant

Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to Mona Lisa, brown reefer, 10 G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinking and thinking

Your Roley shining, thinking to yourself "Nobody's taking mine"
At the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, "Where's the hundred grand?!"
Stripping her hand from all the ice
Wouldn't you know? You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim?
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffing ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, just a reminder:
Shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could've passed out, your coke is gone, now you ass out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes!

It was a murder, Jake just hit the corner, people swarmin'
Three in the mornin', I jumped out my cab like "Fuck!"
Niggas is buck, mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, "Yo, he should've ducked"
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for real-er
I'm all high, it's late, I'm lookin' down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His moms had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kinda took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop ya life clock, the beast'll time ya
Cell to cell, suspect-ass nigga, you fail
First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail
Burstin', blastin' at you, forty cal' shells split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch, why tell?
We roll wit' no regrets, destinies, fifties and equities
Queens'll be the death of me!

Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red Ferrari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, "Nas, roll with us"
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him "Here keep that"
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
She said—

Arrangement's a closed casket

Yeah, hahaha
When I flow for the street, who else could it be?
Nas

Yo, explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychos, killers
Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin' front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early to fear none, little Nas was huntin'
Livin' carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks, y'all don't hear me
Yo, I'm in my second childhood

When I flow for the street, who else could it be?

Got babies by different ladies, high, smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since '85, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes, it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood

Drinkin', smokin', hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin'
E poppin', ecstasy takin', won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin', stuck with limitations
Lustin' men, many hotels, Fendi, Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well
Her kid suffers, he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job, never stay workin', mad purty
Shorty, they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin', she the same person
Never matures, all her friends married, doin' well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin' like she was twelve
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life
Guess she's in her second childhood

We use the word everyday
Now we don't know the capacity of this word
Are we headed for conflict or not? (Yes sir)
Because we did not break down the capacity
Of the same what (The same word)
Brothers and sisters, this is why we hung up the consciousness
We've been taught wrong

Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of Martin King just ain't around no more
Du Bois ain't here, James Baldwin neither, they all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this Porsche two-seater
A lawyer left the hood, he never looked back
To be a Fortune 500 CEO, it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back?
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies is hiring blacks
Fresh hip-hop lingo for your campaign ads
Controversy surrounds who could say it and when
Some niggas are full time, some play and pretend
So fuck that, no apologies on the issue
If it offends you, it's meant to, it's that simple

Oppression couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say it's quite amazing
The use of ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
It's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one

Every word we use, it has a capacity
And if you don't understand the words you're using
And understand the capacity of it
You are using words that is creating a destiny for you

Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky
Murder trees, cruising gat in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Trump Plaza, Suite 3010
Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell 'em hoes hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume and mad boom
And there's video taping blooming asses on the zooming lens
Rollin on you nondescript niggas, you're marked for death
Like Colombians with bad coke that gyp niggas
Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts

To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles
This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow?
You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say
He say, she say, I'm 'bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make
Sipping clear liquor with niggas, that talk sideways
Listening close, to every word in case they violate
Up in the projects Apartment 5D
Spark a lea' it's 'bout the reed, counting everything the block see
We 'bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour
Hold in case we gotta rip niggas, loaded
Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggas
From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my mans with guns in hand
Police vans, they missed the summers again

Yeah, power to the people, death to the phonies
This beast to the mic one two check, y'all fed-e-rallies on me
And they look like you approachin me like how you, homie?
The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me
After the young black male cause he makes a lot of money
So hustlers make crack sales cause they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While making cake with real golded plate rims on Humvees
The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga
Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow
Motto no stress, smoking less than I did befo'
You see the kid was broke 'til I spitted vivid expressions
Of hard living ghetto children, of a lesser God
Religion was fast women, expensive cars
Y'all witnessin over 10 years, the best of Nas3Embed
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah
For niggas up in they mom's crib listenin'
To this unadulterated Nas shit, wishin' it was them
Instead of, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope, see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they was into dope back then
Numbers, pimpin' and robbin', well they still robbin and pimpin'
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin'
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin'
Trips expensive gift shoppin' whip drivin'
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin' you thinkin' naw it's just rhymin'
But all this time it's like organized crimin'
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin', everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin' all of those who thuggin' it
They wanna lock us up 'cause they kids are lovin' it
Not knowin that most rappers are straight ass

Caught myself driftin' in thought, 'cause now it's different I thought
Niggas was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shan and Scott LaRock in the jams
Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin' mother had a motherfucker
I don't think about it niggas talkin' there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a pot? Yes
Do trees grow from a forest? MC's y'all are clitoris
Y'all niggas roll with any click that's winnin' any crew
Doin' whatever's trendy, even they envy me too

What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns? Star Wars
'Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
'Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out
This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold, we live it
Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin' on your nine to five jobs
Entertainment, this is our world, this is our language
Different regions speakin' east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube
Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques, your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggas who tell you your all of that
'Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin' it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin' the place
Or catch you when you least on point, puttin' your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in KB Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggas check you
"You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you"

Solicitin' ill editions of that murder I wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on the top of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes
Chrome kitted up, calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched, checkin' my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutchin' gats, quick to bust

Blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be the real
But impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Countin' bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP

My name's passed out like it's somethin' venereal
But back in stereo

Sip Cris', push the 6 with the biscuit
Jeep full of chickens — pull up beside, have a listen, y'all
"Nas, y'all" — fly gangsta, wavy hair, teeth chipped in
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk, links truck, rocky bracelet
Cognac kernel, never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero

To '96 ('96, motherfucker)
Check this shit
('96, Escobar 600)
Check this shit!

My mind set, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas actin' illy? Word to Will, he 'bout to feel it
I feel it, he should've been dealt wit' it
Them niggas sour, they put too much flour in they coke
And got the nerve to wonder why they broke
While we was gleamin', niggas was schemin'
Seen the ill Bimmers beamin'
Triple-beam and doublin' C.R.E.A.M. had 'em fiendin'
To get they fingers on a dose-ah, I called Sosa
"Sosa, these niggas hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the 'Bridge, I'm 'bout to go loca"
Left my rat beggin' me to stay and stroke her
He came through wit' two fly bitches (Uh) Venus and Vicious
Wit' two MAC's inside the Volvo, what up, God? I'm still sober
I need some Henn' to bend me over
My nigga Hav' got a soldier
It's gettin' down, it's goin' down, kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin' back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
Wit' two females that don't smile, diggin' they style
Yo, what up, son? These niggas done started somethin' wild (What up)
You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holdin' the steel, I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point 'em out, smoke a Phill' and chill
I laid back — Escobar status, knowin' The Firm got it cornered
We on it, shit we was born wit'

Polo pullover, big links and rockin' boulders
He's stuntin' after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back!
He never seen us, Sos' gave the MAC to Venus and Vicious
Lookin' delicious, handle yo' bidness
And step to him, shake your ass, try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco wit' young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco of all ages (Yeah)
They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York
If they've had to, heard him ask Venus, "Could I have you?"
He jumped out the Jeep, heard her tell him, "Don't grab, boo!"
They started chattin', was only 'bout a minute flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin'
We followed 'em pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and 'em
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'?
Sosa said, "Say no more", we started rollin'
Before we got in, they must've shot him
Security wildin', there the girls go, hurry up, we out in
The 940 — me, Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy!

 Hello?
 Whassup, girl?
 Ain't nothing, this nigga in here stressing
Talking that old off the wall, back to Africa shit again
 What, that God Body shit?
 Yeah, that dumb shit
I'm trying to get up OUTTA here
 I hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumping tonight
 Word, f'real, where?!
 You know, where the real niggas is popping the Cristal
Not that White Star!
 Ha hah! Word, where the real niggas at?

Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby, baby, listen

A young, wild, beautiful love child
You like 'em thug style, link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink, a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel, looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (So fine..)
To see ya prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man
But you juggle way too many willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear, get your fuck on
Following week, you back there, but what you stuck on?
Weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up, ma? Fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo, it should be a throne for us
But for now, that's a whole different zone from us, word!

Grow up, girl, instead, you want revenge so now you act the nicest

To get his mind, all you do is give him something priceless

More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed

There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you

Igloos of ice, tricking on you
You never listen to this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past, though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain

Where are you focused? On legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo, you seem hopeless
Your value — too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop 'em off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost
(You should be ashamed)
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you being lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn, look! There goes a black girl lost
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong

Carolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Keys of dope, lovin' cats to skeet in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passin' for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shoppin' when she not, coppin' bricks of that shit
She hoppin' on dicks, ridin' Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually, bumped into her shoppin' for jewellery
Her bodyguard screwin' me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothin' new to me, blowin' backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, "Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her"
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work

From Attica, known for keepin' chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
5 years plannin' to blow soon as he hit the bri-di-cks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O
Started robbin' niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starvin' niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, "Don't knock hard"
Laying with his bitch, "niggas is rich" is what he told her
Played the block, holdin' cracks inside the baby stroller

Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God (Peace God), he stared at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em

And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racin'

Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

To my dogs.. wherever you are

Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
Ain't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit
We used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're
Capable to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die
You was like God to us in the form of Allah

Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop
And use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin', offendin' me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
All Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could Never Be Peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on "the realest shit you ever wrote"
We had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggas would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?
Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs, put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said "Baby bless"
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game
Could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain
One day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way out of this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack
To my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that
.. always survive.. but why?

Always survive, always
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive

As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you one of those prophetic MCs
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies

Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad

You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter

I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
You thought I was a boxer Prince Naseem
But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you riding with me
You keep asking, "When do you have time for me?"
I'm never free always on the move, business oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying

Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
But I be out with my peeps in them system Jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely
But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby

Newscaster: "Recently there has been an emergence of socially

A new trend in the Hip-Hop world."

(Yeah, check it, uh)

Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard little longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice, I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MCs, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MCs on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh

Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a black ho
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinsky or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most women who love Givenchy or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse

I don't care about the hurricane as long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates, they burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (Nas: Uh)

Can we please have a moment of silence
That's for my niggas doing years in confinement
And for my soldiers that passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor
Symbolizing let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep till slugs kill us here
This for my dogs, stuck in the struggle trying to gain
Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Blooding and thugging, folking and loking
Criping and creeping, Latin and Kinging
Or just for poor righteous teaching

As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children
Who got raped or murdered or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding
Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn

I ain't mean to be late
It was my night to watch my little girl
It's chilly out here
What happened? You crying?
Y'all got into it again huh?
See you gotta let them know from the jump
I don't care who they are, or who they're with
Yeah I know they know we're talking
Shh, why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us
Could love each other
Come on, stop crying now
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you
I heard they're watching you
Yeah, they're watching, they're watching me too
But there ain't no reason to get low
I'm proud, I'm here
You know I'ma stand up for you, no matter what
And I know you'll stand up for me
I don't have no doubts about you being true to me
The world is ours
But right now it feels like the whole world is against us
So study, be strong, don't cry no more

I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggas in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress

I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
My taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her Messiah, I'm God
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath

Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ki Toy Johnson and Kenya Moore in Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words from a pimp was, "Nas, it just don't exist"
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like "I Dream of Jeannie"
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt

I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with

"Picture us married, you and me," what?
"K-I-S-S-I-N-G"
"I remember the first time, girl you and me . . ."

This ain't no sucka-for-love shit
This ain't no Huxtable-kisses-and-hug shit
First night we fuck, shit, and don't call the next day
This a thug's wedding day, in love
Will we make it? Let us pray
In the limo my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard bottles, mob costumes this ain't no act though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenumptial agreement
Cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit
But know this
You fuckin' wit' a slit your throat quick
Vehicular explosion, cigar smokin', dark minded, chart climbin
Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun
Headed to the chapel, my niggas laughin, and its baffling
Cuz just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married
To who I knew not
Thought of snatchin Halle up from the dredlock
Pumpin Sade, my head nod
Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French
Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop
Couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin'
Everybody bump the same bunnies
The game, will put niggas in they grave
Right before they part ways, with the street
I want a son to greet, every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin, tellin me it's time to eat
I'm getting married

I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm
Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suitup kings
Girl, you get the rings young, you behave
Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi
Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out
My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody could touch
I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit
Court cases, baby mamas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin
Heart poundin out my chest like a canon
I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it
But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful
I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true
Will you take music as your wedded wife? I do

You see I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City
Where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir
All the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive (Let's go!)
La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la (Ah!)
La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la (I'm the Magnificent)
La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la
La-la, la-la, Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!

Chuck Berry of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks

Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, "Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild"
I was born in Mississippi

Moved to New York City

I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke
That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men
Serve niggas, bird niggas speakin' reckless
When their momma love the kid's records I made
You gutless, you don't know struggle
Throw a couple shells at you, hell grabs you
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand
I'ma guide you like a O.G. but don't talk, don't get it confused
Cause none of y'all can fit in my shoes
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions
God'll forgive you bastards
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage

I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?
Form a crew, swallow forty cal. bullets after dinner's finished
Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full of scrilla
Can't come close to, Francis Coppola, Samson -- no Delilah
You're pint-sized, I'm Mike's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it
You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like Lawry's
Chicken-heads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes
Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys
Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage

Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?

By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggas pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said "My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum"
They judged us, thinking that we dumb cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggas wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?

Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know

I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason
I see people hating other people

There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
In her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next

Emily harmonizes as Nas talks:
"Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggas with they
Kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there
To all the niggas that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah
Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what
We do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
Shit. Just man... man."4Embed

We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was the wine though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't stop
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we sashayed across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us two

In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall
A super freak as my thoughts revolved
It's like a menage with Nona Gaye and Lalah Hathaway
Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip rosé
On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune every day
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe
No matter what's going on around us
All I could hear was the sound of (her)
Twirlin' her around just (her)
See nobody in the crowd just (her)

Clap! Break it down

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
Look around it might hit you
No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you
Shit comes around faster than you think
Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
Become a creature of habitat, the average cat
Won't see where it's at, or where it's going
The hood waits for no one
I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings
Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
Imagination is what they lack
It stops niggas from getting stacks
Feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks
Wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple

"From the day you were born" (Olu Daru sample)
"Starring out, a young disciple" (Nas Sample)
"You had that gleam in your eye" (Olu Daru sample)
Disciple of the projects!

Moonstruck stuck, slow as molasses in my actions

In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin Tyson
After watchin him cut up Razor Ruddock
In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
Lookin back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggas they can have it
Coke baggin and toe-taggin
They took Will, let me describe him, a live one
I think that he was the true +God's Son+ - not Jesus, but fearless
His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin
Not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you"
He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggas frontin couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple


Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants
It's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhyming to music all this time
Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it
Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezing
Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them
Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies
Babies born in a cycle, future disciples

I think I can remember some...

Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and lift her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Nasty though, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch and screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker

Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
And all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind
But none of them could touch you

Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection

Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when she fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
When weather was colder Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high

Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's a side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
See mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences
No longer are we tempted

Remember the times I hung with the dimes (Yeah)

Acknowledgements: first off I wanna thank God
And I wanna thank everybody for helping me out with this
Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1

January 28, 1968
Born into this world, William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch, Long Island
Scientific rhyming invented a new style when
He met with Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene 1986, with clap to this
'87 dropped a classic disc
The facts is the tracklist was like full
The vocals, the beats, according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative
This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock
Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearing Kurtis Blow saying
"It can't get better than this"
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits
From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan Smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap
18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre
Supreme, Rap and the 50 that don't rap
Fort Greene, Queens, Strong Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn
With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote
"Smack me and I smack you back"
Sounded like the answer to the "I Ain't No Joke" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzing from Wyandanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot
At sixteen when I met Freddie Foxxx
Toting burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How has Rakim's flow made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one
Before similar voices were King Sun
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, son was watching him, mesmerized
Respect, not jocking him, was so amazing, besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

Specially dressed, guess who? -- Nas, it's obvious
Step to bars, we just order dark liquors
Clear liquors, y'all niggas are S-E-X
Yes we get respected, eclectic messages
Left our brains, straight into a female's estrogen
She feels electric, her breasts she's touchin' them
Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction
N-A-S, bend they ass over, spank it
Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas
Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull'
Before I get either I need some Red Bull
She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool
When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool
That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing
Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't fuck with just anything
Gotta come up, run up and get touched up
Suicide, that's if you confront us

See me with the next chick, now you act different
Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her
Play your position, you way outta character

Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse
On the eyes shades in the nighttime regardless

There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feeling alright
I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

Briefcase, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', cocked? No
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creeping in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her
And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire, try and stop me

There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feeling uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo
'Cause she's standing on the corner of Linden Boulevard
Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight

Grabbed her by the pony tail, "never disrespect me"
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the Land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezing the pen, released again, chart toppers
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world
Checking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy
I'm grown up and thankful for lessons God gave me

There's a war in the streets tonight

Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya

Alchemist, you know me, man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes
Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track
You know what I'm sayin'?
Word, but I wanted to bring
A couple of books to the studio today, man
I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man
I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits
Or what's in these shits, man
Probably a bunch of bullshit, man… fuck it, check it

How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man, a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liars all day
Time pass— (Nah, let me start somethin' else)
Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal
‘Cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames
Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game
Your rhymin' is called "Vagina Monologue," it kinda supports
Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed, he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life

And they don't even realize that I notice they stealin' Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap
This can't be my book of rhymes
This can't be my book of rhymes, writin' this bullshit!

Nah, neva that! Fuck that!
Aw, why you laughin', Alchemist?
Hah, you a funny nigga...
Naw, yeah (My book of rhymes)
I'm tellin' you, I'ma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that! I'ma write again now, fuck that!
I musta been high on some shit… what the fuck is this?!

Look how we treat pregnancy, women in the hood
Our values so low, our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we should've heeded
‘Cause now we need it, we older, almost able t—
I'm jealous of you, how come you so beautiful?
Smellin' fresh, youthful, intelligent, while I'm stressin' and shit
Ayo, I envy you ‘cause all you do is smile
And things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset ‘cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star, not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute, we both need your mother's attention
I must be crazy, jealous of my own baby infant (Kinda crazy)15Embed
The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in Set It Off
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', "Hi Nas"
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, "Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room"
Nine push-ups, strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Patron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Filas
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tels
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know, when will they learn
Nas need a queen not a ho to
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife, play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue, a woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ak
'Cause you point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be cruisin'
But let's take, it, slow

Slow is the way, holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray when I run that you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world exist, except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billie Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy
Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be cruisin'
But let's take, it, slow

Velvet bow ties
Bulletproof's in the tux, when I roll by
In a car similar to Osama's, in my diamonds
And my principal is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan
A couple of, years ago when guns started clappin'
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggas ran
They was amateurs in beef with a grown man
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in a coffin
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man
Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose, man
Make your enemies believe there's love there
'Cause in war, belief is all fair
Rock them to sleep, shots in your Jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was from me

Toast to my hero Nat Turner
Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her earlobe, "drive home"
'Cause she the wife and they the freaks
The underneath my girl caliber
They smiled at her and said "Goodbye"
With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Denali truck
Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs
That I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link
I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew, I switched that

Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it
Niggas who brilliant, came in and killed it
Made millions every three months, new jury

Would come and try to kill you too

Yo, my man was regulatin' on niggas he used to thug with
Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin'
Drivin' they cars, robbin connects
Drivin' his Lex, keys was movin'
Young don, now they know they weakness
They never seen it comin'
Son was on some real take over the streets shit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin' now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?

Dudes be, comin' from bids thinkin shit is different
'Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin' my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin' real loves stories like
Caesar and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
'Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin' to later hours, only
Fuckin' with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you

Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here

Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but masterfully notice the weakness
In all them, gotta shoot only if necessary
Homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
When Aryan nations ain't having integration
We so blind, the beauty of life
Was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right
"Jesus", what is he like?
I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool
The chronic's a fool, got me thinking out loud, fuck it

And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and AR-15s on the sofa

My motions don't appeal to appellate divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler
Black gorilla, Crip and Blood in one nigga
Only killers know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake

So what we fight for, my heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war

Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient
Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
You ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in

Uh, if I can teach somethin' so be it
And hope somebody learn somethin' from it
And give it back

They can't break me or shake me
They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith is with Satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto medleys, so now they wanna dead me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it
I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
Y'all bunch of backward gangsters
Y'all signin affidavits
Snitches with smiling faces, got you blowin trial, I hate this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind of weird and it's scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I see clear to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive, how did I make it this far?
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go

Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to body somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me

To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold

Sometimes I wish I was dead

And you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit, it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him, but he's blinded I see
Jealousy, he love me to death — am I'm buggin'?
I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mothers' life

.40 cals plus the Heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast
Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low

Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil
Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin', ho get on

Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts

Nigga never gon' grow up
Drinkin' the Henny
But he know he gon' throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? Future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane

Spendin' chips on big chains

Make it bi-coastal

Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition

Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop

Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not forever
At least to 140

I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey
A mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out

I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things
Kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks
Missionaries pass out papers that read "Love God"
I see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thug's face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro
Sixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where it sets at
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his asthma's flarin'
Smokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin'
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
I give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion

Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years
I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion18Embed

Pull out, brrrrrrrt, forehead yawning
Sloppy, droppin' you birds
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit, back in ya head, vomit
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals tryin' to wild nowadays I sold crack bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
Fuckin 'em hoes, boilin' coke since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray MAC-10 and a pocket full o' dimes

To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts

Well picture us Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga itchin' to bust
You got a house in Virginia, the only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck
No need for the gun play, it's okay, 'cause you dyin' anyway
Yo, this is for them high school drop outs
Niggas in crow, who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' and you ain't turnin' back
Bravehearts gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have the bike on a bitch
Now I got the Jeep on the strip
Coke in the pot, heat on my hip

Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin'
Shoot 'til the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners
And that's Queensbridge nigga, all day
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze
Runnin' from D's quick to knockout rookies
G Wiz you know what I'm bout
To all my real niggas

Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out

Uh
Crazy (crazy), ah (ah)
Yo pussy kill me...
Huh (huh).. yeah (yeah) yeah..
Huh, huh, huh, huh..

Pussy killed me when I was born (What?)
Pardon me, I'll rephrase it: departed mommy's womb decaying
I look at the bright side
The fact that I got a life side
Born '73 - September right Nas? (True)
Virgo child, the first thing I learn is money makes the world go round
On this small planet, it's ten women to one man; I wonder how we manage
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures (word)
Bitches even nastier, they throw it at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up
Freaky hoes lick a nigga's ass and nuts
Stupid bitch bragging 'til her baby dad went nuts (stupid bitch)
Now he looking for me, two cars deep
Rolling up on nigga's, barrel out the window, asking, "You Nas peeps?"
I can't have that, two four five, nigga grab that
Pass it to me, sucker-for-love niggas I blast at
I swear my dick is gonna get me in trouble
I pissing bubbles
I thought I felt a sharp pain, better stick to rubbers
When laying hooker after hooker, day out and day in
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name 'em
Just a thought: we all fuck the same chicks
Some play like they innocent, fucking entertainers
And basketball players, the bitch is a ho
But still some of y'all a save her, put your dick in her throat
You just the nigga that done wifed her (huh?)
She drove you crazy, now your monkey ass wanna shoot the pimp that pipes her
She had your baby, (damn) now you a life-er
And suicide notes you write her, pussy kills

My nigga James got married, same girl he went to school with
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was too stuck
Studied for her Masters, part time nurse
I'll tell you how superb the ass is, but who's looking
I mean that's my man, maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, sike
'Cause James and me like I was with AZ like
Luke and Han Solo
Fucking with niggas' girls' forbidden, that's a no-no
It's death and we real niggas, civilized Gods
And their ain't too many niggas like Nas, I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheating
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life, even
Happy for James 'cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one, I told him he's lucky, we clown some
Rolling up dutchies while watching Roy Jones in round one, he froze
Put his face to the TV, 'bout an inch close
Move out the way nigga, fuck's the matter with you, you blind?
He pointed to the front row, thought he was loosing his mind
She 'posed to be with her sick mother, left for the weekend
Was stressed when she was leaving
Now she's next to some nigga, cheesing
He's having trouble breathing (gasping for air, coughing)
He pictured 'em making noises, grinding him and kissing him
Yelling, "Ain't no telling where her lips have been!"
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser than
Ten minutes later, then they start wrestling and screaming
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at that fight, you speeding
That's Vegas, this is New York, you bugging
I held up my hand for a dap but he wouldn't touch it
I'm like, "When you started acting like that? This is dumbness."
Gave me a crazy look and started swinging punches
I ducked, couldn't believe it, the nigga so whipped
He got his gat and started squeezing, hit two policemen
Neighbors dialed 911, they heard the thumping
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumping
Me and his wife dip to the floor she smiled strange
My comrade was breathing no more, they killed James
Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch'll have a nigga's gun smoking
Huh, pussy kills
Oh what a thrill

Salivating at the mouth, South to East Orange
Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it
You'll be giving up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it
For legal fees in the penal dorm
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout 30 years on your conscience
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'
Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence

Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in
Waves spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition agin'

Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret
Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15
Then one-time intervene (I gotta hold...)
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die
But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die

Never worry (ohhh, no, no, no)

Check, let there be light
No gang bangin' in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger than life
Turn up the kid mic ‘cause ya'll ain't listenin' right
What's all this talk that Nas got bought?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been, they at a stand still
This is all overseen by my man Will

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate

They don't want the same sentence, niggas get to snitchin
If I could reverse demises and turn falls to rises
And bring back the niggas who was livest
Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us
Till we found our own way through the maze
New York, set trippin' and flaggin'
Got the West Coast laughin'
Now Esco's askin', "What happened?"
My homegirl from upper Manhattan; she remembers the quarters that's Latin, a lot of rat-a-tat-tattin'

We can have a conversation
Eight years in the game, I invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame
Only then I let you pick my brain, niggas

Why are we even out here?
Why are we out here? What's going on?
This is retarded, yo, we gotta…
This is crazy. Never again
You'd throw everything away, for what?

Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me, "Son, do not look back"
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax
When people act, school em' with facts, tell 'em
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'
Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
And twist, homie's hermano just died, I gotta let it ride
That's what I got the public thinkin', my nigga
Just ‘cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit, my nigga
I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used
How much money the shooter got
‘Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time
Is all we talk when we talk in New York, y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe, son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up
What cars and what trucks they drive in
What towns they spend the most time in when they grindin'

First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things, you still ain't really doing shit, kid
‘Cause in reality, I'll earn my salary
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling
It's a race thing how they sell blacks the bootleg shit
In fact, real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
Whores charge niggas with raping
‘Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks, smokin' cigars
So they counter the laws to take what's ours
'Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars
Instead of going back, I'm buying the projects

The other night, nigga was at Lotus...
I hit P and them
I was Dom P'ed up in there, you know...
But I found this new spot we went to the other night, yo
Check it out, check it out how it went

It was just cool like, smooth night with my jewels bright
Goons left, goons right, coupe with blue lights
Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls
Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off
In the loft, mixing hash and dro
Honey spreaded that asshole like a wide mouth bass
Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast
When the phone ring, the house lights flash
Turned down the sound, let's get down to business
Shit about to go down with some foul niggas
What the voice said, "What up, pop? Who want it?"
I put the guap up, get the boy popped
He say "Son, stop, it's dudes you feedin'
Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'"
Dog, why you callin' me? This our food
You handle the mouths that it trickles down to
Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too
But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich
Don't bother me with silly shit, call Rico
He said "It IS Rico, of all people
Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor
To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather"
Said the nigga shot up my cars
Last night he laid for me to come out my doors?

I never thought bein' a man you could hang in the end
Facin' life with no parol and consecut' sentencin'
Got people witnessin', your co-defendent snitchin'
Your back against the wall, your left eye is twitchin'
Loyal ladies usual, a D-and A's the mutual
Scared to face the light of a courtroom site
Racist cops on each side cause the know I just might
Make a break for the door but I give it my all
If I die in this struggle, give my momma a call
Cause she always left these jewels: what goes up must fall
Since I fell dead broke, landed in jail
Refused to face the facts, how wifey skipped to town with the bail
I'm on my own now, V8, far away from home now
Palmer wealth state, the law changes each date
Secret inditements got me knocked, there ain't no price I can pay
To get me the fuck up out this shit, so to Allah I pray
For forgiveness - Yes, I sinned and I need to be held
And jail ain't no place a black man wanna be killed

Felt the stray hit me, somebody stay with me
Fallin' to the ground with the sound of a four-pound near me
Bitches screamin', wish I was dreamin'
I fought a thousand gun fights, near one bullet skipped me
On the morning run to get my little sisters Rice Krispies
Played the numbers knowin' that I got my lucky dice wit' me
See some niggas I know I can roll - Uh, uh!
Get them bitches, left all of them broke, left what they smoke
Hoes yellin', 'Watch ya back!'
But before I could turn around, before I could I react
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Would you look at me now?
Is this blood that I feel as I fell to the ground?
Feel like a head shot but maybe just grazed my temple
Niggas diggin' in my pockets, sayin' I just rolled a pimple

But shit is gettin' too wild, this lifestyle of sprayin' weapons
So I check out the preacher - Life is off the meter
Thoughts of homicide, tryin' to dodge the reaper
Confessions in a church cause it hurts, behind a curtain
Nigga talkin' to me, but I ain't certain
Voice sound familiar so I pulled the shade back
It was this stupid nigga that I popped way back
He set me up, he just got to the preist
I tried to reach but he had his heat pointed my way
And said, 'Pray'
"You've got to pray, huh! I mean pray, pray
And when you pray, you got to look up to the lord, huh!
You got to look up and you got to pray for your children, huh!
You got to pray for that man in front of the liquor store, huh!
You got to pray for that man on the corner! He know he doin' wrong
But somebody gotta pray for him, huh! You know we doin' wrong
But we gotta pray for ourselves! You know we are headin'
To this new millennium, goddamnit! They say a comet is comin'
To this world by the year two-thousand, I say it's God! It's up to you
To pray to that higher power higher than yourself and humble yourself
And, and, and beg for forgiveness cause it comes back to you!
A man told me that while he was in jail, all he did was pray
All he did was stay in his jail cell and pray to God..."Embed
Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick'll make Bobby divorce Whitney

Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in Pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at the Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossin' with Stoute, he had the 'gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to hit the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washin' her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hittin' it raw, tastin' it, wildin' out of my character
Tapin' it, Tyra Banks face and Faith's lips
Givin' head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me 'bout her husband's affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the lye to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sportif
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rappin'
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adaptin'
P-11's, ACP shells for blastin'
Caught him with his Spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burnin' her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out existence
His maid cried "No", she lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought "What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision"
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet a-gain...

Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screamin', yo we almost crashed
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death9Embed
Uhh, uhh, where am I going
Where am I?
Yo, it's ill

Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
MAC in my right arm
Tequila bottle in my left arm, like Christión
Watching my life go
Can't do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, Hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin'
I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed
I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight
My foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella women
Jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blasting A/C going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good
Find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to

Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight
Livin' my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on?
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Boppin' to The Supremes, smokin' joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want

(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) from break dancin', backspins on the cardboard
(I did it my way) to bulletproof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
(I did it my way) never gave a fuck what nobody said
(I did it my way) they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
(I did it my way) if I fuck up, it falls on me
(I did it my way) I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat

Though I still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get what I got
They think it's a lot; in the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, comin' if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder 'til I seen my man get popped
No blood soakin', layin' there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was lookin' right through me, yo, starin' beyond
I wonder what he saw: the limos, movies and tours?
Did he die in vain or represent for the cause?
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game; y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (Ill Will)

(I did it my way) from the crumbs, roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps
(I did it my way) I call it how I see it, niggas
(I did it my way) if you don't like it, so be it, niggas
(I did it my way) I make my own rules, do my own plans
(I did it my way) gangstas do what they want, suckers do what they can
(I did it my way) takin' sacrifices, kid
(I did it my way) you only gettin' one life to live
Yo, hoes in my focus slow me; roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scoldin' my foes who phony
From blocks where coke'll feed you, and cops is over-evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel
Her-on and blow, it ruins minds, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappeared
Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminisce and remember
Sittin' on wood benches gave me splinters
Just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, movin'
I thank the ones who said
"Shorty, go home, we about to be shootin'"

(I did it my way) from crumbs and roaches and rats
(I did it my way) convertin' from hustlin' to raps

Nastradamus, skama lit, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, I got the chips to make a Lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now it's loads of baguettes
Prefer a MAC-10 over a TEC
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldier cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase "Nigga, light that"
Hoes you fuck ask you, "Where your ice at, dunn?"
It's all about Playboys when we was young
Could only get tongue, then finally we can cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake Pepsi's, to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme "Don it"
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If it's ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Compulsive, with malice incentives, the foulest of bitches
Hunger my riches, her childish wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip and you fold
So when your click roll, I let my clips go
Niggas on opposite poles
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhumane, living hostile opposed
To living on the street, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, finicky foul niggas
See niggas and blacks, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you in jail, chrome objects
Hit you in your own projects, it's street-onomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger paining
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting, marinating
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment
Now back in the hood, certain cats, they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

To my nigga
Brought me in this world
Ha, that's right, nigga

My ol' dad important to the family structure, provider, a God
My moms a queen, that universal team civilized us
My pops maybe was late, but always came home
My moms would put us to bed, and she would wait on
Soon as he walked in the door, she barking
I turned down the Johnny Carson
Jumped out the bed, we grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother, not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting, yelling at each other
My poppa played the street all day
Mama was either home or at work
While we playing inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone
Peeping out the window, heated
But still, I didn't see it, mama hid it from us
We was kids, younger, 'til we got bigger, on to
Bigger things, that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving his crib and my mom's love

Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"

So many kids I knew, never knew who Pop was
That's why I show my pop love
'Cause he was still around when I popped up
He could have left my moms pregnant, shook to death, but stayed
Watched me crawl 'til I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fistfight, right behind me, he would stand
No matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in ya eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing, so then I asked him
"What's this white shit on that plate and your face?
And, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist
And, who's this lady I'm facing?
Dark skin, you not my mommy!"
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promised me things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth closed and don't tell Mommey
He said one day I'll understand—
"Little me, what's in you is inside me"
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"
Poppa was a playa, playa was in poppa
Poppa loved the ladies, never got enough of
The pretty brown round, running round town (Ugh, my nigga)
"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down"

Pops told me hold my own, Pops told me value home
Could I help it, "Papa Was a Rolling Stone"?
Who loved the pretty brown round, out-of-town-bound
Trumpet in his jazz band, he touring
At home, I played his latest recordings
And it's strange how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now
Inherited his brainpower, to pull strings and gain power
Our weed habits the same now
No white lines, or trumpets, just tight rhymes
And beats that's bumpin, 'fore he left, he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now, see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life, next day, they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together, then someone will get killed
I love you still, always will, 'cause that's my nigga
Although you felt you was wrong, I still feel you, kid
Life goes on...9Embed

Uh, 2000 G

Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball 'till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
'Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scaring 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse
While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is doo-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street 'til I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearing a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah

Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit

And as a special treat this evening
I have asked America's foremost young poet
To read his latest poem for us

"Ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"Ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"We-we-we came a long way"
"Ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"Ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"*

Yo..
Yo.. yo..
Power and crime, the thugs slinging powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggas wilder than mine?
My niggas bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's "Godfather" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up, the cars are sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge King
Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way
Niggas with names, living off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothing changing

If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war, we can take it there

You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shining - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggas know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggas to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
(what nigga) and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war, we can take it there

You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dying
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flying high in the aircraft, wining and dining
You die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
The rich ass, they gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm getting head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
We Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war, we can take it there

You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the lord
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now
You might also like
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba

Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say "Oh God"
Every ho that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
'Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl, see the world is yours
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around

Happy new year!
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world
It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world

Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin' gold
Solar-energized rides, no steerin' wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin' together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later

40th side, 41st side ride

Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at

Ayo, I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate, they read your obituary in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, "Freeze black kids!"
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it (uh), put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?

Yo..

Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid
Rap niggas shit they drawers

Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest, we hit you
Dunn you fam to me, and only family

Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water
My skin layered in diamonds and sage
Left alone in confused forest's, enslaved by days
Time keeps on whorin us
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
Flowers and flames flew from her fingers
Rifles pointed from her sac
Or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
Either way, she wore a compass on her head
Rains don't stop the grass from turnin red
Her hair was half permed, half dread
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we danced
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
Time travelling was late
Watching was a blind man's mistake
All his assets melted right in front of his face
His right leg drabbed with demon pace
Shoes stayed angel laced
Never count your blessings with haste
Even a prophet can catch a case
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste
Telepathically cutting through mental gates
Words were weapons against their hate
Shepherds search for stars in her hair
Her chest grew fermented like yeast
She broke her body like aged bread
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read
She wrote her poems inside the mud
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
Named their poison, spit truth inside his mouth
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
Resurrected from bones and dirt
She made hard niggas smile
Left her seeds inside the Earth
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first
Find a reason why you curse
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
Sporting electronic nooses
Hoeing humanity love takes over lust
Despite the damage to Destiny
You can't take the best of me, In God We Still TrustYou might also like3Embed

Those who know don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is 'cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga

Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today
So long my crimes now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me

Welcome to our time

Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles
Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write
Despite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right
Winged assassins laughin while the New World's collapsing
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armed with cowries, I'm blasting
As the Earth rebels my womb swells
The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit
You can't find if you ain't never had it
Spiritually crafted black-listed hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
Power-shifting comb-fisting I predict Goddesses you running after witches
I kiss my fourteen stitches
Keep all my baby girl wishes
I predict all the oceans turn dry
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers
Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon yemanja
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills
Ban all pink and yellow pills
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch
Hate groups will be bombed
Childbirth becomes outlawed
Always will be branded numbered and logged
All paper money is gone
Confused scholars can't interpret our scrolls
Your sky has holes

Spittin' image of a gangsta, the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin' the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you

Now once again this is you, entertainin' your desires
Bitches, money and guns, aimin' and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin' your seed
Tryin' to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit
An out of body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin' real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed

Black hoods, cops and projects, sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Chains in top locks get ripped off hinges
Doors kicked off, drunks stag off Smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare, vision blurry
'Cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that '70s era
He's finished for the rest of his life, 'til he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood, but no signs say out
Mental slave house where gats go off, I show off
Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, 'til they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on

Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

Yo, if this piano's the cake, then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
They lit it up {*puff puff*}, hit it up {*puff*}, now they dismantled
Think the whole world is crazy, got a nine, watch where you walk Two dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hire Satan, United Nations quietly taken, toll on your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, 'cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gash left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
Perishin', brain dead from a Ericsson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons

She said, "go and see the world for myself, and my brother should follow"
Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the blues, guitar strings he played smokin' his Kool
Duke Ellington hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' 'cause somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this room, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, was speedin' like amphetamine
Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustla's and hoes, drugs and fo'-fo's
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows
Oh, outta my window
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

Starin' out of, out my window
Oh I, feel so tired
Oh yeah, outta my window
Oh, lookin' out, lookin' out of
Lookin' out my window, oh yeah
Makes me, feel so tired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired4Embed

Where my real niggas at
There's a lot of real niggas out there
There's a lot of real niggas everywhere
That's why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin'
Not botherin' nobody, until one muthafucka fuck with 'em
And then all hell break loose

Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

Well known gangstas, entrust, that we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us, let's see
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motherfucker beggin' for more
It's Thorazine
Standin' here shakin', hatin' the haters, they watchin' my paper
Realize, a 4-5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop?
Nigga standin' there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show y'all muthafuckas respect
Plans connect
The twinklin' diamonds upon my neck
More Jazz than Hornacek
I blast, leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spittin' like the Trench Coat Mafia
In a schoolyard, we make it hard
What's poppin' y'all?
We made our change; what's stoppin' y'all?
They spray y'all names Rest in Peace on the project wall

I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause
Sling them things 'til the very end, you better get yours
Time is runnin' out
Your streets is gettin' smaller as we speak
Giuliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit out of David Dinkins
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin', not killin' everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is death, umpires keep ice grills
There's no tomorrow, it's the bottom of the 9-9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My heart's full of braveness, so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen, startin' chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin'
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'

Yo, we here to eat food, my peoples be lethal
Shots in your body make you see-through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life bid, never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest gettin' bigger
Celebs on the V.I., respect that nigga
Reggy on the regular, chops it up, like a editor
Come through one man gang like The Predator
If your wake, I'll wet it up, Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin' at you
Air out your area, Queensbridge forever, what
Ill Will the label
Bravehearts, y'all scared of us

Yo, when those niggas ran, these niggas stayed
When those niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick 'cause we paid
Don't even rep QB, you ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin' and it's goodnight
Know how much force this is
Jungle, Horse, and Wiz
Nothin' but horses, kid
We go to war for this

To my niggas.. huh..
We all we got..
Let's hold it down though, y'know?
However it's gon' go down
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?
Yo..

It's the life we chose (uhh), where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know (uhh)
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
(But yo..) this life is the only life I know...

Uhh, uhh, uhh
Gold bathtubs, making love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rolling up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and sub-machines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Chow both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dying
'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealing with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone saying, "Please daddy pay it"
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, coming out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck

Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rolling with you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho
And you don't even let him know, 'cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret being grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs 'til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop ticking, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You getting older player, look at those who gave up
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it

Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holla
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs in renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies looking proper

Fuck this shit, but you know...? Through the year I started to see shit, you knowamsayin?
Nigga see niggas driving around with fancy cars, diamonds, all that shit
Niggas thinking a nigga chilling
Got to go through a whole bunch of big shit, all that bullshit
But you know what? Fuck that shit, you know how I feel? Yo

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that

Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up

I got the mansion and the nice ride
Platinum chain, and an ice watch
All this fame in my life's hard
I entertain in so many places
See so many different faces
They look the same from the stages
After the concert, hours of long work
Home sick from the road, smoking my lungs hurt
Even though now I'm recording songs
It's better than, when I was peddling, doing wrong
I brought the crew along, we thugging
Fucking married bitches; they go to their husbands
Bitches ain't shit, we laughing with them
Can't even role the streets now, without the heat
I bust the nigga off impost, that shit is weak
On trial, what I'ma tell the judge
He don't give me no smile, he don't give me no love, nor the jury
That's when I need celeb status and the blackness
This motherfucker's hate rappers, what a life

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up

See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
My girl hate when I'm with my boys
Think I'm cheating, every morning knocking at my door
State policeman, give him a reason, but I don't give it to him
They said they heard a disturbance, and I just listen to him
See, I cooperate until they push me
Cops hate when you know the law, you ain't pussy
You not fake, can't explain how much I miss the block
When we was slinging with my niggas, screaming "Fuck the cops!"
Now when I'm dreaming I can see my dead friends smile
Wake up, I get some air, hit the mall for a while - pick up some gear
I'm going to the studio; my engineer put the track up from "out west"
And he told me spit it clear
Another hit just made, another album
So ones again we getting paid, and now we wilding
Get hype to shoot the video, all in the city yo
I'm hoping that a nigga blow, but ya don't hear me though

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
The haters say I ain't shit
Hope I fall, but I can't slip
Got to ball, got to bank chips
Old ladies hate my moms cause their kids ain't amount to nothing
Catch my moms on the bench fronting
I got to stay awake, got to pray today
Glad I'm still alive, fuck what them haters say
So many times I ain't wanna rhyme
Wanted a normal life where I ain't Nas all the time
So many problems too, do what I got to do
As long as my moms say, "Boy, I'm proud of you"
I keep laying hits, winners never quits
Plus if I stop, how would I stay legit?

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby

Ayo, it's packed on this Rikers bus
The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer
Mother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends in the street, smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a '72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably three
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor who left stocks for me?
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry

It is I that step up, me that don't give a fuck
You that foe, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Ranges through the desert, fuck a twenty-inch
Long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter, I gotta get back
For what they owe, shoot 'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hogtie, gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see for miles, the land, it's major rubble
And debris from the Earth as we knew crumble
Yo, you could see the sea and the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie, Mad Max
SKs, AKs max
ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back, but, yo
My country shitted on me (My country)

Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war, and, yo, I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns, clean fun
Shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan, every color of man inherits the shit
Yo, I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe, but, yo, I swear
It's a billion dollar business, courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in the system, I'm 'bout to rebel

There's not a bitch in sight or a block bench
All-black gate, all-gray fence
Look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried eight of mine
At night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine, I ain't goin' out here
We gotta win, every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake
Every day I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say
My country shitted on me (My country)
She wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)
'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)

You think anybody'll read it?
No fuckin' doubt
Let's make history, homie
Aight then
You know we brought the hoes, clothes and money rolls to the table
No fuckin' doubt
It's time to manifest this
We the flyest nigga
Bring it to a whole, you know?
Gangsta nigga

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like you don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome
We the flyest gangsters

Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the playa haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize, bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play with me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggas 'cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like you don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow

Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome (Ha)
We the flyest gangsters
I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin'
Live how I live, it's only 'cause I been through it
Learn to try it, like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin' to it
Burn it, light it, weed it and off the liquor
While drivin' outside I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sights, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
'Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the Lord
Wonderin' does Faith think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin'
We ain't these little niggas no more, runnin' dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be havin' they legs shakin', stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules Hercules when havin' relations, the flyest

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like you don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow (Uh)
Countin' out stacks and mackin' out hoes (Hoes)
Pushin' big dicks and packin' our chrome (Ha)
We the flyest gangsters
We put this on the soul of our born, as we hold the Qur'an
Kamikaze style, older cats coaching us on
Yo, it's kill or be killed
Understand, real'll be real
A forty-shot spectrum make your whole embassy kneel
Identity sealed, protected by our energy shield
And fuck a drop 'cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
Close the book
Was taught never expose a crook
Between the knight and the bishop
One'll knock ya rook
I'm a rare breed, never had a fear to lead
I ain't like niggas with sight, too impaired to read
We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas, who's a target?
Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin', so act like you don't know (Act like you don't know)
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough

We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas, come on (Uh-huh)

Zoom, from outer space he comes
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin' they gums, do he be clappin' and shootin' guys?
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized?
What is his race, nation, or creed?
Is he Arabic, Black, Latin, Asian? They read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy
September '73, up in these wild streets
Fuckin' these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (Goddamn)

Only way you die if it's meant to be
You fuckin' with a general
No discussion is the principle, we bust and it's the end of you
Now we knockin' on your mama door
Like we came to fix the sink, my kind of war
Death angels coming for you
Spirit horse runnin' from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2
Paramedics fightin' for you, who's gon' win?
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine?
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake
Walk by your casket, spit in your face
Enter the fog, dawg, the light is your guide
And when you're gone all your niggas gon' light it with Nas

Pardon but I gotta question of life now
Look at the nigga next to you right now
Is he real, fake or scared?
Do it like this, niggas, right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now let's say it all together, let the ceremony start
"I shall stay real, stay true, stay holdin' figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never cooperate with the law
Never snake me, I'll always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death, I swear"
I swear that's how we pledge allegiance to the alliance
Of underworlds, killers and thugs, though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green (Uh-huh)
And pass it around, just pass it around

Uh, you know
I still run with that, that blood of a slave, boilin' in my veins
It's just hot, until a nigga can't take it no more
Blood of a slave, heart of a King, turn my voice up

Ayo, the brother's Stillmatic
I crawled up out of that grave, wipin' the dirt, cleanin' my shirt
They thought I'd make another Illmatic
But it's always forward I'm movin'
Never backwards, stupid, here's another classic
C-notes is fallin' from the sky, by now the credits roll
They're starrin' Nas, executive poet, produced, directed by
The Kid slash Escobar, narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to survive
The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin' the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin', soft in the background
Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door, all of us poor
I learned the difference 'tween the snitches
The real ones, and who's soft, and the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumpin' from roofs
Shotguns pumpin', made it through my youth
Walkin' very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walkin' through the hot desert searchin' to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning, nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in The Matrix
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan, it's the rap–repo man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real
Professional stick-up kids dreamin' for mils
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From Crips to Pirus, this is survival

'Til I dodge enough shots and the presiding judge slams a mallet
And says life I'ma guap, then I cop
Then I yacht, then I dock
Island hopping away from nightmare holders
Or cowboy slingers, who shoot up any club
To see they names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on X or they coked up

Pierre Hardy, imitation of Christ
Ice-wear gaudy, since '94 flossy
The Lex was an excellent choice now fast forward me
The pestilence of the ghetto informed me
As a shorty, to push nothing less than a 740
With fresh linen, sip Pellegrinos with Airs on
They sick, mixing they water with Airborne
Oh, they so sick!

The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you looking for? You the question and the answer

We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, cooling off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level
It's not unusual
To see photos of dead homies funerals
Aluminum foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigga's paid, ancestry of slaves
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, wear Timbs on every scene

Do I mean it like a slave master, nigga?
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes
Take off the bracelets
Savage when broke, smoke sour diesel, need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Thought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a gross sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peeping us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreaming of
Between cutting hard coke with new razors slicing my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringing us cake be the snakes like the

My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain't just rapping for fame
I got my old homie's half-sister father asking for chains
Yep, I give the cash up, this paper don't matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They calling it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You'll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let's keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king

The white power structure of today is just as much interested in perpetuating slavery
As the white power structure was 100 years ago
Only now they use modern methods of doing so
And, uh…

White folks made up nigga and don't want me to say it
Ain't that a bitch?
You made it up, you shouldn't have made it up!
You done fucked up, you shouldn't have made up nigga
And you made up a song to go with it
Please don't make me sing the song
Eenie meenie minie
You know the god damn song I'm talking about
And you change the words when you see black folks

This is my opening scripture - I've been preparing this album
My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satan's bombarding me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not Bathing Apes
But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty
This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defending Vick, and free that nigga T.I.P
I'd take the grave or a bid
Then let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's going to church
Plants packs on the man that's going to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruiting all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar a racist

The good man in me say, "Get money and stay on the path"
But the pimp shit in me say, "Yo, keep looking for ass"
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait 'til you grown, when he love you, you'll know
Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two
Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick
Revenge to get, against - who I don't know
Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake
They mistake blaming me for they failures, I'm fresh, getting tailored
Single breasted, a lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit
A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, 'cause he still with her
She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga...

Maybe a tid-bit similar to when we rappers make big hits
And not own the masters, that's the deal
By the way, Poitier helps all the Denzels excel
He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out
I knew a girl 'bout, 5'9", so fine, she could for sure grind
She was sleek, chic, with a classic mouth
Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch
She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler
She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road
I showed her all my stones and gold

It is absolutely silly, and unproductive
To have a funeral for the word "nigga"
When the actions continue
We need to have a movement to resurrect brothers and sisters
Not a funeral for niggers
'Cause niggers – don't die

Uh, yeah
Yo, I'm creepy and crawlin', in your sink and your toilet
I be drinkin' from your spit, anything 'cause I'm more or less
An insect with four legs; people come in, I fake dead
Correction: I got eight legs, climbin' on top yo' plate, bed
Wherever I smell food, it could be even jail food
Stale food that's molded, a roach is what I am, fool
The ghetto is my land, fool, I'ma never be able to
Fly like a bumblebee, try not to be underneath
Your sneaker, pitiful creature, I'm not afraid of
Your pesticide or RAID 'cause in heaven's my Creator
I love it when the light's off, eating from same knives, forks
From, any man's dinner, see my antennas
You can't win, you can't stand the crunchy sound I make

Son, these niggas look faker than the new hundred dollars, son

It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

The Buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik
Jam like a Tec with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen

Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks
MC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep I never fail
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell

The type of lyrical terrorism I present164Embed
INVASION!


Now all you hypocrites, witness the injustice
Conversations taped illegally, then they cuff us
U.S. attorneys, public defenders send us off to hard prison time
Whether you innocent or did the crime
Say you come from Hooters, cops pursue you hard
Run your place, put guns in your face
Put you in the car for nothing (Green Lantern!)
Now you struggling, tied up, standing in line-ups
Call your lawyer, they charge you for murder
Why? ‘Cause these liars
Say you shot another man in his driveway
Guilty, just for being Black on a Friday
Polygraph test, you’re failing, because you’re nervous
Charged with murder you didn’t commit, then they serve ya
Fifteen years, maximum security
Slashing, stab wounds, broken bone, injuries
You were placed there intentionally
Either you bang or you miss me
Listen to me, this is true!

Mets hat rocker, pretty bitch slobber
Ex-robber, heister, my own life biographer
Pants saggin', Bentley whippin', Summer Jam stopper
Ten truck, pineapple vodka, then I spray choppers
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me
 then paged me, boy  suits with Adam Stacy
Cigar like Dick Tracy, it's dark I get spacey
Alcohol and laced weed, that was part of my '80s
Them Cartier consigliere's,  me
Canary  in my pink 
Liz Taylor tried to  me
'cause I keep it green like the other side of Bill Bixby (Don't stop)
When he gets mean, think fast 'fore I blast hoes like Grassy Knoll

Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse

Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Simone
Screamin, she fiendin' for the semen
Me bein' the man that I am
Took it to her condo pronto
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the chron' chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow
Satisfyin' all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? What?
You nasty boy, you nasty

Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently
She like the way the dough fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal 'til she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's DeGenero
Dripped out, Iceberg apparel

Uhh, schhh, Lord, Lord, Jah
Hahaha, shit is all true

Mmm, fried chicken, fly vixen
Give me heart disease but need you in my kitchen
You a bird but you ain't a ki'
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats, all the way from Kentucky to fuck with me
Look what you done to me, was number one to me
After you shower, you and your gold medal flour
Then you rub your hot oil for 'bout a half an hour
You in your hot tub, I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down 'cause you're red hot
Louisiana style, you make my head rot
Then I flock to the bed, then plop, when we done, I need rest
Don't know what part of you I love best
Your legs or your breast
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you gon' be a nigga death
Created by southern black women to serve massa' guest
You gon' be a nigga death
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you was my addiction
Dripping with high cholest'
Like Greeks with his falafel, Italian with his tomato pasta
What roti is to a rasta
Trapping me, you and your friend mac' and cheese
Candy yams, collard greens but you knocking me to my knees
It's killing me when I'm inside, nothing I need more than a fish fry

Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing how you sparkle when I glaze you, swine
Hey, my pretty ham hock
It's so feminine the way you submitted and how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower you with lemon water
Marinate you with seasoning, dipping you in chowder
Baby, it's like you at the spa the way you gently lay in the pan
While enjoying your butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle, bubbling on your skin
Despite the funny fragrance, still I lick my finger frequent
In any event, I'm reflecting on all the signs
That I got saying that I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you that you would taste made you hard to resist
When I put my mouth on you, but that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach when I laid eyes on you
Or was it infection manifesting?
Confused over the feeling, impatiently eating you
Trichina worm chewing on the wall of my intestine
I'm a eat you 'til there's nothing left
Until my very last breath, you gon' be a nigga death
Despite I prepare it the best
And specialize in cooking swine as a chef, you gon' be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine's mixed with rat, cat and dog combined?
Yes, I'ma eat the shit to death
Ain't that some shit?
I'ma eat some shit until what I'm eating kills me
And I choose to do that, why?

If Heaven was a mile away

Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a (Flash?)

It ain't you, it's the things you do (Do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you
If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens
Would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder, finally believe in His power?
Even if you couldn't see Him, but you could feel
Would you still doubt Him?
How would you start actin'?
Would you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now?
Would a fiend even want to get high? Would he stop smokin'
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in?
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist
It's hard takin' this, racist planet
Where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff
Even if he innocent, "Nigga, get on the car!
Put your motherfuckin' hands up!"
Thinkin' I'ma lose it, my mom's in chemo
Three times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard
And God, your young soldier's not sober but needs you

Game time took 'em cats, never looked back
Cristal, blowin' dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys
Is nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks
Free of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me
It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on altar boys
Sodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord
How could they do the Devil's work?
A man give another man head in Church

Yeah, we all in the grind
But look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life

I'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothin' to do with money
Got nothin' to do with nothin' material
I'm talkin' about Heaven in your own heart
In your own world, baby, in your own existence

Task force homicide, federalies gon' harass

Was slipping in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice
Symbolize the rap life, it was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doing the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowing, didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she want shellfish
Red Lobster was popping, standing on that line forever
I wish somebody would step on my Bally leathers
Now it's whatever
Hip Hop's forever
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift, but niggas never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn them, I was a tornado coming
He knew from inside like the eye of a storm, and told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweeping leaves, socks to my knees
Home-made shorts, cut off Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wiping away eraser off the paper, man
I'm just trying to say it right
Big radio, tape's slowing down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I got to freeze them 'till they're ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm staring at the speaker
Sunk in them 808s deeper, cleaning my sneakers
With the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoestrings soak in water

Ay fellas
I-I think you might wanna s-s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put the petroleum jelly on your face
Ayo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets that you knock their ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
Get them!

Sitting up drunk, shuffling thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losing focus, what a nigga still hustling for?
My seed is straight, the family's settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin', my life get borin'
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin', but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leaving behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two nines
Next to me in the Phantom, who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Dada, trying to stay away from creeps
With their bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where Feds be laying, from a dreadful slaying
Body viewings, at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dudes is more zealous than Branford
Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya
Kidnap ya, cause of they hunger, but you fucking with hunters
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit

To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitching shit, all up in your body language
Mean mugging your bitch, because she leans over
To look closer, told you: "Y'all sloppy gangsters", saying:
"Nas is this, and Nas is that"
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Because the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, four to the stomach
Call more security because, I come off
Anywhere you at, you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder, than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude, that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, because jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for Salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say: "That's the way you kill a man
Avoid the shooting", hey {*echo* x4}

Secretly I know, you want my place
You waiting on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
Want to come cut my throat, you want to get rid of me
But before I let it happen, them guns going to start clapping
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns going to start clappin
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe

Ayo, we ain't posin' for no pictures in 2018
Candid shit only
Scared motherfuckers

Black Kemet gods (Yeah), black Egyptian gods (Let's go)
Summoned from heaven, blessed, dressed in only Goyard
Homie go hard like Stone and Robert in a stolen car
Shoot the ballot box, no voter card, they all are frauds
Senegal's finest, minerals, diamonds
The Earth is cursed but I survive many climates
Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me
John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me
(You know God sent me here)
Fear will make you reveal who you really are
Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard
This ain't knowledge, this is not intense
For honored men, women too
Us who can see the same thing, but have a different view (Let's go)
All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past
Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back
And who y'all comparin' me to is nonsense
Show gratitude in the presence of dominance

Wheel of Fortune, spin, around

Get smacked down by the fuckin' four pound in your dome
Hit you with the nick plate chrome
Queensbridge, that's my motherfuckin' home
Off the top of my head, yo, I'm a blunt head
Police... Police want a nigga dead

Yo, my style is iller, iller than Halle Berry's figure

Shorty, watch your mouth, I smack you back in your vagina
Here's the reefer, crack the Sunrise Tequila
Kill the Margarita, here's a 50, get some more cheeba
The ghetto trooper, so spark up the Bu-Buddha
My thoughts'll stay nasty like the underground sewers
To be the man, you gotta beat the man
It ain't nothin' startin' over here but nothin' mark my Timberlands
You want static? Let's have it
Niggas who flow like the Atlantic will sink like the Titanic
Since birth, I was thinkin' too fast
My first beef was with the doctor when he smacked me on my ass
The trigger man, I'm crazy like Sam
My skill's so ill like a white chick with a suntan
Check it out now
One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis: my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
But, chill! Bless the microphone and say peace
So, Sudan, take the microphone in your hand
Kick the flim flam
So, check it out
I'm gonna give a strong shout-out, this is to my man Will
A little somethin' I done wrote up for my man Will
It goes somethin' like this, it's called Rock-a-bye Homeboy
Check it out

Queensbridge, when will the drama ever cease?
I'd like to say peace, Willie, and rest in peace
A cool brother who's all about justice
I still can't understand how he left us
Well... he's gone and life goes on, you know
We had a crew, but one by one we go
Memories of his face that was full of joy
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye homeboy
Reminiscin' with the brothers standin' on the block
Never talked a lot, never was a big shot
It's so hard to say goodbye, a sad song
And damn, I can't believe my man's gone
Diggin' back in the days when we used to laugh
Now its a memory that's haunted from the past
Poor Willy, its a shame how the ghetto got him
And word is bond - I wanna cry when I think about him
Three bullets to his back on his own block
Not a way to go, killed by the buckshot
Queensbridge, wake and up and smell the air
And stop killin' like a villain, like you don't care
Remember Willie and the times we had with joy?
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy
Rock-a, Rock-a bye, Rock-a bye Homeboy
Quensbridge style!
Rock-a, Rock-a bye
My skills are ill like the prez with a plan
My brothers run from Sudan then the Ku-Klux-Klan
Like a kamikaze, Saddam Hussein then won
Feel the buns of a nun, put tricks for funds and chill (Wooo-ooooh)
I spill a verse so you can understand
I kill rappers off quicker than a motherfuckin' Mic Man
And when it comes to a battle, I stand out tall
Like the man who played the man on The White Shadow
One two, one two

What you gonna do when the flavour's comin' after you?
Grand Wizard, take my side
Grab the microphone and I'mma rock it up like...

To my man Jungle, dwellin' in the jungle
Where must we go? Where must we wander?
Deep out the skies come the MC Nas
Not to surprise, but to civilize
All the dumb men wanderin' around the streets
Listenin' to a nigga rappin' on fly beats
I just kick the mad Phillie style
Get buckwild 'cause you know my style
I could run a word, kick it to a herd
Make 'em turn into a rich man, increase the plan
The master plan, yo, I'm buggin' out
'Cause the weed got me buggin', plus the Guinness Stout
Grand Wizard, yo, you my physical
Why don't you mic the make, make the microphone miserable?

It's the G, the G, the G, the G, the Wiz
You know that our culture's gone get theirs
I got my man Nasty on the side of me
My man Six-Nine, you know we're not hidin', G
I am the man that'll break it down
I'll break it all down 'cause I got the sound
I got Queensbridge backin' me
The Tec and everythin', I'm comin' strapped, G
It's like that, check it out, uh huh

Yo, check it out, y'all
Money and murder, money and murder
The sick shit you heard comin' from my motherfuckin', my swerve
The words are poetic
I sound energetic when I'm blunted or Moët'd
My microphone's upsetted 'cause I'm crazy
Now you know, never lazy
Yo, I'm gonna get all the cash I can
Don't give a fuck if I gotta shoot a policeman
Pluckin' a church and snatch a fuckin'...
Nah, can't be flippin' like that
'Cause you niggas try to jock the style
But I left that shit to get the new shit to flow like the Nile
Now you can't catch up, G
'Cause I got the new styles on the M-I-C
I keep gettin' newer, can't step to a
Nigga from the Bridge, so, you keep that shit
And I'mma flip the script next year
And my real name is Nasir
Can't spell it 'cause I say it too clear
The alphabets are not enough words or letters to use
When it comes to mics, I bruise
I just go with the magical mystic flow
Niggas don't know, that's word to the man Bo
I get Illmatic with the style that's insane
Comin' out a fuckin' murderer's brain
Grand Wizard, please take this mic from me
Before I bug the fuck out and wind up D-A-E-D
Wait, D-E-A-D, I'm buggin', fuck that shit

Oh my God, they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord, my enemy is fear, and I'm sure
Oh my God, they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure
Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it
It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far, learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off the shoulders of soldiers, on they grizzle
My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children
I made a killin', I'm alive like the morning star
Court Jordan's for the price on stock, so what the Hornets are?

Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger
Yeah, my language advanced, my cadence amazin'
The voice triggers somethin', what is this conundrum?
The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile
Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweat in the sauna or the spa
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction, gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended
Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended
I'm just good at existin', existin' in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah

What come first, peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit
No bacon, brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin'
Say somethin', you stay frontin'
But these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings
You broke my heart, Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get, is there less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time, these are the best times

My pedigree, above your ass, you'll never see I
I love the past, but see where I'm goin', I get to fly

Without production I'm worthless
But I'm more than the surface
Want me to sound like every song on the Top 40
I'm not for you, you not for me, you bore me
I drop lines prestigious schools read to their students
Look at my album plaques, somebody agrees with the music
Was lovin' women you'll never see
All you know's my kids' mothers, some celebrities
Damn, look at the jealousy!
Lucky me, I meet some beauties
Make you wanna shoot me
Hate to brag, my worst batch kills off your best cutie
Facts is deep, we break up, they hook up with athletes

"Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!"

And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs

'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right

Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?

And start up a business, I woulda thought they was playin'
All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin'
A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut
Just a spazz, puttin' wax in the blunt
The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front
We building businesses, you can be mad if you want
It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see
Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me
The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me
So cheers, here's to the Kanye production this eve
War of the Roses, it's war, baby
My nigga High said it's me, I drive 'em all crazy

(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll love, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

If I had everything, everything

If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all?
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
Let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart

When the media slings mud, we use it to build huts
Irrefutable facts, merciful, beautiful black beloved brother
You fail to embarrass him, harassin' him
To my life, your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the God
Do what's necessary, I'm never worried
Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competin', death by the chrome barrel
Forgot the secrets, my Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that
We want freedom, I'm a scholar; an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough

From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, "I thought you would protect me from this scary place?"
"Why'd you let them inject me?"
"Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?"
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso
Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position
Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'
Said, "Screw that bus!" – boycotted that bus outta business
The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison

If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah
Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Baccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper
Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen

You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

You are who you associate with
Look around at your five closest friends
And that's who you are
If you don't want to be that person
You know what you gotta do

Association breeds similarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas
'til six niggas carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man, but no man
Wants to die a poor man with no plan

You can try to kill me, but I come back
Hate me, that's a small thing
Demons let the sword swing and sever off my offspring
Bitches try to see me down, hugging the floor
Bullets pulling me, playing tug of war
With my body, gravity got me
Police want me arrested, just to see me naked
Snakes want my necklace, fake niggas make me set-trip
Thugs shooting reckless (every night, niggas)
Wonder, how will I exit (from this life, niggas?)
Think you a killer, get cement shoes in the river
You should watch them people with you
Let them street rules hit you
If you hang around snitches, you get judged for that
'Cause you condone it, you know there ain't no love for that
There's slugs for that
Oh, you didn't know your man was talking?
That's why you stand with him, 'til you both land in the coffin
When you first heard he was snitching, then you should have thought
Every time this nigga got caught selling, they let him walk
Early on a nigga was taught, stay away from them niggas
So a nigga like Nas got nothing to say to them niggas
I fuck with, only the trusted thug clique
Who really done shit, run up in your bitch, bust the gun quick

Some bitches lie a lot, they could be fly or not
Actresses cry a lot, their girlfriends spy a lot
They can shake your hand, girl, then they take your man, girl
The whole hood knowing, we got something good going
None of these hoes is after me
'Til they saw us happy and that you bagged me
Now they wishing that they had me
So watch who you hang with, and who you cling with
You know these bitches ain't shit, they hoping to bank chips
(With a baller) after she done gave him some head
(He never called her) he gang it and he left her for dead
Birds of a feather fly together
But chickens don't fly, they eat their own shit and die
And you affiliated, now you look weak
'Cause your peeps is freaks
Credit card stealing hoes, well known in the streets
And they brought your down in the dirt
You was a pretty, young, smart thing
Going to work, I bet it hurt, 'cause you had a clean rep
But the girls you seen with make these niggas say
"I bet that bitch suck a mean dick", word

A warrior walk alone, there's one spot on this throne
Fake friends be off and on, but a man stand up on his own
I'm raised by a different code, cut from a different cloth
Never been a follower, my momma told me be a boss
Watch who you hang around, don't let nobody bring you down
Friends come and go like seasons, leaves turn to brown
And some only come around when everything is green
Be careful not to let a snake infiltrate your team
For every Jesus there's a Judas, every Caesar there's a Brutus
If somebody tell you jump off a bridge -- are you gon' do it?
There's two types of influence: either healthy or deadly
Keep your circle small, away from all the hate and the envy
Don't come nowhere near me with it, I'm bullshit intolerant
My politics boss up, for you black empowerment
I stay in my element, Braveheart intelligent
Only associate with those for my betterment
I'm out for dead presidents to represent mines
Only click with my kind, my best friend is my grind
Everybody got big dreams, but few follow through
And it's deep: the company you keep become apart of you
Don't just be sitting around smoking weed, letting time fly
If your homies don't inspire you to rise, tell 'em bye
You're better off dolo than rolling with a weak ass crew

Yo, it's like waking up, from a bad dream (America)
Just to figure out, you wasn't dreaming in the first place (no)

If all I saw was gangsters coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung to
Claim to, I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap? I'm a monster
Streets deceiving, can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata, persona's that of a non-needer
Cause I don't need nada 'cept for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer sleeveless
To my G's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up, a phoenix caked up
Trying to take what I'm eating came up
A dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy, mild, wild hardly
A man's man, who would've knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and Stella McCartneys
For years, all that, how can I not be dead?
This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see, from my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My story is I'm from the home of the thieves

We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA

Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas

Love to sit on the Senate, and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair, she read about herself in the Bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron like, "Bring me my dinner dear"
She the 'nigga' here, ain't we in the free world?

Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?
One time.. two times..

From "Breaking Atoms" to "Illmatic", to goin' platinum
Shit did change course since rippin' it with Main Source
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule
Younger frame, older state of mind
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89
When I was slingin' cocaine and baby 9's
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up
My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up
Took advice from a street legend
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
Witnessin' niggas' mistakes, visits at niggas' wakes
'Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate

Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it, then live it!
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'

Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains
Canal Street, just lookin' at rings
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked
How much it cost, Korean man brushin' me off
For some other big time customer, probably a hustler
Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
I said, "I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker, what?!"

I sat back like the Mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'm ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love, one love

Oh, One Love, means keepin' it real
For the brothers that's locked down
Keep that one love
For the brothers out in the East
Keep that one love
For all the brothers uptown
Keep that one love
For all the brothers in jail
Keep that one love
One love means keepin' it real

Visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 percenters
But somethin' musta got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some rest in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough, so
Until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers, will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Ride the blades of Glory if you got to
Otherwise you ain't shit
You might as well be (?) your damn self

I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels, and rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now I think about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of saying "fuck tomorrow"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Times is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
I Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

They own YouTube, MySpace
When this ignorant shit going to stop?
They monopolizing news, your views
And the channel you choose, propaganda, visual cancer
The eye in the sky, number 5 on the dial
Secret agenda, frequency antenna, Dr. Mindbender
Remote control, soul controller, your brain holder
Slave culture, game's over
What's a fox characteristic? Slick shit, censored misinformation
Pimp the station, over-stimulation
Reception, deception, Comcast digital Satan
The fox has a bushy tail
And Bush tells lies and fox-trots
So, I don't know what's real (what's real)

"They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan

His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life

Uhh, yeah, wow..
No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told
You're left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name
I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
He want my blood, why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man?
Fuck it, I'll take one, 'cause stop me
But can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
They believe in reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in son
Another bullet pass by, missed me
Wondering who plotting to get me?
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys
Then they use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
Don't let 'em kill me...

Some revolutionaries do live long
Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time

Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?
Every time I turn around somebody new dying
Let's start living, À la carte, Escargot
Escobar, invest my millions
Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming anytime
But until then, i'm at large till they shoot me
Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system, be the resistance
No matter what color you are, everybody niggers
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us

Uhh, yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?

And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it?
Underground in they casket, ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazarus
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning ownership, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give my brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we rent and we ask
For reparations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies

Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)

Rich people bags, tip their hats to old men coming out of cabs
Limousine holding doors for them
We all got a job to do, go for it

No bad energy, please, no bad energy
(Just try to be the best you, man
That's all I can say, man)
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
(Don't light over here, man
Put that away, man, put that away)
No bad energy, please, no bad energy
(Tryna tell 'em, know what I'm saying?
Big Apple my Hennessy, please)
No bad energy, please, no bad energy

To rappers who never sold crack, telling other people's lives
Never shot nobody but be shooting people in their rhymes
Never robbed nobody or re-upped with coke in they ride
I'm probably who they talking about when they're writing most of their lines
And I ain't notice it
Trapping was what was happening with bolder cliques
Around me I'm surrounded by the most devoted clique
We saw the smokers get rowdy for all the potentness
And still ain't know how sick it was in that ocean abyss
What doesn't come out in the wash comes out in the rinse
You suckers ain't had no say so
Whoever put you in the position to have a say so should be questioned theyself
I'm silk shirts, summer time sunny, sun chaser
Pretty girl tongue taster, southern girl luster
City girl love maker
The matinee watcher
The good weather on a Saturday afternoon shopper
Good gift copper
Still miss Big Poppa

Literally rich since nine-six
Still woulda hit a enemy with a TEC in nine-six
Exotic material on the neck and fly whips
I was fresh out the 'jects, decked out to death
Y'all witnessed it, I could fill you with real millionaire shit
Escargot, my car fresh from the dealership
Esco alias, my escrow grow daily
It's the freshest Air Max wearer, yes
Ejaculatory depression after sex
And that mean after I nut, don't touch me, no questions
Unless she's a restless spirit then I can heal it
Spend a lot of time together, I know her feelings
But you fightin' what the essence of a woman is
I respect you, my love's limitless
But what are you becoming?
You wanna be the man or the woman? Play your position
Mornin' or night I'm lickin' the pudding ain't I?
Since my days of St. Ides
Pullin' out box cutters to bang opps who ain't us
To Bentley Continentals, see the man I is
Hand-to-hand hustlers always claiming they ran The Brizz
The big homies don't approve that
Felt and Dirty Red fundin' RK but where was you at?
We all tried to move crack
Nowadays I'm just showing my age
The new goons hardly heard of these legendary names, it's strange
The Bridge rappers influenced me, son
But if I was in the Juice Crew, we woulda won
No disrespect 'less disrespect served to me
You a gangsta groupie, gassin' niggas to murder me, nigga?
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
And that's word to Yammy, yeah

I got the je ne sais quoi, why bother
With girls who like to play keep-away with they toddlers?
She started with good intentions like a rich pastor
Bitch was bad, turned from good thing to disaster
Takes forever to build a rep, one second to lose it
She put her neck in a noose, snapped it
Hangin' on every word she heard come outta cougar mouth, super foul
Play your cards right, deuces wild, salute my pals
Fathers all around the board goin' through it
She got lobster appetites, lots of habits
Like frontin' when she need apartment deposits
Here's something, get you a starter
But pardon my pimpin', I don't sponsor
I don't buy cars, I coach you to win, know what?
If you broke and your man don't teach you, get rid of him

Everybody's not gon’ get you but keep going
I be cruising 40,000 feet like I'm a Boeing
Doubting me, they said I would have no longevity
Instead I'm steadily repping these fundamentals
I assemble these sentences
’Cause someone said that I've been unadventurous
I've been uninterested, learning life is what matters
Chill, I'm the humble bragger
I could son a rapper, every one of you rappers
Vámonos, I be running you rappers
Adios, I don't see none of you rappers
All of y'all under me rappers
I need to golf, need a day to relax
Get a massage, Al Jarreau on the track
Al Jarreau of rap, made the Mets hat
More famous than Strawberry, y'all know this already

Here's our symphony
A measure by measure, a pleasure of harmony, melody
Here’s the memories
I used to play 40th and Vernon every yesterday

Evolution of a man and his music
The ill fill of harmonic symphonic acoustic
My Wikipedia just said it, I'm multimedia

I played it some where you tuck away and play the cut
Then they front

In our younger days we were so in love
And the thought of losing you was enough
Can't lose me

Who be the holy prophet, they watchin’ with all his posture?
His Rothstein goggle game be the dopest, he gots to
Be from the '80s era
His tint is shade Carrera, Queens forever
Green pipe seats, clean Panamera
Amateur Hanna-Barbera characters know they envy
The illest Hennessy Black sipper with loaded semis
You pick of the week, voted-in rappers you go against me
You can't tantalize a call girl with just a roll of pennies
Can’t bait a lion in ya trap without a tranquilizer
You enterin' a boxing ring with no trainer beside ya
My Panerai watch glows like Avatar
Caviar black diamonds, can you imagine, y'all
Takin' from a rich man plate? Kick in his door
'Cause his war with the bloodsuckers of the poor
The first shall be last, that's just universal law
Pop the cork, the Perrier-Jouët pours, like this

Uh
I tell a story of a prince life and all his glory
It's killin' me softly
Somber like the buildings in Fort Greene
Hood monsters and niggas who walk mean
Hood niggas and they just came home and they grip they chrome
Can you hear me, is this thing on?
Test, one, two, gimme some feedback if y’all could feel it
For the home invasion dudes that be robbin’ dealers
Picture me runnin' inside they crib, rollin’ wit' ya
Mask on the face, tyin' up the sister
Lookin' for the bricks to get richer
Smackin’ up the dude with the gun, take the jewels and the funds
A dirty game when you servin' 'caine
Got feds to watch, hoes to watch, checkpoints and roadblocks
Police barricades, batterrams
Doors off the hinges, wake up flinchin', who ratted, man?
Knew who it had to been, states, feds and housin' added in
Every department searchin' your apartment
Ransackin' it, found four ratchets
DEA jackets, we gotta escape the madness
Haha, yeah, escape the madness
Yeah, through the eyes of Pablo
That's how I'm lookin' at you, there's an obstacle in everything
It's all natural, I'm keepin' it pilin'
Keepin' heat with the silencers
Learnin' Greek and Italian, speak with kings while dinin'
Good with hyenas, meanin' it's hood when it's time for ridin'

Where I resided, a phenomenon
With the ambitions of a rider

Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Truck jewels, big stacks, mustard boots
Construction on her feet, she eat duck confit
I shoot up the club whenever I hit it raw
If she have a baby by me, I'ma love her more
Brings food to the crib when I'm laying low
And she know how to roll weed, but don't smoke
Chinese massages, wifey, no side-chick
Go sight-seeing with the god
Playing cards with my dad, frying chicken for the mob
Simply Lemonade, raspberry for the wash, gosh
She know who tryin' to rock her to sleep to get to me
Give 'em the side eye when she see 'em in the street
Her brother locked up, he doin' ten up in the beast
He's short, he comin' home and she hyped for his release
Fly her to Hollywood, watch flicks from Nollywood
Like hydraulics, she ride the wood

Said, "It's straight," we need a place up in Jamaica Estates

Said the streets, the snakes, plus Governor Cuomo
Flashes out the window, people takin' my photo
She knew I wasn't gon' be no husband, I be a no-show
Leave her standin' at the altar, bro, I couldn't falter
Plus that Nigerian blood mixed in her culture

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)

Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty

A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy and it bugs me
Behind her best friend back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less then a week ago
He's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speakerphone
Right before he clinked up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You can stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk
Never swung at nobody, never let a gun spark
Big nine-seven Benz with the old body
Pulls up to the corner, out jumps his old hottie

I think about settlin' down again, have more seeds
Ten toes on the ground again, let hoes be
Nothin' like makin' love with somebody you love

Know some people who know people
Getting money, the broke people claim you owe some people
It's easy to explain anything to a real liver of life
Who live where you live and see shit the same
Gotta watch who you joke with or get checked
We easily mistake jokes for disrespect

Some are caricatures, amateur boys
I'm like a classic pianist with a handful of sores
Bandages on my finger, still managing chords
Like a live band, performing in a sand storm
Blind, but I still hit the right keys
Swift as a life breeze, dripping
In fear of God, scented in Diptyque fragrance
Some nights Creed flavors, I am motivation
I don't talk on the next man, I am never hating
This daily bread, holy bread
Alphabetical numerals, codes of red
What's more dense, gold or lead?
What's more expensive?
The OG said, "No matter what it is, rent it
And never buy it, it's all temporary possessions
We don't own nothing on this Earth but our soul and that's the lesson"

At fourteen tried out for the ball team
Junior high, they denied me
I shot bricks that made the backboard scream
Fightin' Italian rival gangs, they was sniffin' glue
I was skippin' school, smokin' green, that was the shit to do
Stole somebody team jacket at practice, slept through my classes
The borough Queens, so it's rep the Q to the casket
Average student, had illusions of the supernatural
Horror movie addict, werewolf fanatic and Dracul'
One night after school and train hoppin' and snatchin' jewels
I dozed at midnight, woke up a little after two
My hands shook violently
My eyes took red
My hair spun in ways
Bread was the only word I said
I heard voices in the nights calling, the Benz engine roaring
Heard that gin and champagne pourin' and niggas ballin'
I put the .22 on my waist
The face in the moon had a mean look
I transformed to the Queens wolf

You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

Waking up is a pleasure though last night I can't remember
Cash up on my dresser, where'd it come from?
This is messed up
What kind of fatal drug am I taking? who laced it?
Previous night, memories who erased it?
Wasn't even wasted
I do recall the nightfall, lunar, the stars around it
Then my man called, said what I did, the goons were talkin' 'bout it
Singin' me praises, said I lit the corners up
It sounded like Vietnam screamin' out "QBietnam" the loudest
"Homie them dudes is scared you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing
They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team"
So that explain the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer
That wasn't there a day before, I should press 'em all
But I be on some cool shit, nigga, my QU shit
Audemars watch, burn a peach Swish', new whip
Stoli' vodka, club soda with my new chick
Ah shit, teeth showing, snarling when the moon's lit

You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

Buckets like Gilligan
Still I peep reptilians in the Filligan
Blendin' in, my quintillion ton brain
Got me revealing men
Quintessential Queensbridge poet back to the grill again
Did songs with Chubb Rock to Chris Brown, switch styles
Yet to see any heavyweight make it to this round
This that pure champion sound, I wear the crizzown
Raw, one take, I don't even need a mixdown
Demure, not docile, volatile, I kick down
Amphibians, reptiles that make that hiss sound
They eyes change color, their pupils start to slit down
When I take cover, and I let off a fifth round

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
Rest in peace to B.I., the shit never ends
B.I.G. shit
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
The world's going crazy, this shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)

Stop waiting for the hood to 'preciate ya
Whoever gets love in the hood, he's a freak of nature
When I said I wasn't mainstream, lames scream
"What does he mean?
Who does he think he is?
His bank be hid, he hardly out
He still as hard as he was when he started out"
We count 'em out, we count 'em in
Amongst the real, never my crown in doubt
So around my house with my wiz, lessons I got from my friends
Do they love me for me or love me for them?

Can't see me moving, I'm like the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
They hate it before they hear it
Clear that my perseverance is somethin' they can't bear
It's become apparently clear
They fear me, I'm not dying or rather
Put my ears to the blaring cop siren
Am I here or in a hot dryer?
Didn't hear all that pop-soundin' fakespeare, pop rhymin'
Niggas should stop lyin'
Why in a whole year, you still in the same spot trying
To change, but you not risin'?
When will somebody real tell him he not Nas-in'
Cars, you just started drivin'
I've been ridin', been made it
You and your pretend stages

Where we met, I had to give her mad respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back, he jumped in the meter cab
Gestured to her cell to tell her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, and I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass, how she gone get to the projects?
She ain’t got no cash, and she strugglin' while walkin'
So I drive past, yo I say "I ain’t no stalker wit yo big 'ole ass
Here’s my help I’m tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this? now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left her ex
Damn we speedin'

Now girl, you mean the world to me
Now girl, you mean the world to me

I’m a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in
I’m a king, you're a queen

So she treat him like it’s a setback

Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I’m laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you
But when you make a girl leave her man
You never really know where she stand
How you know she really yours?

Talking to this cutie on FaceTime
Trying to figure out if she gon' give me that face time
I don't wanna tour, I wanna chill with my son more
Teach him about Egypt and tranquility
Critically analyze black lives and respectability
Why Prodigy mural get vandalized? Why Prodigy?
The project politics obviously
Demagogue democracy, in the fog I see the Mobb represented into the light
Back to the source where all energy comes
Your enemy, dunn, was internal
A disease that needs a vaccination
Plagues black seeds
The industry ain't as friendly as it first seems
When you dream of drivin' your whip to ya house in Florida Keys
On behalf of me and Queens and all of the Gs
Bandana P will always stand as tall as the trees
First things first, this should be understood
Queensbridge, just ain't any other hood
It's music, legacy is incredibly high pedigree
I don't mean this disrespectfully alphabetically
If it's hard to swallow and the credits of B street singing this Bernard Fowler
He sang with the Rolling Stones, background for Bootsy Collins
Marley Marl's advanced raps sound perfect timing
The early '80s, we babies, Pebblee Poo dropped
The beat was crazy and Marley was changing hip-hop
Then Marley and Shanté caught a body, UTFO
She cold, "Roxanne's Revenge", she was 14 years old
Then came the Juice Crew and the who's whos
G Rap, Rakim and Kane, beats made in the Q-U
I was probably playing with .32s in the lobby
It's Queensbridge over everything and everybody
I wish the 'book never came out
And everything got straightened out
Before you left, I saw you, it was all love
Except we needed to build more and get things correct

My baby's mom made a book about me, she tried to out me
In Barnes & Nobles new release section she's confessin'
Now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman
Couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth
Was she looking for fame? yo I hope she got it
Since then I been the object, gossip people tried to target
All women should bid
For keeping real fathers away from their kids
These rappers talkin' real shit I lived
How many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin'
Hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand
Stevie Wonder sent me word that he was in my corner
Blind but still sees the pain of a young performer
Used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us
She married again and I'm wishin' all the best to her
Got me looking for my mother, all I see is suckers
She lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em
Come on I'm livin', I don't need many to pray for me
Her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad

So unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast
I signed my own checks, swore we paid the IRS
Somebody's stealin', I swear to God
Tsk, for now, I invest
To my incarcerated team who got life
It's not right but you still got your life
Rest in peace to Gil Scott from the kill or be killed blocks
Not from Philly but a nigga done hustled them hilltops
Commercial pop artists get all the accolades
I give a million cash away to be revered like Donny Hathaway
Probably not as half as paid as I should be
But I stay in some cars and stay in some pussy
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

A thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed, or smacked up
Proud to say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
Or extorted for my pay stubs
Lucky or blessed from what prayer does
'Cause hey, I was riding in caravans with AK's and gloves inside 'em
And if I should spare that man who violated my trust
I gave him a pass
My man called and I value his judgement
I let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over
So if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun
I'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder
'Cause I chilled and let you breathe, yes
Let's go our own ways and let the beef digress
I done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us
My younger brother knows this
Not Jungle, got another brother in PA
Spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day
I gotta say I got some fam across the USA
Cackalack to Kansas but my mans around the way had contacts
They was Spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye
Willie, Bo, blowing haze, Mayo next door
Joe, Martin, Slade, I'm solo these days
It wasn't my fault
I never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in New York
Barely survived
Large, I thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter P's in the booth
How to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth
Akinyele, you knew
I was your brother 'til death
Back when you put me on to NiQuay from Lefrak
You was a dime, we was nobodies
Say what's up to Shameek, send my love to Yadi
I pray we all get old if I never again go gold and sell tickets
We could all still kick it
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life
Rest in peace to my brother Talik
Gone too soon
God bless your soul brother
He was wild
Some things we just can't explain
Life
It's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back
With your kids at an early age
First steps, first words
I can't see 'em cause you mad
Don't put yourself before the babies
Don't say crazy things to hurt that man
You hurt him enough
The good times outweighed the bad
When it was good, it was great
But because I could see him now through the courts, you mad
Okay that's how it is out here
That's life huh
You see we can't be selfish out here
We gotta live and let love
Let the light in
To the beautiful mothers of my kids
And all the mothers around the world

One time
Yeah, yeah

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors

One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin

Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now
All I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)

All I need is one mic (This is all I need)

All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now
All I need is one mic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All I need is one mic (All I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (Fuck the cars, the jewelry)

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time a man is murdered — the beginnin' and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt

Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid

I'm just tryna tell these brothers where I'm comin' from
You know what I'm sayin'?
Alright, kick it

I'm the nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Gimme a Smith-N-Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
I'm rollin' with a mob and run from the cops
Drive stolen cars and shoot many Glocks
A marijuana addict, if niggas want static, they had it
'Cause I flip just like a acrobatic
I'm always on the corners rollin' up Sess
When I dress, it's never nothin' less than Guess
So I walk with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committin' sins and my friends sell crack
I got it goin' on, my knuckle game is strong
Sip Dom Pérignon and then carry on
Army certifieds, keep a Rent-A-Ride
Strippin' mad hoes and kick 'em to the side
See, I'm the type of brother who keeps a four-pounder
Start a lot of shit and shoot at out-of-towners
At every block party, I try to catch a body
All for props, tell your pops call the cops
See, now I'm on the run, but still havin' fun
Livin' by the MAC, my gear is all black
I keep killin' because I'm ready and I'm willin' and I'm a villain

Around they wrist, you don't like the sound of this rebel
But my country doesn't want me
They'd rather hunt me, but you'll never catch us all
While you fuckin' with the dealers, we'll be stickin' up the malls
Full of anger, all about danger
Pullin' out my banger, stabbin' up a stranger
I hear Walkie-Talkies in my sleep
And use a whole lot of slang when I speak
Walkin' with a vest, the projects is where I rest
And the streets keep me stressed
Starin' at your face, wait for you to make a sound
That's when I take you down, shoot you up and suit you up
All in black and put you in a box
A hard rock with a .25 in my socks
Aimin' at your temple, so take the diamonds off your hands
I'm buckwild like Billy Bear and Ganz
Prince of pistoleers, words are crystal clear
And this you should fear
The maniac keeps killin'
I'm known as a outlaw 'cause I'm a villain
What?
What?
Wha-a-a-t?

I keep bullets racin' out the barrels of a Magnum
Put 'em to sleep and leave the doctors to tag 'em
A outlaw, although I never wear a holster
In every town, you see my face is on a poster
Hear so many gunshots, my eardrums should pop
Eyesight should stop from seein' mad niggas drop
To the concrete, I got police puttin' chalk on the street
And this is done once a week
I'm out to kill like Navy Seals
I'm crazy ill, and what I can't do, my .380 will
I never play with a AK
Because I'm fine with a .9 and if caught, I'll do lesser time
Sometimes, you gotta plan shit and understand it
See, I'm a bandit whose hand'll itch
Without a gun in it, Nas is runnin' it
I stay blunted, I'm the project's most wanted
My voice is like magic
My cassette is the clip and your radio's the Automatic
So when I'm in your town, duck down
Or take fire, whatever you desire
But I'm on point, you might miss
Never fight this, you'll be sightless when I strike this
So roll the dice, I'm stoppin' the bank
It's ill how I got the pen droppin' the ink
No one can stop this apocalypse on your record player
A method layer, so run and tell your Mayor
Nas the parlayer, you better say your prayer
I'm the New York City slayer
I play high-post and then lay low
Parlé slow and wear horns, not a halo
And keep killin' 'cause I'm a villain9Embed
(Y'all ready for Nas?
Queensbridge, y'all ready to see Nasty Nas?
Uh huh, they ready)
Yeah, word
Got some Rémy Martin
And some good-ass cigars, check it out

Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety

Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'?
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it
You envy, but don't offend me
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me?
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Montana from Queens had before the 90's
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact, haha...
(Nasty) Nasty kid
(Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) The kid! (Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) Nasty kid (Nasty)

For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'
Saying, "It was Nas I used to hustle with"
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish
Guns on my waist, past this
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors
For my team, nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I’m no fake rap CD listener, sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my G's, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga31Embed

Uh, light somethin', stop frontin'

How much money's enough? Think maybe like a trillion figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters
That'd kill me yo, filthy rich
My daughter pass it onto the next generation
Throwing carnations at my tombstone
In my new home, meet Mom's in my Yves Saint Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance
Like my man Luther jam, but my verse came first
I stole change out her purse, now I wanna dig her up
Outta the earth, too morbid, lean forward
Toward a new paragraph, Blue carrots, D-class
Strictly that kush in the weed bags
Tryna' figure out what Barry Gordie had put in production
Studio's smokey now, hard like David Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a seance, and uh, play on, playa

Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta' get your papes on, play on, playa
Before it's all gone, sip Don, tip waiters
Do y'all thing, ménage, swing, baby
Spend dubs on your bruhs, gotta live crazy

No criminal, no mo', just mo' dough
Mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings
On fingers while your girl performs cunnilingus
‘Cause this big money aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then they give me a fade
Hot towel on the face, hot models who vomit
After they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Mo Green from Godfather, so clean
Where I step I 'Clorox it', keep twenty G's
On both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thou to browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buyin' conflict ice
That's the shit they stole from the Congo, and other black soil
True mack fo' you, nappy hair just spinning
Honey gave me a massage with a happy ending

It's kinda hard for a playa like you
But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
What you never do is punk out, what you better do
Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view
Better yet, a better crew, praise God, I'm a marry you
Get ya holy, carry you, bury you, slowly
Roll me another blunt, stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it
That man, that game, that thing it busts

Yup, yup, young loc with the two steps
He creepin' with two TEC's, they sleepin' with two chicks

End of existence, for instance
Rewind, replay it, re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it
Goddamn, D-O-Double-G, cuz, we missed it
Travel slow, I'm an Indian, but not a Navajo

Hudson

Heard you got your master's
Did college up, never looked back, now that's what's happening
And it's good to see you made it out the hood
With a degree, a true man with passion
Now you could enter the so-called "White Man's Society"
And go right past 'em
Looking in the Wall Street Journal for your face
But it's always absent
There he go, that's him
Eating flan and ambrosia, watch on his arm, golden, laughin'
Try to get his attention, but he's flinching
Guess my grimy clothes threw him off, so I mention
We were neighbors some time ago
He was kinda cold, in this restaurant, full of his kind and more
He sighed, tried to look surprised, I know
His side of the city where he resides, so
I had to go, I heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes
Hate so-called "intellectuals"
No balls, he suggests we vote
He stand all proud, speaking to correct his folks
He want to lecture folks 'cause he professional
And he suggest that we don't sell dope
And I guess it's true, but who the fuck are you?

With my Hell Up in Harlem hat in hand
With a girl named Pat
She more than a waitress to order your drink with
She divorced a banker and bought the bar
She got an automobile, she give an order to kill
You get caught and robbed, we could see your walk is off
You could lose your rhythm when you outta the gutter for a while
You easily go to soft from hard
Now we all about hustlers, number runners, hoes and sharks
And we all know the code of the block
And you talking some gibberish, anti-nigga shit
'Cause you marched back with Rosa Parks?
Brother, don't start, go build your Noah's Ark
You could float to the end of the world, and pretend what you not
But I know what you are
While I roll in my car, and I'm spending my knot
While my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot
Matter of fact, you're an easier target
And I respect everything you accomplished
But I hope I never get old and talk that nonsense

Yeah..
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore, I could see
Through my belly button window, who I am...

I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Nine-months process, infant size
A prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties
Was married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop
I'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones
Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones
Hearing prayers, she asking for my good health
That I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself
Nervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood
Mixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes
Lot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping
I'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen

Yo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered, "If I am born, will I be safe at all?"
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
September 14th, 73
Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop
See how the government start retraining cops
Month nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said "Stay calm," holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud
Wanting to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he say, "At least that nigga ain't ugly"
Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers

Dre, he a Compton-Compton O.G
Nas, he a QB-QB true G
Do the history

Way before The Firm, like back in the day
Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away
But we still get together, like, every several years
To sprinkle a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax, sippin' Cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers
Low-key, no G's, but it's still Gucci luggage
I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with gray eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? ‘Cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate
So every breath I take is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe, like you at high altitude
So crack the Patron, it's on heathens
The God's back, hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'

Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders
Make that cake, cop two five fivers

1995, eleven years from the day
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
Illmatic on the top shelf, The Chronic on the left, homie
Wanna cop both but only got a 20 on me
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the 20 on a dub sack
Ripped the package off Illmatic and bumped that
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a "New York State of Mind"
Inside the dope house, bottlin' up sherm
Bangin' The Firm, Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm making 'em burn
Ended my peers' careers
Hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with niggas, ‘cause I'm "Ether" to niggas
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
If I ruled the world I summons all you weak rap niggas to death
He a Compton-Compton OG

Yo, the Jordans sportin', come off the dice game
With a fortune walkin', you a walking coffin'
The musket, I tucked it, you bluff it, I bust it
You're sideways talking, so I lay often
I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas
Pluck ashes of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that Soul Plane movie's the bomb
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting
See that's malarky you yappin'
I open up the tripod to put the Gatling on, and I start clappin'
Nasty man, from bagging grams and runnin' from cops

Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have to kill ya
'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war, we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no Heaven or Hell, dead is dead, fuckers
And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur

I sip shots, watchin' 'em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin' deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin' why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die?
Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game
Exhalin' guilt, sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring, luck or anthrax?
I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow

My skin is a art gallery, right, with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin' the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse?
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des?
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She know what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess, it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous?
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely, hold me, it's gettin' darker

For every child that's born, and every nigga gone

Family gossiping, pocket watching him
Jealousy keeps blossoming, ain't let it box me in (King)

Remember crowns, remember, kings
They want your reign to cease (King)
You a king, you will be next to me, doing your own king shit, most definitely
We're so "Say less when I speak", y'all estrogen speak
Respected by kings only, address me as chief
Invested in things only a vet would
Only lames front on kings, that's expected from creeps
You mad at my niggas and any woman with interest in me
You could've made it (You was good), look at all the time wasted
Now you gotta retract statements, shoulda stuck to the basics
All you had to do was tell the truth, like, fuck all the fake shit
You should want every brother to make it out
But brothers want trophies, they troll for clout
Rap is weird, weird flex, but okay
You ain't as ill as you think, you just okay
You got pressed in the hood, fix your jibs up, I'm on top
Stop fighting it, yo, stop with the over-righteousness
It's so lame, this media circus greedy and worthless
My life got 'em tight, why they wanna see me hurt up? (Why me?)

As we go through life, one of the big questions about
Things we purchase is— is, what the value of it is
Is it really worth it?

I used to be at The Tunnel twenty deep in a huddle
Razors on us that'll make skin bubble, Moet, we guzzle
Chris Lighty let me in a few times with nines
That's on God, wish you woulda walked by
And bumped me hard or just looked at me wrong
My chain on, try to book me, you gone
Goons, Italian leathers, couple bottles of Dom
Took risks, this ain't what you want, there's rules to this
Don't get it misconstrued, my suit gamе is crisp
Silk, linen, chiffon, Dior to Diadora
But I rock custom more, that hustler aura, tap in
Razor cutter, nineties, eighties lover, raised in gutters
Raised above it, they made it up out the hood subject, I made you love it
Crazy, I knew this chick, she had a blue Benz
A Jersey penthouse, she used to pimp girls that would turn rich men out
Her coke habits was so savage
She hear voices and see ghosts on the average
Of her stepdad, he raised her from a carriage
She was twelve when he passed, she's been in hell since that
Her grandma raised her, I met her in Kingston, Jamaica
Where veteran kingpins bought acres, rest in peace Louie Rankin

I'm studied like a book by many
They give me looks of envy, I took the Bentley
White chick like Liz Taylor might get the Bentayga
On my Rick James behavior
Life is school for the soul and I'm in life seven already
Life's simple but heavy, incomprehensible shit
Everything from sexy to deadly, I done been through that shit
Still goin' deeper like I grew a new inch on my dick
We looked at robbin' as a way of resolving our problems
My moms cooked food, but some of my niggas was starving
And whatever they was down to do, I was with 'em regardless
Turns out I was hungry and was hittin' the hardest
Decisions was sharper, my predictions was on it
No fortune teller, just going off regular signs
Niggas often tell ya they moves
Without a word, just reading they mind
Wasn't needin' no nine
Corner executive born in ghetto hell
Where metal yell especially over necklaces
Life lessons is karma
Whatever you dish out come back as blessings or to haunt ya
Could miss your kids and hit your grandkids for your dishonor
That's generational curses, they said they want the old Nas back
Play the Clue tapes for old verses
Messin' my homies' lives up, sayin' Nas'll rise 'em up
Like they wasn't live enough, many lives I've touched
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
I need a witness, drinkin' three at night on some Bridge shit
Wearin' shorts and Timbs, summer night on some Bridge shit
Party with gangsters, gettin' right on some Bridge shit (Yeah)
Like MC Shan and Marley, I be on some Bridge shit
Yeah
Like Jabari, I'm on some Bridge shit
Shooter live on
Kings live forever
Yeah
We go through a lot
And nobody wanna hear about what we go through
And that's cool too
Every man go through the same Mondays and Fridays
Same sun, moon, and stars
It's just how you stand like a man10Embed

Whole squad hide the burners (Whole squad)

Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest every day as a child
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars, but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time, it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? We must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children

Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, "Dog you safe whenever you with me, see, this is my town"
So the youngsters grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At a early age already know what's against him
So in order for him to survive
One day he must open up his eyes to the setbacks and rise
'Cause everybody wants a shot
In this land of opportunity, look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet?
The Earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks, and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo
All this hate can't last forever (Uh, come on)
It's time that we stand together (Yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (What? What? What? What? What? Come on)

Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In hip-hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best, you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid, none less
Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders, no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now
All this hate can't last forever
It's time that we stand together
Everybody wants to rule the world

Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying?
Niggas ain't forget nothing, man
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that, man, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is, like
Whatever you want out of life, whatever you feel is rightfully yours
Go out and take it, even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about

If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, "She's my Queeeeeen"
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin' shot, given poison

In hospitals, shots riddle the block
Little children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' "Rest In Peace"
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
"Life is short" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses

Sisters up in my hood try to do good, given choices

When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial, hateful
Toward themselves, denyin' even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods, but I
Overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint them, plaow
Never to worry
All the wrong-doers got it comin' back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it comin' back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sows, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse
But we'll get through it, y'all, be strong

The China-man built the railroad
The Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return, the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday "Hell-day"
'Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts e'ryday like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party e'ryday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

It's all poison
All of my words to enemies, it is poison
Rappers only talk about keys, it's all poison
How could you call yourself MC's? You ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison

This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C
This is the problem, 'cause he never tell 'em he got it
From lettin' fags suck him off, Rikers Island in '93
Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rockin' they shirts in bitches' faces like clockwork
"What's your name? Where you from?"
Chain blingin', thinkin' girls everywhere is dumb
Takin' pride in ruinin' their lives
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives
He never used a condom, give him head? He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate, believin' in karma
Those on top could just break and won't be eatin' tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin' on niggas' dreams
They leave, when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' they seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em, they spendin' money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies 'cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you, now you old and you gettin' shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know, the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush-killer 'til George Bush kills me
Much blessings, be healthy, remember

They said this day would never come
They said our sights were set too high
This country is too divided, too disillusioned
To ever come together around a common purpose. They said

("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
("Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president")
Yes we can change the world, the world, the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say

They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trial, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us, uhh

What's the black pres' thinking on election night?
Is it: "How can I protect my life?
Protect my wife? Protect my rights?"
Every other president was nothing less than white
Except Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like: "What the fuck?!", loading their guns up
Loading up mine too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brother
...but will he keep it way real?
Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal
When he wins, will he really care still?

Bitch called "Life": I pimped her, what
Politics, politricks, Klan-shooter
Deacon for defense, progress-producer
Nothing on the stove, a survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through to help
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again

Listen up, gangstas and honeys with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog, whatever they call you, God, just listen
I'll spit a story backwards, it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in this chest of a nigga, now he back to square one
Screamin', "shoot don't please", I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van, they closin' shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, "Go he there"
Sittin' back in his chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, "Outside right we"
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, "Block your on enemy's the"
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, "No hell," she talkin' 'bout, "Me kiss"
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, "Stressed really I'm"
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, "Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill"

You lames could huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody

I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R

You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed, hair parted with a

Return of the golden child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu's, tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me God's Son with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist', I floss
Stick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (Uh)

Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug's mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothing but peace, love
And street passion (I wanna go, nigga)
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's mama to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
‘Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just 20-some-odd years, I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
‘Cause, like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
‘Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings, in thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good (at thugs's mansion)
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion
Dear mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
(At thugs's mansion)
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright

Light it, uhh

The whole city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it
It's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it or dump it
Write it, across the stomach spell "God's Son"
Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple

Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah… light it up

Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things, y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground, but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back, they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tier in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple
Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple28Embed

People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality

On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets, niggas
Little kids scared cops, with red dots
Philosophical gangsta, with violent priors
Going back like black and white TVs with pliers
Leaning on broke down cars with flat tires
Flash iron on anybody trying on the blocks I'm supplying on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em, and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged with wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listening to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple

Cause she bought a jum of soap from one of my boys
It's just another day in the hood
And I'm with some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile, then we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes

We was tryna squash the whole shit in Vegas
No media to eat it up and leak it in the papers
Eric B, Big D, and 'Preme was affiliated
Peace to E.D.I., Napoleon and all the innovators
We had respect before we was ever some entertainers
See Suge, he was a dangerous threat
M.O.B almost turned half of New York red
Brothers I grew up with threw up they sets
Some even had them Death Row chains hang off their necks
There's a rumor that spread I'd like to address
Pac was never set up by Stretch (Let it rest)
I stepped to him at Bryant Park so we could speak direct
He didn’t disrespect, we planned to reconnect
I flew to Vegas to shoot the "Street Dreams" video and link with 2Pac. Tried to squash the East Coast/West Coast beef. We didn’t talk, but he was still alive in the hospital. And it rained that day in Vegas. Rest In Power

Chill out, chill out, yo, hold on. This is my nigga Nas and we both got one thing in common. We both, we both represent Queens to the fullest, aight? This brother was good enough to stop his show.

My thumb struck a lot of lighters, pulled a lot of all-nighters
Banned from some afterhours spots
My crew would choose violence, move in silence
Who knew I'd grew to build an empire?
Streets had me against the ropes, would've thought I was ziplining
TECs in the dresser, money off tech, pushing a Tesla
Rolled up a fresh one, it's one IPO to the next one
Rich from corporate or thuggin', expensive mistakes
It's all a racket, it's the same thing, just the risk that you take
Moving too fast, blues on your ass
The boys came through with the task
Peep through the blinds, you knew it was curtains
Breadwinner take a L, leave the whole family hurting
Seen it a million times, system washed him out with the verdict

Pouring this white wine, you could Richard Mille your left wrist
Keep in perspective, we on God's time (The world is yours)
What happens when dealers reduce to addicts?
What happens when kings don't see their potential status?
What's your exit plan? Face to face with my omens, I never ran
Stood on stages most never can, pyrotechnics and leather pants
Shifting the culture
Mention me with Mick Jagger and Bono like you're 'posed to
I'm standing next to rookies, somehow they looking older
The altitude of matter so cold, it'll make your nose run
How you expect to get love if you don't show none?
I should send you little niggas on a store run
How we moving is no cut
I'm from the era of razor blades and coke dust
People living with no trust, champagne in the soap suds

It's about rank, you ain't there yet
Think you gon' send me to the store? I own the store, man
I'm just testing you

I got the hood playing golf, wild boss style
Crucifixes over the Chrome Hearts, you get crossed out
People battered down, Asian hate getting passed around
Tiger happy, both his parents' lives matter now
Marble floors is my common law, we company builders

We on autopilot, no captain behind the wheel
My whole career, I steered away from features
But I figured it's perfect timin' to embrace new leaders
Accepted my position as the master teacher
I make cash deposits before the first
Flashy diamonds, that's waterworks
Sassy modеls the curviest
Brothers you knеw from the sandbox'll do you the dirtiest
Government assistance, poverty is big business
Overrun the Senate, both parties got policies built for the wicked
Look in the jungle, you gotta move like an animal
Prey on the predators, go where anybody that challenge you
Board rooms, courtrooms, it'll leave you with war wounds

Silk is the dress code, had to be Esco
Colors of lightbulbs change through voice command
Flew over Antigua, made the choice to land
Set my feet on a private island, house come with a staff
Chef know how to cook with no salt and low fat
Extended stay shorty, she don't wanna go back

Houses in Long Island, they always found 'em
House in the South, a nigga barely got out
Sunny L.A., remеmber calls with Dr. Dre
He told mе, "Don't let the palm trees fool you, nigga, be safe"
Me and my higher self, we often would speak
Somehow we lost the connection, might meet at Joshua Tree

I like the other definition, rectangular carats
The concept of this song is rather esoteric
This girl said in Grenada we should go get married
Broke the meanin' down of the Virgin Mary
And you got your own place, my favorite part of the night
When you text me that you made it home safe (I'm home)
I'm contemplatin' at the home base
How I'm used to breakfast in the ghetto, sippin' OJ
That's a picture right there, a moment in time
Before anybody wanted a photo of mine
Before the internet energy and social decline
Destroyed the vibe, foolin' us with the headlines

All my time has been focused on my freedom now
Why would I join 'em when I know that I can beat 'em now?
They put their words on me, and they can eat 'em now
That's probably why they keep on tellin' me I'm needed now
They tried to box me out while takin' what they want from me
I spent too many years livin' too uncomfortably
Making room for people who didn't like the labor
But wanted the spoils, greedy, selfish behavior
Now let me give it to you balanced and with clarity
I don't need to turn myself into a parody
I don't, I don't do the shit you do for popularity
They clearly didn't understand when I said "I Get Out" apparently
My awareness like Keanu in The Matrix
I'm savin' souls and y'all complainin' 'bout my lateness
Now it's illegal for someone to walk in greatness
They want the same shh, but they don't take risks
Now the world will get to see its own reflection
And the anointed can pursue their own direction
And if you're wrong and you're too proud to hear correction
Walk into the hole you dug yourself, fuck a projection
See me in my freedom takin' all my land back
They said a lot against me thinkin' I'd just stand back
I got my legs beneath me, I got my hands back
A lot of people sabotaged, they couldn't stand that
I turned the other cheek, I took blow after blow
There's so much crisis in the world 'cause you reap what you sow
When you keep what you know is meant for someone else
The ditch you dig for them, you might just end up in yourself
I'm in the secret place, I keep a sacred space
They keep showin' their hands, but keep hidin' their face
If I'm a messenger, you block me then you block the message
So aggressive, the world you made is what you're left with
Pride and ego over love and truth is fuckin' reckless
Y'all niggas got a death wish, the stupid leaves me breathless
Some place to be, yeah
Ain't duckin' nothin'
Just might have to build my own city

But you bein' bad is just a bonus, look how beautiful your soul is
This shit feels like a high school crush (Think we in love)
I used to be her high school crush

Ayo, Hit, I like this IE weather

Ayy, look
Vote yes on Hit-Boy, bitch, I'm the city spokesman
They see we got this shit crackin’ and now they spirit broken
I’m standin' on the green like the British Open
And stackin’ ice on top of ice, but I’m not building snowmen
Doctors couldn't even detect my disorders
One case, six figures on six different lawyers
I put my soul in every song with limited support
Focused on the output, not the outcome, big God is my source
Spirit of excellence in my genetics
Complexities come with my complexion
'Fore you shut me down, let me reach my level first
Y'all be too proud to do the devil’s work
All that actin’ and fakin’, I can’t take part in it
I’m washin’ my hands with the soap opera shit
I set the cameras to speed, co-directed KD
We know the caged bird sings and screams when it’s free
Every second I spend on this, I got it back in blessings
You can’t stop and run no errands on the way to legend

They should've told ‘em I’m raising up on the totem
Yeah, boilin' over, pot full of yola
Mix it with the cola, son of a block controller (Yeah)
Can't let 'em fuck me over (Nah) gotta keep my composure, look

Writin’ in my room ten years after that on stage like it’s too soon, but

Olu started to fight and then my moms broke it up
She said "This boy, he’s in the Navy, settle down before y'all need savin'"
Pop went to war around the world, came home, we celebrated
AWOL
Fast forward to when I started to play ball
From a place where we hate law
See the Jakes and we take off (Whoop whoop)
Hit the gate, I get home and take my chain off
Thankful I got through the day and all the evil I prayed off
Everything is cause and effect
Make the wrong moves in this business, you lose all your respect
My block is dark as it gets
We all make mistakes, only a few will recover from ‘em
Don’t spend your whole life runnin’ from ‘em, run up the numbers

Should've told ‘em I’m raising up on the totem
Yeah, boilin’ over, pot full of yola
Mix it up with the cola, son of a queen and a soldier
Can’t let ‘em fuck me over, gotta keep my composure, look
Keep your composure, on city blocks, and cell blocks
Keep your composure
Hold it down, hold it tight
Hold it close, hold space for yourself
It’s the way of the ancestors
Our elders, our artists, our OGs, our dreamers, our builders
With each breath internalize their successes
Their struggles, their sense of self, their sense of overcoming
And take that power forward through your life
Remind yourself of the magnitude of your good fortune
And the mere chance, one in billions, that you survived
That you will thrive
And even the strongest kings and queens bend, yet remain unbroken
Keep your composure
And believe in the magic of who we are
Because what you believe is everything
And what someone believes about you is nothing
Keep your composure, I am Shaka Senghor4Embed
Ayy Hit, how gon' lose with shit like this my nigga
Yea though I walk through the valley of infidels, suckers
Who adhere to sucker religions
Life’s a bible
We livin' in biblical times

Uh, first chapter
This chapter called "Men"
Given knowledge by the psychotic, the block was college
We don't add it up then that shit’ll leave us divided
It's sorta like Ten Commandments
I'm talkin' 'bout men and standards, I'm tryna reverse the damage
You boys obsessed with cameras, the debt we was handed
So many move like Judas, look at the past, it's proven
It's my duty to speak truth to power
I be feelin’ like it’s my fault
Around your enemies, then they call you before you hear about it
Talk to you like it's still love, keepin’ your vision clouded
Tryna get cool with guys 'cause you want 'em to choose sides
Campaignin' with the haters, dismissin’ truth for lies
Definition of a man, don't fold on the stand
For your soul, the exec' let you hold an advance
Don't be discouraged, just go with the plan
Gotta have faith in God's grace over the land
And I pray for the day when they lay down
And caged make their way up out that maze
Get their mind up out a daze
Too many mamas layin' flowers at they graves

Your jewelry could be cursed and so can your ride
Let that soak in your mind, Suburbans and Beamers
Shot up with Ninas, how to stop a young genius
Spiritual like a deep cut from Shirley Caesar
I wonder if it's Jesus when a baby reach up
Sharpenin' up myself 'cause I know they need us
My African skin gave me the passion to win (Ooh, ooh)
Yeah, prayin' this doesn't come to a tragic end (And I pray)

Third chapter
This chapter called "Women", y'all been the rib since the beginnin'
A woman's intuition, is what a man is missin'
To understand your wisdom is something I had to learn
Somehow you the most unprotected on planet Earth
Your smile lift me up and your eyes kiss my soul
Your sweetness is honeycomb, such a lovely tone
You hold the power to make a house a home
Because of you, I wanna right my wrongs (Love)
Kiss your mother 'cause we only get one (One)
A grandmother's words to her grandson
Beautiful minds develop in time (Yeah)
Checks every month 'cause you held me for nine
They might see an image of a woman who's flawed
But I see a woman in the image of God
Highest regards, I light a cigar
To men, women and children, my Bible is ours (Yeah)
Open it up, listen to it in anytime
That Revelations' vibe, get you through it
Ain't none of us perfect, I damn sure ain't
Prayin' this doesn't come to a tragic end
We just gon' hope for the best and do our best
And be our best, no less, yeah
Yo, I woke up this morning
Had to pray to God and thank Him 'cause I made it this far

Escobar season begins

Touch up the game like a photo edit
Camera roll like Oscar Michaeux, they gotta roll the credits
Like Rome came into Kemet and they stole the essence
Before they watered it down and taught us bogus lessons
Written in stone, write whatever in your history books
Me and ancient Egyptian skin tone had similar looks
On my trip out to Cairo, I felt home on arrival
I swam in the Red Sea, took a boat on thе Nile
It's in my blood to drive thesе cars and live this large
Escobar cigars avoiding the prison bars, Nas
I deserve the threads in my closet
Big boy deposits, Nike shares and stock tips
Catching up with those who had a head start
Used to get eviction notices that had a red mark
The lights was out, that's why we sip dark
Acting a fool at the pool in Queensbridge Park
Niggas would not survive in my hood
Pull up with all of my jewels on and Nas is good
Nas is good
My nigga, Nas is good

Ha, I love my hood so much, I go out in a blazing shootout
See I can't come out there, I'd throw it all away, fuck it

Somehow I got a cleanse, back in 2010
Department of Justice wrote me looking for one of my friends
I ain't know where he was at, didn't even have a hint
And even if I did, a nigga'll never snitch
Cheat code, I walked into my greatness
Freak hoes throw they pussy a party, okay then
Raised by a queen, that's the only reason I made it
King's Disease the reoccurrence, that shit reinstated

Death to the pessimistic mind state
Lack of hope low-spirit motherfuckers
Life to kings getting a king's ransom, living handsome, ha

I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it

But she rockin' with it

This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: "Nas, go and get your kid!"
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls
For my brothers with daughters, I call this

And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters

It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks

I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strapped
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God
Check the prognosis — is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin' — some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say "Peace!"
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

But I'ma lamp ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catchin' 3-to-9's, Muslims yellin' "Free the mind!"
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid, when I would say that outta town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind, plus control a 9
Fine, see, now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker

I told my brother Jung', "Fuck 'em, they gon' go through Hеll with us

Only thing undefeated is time
The second is the internet, number three is this rhyme
Before security, my dawg had to sneak in the nine
God must be on my side

Why would I ever have to cop a chain again
When the QB chain birthed most the chains in the game?
No post office was stampin' time
Took out a slice out of the Big Apple, made apple pies, family sized
Leather bombers and Nike Sacais
Dangerous corners, you better pray that tomorrow arrives
Rap Sugar Ray Robinson, nothin' sweet
Y'all too out of shape to even box with me
Heavyweight, I know my way around the ring
Just like shawty know her way around the store
Makin' hits with Hit-Boy, all he gotta do is hit record
Record breakin' news, had to show up just to fill a void
Confused spoiler, oh, boys, y'all better keep your poise
Leave me out of the weasel shit
Be cool when you see me, I'm higher than all that rap diva shit
The hood know you pussy so we don't buy or believe in it
Locked in on the instrumental, I took back the key to this, uh

Run me the keys, run me the Bs, run me that flow back
Your top three, I'm not number one, how could you post that?

Create with a business mind, I'm from where killers reside
A wild hood, only knew goons since my childhood
Niggas say anything in they raps 'cause it sound good
Don't even mean what they say, horrible outlook
Y'all ain't really 'bout this, house nigs
Y'all was in the house with it
We don't respect fake jewellery and silly outfits
Window down, blowin' out kush
Gray tints, New York's J Prince on Houston Street

I got that feeling, Lionel Richie, Dancing on the Ceiling
Hope it resemble a Van Gogh when you paint me the villain
The hate is real but you should know that the love is way realer
Crafty with a pen way before I could pack 'em in
Nasty with dreads, a slim teen, young, I was passionate
A brand new book cracklin' sound when you open, I'm writin' gems
I make gospel in the booth, it might sound likе I'm writin' hymns
Put designer with the Timbs, wow
Thеy wanna run with my style
40-16 Building bussin' 'em down
And the fiends was like employees bringin' customers 'round
Hurricane waters, niggas had dreams of flooding the town
Weather report lookin' rainy but I skate through it daily
In a new grey Mercedes, waterproof Jordan Laneys
I'm sizzlin', scorchin', handsomely how they gotta pay me

Niggas know what I came in this game with, I'm not a entertainer

Famous people sayin' they hate bein' famous, millionaires hate it
People take just to feel like they made it

The scars of martyrs, the path of bastard seeds
Effects of absentee fathers passed on with ease
Hope the babies eat healthier, and may we get wealthier
They was not givin', we ask for forgiveness, not permission
Whole clique is each other counsellor
Holdin' sticks without a hockey puck
Can't co-sign 'em, them niggas not with us
Hop on a private jet with twеlve tenants
Right when I land, thе chopper to Manhattan is twelve minutes
I put the "real" in "real nigga", that's on my momma though
Homie, you gotta feel me from Cali out to the Calliope
Slicker than Desi Arnez on my Copa Cabana flow
In Houston with a thick one eatin' at Pappadeaux
Shit, it was written, choppin' up competition
Palms itchin', Bohemian Grove couldn't get Nas to visit
I seen both ends of the ladder, ain't see no silver platter
Fiction don't even matter, we don't act for the cameras

Guess they used to the ego havin' head in the air
Hollywood gangsta, goons with 'em everywhere
I'm the opposite, smooth, not spreading fear
Silver spoons never fed Nasir
I'm on top and I surprise 'em
I'm on top and I surprise 'em

Flick out ashes, flip girls on a mattress
We get it crackin' without the attachments
Her and my heart is cold as Aspen, both of us laughin'
I put the "New" in "New York", I'm home
All of the watches stay on the Eastern time zone
Throwin' parties whenever I'm feeling godly
White linen parties for whenever we make a million dollars
"Nas think he too good to pull up on us"
See me at a baby shower with some OGs from Corona
Sippin' liquor, taking photos then I slid with a cougar
Coulda pulled a young love but I took who was choosing
Esco relaxed in the hood, I ain't come with a shooter
They asked what I'm doing, they said I was already proven
Who said I'm too comfortable around on my regular shit?
You know I'm a rare nigga but ghetto as shit

Guess they used to the ego havin' head in the air
Hollywood Gangsta, goons with 'em everywhere

Special like my classics

Won't let me pass it

I don't see the point with weak sayings like
"All them niggas on top be blocking," or never help, man, stop it
It’s hard watching brothers who smart but think they not
I need them to realize what they got is a fresh start
That brother that you claim so powerful
The one you said he has a whole lot of pull
Probably already tried to pull his brothers up
And got betrayed, got snaked, got played
Meanwhile he balance his challenges, hard to keep himself paid
It's so hard for him, even though his talent is God-given
Pardon him, stop putting your faults on him
What he did to you now?
The man in him is bringing the kid in you out
You kid him, he still playin' the victim, you weirdin' me out
That's what my perspective is, maybe 'cause I'm a specialist

Six figure checks are big, but eight figure checks and you rich

PS 111 had free lunch
Embarrassed but managed to get a plate...
We was kids hungry
Mom's working, I was famished
She getting home late...
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full or starve
Corner store like "Mister, spare-a-quarter"
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
Fifteen, I got a gun
Sixteen, I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them though, I just forgive them though

I remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth two hundred million now
Bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers
To take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

"Say YEAH!

1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him
I spread em, hit 'em and dead 'em
She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says, it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you're too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis, this goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha

42nd Street Terminal


Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it, my religion is reefer
Big money and the most uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothing is figurative
I can wish it into existing, God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointing to they scars like, right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply
Shattering your silence, passing round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife 'cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing
Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances
A soldier coming home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good 'cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash, huh

My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we pushed it, mush it
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem, Bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot
Staggering, drunker than them cops that 2Pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed reaching
Soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting
Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I, must be, something in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

This for my trapped in the 90s niggas
For my trapped in the 90s niggas

Uhh, rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you
It’s foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y’all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, eight street, twin buildings
Vernon, can’t even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for DU, say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh...

Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team on 118
My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(You all know how the story GO!)

"Any other real niggas in the world besides us?" I ask
Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you DU
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real OG 'cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now
But you know I'm still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling
Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling13Embed

DJ Hot Day...

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive?
Guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my millions
Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then it’s grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, says Einstein
It’s all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it
You'll call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I forced you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moët
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me Olu's son
Now he's Nas' father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener

Yo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don’t understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Don’t make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Ha ha ha

Lies and the pain
Betrayal, life

In danger’s face
Look what you’re facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn’t ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

Uhh, snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat
Stretched out, letter T, it's better to dead a beef
Than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand; what’s the options?
Only conclusion is shooting, bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the Feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous, asking myself what’s my purpose?
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can’t relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy

Has addictions that are sadistic, chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he’s into beastiality porn
And it’s wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high
So they find dough to mainline dope, and y'all know

The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me
So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that’s cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice that’s priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate cause he’s newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent, same time, premeditating
Murdering his ex wife; life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

Oooooooooooh-ahhhhhhhhh....
Ahhhhhhhh-ahhhhhh-ahhhhhh...ahhh..

Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet
Your stage was set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients
That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with Black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleaming, he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis and Halsey
Cop chocolate Thai, Vernon style and burn it down
My nigga Hype in the federal joint, verdict out
Twenty years getting money in the Dirty South
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yelling, "Free my nigga!"
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too
For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it

You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews

Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you?
I might kill you but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures
Through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to.. stay

Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo, I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool to ask?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I'd gallivant around the Equator, if that would get me off the radar

I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby

Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happened when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming
"Hate you so much right now"
Should've saw the meaning, angry black women
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)

'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)

Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet, the cuter version, yet, I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself, and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, we got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like "Ha, yo, look at my wife!"
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, then later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life, of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby guess what...

I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) Forever

Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition?
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was suckers, cowards
Under their breath, saying, "Why did Nas trust her?"
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even a lie
At least I can say I tried, plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again, it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)

You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby
Gimme the key back, baby
I want your love back, baby, oh
Gimme the key back, baby, oh
'Til we make love just one more time
Make it seem forever
This is our last and final goodbye

I pull a string on the lamp and shit darkens
I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment
Proletarian chicks sparking
Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy, looking at the stars and
Alky on the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling
Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving nogging
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining Olive Garden
Nah bitch, Nas is in the real deal
Food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
Rolexes, synonymous shit I'm copping
Ask her has she been around duffle bags
Full of that fuck you cash
Get off the jet with me in heels, I'll cup your ass
Looking in my eyes saying "Nas, you're one lucky bastard"
Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying past ya

Get humbled or disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks, you must wanna die
But you fronting, why? When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about, I'm a fucking juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up
Who don't speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet's a (?), and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami
Time-pieces are from Zurich
It’s like I'm allergic, to Nonoxynol 9
Give it to you raw so you can feel it9Embed

Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more

I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any fuck time either
Hefner minded like I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge, 'cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date -- Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean

You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song, you want to kill 'em, right?
You resent me every time I make a million, right?
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar
Just like a rose

At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel
Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless
Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic
Stroll up in the party: titanium black card
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
You 16, you could do 20, come home young
Catch 20 years when you 40? Homes, you're done
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies
A 360 in the streets real grizzly
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
This ain't The Truman Show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?

Love, I'll trade you love

Roll that up

Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think
It's crazy how many brothers come where I come from
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
"Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous"
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle
Now we having babies, 'cause growing up it was just us
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
The G is in your genes, already you tuck
Inherit your dad's swag, his George Jefferson's strut
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist
Corona sipper, pass it, I'ma blow it with you
It ain't The Truman show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
Young brother go and get your paper, I got love
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung, without love?
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul

It's like a cold story.. repeated over and over
In the winters of my mind, yeah
This shit be real, man..
Shit's crazy out here..
Yo yo, yo what up y'all?
That's my niggas over there, word

If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'
'Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli
Who that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me
It’s a lesson every premonition
Lot of niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen

She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more
It’s old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
It’s quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names
I wonder, will it change? Let's ride…

A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin' the word "fresh" and then starin' at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it

Know Nas still here to remove the wall that I'm back against
Legitimized all your hustles before the gavel hit (Oh)
It takes more than love
It takes wakin' up early to face the moment debatin’
Should I save it or blow it? I mean it's only some paper
None of my neighbors too nosy, the Joneses ownin' some acres
To be the greatest is lonely but it chose me, I take it
Whatever the case may be, I'm out of space, OD
NASA without the A at the end, take off on three
What's the cost of a CD when fifteen-hundred places one sell?

Phone calls from the feds, long stories told fast
Wishin' they’d get home in a hurry 'cause we the last
Of a dyin' pack of lions, nightmares of the cast
Thoroughbred survivin’, you know (Queens in the house)

Welcome home Ronnie Bumps, and love to Corley
That boss ordered us lobster tails late night in forty
We was out there tryna rid the strеss
Had a beat tape from Stretch
Rеst, black TEC, black vest to match the dark aura
We hit the city deep in the Explorer, lookin' at The Source
Wish I was the cover story that was comin' shortly
Cars back then had raw packed in
Rest in peace a few good men, the god Starkim (Queens in the house)
I pop a bottle, we not promised tomorrow
Showin' love is the motto
Flex a cowboy hat, strapped like Desperados
They ain't let one out the chamber, no iron fired
In a vegetative state when that man China died
Stomped out on 12th Street, memory fails me
Heard homie was a real G, that's what they tell me
I was the one to run through the functions, no funny actin'
And it was me in that introduced many to Money Bags and (Queens in the house)
Grandmaster Vic (Queens in the house)

Host a party up at Starlets, they know Queens in the house
No beef or rivals, they playin’ "Ether" on TIDAL
Brothers can do anything when they decide to
In a Range Rover, dissectin’ bars from "Takeover"
Sometimes I text Hova like "Nigga, this ain't over", laughin’
I had to hold it down for Queens, 'cause I over-value fiends
Shout to Brooklyn, all between, hoods be overlappin'
Subways be stacked and I ain't been on a train in decades
And I can still hear the wheels on the tracks (Queens in the house)
Feel the beat breaks, serial defaced for Jakes
A license to carry still ain’t safe in New York State
It's still a lot of ways to manage the life expectancy average
The future of our next generation ain't been established
Conflicted by some of the same patterns that had us
Money and social status, tell me what really matters
So who are you when they turn off all the cameras?
With me, you know the answers (Queens in the house)
Go ask Tony Bennett (Queens in the house)
Terrace on the park, they gotta know (Queens in the house)
DJ Clue, Envy and Camilo (Queens in the house)
Where are my most beautiful queens in the house?
When you see me at awards or a popular place
I see chains shinin', I want a stocking over my face
Coordinated, try to seat me by some popular names
For a second, I'm on some shit like it was back in the days
When dudes would really put that thing up to your rib cage
And pull a switchblade, do anything, it's the 'Bridge way
But I go stu', roll through, just sold out the O2
Piece on my neck in a Hi-Tech Polo suit (Queens in the house)
Drove down Van Wyck, Colosseum and Stan Smiths

Eardrums de-virginized from the words of mine (Mine)
Just a word of advice, you can't murder Nas (Nas)

Elеment surprise, move with the passion of Christ (Christ)

To Portofino, sittin' high in the cliff
From a younger dude with a crew and we was workin' the shift
Y'all South Park cartoon characters, I'm convinced
They never been scared to death while stayin' calm in a twist
I creeped in a jean jacket, headband and Nikes
I ain't like to dodge fights, as I rode my bike
And I was lookin' at these people, thinkin' they just might
Make me come out my cool character, break through the smooth barriers
Go crazy, CeeLo Green, Gnarls Barkley
Before I even pull to the spot, they try to park me
I'm used to dark scenes, that's why I spark green
Why I pour wine, they don't stock these, I gotta order mine
Malcolm X departed at the Audubon
Seen so many slaughtered I'm numb, never mortified
All-black Audemars, you claim yours was one-of-one
We timepiece monsters, every season, we be on the hunt
Jeepers creepers, America's a baby that's teethin'
Shittin' on itself, cryin' for it's next feedin'
As odd as it gets, it's not even a toddler yet
Gang members got nothin' on these congressmen
Plus Ray Liotta and James Caan died
Iconic actors who were redemption for these mob guys
We easin' on down the road for the third win
Who's bad? It's up and it's stuck, feel the whirlwind
Like young Quincy Jones, stuck outside the club
'Til Ray Charles snuck him in, ah, to be young again

Nasty like Mike on the vocals, I overdub it (Shamone)

Money attract money, statewide hustlers
Jewelry sellers exposed by these fake watch bustеrs

Young warriors, I wanna see thеm all in position
Best to have it on you, hope you don't go down for possession
Mom's puttin' up the house to bail you out when arrested
How did I become number one? I'm one-of-one
Flyin' down the 101, right under the Cali' sun
Junior M.A.F.I.A. out the subs, shorty calling me "Son"
If one clique make a million today, it probably be us

I grew up around weed smoke, just like the Marleys
Heard my Mom whenever she spoke, they havin' parties
This the 70's, of course Donna Summer's voice
Me, I'm in some holey but clean undershorts on the bed tryin' somersaults
And when summer starts, you hear a hundred shots
Steppin' over empty liquor bottles I come across
Scented stickers that smell like what's in the picture
Was just a kid but I stayed away from the sniffers
We knew better, we knew how to see a setup
Just wanted to be some players pull up in a Jetta
From the Census Bureau they put up a killer's mural
It's a different world with thirty shot clips that curl, melon popped
Like John Fitzgerald with his girl in a drop
If he can get hit, then anybody can get got
And you a easy target, see you never know who watchin'
Cold hearted monsters, whole city going bonkers

Ain't nobody recession proof (Recession proof)
Invest in you, that's what it's best to do (Best to do)

'Cause Jung hid his jumb's in the building
And I peeped him, I was low so I stole 'em and sold 'em while he was sleepin'
Re-up, gave it back with interest, we even
Some of these things that we escape, I can't believe it
Knicks game up in the seats, I barely hit the floor
Not tryna sit across from somebody lady I hit before
Top of fourth quarter, I skate, hit the liquor store
Lambo Aventador, Maybach with a minibar
Met a girl from Senegal, told her 'bout Medgar Evers
While combin' through Louis sweaters, we spinnin' and savin' letters, G's and M's

My comfort give you discomfort
Just know that in the hood, they gon' bump this
And I'm only strong as my circle
The things that shaped me would've murked you

I didn't have to die so that they could call me the great one
Didn't take a couple albums, people said it from day one
From wings with hot sauce to tuna tartare, driven in RRs
From hidin' from robbery victims in back of cop cars
Tatted from my neck to abdomen
Almost gettin' shot was averagin' once every two weeks
Blessed what I had to been
These painful words, hearing these liars puttin' my name in dirt
Aim and I burst, pistol practice until my fingers hurt
I hit my target, uh, I up the margin
What they on? You know how Nas do, don't get me started
Chic, sleek and snazzy from a small family
Fine taste and I hate the unsatisfactory
We can gun blast or party, Great Gatsby theme
Bring your first ladies or come with your new nasty thing

'Cause what we doin' right now is really lit

When you high as me, you get highly critiqued
Hopped on a beat, purposefully soundin' like '9-3
None quite like me, so haters can S-M-D
When they bitter like black liquorice, my life still sweet
I went for the cash grab, crack cash was my math class
Fresh white tee, two diamond crosses look like a hashtag
News is fake, never knew I'd soon relate
To Tom Brady goin' for seven in Tampa Bay
It's that crazy, I ain't never been bothered, that bothered you
You ain't born for this shit, being great is too hard for you
That's a hater problem, they try to say it first what you might say about 'em
While you stuck in the past, I stay vibin'
Can't just reminisce only, gotta live in the moment
Talked my shit at the MOMA with The Weeknd performin'
I'm chosen, got off the big Boeing in Rick Owens
Rick owe us, peep how different it look on us
My comfort give you discomfort
Just know that in the hood, they gon' bump this

Those things were great man but today what we doin' is next level
And I don't like to reminisce (That was then, this is now)
'Cause what we doin' right now is really lit (It's about right now)
The things that shaped me would've murked you

Trippin' on 'em, spinnin' corners
Distant times, I reminisce on 'em
Reminisce, and my past ain't the prettiest
There was a time they wasn't feelin' us
Mass Appeal, now we really up
Reminisce, relationships ain't the prettiest
I was stuck on the silliness, was it love that I was really in?
We don't know until it really end, but then it's too late, reminisce
Reminisce2Embed
Uh
Woke up this morning on some white linen sheets
The bed almost caught ablaze
The temperature's one hundred in the room
I'm like "What's up?"

Still got the same flame behind me from the "Hate Me Now" video
It's continual, all I need is a beat and I'm stitchin' you
Like stitchin' these words together, how I'm still getting better
I'm finding more gold as I dig in the dirt with a shovel
I got the last laugh, don't get blown away by the backdraft

(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm on firе) Don't be scared now

(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm, I'm on fire) I'm givin' 'em hell now

Tryna walk in my soles is like bare feet on hot coals
Soon as I start heatin' up, the whole block froze
I came in without an ordinary name, how many Nasirs?
How many top tier? How many not here?
There's something in the name that's different from theirs
Depicted in scripture holdin' two dragons blowin' flames
Sorry it ain't go the same for y'all
They say Allah, please explain Allah
You Godbody or do you praise Allah?
And still rock crosses all on your chain a lot
I'm scorchin' and I never forced it
Even when forces and powers that be went against me
Y'all use that as an excuse, you dudes cannot convince me
Or trick me out my spot, y'all want my shit like Sherman Hemsley
I'm debunking the blackball myth, the facts more or less
I might hurt your feelings but, yo, sometimes it actually is
Victimization, mix that with some entitlement
It's bound to explode
I make 'em stop, drop, and roll, move to the side with it

They become cowards, they cut the tough guy shit
When they arrest, when they come cuff your kids
They give us criminal records, because of where we live
And the money is low, and narcotics are thriving
It's evil, we diagnosed with something that's untreatable
Feel powerless so brothers only have beef with you
So you on your murder shit 'cause that's what you see them do
Well, let me tell you somethin'
Many go on GBG, Get Back Gang, who gon' rest in peace?
In this land, twenty-three million layers
All we have is some givers and some takers
Have some good souls and bad souls
Some humble people, some assholes, slow like watchin' the grass grow

There's a place in heaven for her, as is you
And if you don't believe in that, then slatt
Go where you going, be where you at, no hugs, speakin' or dap

Nintendo Duck Hunt, I ducked police, I had to run
Meanwhile, when you get old, you might become futile
My old style is a rough of my new style
My old girl dope but I love my new girl
So when I'ma slow down this merry go round called life?
I was a youngster with a fever, moms brought cold ice

And I was young, scared, she ain't care, she made me fight
Fifty-two sweep you haymaker right
When I get old, I hope that I can stay this fly
Once a man, twice a child
From mama's boy to preschool to college to now employed
Now you on, got your first crib, she's having your firstborn
Went from buying the finer toys with your boys
To buying toys for your boy
It's crazy how fast he's growing for sure
Grandpops, he told me ‘bout his days of old
One day I'll be him on the porch, sippin' on something cold
And it stuck with my soul, I been divided at the road
Hot-headed as a youngster, confronted, I might unload
Now listen, knowledge I received as a seed, as a G
That would feed my personal frequency
Transcends through all, travel through walls
My ministry we ain't know we was livin' hazardous
Savages, first niggas in New York with Bentleys
Tyson, Kedar, Puff, Stoute and then me

The soul is different than the flesh is, life is teachin' me more
Wisdom and ignorance is kin, to have peace, you need war
By the time you see the stars in the skies, they already burnt out
Same way these dudes be shinin' but been burnt out
But we don't change, as we get stuck in our ways
We just act like we agree so we can end the exchange
What's meant for you is sent to you
But you could be the problem, it's not always them my dude
Was she crazy before you met her or you made her crazy?
Possibly she gon' be a nurse when you back to a baby
Once a man, twice a child
Strong motherfucker when you're young (Uh)
I ducked a razor, ducked some punches, even ducked a gun
Nintendo Duck Hunt, I ducked police, I had to run
Meanwhile, when you get old, you might become futile
My old style is a rough of my new style (Wild)
My old girl dope but I love my new girl
So when I'ma slow down this merry go round called life?
I was a youngster with a fever, moms brought cold ice

And in the streets I had agility, was quick to strike
My fear's not seeing it coming, got too rich for that sight
So take advantage of your youth before you elderly
'Cause today is the youngest that you will ever be2Embed
Ladies, fellas
I know some of the most intelligent women in the world is listenin’ right now
And all the realest brothers is like, uh

Get light with it
Day party to midnight with it
Ice wet like a fire hydrant hit it
While the girls double dutch, I double my digits
Dice game pop, peace and one love to my niggas
New York, New York
All sorts of bosses who walk the walk
Look how long the blocks is, ruthless
Close range they shoot shit

Wall Street, racquetball, oysters, masseuses
Bourgeoisie, the mood y'all be
Then it's back to the hood where you knew I'd be
Driver's license and the face card, two IDs
Get light off the Rosé (Uh) bottle we sip
New shorty in my life, she my lottery pick
And if the economy slips, she gon' ride with the kid
City Girl like JT, M-I-A to the Bridge

ATVs, quads with speed
Doin' wheelies, black Lanvin sneaks
Family first, a holiday feast, I constantly seek
Moments like this is peace to say the least
We used to play ball, when girls watched, we played smoother
I had to try to be like Mike, a cool three-point shooter
Couldn't be the loser, takin' Gatorade from the cooler
Summer, fall, winter, New York girls smokin' hookah
Grown ladies with Mercedes Benz keys and chimneys
Friendly as little kids on ten-speeds
Makes me want to have another seed, I'm simply
Gettin' light on the track, Ripley's
Believe it or not, I'm still the cream of the crop
I was just the tender age of eighteen on the charts
Wasn't even dreamin' this far, believe who you are
The sun doesn't even know it's a star
Get light with it
Day party to midnight with it
Ice wet like a fire hydrant hit it
While the girls double dutch, I double my digits
Dice game pop, peace to my hustlin' niggas
New York, New York

Long range they shoot shit

First time
Yeah, I think we gon' call this one the First Time
Brucie B voice

First time you heard Nas
Was you earlin' on some gut rot liquor on 2-5
Or your big brother put you on like surprise
Hearing my hood described
So vivid, you could see it by closing your eyes
Maybe it was the age or the letters I wrote
When jail letters were hope
You read the credits and you saw Large Pro
Or some decrepit club where DJ S&S had buzz
I stеpped on the stage with impеrfections
I was messing up or her first time
Inside a Subaru, she just had a feud with her boo
They drivin', he put on Barbeque and I got through to you
A dude who I saw rockin' FUBU outside Papaya's
Told me Halftime was timeless while Armor All'n his tires
I was tryin' to juggle Columbia Records
While dealin' with what the country Colombia jungles had left us
First time you heard of Nas, I pro'ly was under some pressure
Gun in the dresser while you was baggin' up in the kitchen playin' my records
You might also like
Your first time was you hittin' the gas
In the whip with some ass, you never hit and she passed
Your real music test to know if she into the ad-libs
Real rap shit, yeah

First time you heard Nas
You probably heard somebody say that I pick bad beats
But I pick bad freaks
Narratives they runnin' with, the classics they comin' with
Ain't fuckin' with what I recorded last week
For new guys, hope this the first time you heard Nas
It's a special moment, a million reasons I wrote it
My shit'll get you re-centered 'cause you can tell where my soul is
The one I'm chosen, like Bryce and Bronny, their Pop ball
So they had to do it, my dad did music, I had to pursue it
And spread my wings on the helipad like Troop did
The truth is, a similar thing had happened to me
I listen to Wayne, I listen to G, I listen to Dre, I listen to me
Since when did rap leave me so suspended in air?
Since Kendrick entered the atmosphere, '09, I was there
On La Cienega
My nigga from L.A. said there's a nigga from Black Hippy
I was happy to just witness history
Like the first time I heard Slick Rick
How did you feel? (First time you heard Nas)
First time hearing Biggie
I'm like, "Who's this kid? Wow" (First time you heard Nas)
When I heard Pac
That was on that song with, uh, Digital Underground like (First time you heard Nas)
Yeah, that was crazy
I really hope that this your first time

It's somethin' bout
First time hearing your favorite artist
Or they become to be your favorite artist after like a long time or
Or it's instantaneous like
I know when the first time I heard Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye
Diana Ross, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder
Like, N.W.A., what the fuck is this shit, kid?
I was goin' crazy2Embed
It's like y'all can't do nothin' without me
Everything be going good, but then y'all pull me in
And mess everything up
Why y'all always let me win? Hahaha (Uh)

I be tryna find the best way they can stop me cold
Another body and guess who the cause and why they foes?
Beef is my name, my story is age old
Some question why do I always come to take souls?

I'm everywhere in the hearts of men
Jealousy and envy my right hands, them is my mans
I'm what happens on mad blocks, I'm the jabs taken in talks
The arguments between the women in the crab leg spots
That behind the back shit, complex and multifaceted
Lesson to the real, I be decimal, subtracting shit
The devil is a lie, I could confuse a genius
Have him movin' real dumb over nothin' at my convenience
When empires fall over women, I am the reason
USA and Al-Qaeda, I'm the tension between 'em
I'm the words that get misinterpreted
I'm the get back, I'm the first to hit, I'm the worst of it
Lurkin' on your premises, I am your nemesis
Parents of every slain rapper wish I didn't exist
But I'm alive and I thrive on your ignorance
I'm a thousand-foot fence that keep you from getting rich
Get around me

I'm the invasion of personal space
Fake smiles on your face, it's certain I'm hate
All that internet beef, that shit a virgin to me
I been here before the Bible, it's murder I speak
The energy creepin' 'round the blocks and the streets
Took his guys with him shoppin', they side-eyeing to please
Everybody's impossible, it don't stop in the Ps
I'm eternal, I'm everywhere the action at
I'm always where the guns are blazin', attractin' that
The grimiest places is my natural habitat
In all the jails and all the parties I be
Drive-bys where kids get killed accidentally
That's the type of shit they try to pin to me
Tragic situations give me my identity
And beef cut off the fat, that sizzle in grease
Love to many deceased over me, beef
I be tryna find the best way they can stop me cold
Another body and guess who the cause and why they foes?
Beef is my name, my story is age old

People got me in some shit everyday
Over this, over that
Over nothing, over something
Either way, it's on

Why it's always gotta be resortin' to me?
I ain't asked for this power, it's torture, it forced me to see
People drainin' themselves, some pull off some horrible deeds
Rumors turnin' into a monster, lies always mislead
By the time you hear what somebody said, it's stretched out
They expanded it, made it worse, now you all stressed out
You wish you got it straightened out, but it's too far gone
From "Who Shot Ya?" to "Hit Em Up", the 2Pac song3Embed

Am I snitching when the police commissioner my friend?
Am I a player when me and the mayor hang and tap in?
Just a grown man tryna see how to change the community
'Cause all I see is mama's crying, reading eulogies
Thinking 'bout, everything her baby could've grew to be
Speaking unity for years, but face scrutiny
He weird, one day Esco be rapping 'bout shootin' me
Next day he say "And I can", he been confusin' me
Don't wet that
I advise you to mind, I don't just rap
Look around every town like a deathtrap
Out his mind, put a nine to his neck tat
And it went plat-plat, now we set back
And I'm scratchin' my head under my Mets cap

And most of these guys are supposed to have male tendencies

You are your own cure for your King's Disease

Used to play McGruff, freestyles on cassette
Patties and cocoa bread, skunk trees from the dread
While the D's and the Feds watching
Before New York had Bloods, before L.A. had Suge
Before the South had Percy Miller or Thug
I was home reading a book, top speed, probably a blunt
A can of Sprite, and a chopped cheese, now it's hamachi

Tired of picking up clothes, I got a personal shopper

I'm done with star chicks, I survived divorces
I ain't have to climb back, I just climbed in Porsches (Thirty, uh, uh)
Uh, I ain't have to climb back, I just climbed in Porsches

The villainized, but I feel free and the field be
Crazy way before the drill beef
Doesn't matter this is sheer relief, I feel the breeze this is
Superhero material, rap star status
Premier album still might happen
I wonder why Pete Rock would act like that
That type of behavior make me give rap right back (Thirty)
And now I can't tell if all the good that I did's bein' hid with they agenda again, nigga

Divide the profit by 4, subtract it by 8, we back to 16
Now add the other 2 that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki, then that's more for me
Mad coke and mad leak
Plus a 500, cut in half is 250
Now triple that — times 3, we got three quarters of another ki

Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows (Yeah)
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one (Right)
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jammin' up the border to this game stop, and I side with the Lord (Uh)
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors (That's right)
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks (You tried?)
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' 'em up (That's what you hate)
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just inferior man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

(Yeah) (It won't stop)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (It won't stop) ever in your life (You can hate me) (Never!)

One .44, two .45's
Three loaded clips, four niggas roll, one nigga drives
Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes

Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?

Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?

Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet
Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go, Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
"Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?"
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, "In this scam, do I even stand a chance?"
He killed the hoes, took all they dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
"Put your gun down, we can skip town"
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?

Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck!"
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

"Nasty Nas—"439Embed

Ayo, Queens get the money, niggas still screaming, paper-chasing
Where presidential candidates is planning wars with other nations
Over steak with Masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters
They daddies faceless
Play this, by your stomach, let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it
Tell him his name Nasir, tell him how he got here
Mama was just having fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hating
Talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming
He'd rather floss with diamonds
They pray "Please God, let him spit that 'Uzi in the army lining'
That 'shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wops in the park reclining'"
Take 27 emcees, put 'em in a line and they're out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement
Hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic
Gets rich but dies rhyming
This is high science
Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more
I'm over their heads like a bulimic on a seesaw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gon' bow holmes, this Dow Jones
.80 cal chrome, needed time alone to zone
The mack left his iPhone and his nine at home
My queen used her milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This that "nigga" shit that's on the album
For them niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life, back into the embryo
Let us make man in our image, spit it
I'm Huey P in Louis V

And for those who want my position
You gotta step inside a time machine, come back with a vengeance
You should go study my analytics
I shouted people on verses that ain't deserve it
When it's turf shit, I stand on business
Shout to the ones at home, I gave passes
Could've been a lot of graves full of caskets
Damn, I'm a good guy
For that I think I'm blessed more
All these Fredos could've been added to the death score

Never backwards, stupid, here's another classic
C-notes is fallin' from the sky, by now the credits roll
They're starrin' Nas, executive poet, produced, directed by
The Kid slash Escobar, narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to survive
The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin' the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin', soft in the background
Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door, all of us poor
I learned the difference 'tween the snitches
The real ones, and who's soft, and the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumpin' from roofs
Shotguns pumpin', made it through my youth
Walkin' very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walkin' through the hot desert searchin' to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning, nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in The Matrix
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan, it's the rap–repo man

I finally see
See what it all mean
Yeah

The feelin' of the first time seein' your name on a flyer
It just was yesterday, picture that on the day you retire
And they still shocked and amazed, I made it up higher
'Cause I came up with them hotheads that played with the fire

Product of the '80s, Prada Milan store for the lady
I'm a carnivore, constantly come with concepts to pay me
I'm responsible for they most cockiest behavior
My DNA in they G-ed up ways, and they surveyin' us
Showed 'еm my scrotum is golden, rap game stomach was swollen
I lеft these bastards on your doorsteps, behold 'em
Ideas come and go away but I already thought 'em
So years later, they still new when I go record 'em
I done hooked up with a beast, never stingy with the beats
Experimental, accident records wind up killin' the streets
"Black and Proud" shirts, white Jesus pieces on cuban links
Civil war chick, yo, she black and white on Egyptian sheets

And I can see the jealousy, I think they really scared of me
Do what I do and let it be
And that's the way I always been since I was seventeen
I finally see what this all really means

Did a double album when rap double albums was startin'
They bootlegged I Am, an album I put my heart in
Nipsey met me to do a doc about it 'fore he departed
He talked to Stoute about it too 'cause he was 'part of that project, yeah
Back then, we charted with the CDs and tapes
And I still come out the field, you either scrape or get scraped
You either in and out, you rollin' or you just in the way
What this all really means, I had to reload the Drac'
Eighty years old, I'm still gon' have a chain, a kilo it weigh
Speedos on the beach, my belly out when I land in Capri
Wearin' black owned designer (Uh) math on my mind (Okay)
It's a while 'fore I get there, almost passed forty-nine
I be on the block easy with a glass full of wine
Red Chrome Heart lenses to see I'm in my third prime
The Q-U double E-N-S
Y'all gon' need some EMS when we drop this and that's a bet

The feelin' of the first time seein' your name on a flyer
It just was yesterday, picture that on the day you retire
And they still shocked and amazed I made it up higher
'Cause I came up with them hotheads that played with the fire (It's facts)

And I can see the jealousy, I think they really scared of me
Do what I do and let it be (Uh)
And that's the way I always been since I was seventeen
I finally see what this all really means
It's everything, from the hard times
(I finally know what this all really means)

Hardest shit since Rakim and Eric B

Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
I murder niggas on wax and forget where they buried
This the hardest shit since Rakim and Eric B
Or pistols on your album cover just like BDP

Single mothers on that EBT just tryna feed they seeds
Scammers and boosters livin' nice off of EDD
CCTV, all the cameras'll shoot ya
Soon as you let a shot off, it'll damage your future
It's some thugs in the hood that could have been hoopers
Some good girls who turned bad who could have been super-
-Models, some Dominicanos in Cabo
Some with the bloodlinе of Lagos, Lagos
So many stones in my hand just like Thanos
Eat Italiano, grazie, prеgo
Vibe to my music out in Prague, FaceTime, me and Haas
It feel good to feel alive, think I just had a breakthrough

I know the light is bright but keep on watchin' me
I know the light is bright but keep on watchin' me
I'm stolen property, kickin' the flavor to society

Man, this the hardest shit since DPG, Kurupt and Daz
Nate Dogg on the hook, Dr. Dre on the track
This melody be takin' me back but we pushin' it forward
187 on rappers, N-A-S, I'm a poet
At times, I get confused, they lie in they interviews
Get goose pimples whenever I'm puttin' on my jewels
Bailed so many brothers out, paid all they lawyer fees
After that, some turned they back, where is the loyalty?
Money's lovely but I could care less who has more than me
I'm just happy Mutulu Shakur got free
May he rest in peace, he was a warrior all of his days
And time move faster the more you get up there in age
In other news, I'm a G to the grave
I know they wanna see me burned out, depleted and drained
High blood pressure, instead I'm on a red page
My pupils are dilated, I throw on some dark shades

Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
I murder niggas on wax and forget where they buried
This the hardest shit since Rakim and Eric B
Or pistols on your album cover just like BDP
I'm MC Shan with an Uzi
Pistols on your album cover just like BDP
To the hardest artists out there, hard
Pistols on your album cover (Blaow)
Boogie Down Productions
I remember I put Tupac onto that Henny
Howard University, Howard Homecoming, D.C.
He's like, "What's this?"
(I know the light is bright but keep on watchin' me)
He drank that shit though, word
Crazy, super hard, fact, facts, super facts
(I know the light is bright—)
Yeah, uh, pistols on my album cover, nigga, blaow
(I know the light is bright but keep on watchin' me)
Let's go, yeah (I—, I know the light—)
Peace to Mutulu, I'ma get at these dudes though (Light—)

History revisionists, they put themselves where they didn't dwell
I was there, saw them almost shit themselves
Walked in the club one day, the pistol fell
I gripped my belt, shit was real
Back then when I used to ship a mil' out the gate
Different world, digital scales to record sales
A symposium with my bros and 'em
That mean we kick it with official bros
My journey was great but difficult, what is life if it isn't both?1Embed
Yep, I need money every day
Like a junkie need heroin, you know what I'm sayin'?
And I'm a junkie, and that's my fix, money
You know what I'm sayin'?
I need it every day

Nas like the Nazca Lines, can only be seen from up high
Only the true understand me but I see 'em as family
I saw the shit when I was fourteen, I counted on it
I was born a don with a powerful poignant style they wanted
Never dissing for clout, y'all know what this about
Niggas tryna deflect from the fact people sort of fizzle out
The people saw them try to make hit songs that went wrong
This about the money, right? 'Cause all that shit done been gone
Let's throw a nickel at the wishing well rappers
Watch it sink to the bottom, and I wish 'em all happiness
I'm in the cut, attention needers need to front, see 'em front
The world watching 'em shine, that's all they want
And I always get my cut, imagine that making you mad
I'm just a real version, they don't make 'em like that
Never had to get the youth to relate for the bag
And since they smarter than us, they know Nas was once they age
Made they pay grade, the youngster phase
Same mistakes though times have changed
Trying not to touch the cage but touch interior
In the front is the trunk, that's the custom carrier
Let's play a game, I hand you a king of diamonds
The hand is faster than the eye, check in your pocket
I snap my fingers, I'm up in smoke like The Chronic
Disappear and reappear right in front of your optics

Slow it down, let's, let's slow it down

Upon closer inspection
They really are non-threatening, I bomb first then I stretch 'em
Instigators causing these problems, that's why I question
Everything and everybody that's aiming in this direction
That's why I sound like I been spending time at the SPA
Thinkin' 'bout the days I first heard I Became a Star
Words from my A&R, I'm noticing that they notice me
Gun and a mean mug and was slow to speak
Now I hold meetings over cold sake and kobe beef
Hockey jersey, a hoodie underneath
Set up the trust, support the trustee
Corporations is the modern day custies
My flow is the hard substance, mastered it, Bernie Grundman
The stove top and oven, my company going public
I see the puppets, they moving like they the judges
But Nas and all his subjects is hard for you to catch up with
Let's slow it down

I might be moving at lightspeed
I landed icy in Iceland to sightsee
This long mink gon' be pricey
I might perm up my shit like I'm Ice-T
American pimp, I'm on timing
Only thing that I pimp is this rhyming
I made that work for me back since the '90s
That's a daily affirmations to remind me
I might be moving at lightspeed
To do what I'm doing's unlikely
This new urgency's perfectly hurting 'em
Send these suckers to emergency nightly

I know some goofies that wanna scalp me, ouch
Wipe out my accounts, leave me needin' mouth-to-mouth

Bars hittin' like I'm still livin' couch-to-couch
Motivation for the trappers livin' ounce-to-ounce
This is rockstar status, Neil Young with a bounce
I know that make you uncomfortable and make you say, "Ouch"

The snub nose like the Colombos and Bonannos
Rum in the cup holder
Hittin' bumps and spill on the sandals and car panels
I drew attention with artistic vision
Make an incision like Alonzo did to Joshua in Jason's Lyric
I think I caught the holy spirit, I put my soul in lyrics
Closed casket and we know who did it
E-S-C-O, I'm in the pole position, yo, she chose this pimpin'
Put the pain inside the music 'cause I know they listenin'
'Member I sat on Kool G Rap couch
Drank Olde E 'til we coulda blacked out
He pulled the track out, thinking 'bout what to rap 'bout
Snappin' like Chrisean and Blueface
Tradin' bars with the gods 'til they get the screwface
Ouch, I know that's painful like playin' hoops and sprain your ankles
Or gettin' robbed for your Jésus, your girl ain't stay true
That shit'll hurt you like a K do
Being crossed by your homie, wow he ain't the same dude
I'm bent off good wine like Bokeem Woodbine
Home readin' a script, lightin' up from a good line
Not no cocaine, this that crack though
She asked for my passcode, she got what she asked for (Ouch)

Could never say goodbye, I let my skill cry
Let my soul bleed, inside a Rolls, wearing rosaries
Homie, I lovе the new NY 'cause I'm thе new NY
And the old NY at the same time (Same time)
I always hit the last shot when it's game time (Game time)
The Jordan, Kobe, 'Bron talk, take a long walk
You might start to understand what I'm puttin' on for (On for)
I left more flows in Pro Tools sessions
Than you ever thought of with old school methods
But what you're hearin' is the present day
Over breaks and samples of New York, NWA
The brand new Brand Nubians, N-A-S and Wayne
Don't threaten me with a good time, we here to stay
Nasty, they don't make 'em like me
Mask up, all black like I'm Pooh Shiesty, truth too
I'm like Detroit Red in a zoot suit, loose screws
Any great challenges, I find a loop through
Loopholes, why they treat me so bad, Club Nouveau, damn

We need to read the guidelines, instead of readin' the timelines
Where everybody like lyin', nobody flow like mine
I'm sonnin' these niggas, got me coachin' niggas like Prime
Tongue, I never bite mine, got dough like Taekwon'
To spend all this money, I'ma have to spend a lifetime
You broke, can't even buy time, should throw niggas a lifeline
You know money on my mind, and I be on your wife mind
I hit her with the pipe bomb, then pass her down the pipeline
But actually, we quite fine
Diamonds on me sparklin' and splashin' like some white wine
They love me in the night time, they hate me when the light shine
Shots, I got a hundred, and problems, I got ninety-nine
Bugatti Veyron, take off with no flight time
Bad bitch on the passenger side, she don't even like flyin'
Booty soft as nylon, you niggas small as micron
I got a Black nina that get nasty as a white blonde
Low credit, high crime, open mind, tight rhymes
When they hear my lines, these rappers gotta catch up like Heinz
Weezy and my slime Nas, ain't nobody like ours

Lobster sauce on aprons, pardon, that's the chef
Burgundy on the breath, uncertainty when I step
Dancin' to every song like it's a contest
Singin' to Stevie Wonder Happy Birthday
Celebratin' years of flows and crazy wordplay
Seasoned, I'm leavin' my forties, I'm a griot
Deep as Deepak Chopra, dress socks and loafers
Family only, I'm holdin' hands with a cold piece
Bow to the old me, I'm officially OG

One come through the front, one leavin' out the side door
Potential — but what's potential if all are missin' the mental?
And what you been through could mess up now what you into
Got the essentials to murder an instrumental
Made it to Gen Z, deservin' what they extend to you
Talkin' to the younger you
Every stage problems'll still run to you
That big age you rap, you did your big one
My favorite era from you, I can't even pick one

Got through the scars, every one, uh
Cops drew down on you with guns, uh
Close friends, you lost some
No tears on your face, none
You missed time seein' your son
It's hard to find genuine love, uh
Family members in them cuffs
No tears on your face, none
Everything is just what you made it out to be
The world of entertainment got some lessons from your pops
Held it down alone, mom's on heavenly watch
The tears on my face just stop
Talkin' to my younger self
They say in the big fifties
That's when you get rich, rich, rich, rich
In every aspect
You got nothin' to worry about, no tearsEmbed
The levee busted
New Orleans, a catastrophe
America, how long we got?
'Cause I'm tryna find her
(There was a pretty young girl) Is that you?
(There was a pretty young girl) Ayo, anyway
(There was a pretty young girl) With no longer delay
That boy Nasir and Chauncey

Long braids, brown eyes (There was a pretty young girl)
Weight 135, she like 5'5 (There was a pretty young girl)
I see them thighs on her (There was a pretty young girl)
Make me wanna multiply
She's a queen, her dad a G, I know hе rock to Nas

And I, uh, she was so fly
Like she comе from Queens, or maybe L.I
I tried to find that woman, no later than tomorrow
Her body shaped like a Jean Paul Gaultier perfume bottle
When I find her, I'ma roll through, smooth in the Ghost coupe
Make shorty hop in, listen to BIG's vocals
See if I get a sign of intellectual
See if she rude, if she wild, if she sexual
If we caught a vibe, that'd be incredible
We probably break box springs, near hot springs like we on edibles
I would fit her in my schedule
If she is for real solid, nothin' else is acceptable
Slide up to Malibu, paddleboats in Pacific Coast
Havin' her swim in Atlantic water, it's less cold
I make her listen to poetry, hit a jazz club
Asked her would she leave if I was down to my last dub
I gotta find that girl, what block she be on?
Heard she was last seen in Rome, plane hoppin' in Florence
(There was a pretty young girl)
I think she right for me and I don't even know her
I mean the one time I seen her, she was naturally glowin'
That's why I made this song, told the label promote it
So she can hear it, 'cause even if she don't like rap
This still gon' find her right where she's at

Yeah

Me and her is cool but she hung with dude's girl
And dude is cool but he live how fools live when tools spit
He's in the middle of it, little nigga shit
And I bet my chick be sharin' our news
Tellin' his girl what I told her about my power moves
You know? Showin' off
Showed her the Chloe I bought her, they both with floss
Her friend's shinin', friend said she got broke off with more diamonds
They go to islands, then they post pictures
I search her friend name, her pagе come up
She with a dude I said, "I know this nigga"
Thеn I showed ol' girl, "Do you know this nigga?"
"Look closer, for real, you ever met this guy?"
I told her, "Zoom in tighter," she said, "We met one time"
Private investigator shit
Yeah
Me and dude alright
Seen him on the scene a few nights
Little chain and bracelets, nothin' crazy, somethin' light
Introduce himself to me, tough act
But he's a goofy, he hype
Impressin' ladies with his vest on tight
Like he a target, a marked man or perhaps hard to kill
But you attract what you fear and you ask for, for real
My girl says, "Why you ask about him?
Back to the problem
Can't tell her it's an unsolved murder, never mind it
"Forever find it strange," she says
"First, you excited, then you silent, somethin' has changed," she says
I said, "I knew a guy and he had a beautiful mind
And who would have knew he would die, they ruled it a suicide"
But that guy in the picture, sometime would ride with my nigga
Rest in peace, Half A Mill, a god amongst niggas
Was it self-inflicted? Somebody came to get you?
Maybe I'm paranoid
Somethin' sabotagin' the path he was on
But you passed on
You left us your scriptures, I'm in the whip, playin' your songs
Then I saw your face, still remember when I brought you to L.A
And we performed on Keenan Ivory Wayans (Yeah)
And your light remains, rest up to TJ
That's Havoc' brother, Killer Black, went a similar way
I used to call down to the crib, you would answer the phone
And years later, you were in shootouts with some of my mans with the chrome
Wow, so foul
How do projects turn to a war zone?
This is the place we call home
Drama, homicide, suicide in our father's eyes
We programmed to survive, but it's love that we don't prioritize
Speakin' of love, it was me and her
It was up between me and shorty, we crushed
I felt she was sent from above
That kind of karma with her is finally gone
I don't call her no more, we ain't talkin' no more (We ain't talkin')You might also like2Embed

Chapter one

Fresh cut, lined up, his hair clean, it's not a fair game
Can't trust how they move, and his solitaire chain
His bust down Cuban whippin' the 'Rari truck
Cuts down the music, he got a call that was confusin'
Heard this kid said in front of that dude somethin' that never happened
Somethin' bein' perceived like it's beef, but it's street gossip
It's nothin', ain't 'bout no cash, and hung up the phone
He can tell by the sound of his tone
Next time we see him, it might have to be on
Four Seasons with the heaters
He pull in the valet, he playin' Jackson 5, Maria
Pourin' good burgundy, drinkin' wine by the liter, million dollar ideas
Son a thinker, but he's surrounded by negative peers
Minds of seventh graders
Several haters, several losses, had to get his weight up
"Happy belated gorgeous", he sent the text to his ex
Her tattooed chest where her necklace rest, she covered his name
Thinkin' to himself no other girl could love him the same
She replied, "We still celebratin', come out to Spain"
He jumped right on the plane
He had bright orange leather luggage when he arrived
At the world's oldest restaurant, since 1725
Madrid was live, lookin' in this woman's eyes
Lookin' where his name used to be now covered with butterflies
Had a few Spanish connects from touchin' pies
Just to summarize, he knew a couple guys who had a couple ties
To make that shipment touchdown safe
Secured the situation, told shorty, "I'm out, bae"

Chapter two

Nigga plottin' on the plane, crunchin' the numbers
Thinkin' how this move gonna help him fuck up the summer
Told his dog who to meet and what he pickin' up from him
Dog said, "We solid, I got you, nigga, we bubblin'"
Since Jamella out in Queens used to have him living lovely
She sat down and didn't sing, she got out, he had her comfy
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' that fly estate with five acres
Three hours from JFK, watching Knicks versus Lakers
When the game was over, he dozed off
When he landed, his man wouldn't answer his phone calls
Did he take it or is he locked behind a stone wall?
Did the Feds wait in undercover patrol cars?
Tried to tell himself not to panic, don't go so far
But what's the law of averages when you done broke laws?
He had to do the math on this, he can't take no loss
Keepin' his poise
At the end of the day, he know that he can trust in his boy

Chapter three
Baggage claim, "Hurry the fuck up", askin' TSA
"Is that conveyor belt stuck or what? What's the delay?"
Satan's work, hopin' the devil don't fuck up his day
He had to factor in the facts when it came to the play
He remembered his face last time he was loadin' the safe
Heard him say, "You ain't the only rich nigga who in this place"
Fuck tryna relax, he had to pull up everywhere that this nigga be at
Said, "It ain't like my nigga know he ain't dip with the stash"
Hold on, I'm almost at the climax
Shots ring out, soundin' like some loud hi-hats
His dome got popped at the place of the transaction
Dudes from Spain set him up, straight flattened
On Flatbush Avenue, a restaurant in the back room
They took the money and drugs and shot him in his half moon
Doin' my homework on IG
Under his last picture says, "R.I.P."1Embed

Ayy Hit, how we gon' lose with shit like this, my nigga?

I once too was a young boy wildin' on tour
Runnin' with some of the wildest youngins out in New York
Met some more in Baton Rouge, used to wow how they talked
Nineteen, my girl was pregnant, had to sit with my thoughts
Sit with my thoughts
I had to sit with my thoughts
My family was my motivation
Focus on the elevation, I'm attractin', not chasin'
We ain't scared of niggas, we rarer than niggas
Rope chain hang, diamonds in the pendant
I am independent, she wrote a comment, they pinned it
It got to my attention, we could go viral in minutes
Aspire to win it, I'm spiralin' in it
Flip sides of the coin, that's life in the business
Flip publishin', it goes to the highest of bidders
I got 'em bitter, lows of a winner
That shit comes with bein' great, it's a lot on my plate
Never broke again, I'm blacker than the NBA
ESPN couldn't cover all of my highlights
Look at this money machine, I love what it sound like
And Nipsey would've love that I'm workin' with Hit
He might've took me to 6-0 and turned me a Crip

Sittin' with my thoughts, thinkin' what it cost
For peace of mind, I'd go crazy if I couldn't rhyme
I finally took time to drop constant releases
I finally put me first, the intro on the sequence
Don't need a new assistant, I'm just too persistent
Officially efficient, I see it through to the finish
So complete, I'm not a control freak

It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue

I won't deny it

Two girls, same city, both wanna stay with me
I bought the plane ticket, say my life ain't litty
Say my life ain't litty
Two-story high ceilings, two-door blue Bentley (Two)

Zero bonds, so the women gon' be deep tonight
I'll proudly spend a hundred fifty G's, it's light
Chain walkin' on water like Jesus Christ
Should I do the gators, Nikes, or Adidas stripes? (Two)
It's been a good day, but tonight, we goin' bad
Whole squad causing terror, shout to Joey Crack
This a different lifestyle, how long can you last?
She wanna come with me, it depend on how she act
I'm different, we don't bank at the same bank
Shorty know she good when she with me, it's a safe place
For real, I can only send a lo' if you won't tell
I can alley-oop your whole career 'cause I'm known well (Two)
When she land, she let the whole city know
Then hit the room and send me a twerk video
She be all on her gritty flow
Met her headed to Coachella in Indio
Other one had a BnB, she fifty though
In my business, they wanna stick they nose
Think I'm wildin' like Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo
I'm a gentleman, open the car door, holdin' hands
They both hit my line, I might crush 'em like soda cans (Two)

Said you lookin' desperate, I made the exit
My favorite found a shirt from my new one inside the bedspread
Asked me who it was, I said, "It was a girl I just met" (Two)
I can't be your lover
I'll leave they head fucked up like none other
Coi Leray says, "Girls is players too"
That's why I do 'em how I do 'em, then I'm makin' a move
I guess, soon, I'll be jumpin' the broom
Until then, keep 'em comin' in twos

No sex, I bounced on her, not yet, but while summer
I bet, I get my next child from her
"Have a baby by me," playin' as loud as I wanna
My checks, they pile, runneth over
Older guys be mad like I stole they lives
Some of these young boys tight like I had they wives
Realize that's not real, it's only in your mind
The rеal recognize real typе of time
Real man ain't supposed to be in his feelings, that's a crime
Half the time I pay attention to all these rappers lyin'
Real men ain't 'posed to be postin' up all the time
I take somethin' you slept on and make it mine
I hit the party scene, they thought I was DeVante Swing
My introduction to that name, they thought I was a Jodeci member

Put a fine girl in the studio, you might get a hit

My guess is, I won't be on your guest list
I'm unimpressed with doin' press kits
I'm good on lookin' desperate
I'm on the intersection exit, just missed a pedestrian
Been etched in stone for years and still I got room for perfection
Sometimes I random check it
Just to see if I still got it, to see it is still shockin', I'm—
Was lost for words
I be lost for words
Still sellin' out arenas and of course some merch
Got my Emmy nomination, I directed my first
Docu-series, the EGOT is near me
Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony, this is not no theory
Pourin' bottles of Hennessy, got me talkin' choppy
Over sample chops from Chauncey, I'm—
I'm lost for words (Word)
Was lost for words
My mom told me, "Clean the room, never shop with savings, son"
Great to have it now but when it triples, shop to death
I had a key around my neck on a string, a curfew, yes
A time to be back at my rest, and my peers, I will protect
There was pee all on the steps, slipped when our sneakers got wet
Scared to grab that TEC but I had to get my respect, I was—
Wow, was lost for words
My guess is someone'll replace your soul
A.I. is only here to replicate and control
Imitatin' the original then grabbed them a mold
Of the binary code, it's your patterns they stole
This my tactical flow, the one they can't redesign
You can redo the voice, but you can never read my mind, I'm—
Was lost for words
These times got me lost for words, that says a lot for a wordsmith
From the free cheese line to Prezi watch since my first shit
My old Earth left and she was here since my first steps
Therefore, my first words, I asked her where was my work desk
To put rulers to paper, draw measurements, use 'em later
Punch numbers in calculators, I'm happy to say I made it, I'm—
Lost for words, I'm speechless
I'm lost for words at the state of my nation's consciousness
Either you woke or nationalist is the politics
I'm lost for words for Black babies with low confidence

Paragraphs indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're lookin' out the sky's moon roof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo, the system wants the coon's noose — hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up
It's off the hook while I just wrote a statement
Like I'm facin' twenty-years in the basement
Chillin' on a VI with Mumia for wearin' chrome
I told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone
But like Capone, I'm thrown, yo
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
(Lyrical, ly-lyrical shine)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's

Yo, the time is wastin', I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin', court pen pacin'
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation we livin' in
Dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealin' boy
Coke suppliers actin' biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's
Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer, MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler, demi
Bottles of Mo', yo, simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and butt-holes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed toward the peasy-haired brick housing
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transportin' thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin' to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped
Watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catchin' mad feelings
Peelin' off in a Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin'
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TEC's you blessed
Word! So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money, when it comes to mine, take it in blood
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's

Yeah, Capone-N-Noreaga

Damn, look how muh'fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun, I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong, so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel, for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats, they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches, four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out, I watch as niggas scattered
Making me kill, but what I feel, it never mattered
When I'm empty, I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves, under beds
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
Always, I'm in some shit!
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick
Uncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear
Stunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys
For years, I've been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five-and-zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a 9
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear
He's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf, his eyes bubbling
He said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him
Shaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, "Remember me?"
He pulled the trigger, but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of them thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'!
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!47Embed

Uh, what, what, uh

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God's sake, what a nigga gotta do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings? (What, uh)

From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein' alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from bein' rich
But now, I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smokin' on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while I'm hoppin' in the drop-top BM'
Word is bond (Uh), son (What), I had that bitch down on my shit  (What, uh) like this (Word)

Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out
(Uh, what, what, uh)
