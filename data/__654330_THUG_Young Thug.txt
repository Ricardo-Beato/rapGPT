13 ContributorsTHUG Lyrics

The R stands for royalty, U stands for unity
N ain't gone never bitch, T stands for truancy
S stands for sex, stayed about money
Bought so many foreign shoes, I'm startin' to grow corn, bitch
The R stands for robbin', O stands for on, bitch
B stands for bleveland, red just like our team is
And pull up to the booty club, Bentley top receding
You know I got plenty girls, spendin' bands on they nieces

I ain't playin' on a man, I got motherfuckin' bands
I need a couple bars, where the fuck is Tarzan
Tryna rob, better have a 100 motherfuckin' plans
I kill a punk ho, she getting found by her dad
Hickory, dickory, motherfuckin' dock
Bitches just look at my motherfuckin' watch
Bitches, they like when I cook up them blocks
Get away with murder like a motherfuckin' cop
Indonesia, Indones
I got birds, I'm ridin' round with key-key, fuck 'round with Keyshia
I'm a blood, you can't rock none with C's, or I might bleed ya
Hit a lick by myself, bust it down with my homies
Count this moneefa
I been through tragedies
Now them bitches chasin' after me
And them bitches chasin' after him
Hey, I'm a boss, I need M&Ms
Hey, play, pullin' up with no chasing teams
You might also like
The R stands for royalty, U stands for unity
N ain't gone never bitch, T stands for truancy
S stands for sex, stayed about money
Bought so many foreign shoes, I'm startin' to grow corn, bitch
The R stands for robbin', O stands for on, bitch
B stands for bleveland, red just like our team is
And pull up to the booty club, Bentley top receding
You know I got plenty girls, spendin' bands on they nieces

Skrrrr, when I pull up on them fours, Forgi's
Take your bitch, make your bitch make it to an orgy
They said that I would never make it
So I got my blunt, got a (?) and had to take it
Yea, it's Young Squeaky and Young Thug
I think I'm on three drugs
Every time you see my mug
You know I sleep with the plug
We got a mag with the top off
Tired of countin' up, meet me at the loft
Got pills, hard, still got soft
Nigga tryna pull up man, just take 'em out

The R stands for royalty, U stands for unity
N ain't gone never bitch, T stands for truancy
S stands for sex, stayed about money
Bought so many foreign shoes, I'm startin' to grow corn, bitch
The R stands for robbin', O stands for on, bitch
B stands for bleveland, red just like our team is
And pull up to the booty club, Bentley top receding
You know I got plenty girls, spendin' bands on they nieces
Runts, last letter yeah it stand for sex
Your bitch pussy got wet when she seen the Rolex
Zoom, when I pulled up I got all the attention
The AP full of real diamonds just look how it glisten
This world is just a dirty world
Keep your head up, keep your head up, and survive her
Yea, cause these streets, yeah they play for keeps
These niggas hating, they don't want a nigga to eat
No, I ain't gonna wait on no nigga
I'm gonna get money, fuck bitches, and flip mo figures
And I'mma stay down with my crew, you niggas ho niggas
And I'mma keep stackin' this cash, it's all I know nigga

The R stands for royalty, U stands for unity
N ain't gone never bitch, T stands for truancy
S stands for sex, stayed about money
Bought so many foreign shoes, I'm startin' to grow corn, bitch
The R stands for robbin', O stands for on, bitch
B stands for bleveland, red just like our team is
And pull up to the booty club, Bentley top receding
You know I got plenty girls, spendin' bands on they niecesEmbed
