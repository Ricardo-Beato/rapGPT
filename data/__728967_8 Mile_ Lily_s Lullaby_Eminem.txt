11 Contributors8 Mile: Lilyâ€™s Lullaby Lyrics
I know this girl, her name is Lily
And it's past her bed-T-I-M-E
She goes to sleep and she can just dream
And not have to be in a stinky trailer with me
So when I feel blue, don't know what to do
I look at you, and I just say- *pfft*You might also like1Embed
