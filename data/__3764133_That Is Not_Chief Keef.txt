Huh
Sosa baby
GBE baby

I just bought a whole store man I want some more
This drink I'm sippinÂ´ mud-dy
That is a not a four
Girl that is my house
That is not a store
Girl them are balconies
That is not a Porch
Baby that's a Koenigsegg
That is not a Porsche
Girl that's for my me
That is not your choice
Girl that's my AR
That is not no toy
Girl I am a man I am not no boy

This is house is a small it is not a large
These niggas is frauds tuck your credit cards
Baby that is horse hair that is not your real hair
If that your real hair hit me with a steel chair
I'm landing so fucking hard put me in wheel chair
I can't fell these cus only thing i feel is air
Baby those are louis' those right there are fendi
I got so much money that right there is plenty
Baby that's a speed boat that is not a jet ski
Baby that's a full bag that shit is not empty
