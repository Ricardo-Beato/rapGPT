Haha, yeah
Nigga, fuck that gin and juice (Hennessy)
Just pour me a glass (Hennessey, that dark shit)
That's right, that's right
Ayy, pour me some of that too, baby

They wanna know who's my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Yo, what's our motherfuckin' motto, nigga? Hennessy
They wanna know who's my role model, it's in a brown bottle
You know our motherfuckin' motto, nigga? Hennessy
Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this old thug shit, Hennessy
That's what you sippin' on, now what's your name, nigga?
Big ballin' ass nigga named 'Pac

Now, I was born in the gutter, facin' life or death
I was a thug, ever since my mama gave me breath
These motherfuckers wanna see me die, so who am I
To try to warn 'em, I buck and bomb 'em, them niggas fry
Hey, remember me? Down that Hennessy
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me proceed
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me
Now that it's poppin, ain't no love, bitch
I maintain in the game, in the gutter's where I still kick it
I'm trying to hustle up a meal ticket
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dyin' days
Ain't nothin' wrong with gettin paid, so, nigga, blaze
'Cause we some motherfuckin' fools
Walkin through the streets wearing jewels
Breakin' niggas, makin' moves
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip
When they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy
You might also like
They wanna know who's my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Yo what's our motherfuckin' motto, nigga? Hennessy
They wanna know who's my role model, it's in a brown bottle
You know our motherfuckin' motto, nigga? Hennessy
Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this old thug shit, Hennessy
That's what I'm sippin' on, now let me tell 'em who I be
Big ballin' ass nigga named Trice

Now I was born in Detroit on the side that's West
Troubled child comin up I had to ride, I guess
Tried to apply myself, them niggas was ballin'
My mama couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin'
I was often involved with niggas breakin' the law
I look back, 'Pac nigga, we was bankin' off raw
P-Funk got it pumpin', he had the connects
Threw the sack to his lil' niggas workin' the set
And if you got it, you gettin' wet, nigga, bet on that
Don't come around here on that floss shit, Detroit niggas off shit
Robbin' niggas in the doorways, that's right
With my four-four, that's the sure way
And this your road days, All Eyez on Me
We was looney I suppose, you could die, homie
Old Trice always rep his block, Pass the Henn' and that ice
I'm on a track with 'Pac, nigga
They wanna know who's my role model, it's in a brown bottle
Yo what's our motherfuckin' motto, nigga? Hennessy
They wanna know who's my role model, it's in a brown bottle
You know our motherfuckin' motto, nigga? Hennessy
Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this old thug shit, Hennessy

Yeah, ayy, 'Pac, 'Pac
Nigga, Detroit love you ,boy
You put it down out here, I mean, you know
Me and my family, my friends, nigga, we ride for you always
2Pacalypse Now 'til infinity, boy, forever
Shady Records, Afeni Shakur, what up?
Yeah, Obie Trice, pour out a lil' liquor, nigga17Embed
