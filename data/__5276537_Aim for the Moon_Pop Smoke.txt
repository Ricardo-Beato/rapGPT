Come to my crib, take all my shirts
Pop all my Percs and sleep in my drawers
You talkin' too much, baby, pour up a four
We both bust a nut, now leave me alone
When we in Miami, we stay at the Mondrian (Oh)
We pull up to LIV in the Cullinan
Welcome her to the party
The afterparty's afterparty, then party again (Oh)
Hundred bitches, hardly any men (Oh)
In my room is where the party began
Then take a flight to Bora Bora, it's time to catch a tan, look (Woo)
