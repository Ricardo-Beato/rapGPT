4 ContributorsMasters of War (Reinterpretation) Lyrics
Here I sit, waiting for the fear to hit
Unclear of where I fit
This mirror doesn't work no more
This mirror doesn't look like me
I wish that I shook it free
That smile and your crooked teeth
This mirror doesn't work no more
This mirror don't reflect life
Can't see how you rest at night
This mirror won't get it right
This mirror doesn't work no more

I've got a picture in my head of what you look like when you're sleepin'
This skin sinks into the instincts of a demon (Demon)
Can't believe the words exist with your breathin'
The evil-eyed еagle flies high into the еvenin' (Evenin')
Every season has a reason
And every allegiance was inspired by some type of a treason
You can keep your secrets, nobody needs 'em
Convinced everything'll get better after you leave him
Skip the proper impeachment, not enough to call the bluff
Of the cotton thief, rotten top feeder got a fever
Caught him stealin' from his own father
Fuck the globe, fuck her off of his mother, no, don't bother
Got a better plot, a lot more dignified
A little more history, a lot less truth to hide
Do it right, set a precedent
Be the first one to ride into the sunset, successful suicide
You might also like
This mirror doesn't work no more
This mirror doesn't see my side
Or the people you leave behind
No end to the heave and grind
This mirror doesn't work no more

(Didn't think that you would) Give a little of a damn
About the interest of the man, woman, child
Look at now with your crooked smile
Put it into the perspective of a skeptic
Well, versed at getting hell head first (Boom!)
All you wanted was all of it, callin' it from the office
Unaware and lost of where the watchtower sits
Power fits in your wallet, too much for the mountain of big guns
Death count, it's got you all surrounded now
Dubya-dubya-dubya, dot-six-six-six-dot net
Fuck ya, fuck ya, fuck ya, lots of kiss, kiss, kiss got wet (Splash!)
Break the body, set fire, no loss
Make the dollar holler, how much will your soul cost?
When you die, are you gonna be surprised?
Will you see it coming? Will it be your summons?
When you face the judgement of death
Reinterpretation is all that's left, now hold your breath and
Close your eyes
Pull apart your disguise
Reap the grim of your lies
This mirror doesn't work no more
This mirror doesn't trust your words
Laughing at what we've learned
Stab and then cut the nerves
This mirror doesn't work no more
This mirror doesn't do us just
It might be my ignorance
This mirror don't resemble us
This mirror doesn't work no moreEmbed
