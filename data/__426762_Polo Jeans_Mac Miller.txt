Yeah, no fucks when I go nuts
Give no fucks when I go nuts
'Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa
Yeah

I give no fucks when I go nuts
'Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead
Woke up from a coma
Poured up with a soda, smoked, went back to bed
Never thought I'd be such a loner
I tell my bitch that I fuckin' own her
My neighbor's daughter just got a dog
I'ma run it over, I'm a fuckin' soldier
So cold, bruh, fuck pneumonia
All my bitches got love for Sosa
I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta
Then disappear in Southern California
Strung out 'til the night, I'm chillin'
Everybody worried that the lights might kill 'em
Uh, feel ya sight slippin'
Long lines of those white women
I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows
Just went through a half ounce of coke
Blood pourin' all out my nose
Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem
I'm fuckin' high-ly publicized
When the sun go down, I come alive
'Cause the guns go off in the summertime
The guns go off in the summertime, blaow

This another motherfuckin' rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Woah


I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
Gettin' wasted as the time that I'm spendin' high and sedated
I'm puttin' five in his face, because we don't buy into bullshit
As soon as it's flashin' lights then it's kush to hide in the bushes
I do this shit out of spite 'cause there's niggas that overlooked me forever
I'm more content with dark and stormier weather
Flip the fuckin' cross on your rosary, we supposed to be better
But here's a toast to your efforts
And don't approach me with nothin' that isn't money or breakfast
I'm close to chokin' a pussy, pussy
Sweaty man, you best had bet your bottom dollar on him
With a couple niggas, weighin' sess like it's a lot of options
Fifteen on me for soda and swishers
And who's the shit, a bag of chips and a colon decleanser?
I'm over bitches tryna act like I owe 'em a picture
Rather introduce these hoes to Vince who could show you a pistol
Listen, S.T. was the older initials
Been rap game tighter than boa constrictors
Rollin' stone like a boulder ravin', I'm so impatient and goin' dumb
As disclosin' my fuckin' home location to total strangers
No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink
Cashin' out off the garments, the hardest, fuck what you think
The sky'll turn black and the carrions could pick
At my flesh when I rest, tell 'em bury me adrift
This another motherfuckin' rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Woah
