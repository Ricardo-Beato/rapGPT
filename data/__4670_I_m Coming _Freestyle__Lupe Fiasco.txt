10 ContributorsIâ€™m Coming (Freestyle) Lyrics
Uh, momma raised a trooper
They trynna hit me in my head like Koopa
But I move like Super
With the hood on my shoulder like Bazookas, early(Revenge!)
I'm waking up the roosters
Until I'm late, and they waking up the future
And send me to the great wise ......
In a suit or, something looser
See, I grew up around rootas of the tootas
I rephrase
I mean supporters of the snortas, I retraces
Become recorder of the corner, free base
Or the shooter
I set Madison on fire, like the looters in Ninety-two-uh
Cooler, much more mature
You can pick it up off the floor like Hoovers
A newcomer, locin' with 2 numbers
The holidays of the hustlers
I be a Huckleberry Doc Holiday with the peacemaker
F-N-F Upwards
I'm coming
'bout my money shot like West Coast Productions
But I'm Chicago born & raised, formed & made
Company's coming, please inform your maids
First and!!! (Gunshot)You might also likeEmbed
