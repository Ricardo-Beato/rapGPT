70 ContributorsF Cancer (Boosie) Lyrics
Ayy, fuck cancer, shout out to Boosie (Ear Drummers)
I fuck your main bitch, I gave her cooties (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Slime Season, hey

Get it, all my niggas, yeah, they with it (Woah)
'Cause these pussy niggas hatin' (Yeah)
They trying to knock me off my pivot (Woah, hey)
I'm a boss, I call the shots (Woah)
I leave these pussy niggas missing
And I'm whipping like I'm gifted (Sheesh)
You can catch me in the kitchen, hey (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't want no brown, I want a syrup bottle (Syrup bottle)
I put it down and then she started stalking (She started looking for me)
Pop all the Perky, yeah, a halftime (Halftime)
Lil' mama pussy soaking, yeah, it's bath time (Bath time)

I put a nine inside a two-liter (Two-liter)
I'ma send it right back because I know you need it (I know you need that)
Stop all that fake shit, I show all my people (What?)
Shout out to rasta niggas, those my people (Zoes)
I put down my strap and used these hands, they evil
Tried to be loyal to these foreigns, but I am a cheater (Damn)
Got, got a lot of followers, a perfect leader (Swear)
I like it icy 'cause I'm not a cheap one, yeah
Babe make your booty roll (Roll)
I got a lot of hundreds, I wan' see that tootsie roll
I got a lot of partners, Falcons like I'm Julio (Brrt)
We done got drunk inside this bitch, I'm Don Julio
We tryna get wet from these bitches, so what you cruising for (Skrrt)
My family depend on me, that's who I do it for (Swear)
Of course I do it for my bitch and for my crew for sure (I promise)
I do it for my jeweler, my ice off a fucking boat (Sheesh)
You know the routine, lil' bitch, I'm private (What?)
Lil' bitch, I'm hot (Hot), like I'm a Taki (Yeah)
I knock it out, pussy, just like I'm Rocky
I got a bunch of wings surrounding my body (Brrt)
You might also like
Get it, all my niggas, yeah, they with it (Woah)
'Cause these pussy niggas hatin' (Yeah)
They trying to knock me off my pivot (Woah, hey)
I'm a boss, I call the shots (Woah)
I leave these pussy niggas missing
And I'm whipping like I'm gifted (Sheesh)
You can catch me in the kitchen, hey (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't want no brown, I want a syrup bottle (Syrup bottle)
I put it down and then she started stalking (She started looking for me)
Pop all the Perky, yeah, a halftime (Halftime)
Lil' mama pussy soaking, yeah, it's bath time (Bath time)

Okay, it's bath time (Brrt), just like a birdie (Thugger)
I cop a foreign (Skrrt), I pull off skrrting (Skrrt)
Bitch, is you worth it? (Is you worth it?) You make me nervous (Nervous)
You rock them Chrome Hearts (What?), you looking nerdy (Oh my God)
This ain't no fish n' grits (No way), but this that fishscale (Woo-woo)
I let little mama be, I keep her good and well (I promise)
Bitch, I'm a OG (OG), I don't play that tattletale (Shh)
By the time you just be out (What?), I'ma be done made bail (I swear)
I smoke that cookie dough, I drink that Actavis (I drink lean)
My life a video (And what?), I'ma let you caption it (What you say?)
Energizer Bunny (What?), you see these carats, ho (I see 'em)
I'm Rey Mysterio (Yeah), my life on HBO (I swear)
They didn't want me for none' (They didn't want me)
Now they want to suck some, and fuck some (Yeah)
YSL ain't gon' cuff 'em, we fucks 'em (And what?)
And then we go and do another one (Woo, woo, woo)
Yeah, we go and do another one, son (One, son)
I got my gun, you better run, run, run (Run, run)
You know I got bread like a croissant, son (Croissant)
I get 'em stuck up for a honey bun, yeah, yeah
(Woah, woah, woah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Quavo!)
I put ice in all my watches, came in in Versace (Ice)
Perky, gas, molly, trappin', we got plenty options (Trap)
Her pussy water like it's bath time, she wishy washy (Splash)
And she gon' suck and fuck me even when the feds watching (Oh)
I don't fuck with broke niggas, nah, we can't relate (No, no)
I put water on that white bitch, I call her Ricki Lake (Ricki)
Lil' mama she lost in the sauce
She needa get hit with the pause (Lost in the sauce)
After I fuck her she run through the dawgs
And then I'm rejecting her calls (Brrt, brrt)
I threw a pack over the gate to my niggas 'hind the wall (Yeah)
R.I.P. Pistol, R.I.P. Mike, I pour out the lean for y'all (R.I.P.)
Remember the days I trapped out the bando
I had a thousand dollars (Never got Ms)
You the same nigga that said I wouldn't make it
I put in a thousand hours (I got a thousand pounds), ayy

Get it, all my niggas, yeah, they with it (Woah)
'Cause these pussy niggas hatin' (Yeah)
They trying to knock me off my pivot (Woah, hey)
I'm a boss, I call the shots (Woah)
I leave these pussy niggas missing
And I'm whipping like I'm gifted (Sheesh)
You can catch me in the kitchen, hey (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't want no brown, I want a syrup bottle (Syrup bottle)
I put it down and then she started stalking (She started looking for me)
Pop all the Perky, yeah, a halftime (Halftime)
Lil' mama pussy soaking, yeah, it's bath time (Bath time)
Split this Perc' with me, lil' bitch, you know it's halftime
She wetter than an ocean, yeah, it's bath time
Little bitch gon' bring me back some dollar signs
And I'ma let you ride her like a Pathfinder (Yep)64Embed
