2 ContributorsStreets On Lock Lyrics
Streets on lock, Beamers on stop
Bullets bounce back, leave the drivers unshot
City on my shoulder, Slauson Ave. soldier
So to all my enemies, my dead body is a trophy
Talkin' ’bout trophies, I think I deserve one
Hotter nigga in these streets, holla if you heard one
Know a nigga sick 'cause I'm the shit with no surgeon
And them Roc Nation rumors ain’t true, but yeah, I heard 'em

Swervin' in that new Lexus with the shift kit on the steering
Wheel, step, 'tronic, got muthafucka purrin'
One thing's for sure, two things for certain
West Coast, Nipsey Hussle, game over, closed curtains
On my pursuit of happiness, I made the cash double
And introduced Italian shoes to German gas pedals
Like Gucci and Prada, here's Benzes and Beamers
All Money In, let no materials come in between us
I know they hopin' they could BMF and Big Meech us
But I got lawyers paid up and off last features
I singlehandedly became the man in my region
You would think it’s a crime how they witnessed my genius

Streets on lock, Beamers on stop
Bullets bounce back, leave the drivers unshot
City on my shoulder, Slauson Ave. soldier
So to all my enemies, my dead body is a trophy
Talkin’ 'bout trophies, I think I deserve one
Hotter nigga in these streets, holla if you heard one
Know a nigga sick ’cause I'm the shit with no surgeon
And them Roc Nation rumors ain't true, but yeah, I heard 'em

Swervin’ in that black Beamer with them button-pressed curtains
They go up and she go down and serve a nigga like a servant
Pull it out her mouth and she gon' ride it like a surfer
Phone ringin', she pick up and tell her man she workin'
Slurpin', everything a nigga got to urfer, offer
I'ma fuck once and I'll be off her
On to, bigger, better things like the dollar
Amount that Epic want versus what Def Jam offeredEmbed
