I said I rarely dream in color but (they don't know)
And every brother ain't a brother but (they don't know)
Pop melatonin like they Swedish Fish (they don't know)
To give her everything's my dying wish (they don't know)
Role play, she plays the mannequin (they don't know)
Raising my hand, teacher says "Not again" (they don't know)
The sun is up, but I feel down again (they don't know)
On just one hand, I can count all my friends (they don't know)

The understudy for the star, the show must go on
I'm a beast on a leash, I'm towed from the lawn
Another notch in my belt, the food's getting scarce
Another notch in my belt, she shakes up the stairs
Drink liquid confidence, tequila's our defense
Get rid of this tense and makes life make sense
As I come off the fence and break through defense
Anxiety is on the ropes and it's gettin' intense

Population gettin' tired now (they don't know)
Everybody wants inspired now (they don't know)
Racist emails fire out (they don't know)
We did it in the dark, it's coming out (they don't know)
The world is crazy and I cannot sleep but (they don't know)
Melatonin good enough to eat but (they don't know)
I read the paper so that I can see what (they don't know)
I'd rather stay indoors and make a beat but (they don't know)

My mother said a lot of wise words to me
Her Bible was like her toolie, peasy-headed and unruly
I made her think she got to me
Following the trail of reefer
And niggas talking through speakers
Fattest laces through my sneakers
The rappers ere ghetto preachers
Thought I had it so I tried it, for so long I would just hide it
Then I made the crowds say "Hoo!"
And saw them all get excited
I was hooked, I couldn't shake it
The more I got, I would take it
Couldn't sleep andcouldn't eat
But this life, I would not forsake it

I said I really dream in color now (they don't know)
And every brother ain't a brother now (they don't know)
Pop melatonin like they Swedish Fish (they don't know)
To give her everything my dying wish (they don't know)

So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
This one's for good girls that all gone bad (just one)
This one I'm taking when I feel sad (just one, yeah)
This one I'm taking to make me strong (just one)
This one I'm taking so that I'll live long (just one, yeah)
This one I'm taking to make me smile (just one)
This one I'm taking to make life worthwhile (just one)
This one and that one and those and these (just one)
I just want to sleep, I want to be at ease (just one)13Embed
