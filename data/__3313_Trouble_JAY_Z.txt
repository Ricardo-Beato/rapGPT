53 ContributorsTrouble Lyrics
(I done gotten in trouble again)
What the fuck
I tried, man
I'm back
Peace talks this song (Fuck, I tried!)
(I done gotten in trouble again)
Hahahaha
Yeah
(I done gotten in trouble again)

I try to pretend that I'm different, but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different, but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change

Now the singer Rob calls the police on me
Y'all niggas ran out and copped the CD
See, what I discovered is y'all some snitch lovers
I might speak, but I don't fuck with nobody
See what Doug, Jimmy & L.A. don't know
These young'un's crossed the line with Hov', I'm letting it blow
Had the papers writing stories like, "Didn't they know?
This what happen when they made that rapper CEO"
I know, it's just a matter of time before the steady hate
Starts to overflow, then the levee breaks
And my conscience go, "You escaped the RICO
Why throw everything away over ego?
You paper-chasing, they paper-hating
Billionaire Hov', you on the pace to make it"
Fuck that, exclamation, comma
Quotation's "I love drama," period
You might also like
I try to pretend that I'm different, but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different, but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change (Ugh, yeah, I'm back)

Smelling like Patrón, singing dirty rap songs
Tip-toeing in the crib like six in the morn'
Every day it's the same, I said in Blueprint that I'd never change
It's just a part of the game
Respect me I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec
But expect me to bug, it's in my blood
But if my chick leave me, she gon' leave me for something
She gon' leave me 'cause Halle, she ain't gon' leave me for nothing
Picture me getting up with something sleazy
Something, something, so easy
You could take out of Speed like nothing
Soon as you finish cutting, you like, "Leave me please"
Not me, I need Angelina Joliezy comfort
So I ain't gon' make a move unless I got a Plan B
That'll happen the day I have a baby by Free
Not to say that anything is wrong with Free
Just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take the cookie, not leave my ring
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take—hahaha, y'all know what I mean
I try to pretend that I'm different, but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different, but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
Ugh, you lil' niggas ain't deep, you dumb
You niggas ain't gangsta, you gum—I chew lil' niggas
Hock-ptui, spew lil' niggas
I can only view lil' niggas like lil' niggas
But in lieu of lil' niggas tryna play that boy
I "pew-pew!" lil' niggas with the latest toy
Unlike you, lil' nigga, I'm a grown-ass man
Big shoes to fill, nigga, grown-ass pants
Probably hustled with your pops, go ask your parents
It's apparent you're staring at a legend who
Put a few lil' niggas in their place before
Tryna eat without saying their grace before
Blasphemous bastard, get your faith restored
You're viewing your version of the Lord, God—
MC, lil' nigga, applaud, or
Forever burn in the fire that I spit at y'all
I rebuke you, lil' nigga, the meek shall perish
I'll roof you, lil' nigga, I'm a project terrorist
Cute, you lil' niggas think you in my class
Substitute, lil' niggas soon feel my wrath
I mute you, little nigga, you a lil' nigga
I child-abuse you, lil' nigga, I'm a ill nigga
Now shoot, you lil' niggas, go somewhere and play
'Cause the day I lose to you lil' niggas: no day
I try to pretend that I'm different, but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different, but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change3Embed
