Godzilla ain't got shit on me, nigga
(Eardrummers)
(Mike WiLL Made-It)

My momma ain't raised no ho, my niggas they wrap that dough
These niggas ain't got no hope, they'd rather be kickin' in doors
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho
My momma ain't raised no ho, my niggas they wrap that dough
These niggas ain't got no hope, they'd rather be kickin' in doors
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho

My daddy had bust him a nut
Keep a .45 tucked in the gut
I'm just a young nigga fuckin' these sluts
Fuck what you thought, nigga, fuck what you mean
Sippin' on promethazine
Fuck what you mean, we be gettin' to this cream
Everything that I did worth, all of my gifts and my curses
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
We don't give a fuck about the bitch
I just went got me another bitch
I just went bought me a better bitch
Trickin' ain't nun', but a habit, smokin' on some of that Cali
Enjoyin' my life to the fullest, the fuck you mean, nigga?
Yeah, I'm a money machine, nigga
These bitches try out for my team, nigga
She makin' a wish and I'm makin' a list (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
She didn't know real niggas like this exist
She's complimentin' me on my Givenchy kicks
Check out my— check out my— check out my wrist
Audemar Piguet is clean clean
That mean it ain't got no diamonds in it
GT Bentley and it's limo tinted
Free my niggas in the penitentiary
Future Hendrix limited edition
Fuck you mean, nigga? Fuck you mean?
Movin' screens yet a new regime
Pullin' up in something European
Fell in love with a lot of green

My momma ain't raised no ho, my niggas they wrap that dough
These niggas ain't got no hope, they'd rather be kickin' in doors
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho
My momma ain't raised no ho, my niggas they wrap that dough
These niggas ain't got no hope, they'd rather be kickin' in doors
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho (Uh)

Fuck is you sayin'? I take what you make in one year, spend it all on a chain
Fuck is you sayin'? I'm smokin' my G pen, until I get kicked off the plane
Fuck is you sayin'? My niggas all stuck to the plan, now we all gettin' rich
Fuck is you sayin'? She thinks it's a Snicker, because I feed her the dick
She get wetter than rain
Purer than caine, no keys for my whip
Smokin' this loud, fuck is you sayin'? I can't hear these niggas for shit
Fuck is you sayin'? My niggas got clips like the movies so duck when we spraying
All the money I'm makin', come easy, you comfortable slavin'
Fuck is you sayin'? Fuck is you doin'?
Take her to dinner, we smoke a few joints, and few minutes later we screwin'
I wouldn't advise you to fuck with me
If you get fly you look up to me
Probably get high, just because of me
T.G.O.D., that's my company
My momma ain't raised no ho (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah), my niggas they wrap that dough
These niggas ain't got no hope, they'd rather be kickin' in doors
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho
My momma ain't raised no ho, my niggas they wrap that dough
These niggas ain't got no hope, they'd rather be kickin' in doors
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho
My momma ain't raised no ho, my momma ain't raised no ho17Embed
