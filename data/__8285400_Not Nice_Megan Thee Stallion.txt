31 ContributorsNot Nice Lyrics
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice
Ayy

I'm on my fuck you shit, bitch, I'm done bein' nice
And when it come to cuttin' people off, I don't think twice (Yeah)
I kept it too real, shit, I kept it too G
And after all I did for bitches this is how they do me? (This is how they do me)
Bitch, I kept your bills paid, you were sick? I paid for surgery (Hm)
God, I pray You put who do me wrong where they deserve to be
I guess my skin not light enough, my dialect not white enough (Damn)
Or maybe I'm just not shaped the way to make these niggas givе a fuck
But fuck it 'cause I'm black, Biggie-Biggie black, ass biggy fat
Not a nigga on this Earth could takе the credit for my stats (Yeah)
I'm in Paris, sittin' on the terrace, sippin' tea with Farris
And I know they talkin' down, we just too far gone to hear it (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
I'm out here cuttin' up, at they neck like button-ups
Everything green like Buttercup, my afro my Powerpuff (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm out here celebratin' on a broke ho that's steady hatin'
And if a nigga ain't taller than me in my heels, then he could never play me (Yeah)

Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice, I'm the shit
I'm done with bein' humble 'cause I know that I'm that bitch
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice (Yeah)
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice, I'm the shit
I'm done with bein' humble 'cause I know that I'm that bitch

Ayy, y'all some dick-ridin' ass bitches, lil' bro-ass niggas
Y'all the same age, callin' niggas big brothers just so y'all could take pictures (Lame)
These hoes can't shake me (Yeah), these niggas can't break me
Like a nigga with a big dick, a lotta these hoes can't take me (Ah, ah)
You a broke bitch, your pockets been a joke, bitch
And you ain't worth the crack your momma used to smoke, bitch
You got the roaches in your crib sharin' snacks with your kids
Delinquent on your payments, ho, go and post this
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice, I'm mean
I'm sick of bitches actin' player when they really green
I'm sick of niggas comin' to me, actin' like they player
The whole time they wanna cuddle with a bitch and lay up
I'm sick of niggas actin' like they hard when they not
They so intimidated 'cause I'm comin' for they spot
Y'all could really miss me with "Congratulations" texts
A lot of rappers mad 'cause I never gave 'em sex (Yeah, ah)

Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice (Fuck y'all niggas, and you bitches, yeah)
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice, I'm the shit (I'm the shit)
I'm done with bein' humble 'cause I know that I'm that bitch
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice (Yeah)
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice, I'm the shit
I'm done with bein' humble 'cause I know that I'm that bitch
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice
Fuck it, bitch, I'm not nice1Embed
