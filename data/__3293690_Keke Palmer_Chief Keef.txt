15 ContributorsKeke Palmer Lyrics
Catch up, lets get it! (Huh? Huh?)

I know she gon' let me hit it
I do it later on, because you know I gotta get it
Blue book on me, yeah it's written
Don't mind me I'm just making these decisions
I walk in the rolls, with my llama
You don't want nothing nigga, so proceed to drama
Wrist looking colder than the Yonkers
Black thang sliding in the car call up Keke Palmer

I walk up in the spot fresher than a damn Islamic
It's a bird, it's a plane, nah nigga it's a comet
Uhh-Uhh-Uhh-Uhh I'm slidin' in that vomit
Smoking on this strong pack feelin' real atomic
Pass the blue thang my nickname is Sonic
I just left Saks now I'm pulling up to Sonic
Tryna get on forbes cause they label me a convict
Slide the gear over you won't see a nigga comin'
Cause Tadoe we on shit and we seeing how you bummin'
Ion fuck with you boa you seeing how I'm turnin'
Cops on the side and they seeing how I'm burning
This bitch fast yeah they seeing how I'm lunging
You might also like
I know she gon' let me hit it
I do it later on, because you know I gotta get it
Blue book on me, yeah it's written
Don't mind me I'm just making these decisions
I walk in the rolls, with my llama
You don't want nothing nigga, so proceed to drama
Wrist looking colder than the Yonkers
Black thang sliding in the car call up Keke Palmer

200, so the cops pulled us over
I don't know if I'm high or I'm sober
Twin stickies, but this not Minnesota
Actin' a ass got the car bending over
Shawty send me roses and lotuses
Please don't get them lame boys involved with this
Hopped on yo shit and kill it, like "who song is this?"
All up in my DM, man "who mom is this?"
Walk up in yo spot, you know we running it (mmhmm, mhmm)
Sack you in our touchdown, we loading it
Ice on, don't know no nigga cold as this (sosa, blick! blick!)
I won't miss the shot, I don't need no assist

I know she gon' let me hit it
I do it later on, because you know I gotta get it
Blue book on me, yeah it's written
Don't mind me I'm just making these decisions
I walk in the rolls, with my llama
You don't want nothing nigga, so proceed to drama
Wrist looking colder than the Yonkers
Black thang sliding in the car call up Keke Palmer1Embed
