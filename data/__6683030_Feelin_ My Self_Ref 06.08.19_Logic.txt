6 ContributorsFeelin’ My Self_Ref 06.08.19 Lyrics
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
Yeah, yeah, ayo, ayo

Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
Fresh to death bitch I'm killing myself
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
Fresh to death bitch I'm killing myself

I'm feeling arrogant, all up in your system like heroin, it’s easy
Know my beats bumpin' like Yeezy
"Wu Tang Forever," get the C.R.E.A.M., shit's breezy
Whip out my dick, how it taste?
I’m cummin' on your face, I’m a savage, your shit is average
Ha, yeah, on this day, we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of, bitch, I cleaned up and rolled out
The Illest mothеrfucker on the scenе, don’t bring yo' hoe out
Louis on my feet, best believe I'ma show out
My shit bananas, no doubt
Yeah, yeah, you bet' not bring your ho out
You motherfuckers ain’t got no clout
Kick in the door, waving the .44
Bobby-Boy ain’t never rapped on some shit like this before
Contradictin' himself on every other song
I got different moods for different occasions
My shit is amazing, I'm barely scratching the surface, I’m barely fucking grazing
On my beat machine, dropping gems like black raisin
I gotta leave the booth 'cause my homeboy's blazing
I'm tryna get so high that not a fuckin' thing phase him
Oh yeah, uh
You might also like
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
Fresh to death I'm fucking killing myself
Feelin' myself, Bobby feelin' himself
Fresh to death I'm fucking killing myselfEmbed
