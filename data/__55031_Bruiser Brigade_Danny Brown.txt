Bruiser, that's my crew
Bruiser, but don't forget the brew
MGDs and Colt 45s
But don't forget that Molson Ice

I'm about to drink a Heineken (Heineken?)
I'm about to drink a Heineken (A Heineken?)
Met a white bitch with a China friend (A China friend?)
She gon' slurp me and she gon' slurp my friends
Bruiser, that's my crew
Bruiser, but don't forget the brew
Coronas and Bud Ice
Don't forget the Miller High Life
We about to drink some PBR (Stop)
No bottles at the club, nigga (Nigga), we at the bar (Stop)
UK niggas up in the pubs (Pub), they watching them soccer games (Swag)
We drunk as fuck, nigga (Nigga), we bumpin' Waka Flame (Baow, baow, baow, baow)
Your bitch, she wanna fuck
Your bitch, she wanna suck
What the fuck you think she 'posed to do?
But if she fuck me, she gotta fuck the crew

Bruiser, that's my crew
Bruiser, but don't forget the brew
MGDs and Colt 45s
But don't forget that Molson Ice
You might also like
Bruiser Brigade, bitch
You ain't pullin' a nigga dick out and slappin' yourself with it
Throwin' this bitch in your mouth, suckin' dick with bubbles
Fuckin' all night and drinkin' protein shakes in the morning
Get the fuck outta here

I don't give a fuck 'bout none of these ho-ass niggas (None of these ho-ass niggas)
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of these ho-ass niggas (None of these ho-ass niggas)
I'm drunk as fuck, might fire on one of these niggas (Fire on one of these niggas)
We drunk as fuck, we might just jump these niggas (Yeah)
Bruiser, that's my crew
Bruiser, but don't forget the brew
We drink everything up on the shelf (Stop)
Now we hurlin' in the bathroom, I need some help (Stop)
But that's the life of a Bruiser nigga (Bruiser nigga)
Don't make me have to shoot a nigga (Blaow)
Bitch, it's Bruiser Brigade (Bruiser Brigade)
Bitch, it's Bruiser Brigade (Bruiser Brigade)

I need some brain, I think I lost mine
I'm higher than Swizz Beatz' hairline
You always cake up then bake up, say what?
You rappers cuff and you fake as lace fronts
Dopehead hustle harder, niggas can't knock it
Super skinnies, loosies breaking in my back pocket
I slam a rapper headfirst like the Undertaker
Headbutt your whole skull in, nigga, fuck a hater
You soft as Elvin off the Cosbys
My niggas down to do a homi'
Bruiser Brigade and don't forget the brew
Stylin' on rappers since Northwestern High School
Callin' me ahead of my time is an insult
I don't need a pencil, this shit is all mental
You rappers are wack, mad as hell, and you bored as fuck
I hit the stage, grab the mic, and do my Jordan shrug9Embed
