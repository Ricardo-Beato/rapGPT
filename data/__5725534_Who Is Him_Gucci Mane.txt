19 ContributorsWho Is Him Lyrics
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
Got it locked through Atlanta
Yeah, yeah
Got a lot to handle
(SpiffoMadeIt, bitch)
Brr, big brr

Ayy, Fox 13, we rep that murder gang, we don't do no attempts
Hop out on the slammer with this chopper like I'm Shawn Kemp
Drew down on him with his pants down in front of U of M
1017 Shiesty Gang, I got them folks like, "Who is him?"
Bitch, you try me and get whacked, I promise this is not the way
Know she wanna fuck 'cause she keep staring in my Cartier
I think about guns and money sixty times throughout the day
Nobody safe, you can't go get shit to stop these .308s, on God

Entertain like Cedric, had that codeine in my beverage
Way back in day, let them niggas use me for leverage (Well, damn)
F on my report card, on my hip, I got an F&N
Pulled up on me poppin', but he won't pull up and pop again
I don't care 'bout who he is or who his kin, just do him in
Cold, dark pool, they threw him in, I just shot off his chin (Burr)
Murder case, Snoop Dogg, back in the day, no juice and gin (Snoop)
And I'm the coach, I'm with the G.O.A.T.s, we go for it on fourth and ten (Go)
Always was the robber where we stayed, so I didn't play with 'em
Police don't even try to talk to Wop, got nothin' to say to 'em
Five-shot, .38 on me, put a trey to him
Big dawg in the yard, took a nigga tray from him

Ayy, Fox 13, we rep that murder gang, we don't do no attempts
Hop out on the slammer with this chopper like I'm Shawn Kemp
Drew down on him with his pants down in front of U of M
1017 Shiesty Gang, I got them folks like, "Who is him?"
Bitch, you try me and get whacked, I promise this is not the way
Know she wanna fuck 'cause she keep staring in my Cartier
I think about guns and money sixty times throughout the day
Nobody safe, you can't go get shit to stop these .308s, on God

Niggas starve theyself, the whole time, somethin' to eat in they face
Look at that lil' nigga from the Creek, his ass done made a way
I ain't just go put food on the table, I passed out the plates
I'm missing Tre, ain't nobody have me like my nigga Day
It's time to slide
Walk with a hundred up in the chopper, I shot eighty-five
Mix them Percocets with the exotic, I'm back energized
Do donuts up in the 'Cat, drive it like it got nine lives
You ain't take 'em down with me, nigga, so is you not my slime
Niggas talkin' out they neck, but that lil' shit won't slow me up
Two double cups, big congratulations, time to pour me up
We rollin' up, mixin' different flavors, keep my 'Wood stuffed
If you got somethin' dancin' on your wrist, it's time to hold it up

Ayy, Fox 13, we rep that murder gang, we don't do no attempts
Hop out on the slammer with this chopper like I'm Shawn Kemp
Drew down on him with his pants down in front of U of M
1017 Shiesty Gang, I got them folks like, "Who is him?"
Bitch, you try me and get whacked, I promise this is not the way
Know she wanna fuck 'cause she keep staring in my Cartier
I think about guns and money sixty times throughout the day
Nobody safe, you can't go get shit to stop these .308s, on God
On Chopper Gang, on So Icy G, this my squad
Brr, brr, lay up grass in your yard
Nigga, 413 Gang, ayy (SpiffoMadeIt, bitch)
1017 on my damn chain, brr1Embed
