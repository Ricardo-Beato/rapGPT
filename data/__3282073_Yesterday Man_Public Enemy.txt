3 ContributorsYesterday Man Lyrics
Yo come on
You don’t even know who the hell you are
You don’t even know who the hell you are
You don’t even know who the hell you are
Who the hell you are
You don’t even know
You don’t even know who the hell you are
Who the hell you are
You don’t even know
You don’t even know who the hell you are
We did it yesterday, and we’ll do it again
Tomorrow we’ll all still be yesterday men
If you’d like to be more than yesterday boys
Then sit down and listen while they bring the noise

Huh?
They say you don’t know where you goin’
If you don’t know where you been
Say that I refuse to lose
So I’mma win
And I ain’t going to stop quit
Made it a plan for the yesterday man
From Migos to Flash, Rakim to Drake
From Linden Triangle to Livonia and Blake
Yes yes yes yes yes yes tell it
Yesterday man

Some wanna be a spectacle …what happened?
Instead of spectacular …what happened?
Check the sally vernacular …what happened?
Now they mumblin’ back at her …what happened?
Kanye marryin’ Kim …what happened?
Bruce Jenner turned to fem …what happened?
Is rap still a black CNN? ...what happened?
Is Run and DMC still friends? ...what happened?

Huh?
They say you don’t know where you goin’
If you don’t know where you been
Say that I refuse to lose
So I’mma win
And I ain’t going to stop quit
Made it a plan for the yesterday man
From Migos to Flash, Rakim to Drake
From Linden Triangle to Livonia and Blake
Yes yes yes yes yes yes tell it
Yesterday man

Yesterday being everything I ever said
Echo of the past comin out of my head
Sayin’ new is better
So that new gets sold
They don’t want any better
They want different from old
But I ain’t buyin’ what they wanna sell now
I ain’t believin’ everything they be tellin me now
Say tomorrow is better
What today got wrong
Right now I’m the man yesterday is the song
Huh?
They say you don’t know where you goin’
If you don’t know where you been
Say that I refuse to lose
So I’mma win
And I ain’t going to stop quit
Made it a plan for the yesterday man
From Migos to Flash, Rakim to Drake
From Linden Triangle to Livonia and Blake
Yes yes yes yes yes yes tell it
Yesterday man

Brooklyn lookin’ like it’s L.A. ...what happened?
Sway movin’ out of the bay ...what happened?
Eazy singin’ Boyz N The Hood ...what happened?
Pac ridin’ shotgun with Suge ...what happened?
Common used to love her, did he leave her? ...what happened?
Now it’s no love of hip hop either ...what happened?
What the fuck OMG the pain? ...what happened?
I’mma just stay in my lane ...what happened?
Rappers all doin’ TV ...what happened?
Kids lookin’ older than me ...what happened?
3 Stacks ain’t makin’ songs? ...what happened?
Cam and Jimmy don’t get along ...what happened?
Huh?
They say you don’t know where you goin’
If you don’t know where you been
Say that I refuse to lose
So I’mma win
And I ain’t going to stop quit
Made it a plan for the yesterday man
From Migos to Flash, Rakim to Drake
From Linden Triangle to Livonia and Blake
Yes yes yes yes yes yes tell it
