6 ContributorsOne Minute Lyrics
Yeah Pull up with that shit man, right now man, god damn, been waiting for you all day
All I need is one minute

One Minute, One Minute
Give me One Minute
One Minute, One Minute
Give me One Minute
One Minute, One Minute, hear me One Minute
One Minute, One Minute, hear me One Minute
One Minute, One Minute, hear me One Minute
Say you want a whole thing about to pull up one minute
Call and buy the bag, nigga give me one minute
One minute, one minute, give me one minute
Got a bad ass bitch bout to fuck in one minute
One minute, one minute, give me one minute
Got a whole lotta cash thumb thru it in one minute

The way I get the money, you think a nigga print it
Thumb through it in one minute, get some more in one minute
10k a walk through, I be there in one minute
Want a show give me a dub I give ya 21 minute
Nigga say he want a picture told him give me one minute
He called me back in one minute, shit was gone in one minute
My lil bit blowing up my phone, told her give me one minute
Fuck going on a call my phone 50 times in one minute
Time is money it don’t take no time to spend it, hit Magic City
I threw a dime, it couldn’t been no more than a minute
Give me a key I could wrap one in one minute
Told Future keep on rapping he’ll be platinum in one minute

One Minute, One Minute, give me One Minute
One Minute, One Minute, give me One Minute
One Minute, One Minute, give me One Minute
Say you want a whole thing about to pull up one minute
Call and buy the bag, nigga give me one minute
One minute, one minute, give me one minute
Got a bad ass bitch bout to fuck in one minute
One minute, one minute, give me one minute
Got a whole lotta cash thumb thru it in one minute

Super star Camaro had me gone in sixty seconds
After this jugg I can buy another necklace
Frank Lucas plug gone have you George Jetson
Want that Arizona ? she’ll coming out relentless
Chevy sign for the pack I had to send it
Fuck the fame fame and give a damn about no Emmys
The boys find the money I ain’t never in it
Treat the son like a calc and give me my percentage
Yeah a whole lotta cash off the shit that I invented
One minute, ten milli, one minute no limit
Just spend it til I’m finished
When I’m finished, more benjis
More bitches, I’m on for one minute, them I’m in it
One Minute One Minute Give me One Minute
One Minute One Minute Give me One Minute
One Minute One Minute Give me One Minute
Say you want a whole thing bout to pull up one minute
Call and buy the bag, nigga give me one minute
One minute, one minute, give me one minute
Got a bad ass bitch bout to fuck in one minute
One minute, one minute, give me one minute
Got a whole lotta cash thumb thru it in one minuteEmbed
