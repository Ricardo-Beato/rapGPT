35 ContributorsSlow Dance Lyrics
Turn the music up for me Chris
Sosa baby, GBE baby
Bang bang
Bang bang
Sosa baby, GBE baby

I fucked up, fucking hoes and coming home
And whole time, you was with me right or wrong
And now I'm rich, and I gotta spend nights alone
I'm busy on the road, how'd I found time to write this song?
Baby, you's delirious
Baby, you a big time
I know I'm a dog, but I done fucked your sister
You can be a teacher, I can be your listener
I can be the boat, and you can be the fisher
You're so strong, can I come home?
Baby, you so toned
Your faith is like woah

Yo, baby do you wanna slow dance? (slow dance)
Oh, do you wanna hold hands? (hold hands)
No, I do not want your friends (your friends)
Ow, I'm chasing you like oh man (oh man)
You might also like
Your curves are so righteous
How do you do it, like that?
Your face suitable for my chest
And you're so fine, I like that
You can smoke all my weed, my weed, my weed
And she say, "Why me, why me, why me?"
Girl you're looking Chinese, Chinese, Chinese
From smoking my weed, my weed, my weed

Baby you are my, my, my, my, my, my
You are so just right, right, right, right, right
I love you so, Aiyayayayayai!
I’m sorry if I lied, I’m not that bright

Yo, baby do you wanna slow dance? (slow dance)
Oh, do you wanna hold hands? (hold hands)
No, I do not want your friends (your friends)
Ow, I'm chasing you like oh man (oh man)8Embed
