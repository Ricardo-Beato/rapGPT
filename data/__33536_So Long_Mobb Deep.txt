4 ContributorsSo Long Lyrics
Close your ears if you ain't ready for the real shit
Straight like that
Uh, check it out
Word is bond, man, some real shit
No matter how long it would take, baby, y'know what I'm sayin'?
No matter how long (y'know what I'm sayin'?)
It might seem long, y'know what I'm sayin'?
Word, straight up and down, I'm coming at you
Y'know what I'm sayin'? I'ma be there
Right or wrong, wrong or right
Right or left, left or right

Why the fuck did your your ass have to go and get knocked?
Now you got me on the phone, straight talkin' to the cops
Tryna verify your government, they got you now, they lovin' it
They wanna hang that ass, couldn't get you in the past
Though I can't say your prime, you was still young at the time
Did a lot of older things, you was ahead of your time
Never told you to slow down, Residual Crown Heights was wild
All I could say was be careful, give you a dap then bounce
Shit that you went through, watched the drama amount
Gave a fuck long as you wasn't part of the body count
Now I feel guilty, half the blame for your incarceration
Should've intervened when you first started catching cases
Fuck it, it's done, now you in there
Gotta hold it down, you your mother's only son
And I'ma ride for you, baby, cause you locked and it's still love
I'm still there, when you get home, I'mma be there

You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)
You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)
You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)
You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)

I can't believe they got my dunn, it feel like my fault
Cause I fronted you that money to get that dough
Any man's held accountable for they action
Still and all I feel responsible for you being gone
I hit yo moms with a half a K every now & then
Just so you can live and keep your little cosmetics
And that five years was worth the little dough we made
Out of sight, out of mind, naw dawg, it's not me
I miss you, you on my mind daily
Even though I scribe to a nigga, really, you feel me
Trying to get my shit together, so you could be proud
When you touch down, We got businesses to run now
Peep it back how we used to run up in a nigga's house
On some petty crime shit, boy we was not playin'
On occassion, I still check ya brotha 'tll the end
Black, and Bone crazy ass
Reading ya letters, I see you ain't lose ya sense of humour
Talkin' to you on the phone made my day cooler
Tellin' me, how you duff the COs out
You need to bring your black ass home and cut that bullshit out
I could remember me and Killa would test our new guns in the projects
Cause that's where police won't come
Illa Ghee, my nigga 'till death do us
You almost home, until then, hold ya head, dunn
You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)
You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)
You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)
You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)1Embed
