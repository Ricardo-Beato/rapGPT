Playtime's over, I hate Windxws, I hate Windxws

Nigga, grip your lips, you get flipped, meet that fuckin' clip
Diamonds on me drip, ooh, the fit, true blue, like a crip
Goofies wanna be me, like, it's easy, see
I am not crip, but with this drip I look like Eazy E, easy three
Nigga, grip your lips, you get flipped, meet that fuckin' clip
Diamonds on me drip, ooh, the fit, true blue, like a crip
Goofies wanna be me, like, it's easy, see
I am not crip, but with this drip I look like Eazy E, easy three (Fah-fah-fah)

Niggas think they hard, but they really not, AK get these niggas shot
I'm chillin' with villians, fuck yo' wave, bitch, I'm on a yacht
I paid for a bigger spot, pussy, fuck yo' shade
Give you fade if you don't give me props, what I got?
Fucking bacon soda, water whippin', Minnesota
From the north, ain't no Dakota, give these pussy niggas hold-ups
I will take your fucking quota, water rise, like I'm Noah
Get a job, get off that sofa, give me fries, Coca Cola
Stop hatin', lil' nigga, start creatin', lil' nigga
Get the money now, ain't no need for waitin', lil' nigga
Get that bag fast, all of it, go get yo' ass the Jag'
Yeah, I'm up next, callin' it, who else can really rap?
I say big facts, I stay with them motherfuckin' big racks
If you try to stick me up, yeah, you gon' meet that kickback
Yeah, the gang call me Usain, 'cause I run tracks
Now, don't you be surprised when I run up, where your funds at?

Nigga, grip your lips, you get flipped, meet that fuckin' clip
Diamonds on me drip, ooh, the fit, true blue, like a crip
Goofies wanna be me, like, it's easy, see
I am not crip, but with this drip I look like Eazy E, easy three
Nigga, grip your lips, you get flipped, meet that fuckin' clip
Diamonds on me drip, ooh, the fit, true blue, like a crip
Goofies wanna be me, like, it's easy, see
I am not crip, but with this drip I look like Eazy E, easy three1Embed
