Yeah, I really don't wear shades when I do my verses
But uh, sometimes I don't want to see my words
This for you, Six shit
Yeah, hello?
(Free 6LACK)
Brrr, Hello?
Fuck it, fuck it, yeah, yeah, yeah...
(Mafia Family, that is)
Dedication 6
(Free C5!)

Roses are red, our eyes are too, yeah
The pillows, the bed, the light bulbs too, Suwu
The scarf on my head and her drawers too
None of this shit she heard before
My lies all new, true
I cross my heart, I won't cross you, damn
Ride me so good I need horse shoes, ohh
Eat that shit out like some soul food, yeah
Cut the shit down, you'll hear old Tune, brrp
She come to my house and I got drugs layin' 'round
So easy to pick up, and they so hard to put down
Gift and a curse
And she don't mind fuckin' with girls
As long as Tiffany's first
Hello, fuck it

That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She get a little brazy, but she still wavy (Suwu)
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She get a little faded, but she still savin' (Fuck you)

Roses are red, our eyeballs too
We go from the sofa, to floor, to the bed, these nice walls too
Roses are red, our skin tone too, yeah
Let's go off to space, the way stars do, (Pewm)
We gone, it's all in our heads, and our hearts too, (Vroom)
I'm gone, she waitin' in bed for that part two, (Skrt)
I'm back, and we argue all mornin', fuck all noon, (Err-Ehh)
That's what the bed and the walls do
Hel-Hello? She come to my house and I got guns layin' 'round
But, she treat each one of them like it's her own child
Gift and the curse
And she don't mind fuckin' with girls as long as Tiffany's first
Hello, fuck it (Suwu)
Roses are red and my stones too
The roses are dead and my phone too
Damn, I'm changin' her life, her ringtone too
Cut that shit down, you'll hear old Tune

That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She-she get a little brazy, but your bitch basic
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She said, "Fuck that nigga, Baby, I'm your real baby."
(Fuck it)
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She get a little faded, but she steal safely3Embed
