10 ContributorsBlama on Ya Lyrics
I dare a pussy nigga put his hands on me
Damn near got a thousand grams on me
If you run up on me I'mma put that blama on ya
Gucci got that strap on ya and yea blama ya homie

Running from the bounty homie
Your honor I think ya outta order
I know what you did last summer fuck your baby mother
Gucci Mane's 80s baby and he took 180 from you
Mixed Haitian at the station smoking
Like some damn Jamaican
Only thang that I regret is ion got my pistol license
Swisher slice without a license ion give a fuck about it
You a snitch to tell me now I'm gone get the fuck around
 system now you probably hit me another counter
Why they call mountain park I don't see no fucking mountain
Truck dusted and disgusted walk around aggressive mouth
I met the plug and ran it up don't know if  I have the hundred thousand
I may ain't sold a million records but I got a million dollars

I dare a pussy nigga put his hands on me
Damn near got a thousand grams on me
If you run up on me I'mma put that blama on ya
Gucci got that strap on ya and yea blama ya homie
You might also like
I got a thousand grams on my motherfuckin arm
Made a half ticket of off twenty dollar fund
Sitting in the middle of my neighborhood chilling
With two white bitches blowing weed out the ceiling
Made a fifty thousand profits bought half on guns
Turn my neighborhood to Cali can't stay where I'm from
My niggas gang banging robbing all that
Even my nephew got his teacher calling
Say he don't wear shit to school but all black
I dare a pussy nigga to speak my motherfucking name then
Send my boys through there with them choppas it make it rain
All these diamonds on me I'm just coolin'
All these sick haters gone make me call your bitch up and
Go make a movie

I dare a pussy nigga put his hands on me
Damn near got a thousand grams on me
If you run up on me I'mma put that blama on ya
Gucci got that strap on ya and yea blama ya homie

You know me I got that strap and I'll blama some
You know me I get it gone I get my hands on
No hands on all these suckers they won't live long
Ain't nowhere to moan everythang I own
I up a couple hundreds strong plus I just got on
I just fucked a nigga bitch I fucked it up and turn her on
I just hopped out of new whip when I talk to her it turn on
I couldn't wait for no nigga I had get it on my own damn yeah
I just bought a new house and put them bricks in
I walked in smelling like who fucking rich mane
In the kitchen whipping fucking on my wrist again
And I'm motherfucking blam put your hands on it
I dare a pussy nigga put his hands on me
Damn near got a thousand grams on me
If you run up on me I'mma put that blama on ya
Gucci got that strap on ya and yea blama ya homie1Embed
