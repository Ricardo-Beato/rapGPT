19 ContributorsEscapades Lyrics
I love the way you do it
I don't know how you do it
Now I'm watching you and
I love the way you move
Tryna keep my cool, yeah
Boy I think I'ma lose it
I love the way you do it
I don't know how ya...

Pressure building steam, now I feel so high (high, high)
Pleasure place, I've never been here before

Build me, love me, lift me high
Relax my soul and ease my mind
More than lust, more than sex and love
Feel the roaring ripping tide
Slow as the azure day arrives
More than lust, more than sex and love

I love the way you do it
I don't know how you do it
Now I'm watching you and
I love the way you move
Tryna keep my cool, yeah
Boy I think I'ma lose it
I love the way you do it
I don't know how ya...

How deep, how high your love is-
Boy, come on, take me to it
I'll scale hills and sail oceans
To find the lover in you
Baby, believe me
If your heart calls me from afar
You bet I'll find a way to ya
I'd swim across the sea
A day or two to lay with you
Now we're in love again
Let's do it again, and again (and again x5)

Pressure building steam, now I feel so high
Pleasure place, I've never been here before

Build me, love me, lift me high
Relax my soul and ease my mind
More than lust, more than sex and love

If your heart calls me from afar
I'd swim across the sea
A day or two to lay with you
Now we're in love again
Let's do it again, and again (and again yeah)
Pressure building steam, now I feel so high (high, high)
Pleasure place, I've never been here before

Build me, love me, lift me high
Relax my soul and ease my mind
More than lust, more than sex and love
Feel the roaring ripping tide
Slow as the azure day arrives
More than lust, more than sex and love3Embed
