Mhm, New York to Chi-town, rrr
Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Woop

Salmon Gucci slide, slide around (Slide around)
Legit on that jet, I can fly around (Fly around)
Livin' with some people I could die around (Die around)
Livin' with the people I'ma die around (Die around)
Salmon Gucci slide, slide around (Slide around)
Legit on that jet, I can fly around (Fly around)
Livin' with some people I could die around (Die around)
Livin' with the people I'ma die around (Die around)

I still got hoop dreams, I got moodswings
I could do things in a plain white tee
And some blue jeans, introducing
My lil' boo thing, she gon' stick with thick or thin
That's a mood ring (Uh), everybody eats (Uh)
You just don't keep receipts, I'ma just press delete (Ss)
Always ten toes like feet (Ss), came with some built-in cleat (Ss)
You don't need help like cheats, you don't need help like Meeseeks
World on my back like leech (Ch-ch), mafia fam like Meech (Ch-ch)
Steady, keep growin' like Ch-ch-chia
Bringin' my son to the beach (Ch-ch)
Never sit in my seat
I cannot be impeached, wash the bitch down with bleach
Yeah, I stuck around, aw, lookie now
Suki-suki now, got a Grammy, I ain't lyin'
Ask Cookie now, got my hoodie down
Get it goodie now, get into it now

Salmon Gucci slide, slide around (Slide around)
Legit on that jet, I can fly around (Fly around)
Livin' with some people I could die around (Die around)
Livin' with the people I'ma die around (Die around)
Salmon Gucci slide, slide around (Slide around)
Legit on that jet, I can fly around (Fly around)
Livin' with some people I could die around (Die around)
Livin' with the people I'ma die around (Die around)

Gimme five, it's a vibe, in the hood like drivebys
I ain't talkin' wavin' hands when I'm in Dubai, bye
With the people that I love, rep 'em 'til I die-die
And I'm fly, when you fly they give you the side-eye, ooh
I just hit the plug, 'bout to buy a pound (Pound, pound)
Fendi on my moon boots, higher ground (Ground, ground)
Pistol on my lap when I ride around (Round, round, pew-pew-pew-pew)
People I could trust when I'm not around (Round, round)
Loco, I go loco, took a oath, though (Yee)
No Grammy, still a goat, though
You seen how a true queen and a hoop dream
Made my Pinkprint the routine
Treats, everybody eats
Most of them stay quiet but everybody peeps
Feet stay up in some heat (Ha)
Act like they don't follow, but everybody sheep
Ahh-ahh, ohh-ohh
Back on my bullshit, shout-out Chicago
Me and my man Griselda and Pablo
Salmon Gucci slide, slide around (Slide around)
Legit on that jet, I can fly around (Fly around)
Livin' with some people I could die around (Die around)
Livin' with the people I'ma die around (Die around)
Salmon Gucci slide, slide around (Slide around)
Legit on that jet, I can fly around (Fly around)
Livin' with some people I could die around (Die around)
Livin' with the people I'ma die around (Die around)

Back then, I was broke, I can buy it now (Buy it now)
Got a bitch who love me, I can die around (Die around)
I'm on my fourth cup and I'm tired now (Tired now)
Your gas tank 93 so you can't ride around
Name hold weight, elites
Get head in the car with my seats (Let's get it)
Like my pants no crease (No crease)
Gotta watch out for a leech
No two fish, Uber Eats
Perky one-two-threes
New Era hat say "3"
Fuck a bitch while she bleed
She nameless like Lil Keed
Drink my seeds, yes, indeed
Fuck with Chance, he elite
I got a bitch and she don't cheat
Foreign car, beep-beep
Get out my way, I'm OC
I can't go back to DOC
Even though I'm ODB (Yeah, he back)
I put my bitch in Saint Laurent (Yeah, yeah)
Smokin' gas like Chevron (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't got a Grammy, soon one'll come, mmh
The streets told me I'm the one, yeah
Salmon Gucci slide, slide around (Slide around)
Legit on that jet, I can fly around (Fly around)
Livin' with some people I could die around (Die around)
Livin' with the people I'ma die around (Die around)
Salmon Gucci slide, slide around (Slide around)
Legit on that jet, I can fly around (Fly around)
Livin' with some people I could die around (Die around)
Livin' with the people I'ma die around (Die around)13Embed
