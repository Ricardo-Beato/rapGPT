8 ContributorsI’m Paid Lyrics
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
Bout to take a trip to UK cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
Bout to take a trip to UK cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
Bout to take a trip to UK cause I'm paid
And we stars now, hoo-ray cause I'm paid
Livin' life like a movie cause I'm paid
And my whole brew shine like stars cause I’m paid
Walk inside the blub and buy them ball cause I’m paid
And we live life like neighborhood stars cause I'm paid
Everywhere we go they know who we are cause I'm paid

Boolin' in that Phantom, thinkin' bout your momma
Cop a big body Benz, ride it like Obama
He say he gone make it rain, I was like Tsunami
Bout to pop a G5, ride it like a stunna
Plane crash, right in her ass
I no longer smoke weed, I'm blowin' grass
That lawnmower, hit and pass
And yes we really blowin', birthday bash
That's birthday cash for you slow learners
We the earth wormers and we the leaders
I'm really preachin' to 'em, listen to the preacher
Shawn let 'em (?)

Bout to take a trip to UK cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
Bout to take a trip to UK cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
Bout to take a trip to UK cause I'm paid
And we stars now, hoo-ray cause I'm paid
Livin' life like a movie cause I'm paid
And my whole crew shine like stars cause I'm paid
Walk inside the blub and buy them all cause I’m paid
And we live life like neighborhood stars cause I'm paid
Everywhere we go they know who we are cause I'm paid

First of all lets have a toast
Second of all we gone do drugs til we overdose
Third of all put your hands in the air if you do the most
Fuck fourth of all but fifth of all this for the East Boast
And my money still talk like Charlie Sheen
And I'm walkin' green
And we don't floss these, we off these
Give a shouts out to Molly G
I want money please
I molly please, I want Miley please
No fix you can count them D's
And that Chevy wet, it need napkins please
Don't forget the T's
Ride old school don't forget the D's
My swag brazy, red leatheries, please
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
Bout to take a trip to UK cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
Bout to take a trip to UK cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
Bout to take a trip to UK cause I'm paid
And we stars now, hoo-ray cause I'm paid
Livin' life like a movie cause I'm paid
And my whole brew shine like stars cause I’m paid
Walk inside the blub and buy them all cause I’m paid
And we live life like neighborhood stars cause I'm paid
Everywhere we go they know who we are cause I'm paid4Embed
