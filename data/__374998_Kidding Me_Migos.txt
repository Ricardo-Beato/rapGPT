27 ContributorsKidding Me Lyrics
Fuck!
Must be kidding me
Slam my nigga
Nah, nigga don't play with me
Don't fucking play with me
Migo!

They say he ran off with the pack, goddamn (must be kidding me)
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown (must be kidding me)
They say the nigga that robbed you in the trap right now (must be kidding me)
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd, nigga better stop playing with me! (Grah, Grah)
You know that they taking your style? (must be kidding me)
It's all on the radio, like right now! (must be kidding me)
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder? (must be kidding me)
Migo pockets sloppy like lasagna, nigga stop playing with me

Who the fuck said QC we ain't on top? Gotta be kidding me
Who the fuck said YRN2 gon' flop? Must be kidding me
The niggas that didn't believe in me
The people that didn't believe in me
Versace, Versace it topped the charts
Now I'm on BET and MTV
Remember back then watching Oprah?
Now I'm on the sofa with Oprah
Louboutins all on her sofa
No strings attached cause these loafers
OG gas pack got the odor
Green like Shrek that's an ogre
Taking my swag and exposure
Pull up to your house and foreclose ya'
You might also like
They say he ran off with the pack, goddamn (must be kidding me)
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown (must be kidding me)
They say the nigga that robbed you in the trap right now (must be kidding me)
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd, nigga better stop playing with me! (Grah, Grah)
You know that they taking your style? (Must be kidding me)
It's all on the radio, like right now! (must be kidding me)
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder? (must be kidding me)
Migo pockets sloppy like lasagna, nigga stop playing with me

Quavo!
Thought I fucking told you fuck nigga better stop playing with me
Hop out with the dirty stick, the drum, holds infinity ('finity)
My bitch ridin' down with 50 chicks in an SRT (brrrr)
I ain't make it out of high school, it ain't no shame in me
I'm richer than my teachers, damn I know I bet they mad at me (watch 'em)
With yo' red light on, in the bando get it like Krispy Kremes (go)
Hit the pot with the left hook, (skrt) Quavo-Kareem (ooh)
You ain't never seen a mountain of snow (white) on that triple beam (bando)

They say he ran off with the pack, goddamn (must be kidding me)
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown (must be kidding me)
They say the nigga that robbed you in the trap right now (must be kidding me)
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd, nigga better stop playing with me! (Grah, Grah)
You know that they taking your style? (Must be kidding me)
It's all on the radio, like right now! (must be kidding me)
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder? (must be kidding me)
Migo pockets sloppy like lasagna, nigga stop playing with me

Offset
All of you niggas you mimic me (Copy Me), you kidding me? Literally
Controlling the block with good quality (QC)
Hurricane in the kitchen, a catastrophe
I'm number one you other niggas after me (number one)
Wrapping my bitch up in diamonds from Tiffany's
Everyday a holiday, epiphany (holiday)
All you pussy niggas talking and bickering
It don't even make no goddamn sense (no)
You cuffing the same bitch I fucked in my Bentley (cuffing her)
Whoosh, pack gone missing (woosh)
Soon as it's touchin' my hand it's disappearing instantly (go)
Diamonds on me looking like it's a photo
Guiseppe Zanotti walking on komodo
Feelin' like Austin they stealing my mojo
Trapping and capping we selling that yayo

They say he ran off with the pack, goddamn (must be kidding me)
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown (must be kidding me)
They say the nigga that robbed you in the trap right now (must be kidding me)
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd, nigga better stop playing with me! (Grah, Grah)
You know that they taking your style? (Must be kidding me)
It's all on the radio, like right now! (must be kidding me)
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder? (must be kidding me)
Migo pockets sloppy like lasagna, nigga stop playing with me9Embed
