Aah
Smells good
Yeah, okay

F-E-B to the R to the E
To the Z to the E (that spells Febreze) (Yeah)
F-E-B to the R to the E
To the Z to the E (that spells Febreze) (Uh)
F-E-B to the R to the E
To the Z to the E (that spells Febreze) (Yeah)
I said the F-E-B to the R to the E (Uh, okay)
To the Z to the E (that spells Febreze)

I use F-E-B just to keep my air fresh
If you think it smells bad I could really care less
Spray it all day, you can smell it 'round my house
Febreze is the best so forget about Oust
Yeah, you can find it at Kroger
It's your number one choice to eliminate odors
Look around for it in a skinny spray can
When it comes to fresh, it would be the name brand

F-E-B to the R to the E
To the Z to the E (that spells Febreze) (x4)

Yeah, I don't know about you guys, but I love my Febreze
F-E-B to the R to the E
To the Z to the E, that spells FebrezeEmbed
