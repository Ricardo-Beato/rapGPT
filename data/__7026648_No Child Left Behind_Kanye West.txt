No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind

Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
I'll always count on God
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
I'll always count on God

He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miracles on me
He's done miraclеs on me
He's done miraclеs on meYou might also like57Embed
