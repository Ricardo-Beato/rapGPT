6 ContributorsI Used To Know Her Lyrics
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
Says she got another nigga, but I used to know her
Says she got a man now, but I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
Says she got another nigga, but I used to know her
Says she got a man now, but I used to know her

I used to know this little thirsty ho named Nessa
Bills came in two hundreds
She asked for our help
So Gucci super-fly guy
Call me Young Delta
And the pussy stupid wet still, cause I just left her
Shorty got a trunk backed out
The Lord bless her
Kitchen table to the shower
To the bedroom dresser
Headbanging on the headboard
Yeah, I knelt her
And her body stupid banging
But her head something special
You might also like
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
Says she got another n*, but I used to know her
Says she got a man now, but I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
Says she got another n*, but I used to know her
Says she got a man now, but I used to know her

I used to know her
I know I know her
She was such a good soldier, very loyal
Used to text me all the time, but I did ignore her
That's why she acting like she don't
But she know I know her
They call me Mr Badman
I'm a money thrower
I'm throwing bones, go for money like I'm Brodie Croyle
I got your girl with me, late night on that oil
I drive a new Ferrari
He drive a Ford Explorer
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
Says she got another n*, but I used to know her
Says she got a man now, but I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
I used to know her
Says she got another n*, but I used to know her
Says she got a man now, but I used to know her2Embed
