4 ContributorsNobody Better Lyrics
(Snoop Dogg)
They wonder how I do it, that's that big boy shit
5-7 clean, that's that big boy whip
Stacy Adams mean, that's them big boy kicks
The way I'm mackin' a bitch, that's that big boy spit
King of the coast, yeah I earn't my due
Pimp hoes, pimp clothes, yeah I earn't that shoe
Been around the world, did my time in the pen
Got them niggas on gin, gangstas back on them 
So, how could you ever disrespect my place?
Since '93 strong I was all in your face
Big shows and arenas, bitches thicker than Trina
Party like rockstars, at the bar is where I seen her
Made my move closely 
I had ya in the club for 10 years sippin' 
To my shit
Classics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?

Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rockstar indeed
Ain't nobody better than me
Yes S N double O P
You might also like
Slow motion in the fast lane
Feelin' so alone blowin' zones in the crap game
Sittin' at the top of the game where you ain't
Got every type of car so now I just play to paint
Show after show, bank rows in the rolls
Livin' nice, big slice got me slammin' candy doors
3 piece suit with a pocket watch
Snoop Corleone ridin' chrome like he gotta stop soon
Did it the G way, he say, she say
Peer pressure to me way to stop bangin' the C way
I was a hog in the streets
Got in the game and broke the law on these beats
The slow flow killed them
The people said I rapped like I was chillin'
Way above the stars Snoop Dogg is top villain
Classics and all it was was keepin' it true
I brought the west back what did you do?

Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rockstar indeed
Ain't nobody better than me
Yes S N double O P

Who did it like I done it (nobody)
You just in it, nigga I run it
I gave life to the game and you behind on your bills
Like I can't get in your grill 'cause I live in the hills
Snoopy this, snoopy that, yeah I heard what you said
Ungrateful ass nigga, all the kids that I fed
Oh young ass buster, let me see ya I.D
I just chunked up a dub passin' V.I.P
I gave niggas a lane to represent that G
A N G S T A 
Been Crippin', been pimpin', been doin' the do
C walkin' now the whole world doin' it too
They play follow the leader
Boss on the move
Shark down to the shoes
Man 
Coldest of 'em all, I been keepin' it true
I brought the west back
What the fuck did you do, nigga?
Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rockstar indeed
Ain't nobody better than me
Yes S N double O PEmbed
