Apocalypse Now
Mind over matter, next batter be Tical
Put it on a platter — how much uncut raw shit we dealin' with?
Murder track, what? Slang killin' it, touched
You feelin' it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir, hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now, follow me the Mister
Mef Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture
2001, bring the rap Armageddeon, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes

Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap; cleanse that
The kid's rank, snatch collars off while ridin' off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks Animaze
Somethin' shiest like seven butcher knives
Rollin' Rover style twice, finger itchy like lice, hair fell out
Something to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck, switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life, preserve the other guys
Now, FUCK Y'ALL! Act wilder!
The style wilder than a praying mantis, chillin' like.. (Long inhale)
You might also like
As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changin' the courses of time
Devils no longer exist as God Cipher Divine
All minds one, no question, now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protestin'
Comin' with that lip professin', you must take Allah for fool
Where's his Jewel? Is he usin' Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist
You wishin' you did the Knowledge before speakin'
Seekin' where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?

Yo! Mind arson, my squadron surround the SoundGarden
Guns for hire, plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher
I, Pied Piper, move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave, crash the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state
Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent, Range whippin', Soul Controller of the lynch
Mackin', phone rings, Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut juice, walnut colored shoe, ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hidin' the manual
Blowin' evangel, buggin' off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posin' in Osh Kosh, guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage, rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third, kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat, 'cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death, Kobayashi couldn't stop me
Gettin' caught up in my world, Häagen-Dazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl, cave your whole world in7Embed
