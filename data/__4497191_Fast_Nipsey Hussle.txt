Fast money, fast women
Fast cars, black leather, black denim
These streets, I was in 'em
Stack money to the muthafuckin' ceiling
Got no feelings, it's fuck bitches
All Money In No Money Out, we get it, yeah
All Money In No Money Out, we get it, yeah
All Money In No Money Out, we get it, yeah

Look, All Money In No Money Out, we get it
Fast cars, fast money, fast bitches
Marijuana scented, got me smellin' so suspicious
Runnin' through the airport 'cause we always last minute
Yeah, but they know I'm that nigga
So they rush a nigga through security, no hassle him
Nah, first class black nigga
Robin Jeans, black denim, pockets got cash in 'em, nigga
Fail a drug test like I'm Barry Bonds
'Cause I'm the type to keep the kush inside the carry-on
Look in my eye, I'm very gone
Flight stewardess tell me she knows every song
Signin' pictures, last year I was barely known
Now I'm booked up, so I'm barely home
Rockin' stages, sellin' out each and every show
I killed the game with bullets, this is the burial, nigga
Uh, yeah, Hussle music, hotel room shit, niggaYou might also likeEmbed
