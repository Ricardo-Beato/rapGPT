8 ContributorsI Warned You Lyrics
It hurts...
G-G-G-G-G-G-UNIT!

I warned you, told you not to push me, pussy
See what happens when you push me, pussy
I warned you, told you not to fuck around
But you never listen, so you go ahead and fuck around!

I told y'all I crush 'em, I crushed them, it’s nothing
I destroy him and any motherfucker they lovin'
Got my thinking cap on, now I'm sharp as a blade
Don't believe me you sit there and watch me get paid
New game, homie, my next move is always my best move
Stricktigic, I show you motherfucker’s my chess move
Believe it, I'm not that rapper nigga you used to
That hammer hit that shell that hollow tip will go threw you
Contact hop, smoke from the cronic got me fellin damonic
Shoot one in the head for any nigga that want it
I prepare for the worst and wish for the best
40 Cali on my hip, teflon on my chest
It’s simple math, niggas get blast, D’s canning it up
Feel the crime scene playin' DA, mad as fuck
Hit my voice 'em on the wire tap, now you can’t get me like that
So called investigation, just was time you just wasted
You call me Palli, call me sonny call me don dada
50, I break 'em off proper!

I warned you, told you not to push me, pussy
See what happens when you push me, pussy
I warned you, told you not to fuck around
But you never listen, so you go ahead and fuck around!1Embed
