5 ContributorsAll This Love Lyrics
Everything 'bout you girl it's oh so great
Used to think this shit was corny 'til I saw your face
Then it clicked for me, now it make sense to me
Now I'm thinkin' bout you and I'm only livin' blissfully
'Cause when I look at you, girl, I don't get an erection
I think about how I wanna give you affection
I'm only sixteen, so it's better to do it
And take all this love and invest it in you

I got a bad chick with me who ain't interested yet
She's always in my mind I ain't gettin' no rest
And if she says she don't like me I might give it a rest
Until then, no, I'ma have to give it my best
Every single time that she sends me a text
I feel the butterflies slowly creeping into my chest
I'm fantasizing thinkin' 'bout the way she fits in a dress
And to be honest, I don't think that I can live with the stress
I know I might sound a lil' cliche
Every time I see her, I just wanna hit the freeze frame, replay
Gotta talk to you 'cause the rest don't listen
And them yoga pants give your boy X-Ray vision
You the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Put that down on on everything
Ever since I met you every night I've had the wettest dreams
And that's real
You might also like
Everything 'bout you girl it's oh so great
Used to think this shit was corny 'til I saw your face
Then it clicked for me, now it make sense to me
Now I'm thinkin' bout you and I'm only livin' blissfully
'Cause when I look at you, girl, I don't get an erection
I think about how I wanna give you affection
I'm only sixteen, so it's better to do it
And take all this love and invest it in you
Everything 'bout you girl it's oh so great
Used to think this shit was corny 'til I saw your face
Then it clicked for me, now it make sense to me
Now I'm thinkin' bout you and I'm only livin' blissfully
'Cause when I look at you, girl, I don't get an erection
I think about how I wanna give you affection
I'm only sixteen, so it's better to do it
And take all this love and invest it in you (Yeah)

Girl, I'm so infatuated with you
Swear your body bangin', let me grab it while I kiss you
I know I'm not the best but I'm just glad that's not an issue
'Cause most of the time I'm stuck at home masturbatin' to you
Tonight is lookin' different though, I think I'm in the zone
With you, all the time, but I swear we never been this close
If the feeling isn't mutual then I can hit the road
But if you're vibin' with me, baby, we can get to know
Each other just a little, you've been all on my mind
Maybe we can spend a little quality time
If I gotta wait for you I can fall in line
I'm only sixteen, we've got all of our lives
So tell me, if I got a chance, what's the probability?
If I'm so in love with you, how could you not be feelin' me?
Everything fell into place and everything is makin' sense
I just don't know why she ain't convinced
Everything 'bout you girl it's oh so great
Used to think this shit was corny 'til I saw your face
Then it clicked for me, now it make sense to me
Now I'm thinkin' bout you and I'm only livin' blissfully
'Cause when I look at you, girl, I don't get an erection
I think about how I wanna give you affection
I'm only sixteen, so it's better to do it
And take all this love and invest it in you
Everything 'bout you girl it's oh so great
Used to think this shit was corny 'til I saw your face
Then it clicked for me, now it make sense to me
Now I'm thinkin' bout you and I'm only livin' blissfully
'Cause when I look at you, girl, I don't get an erection
I think about how I wanna give you affection
I'm only sixteen, so it's better to do it
And take all this love and invest it in youEmbed
