Fed chirp on scanner (Scanner)
Got blurped with the hammer
I ain't playin' with the DA
I'm finna hit the corner, do a relay (Hit the corner, do a)
Fed chirp on scanner (Scanner)
Got blurped with the hammer (Hammer)
I ain't playin' with the DA
I'm finna hit the corner, do a relay (Hit the corner, do a)

Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Inner city, sittin' pretty where it's dangerous
Watch me talk that Bunchy Carter, that Karenga shit
Watch your back, or boy these crackers try to hang you quick
Baby, let me break the levees, I'ma hit the spot
It be tricky when that itchy, glitchy, getcha, got
She so pretty in the face, ass, titties, and the waist
Pull up, tryna get a taste and she get you popped

Fed chirp on scanner (Scanner)
Got blurped with the hammer
I ain't playin' with the DA
I'm finna hit the corner, do a relay (Hit the corner, do a)
Fed chirp on scanner (Scanner)
Got blurped with the hammer (Hammer)
I ain't playin' with the DA
I'm finna hit the corner, do a relay (Hit the corner, do a)

Baby went to Howard, got a B.A
Had her baby shower in the PJs
Got her baby daddy for a GTA (She on the road, yeah)
On the GTL, tryna beat the case (That nigga bold, yeah)
Crimey kept it solid, least that's what he say (That nigga told, yeah)
From direct deposit to the lawyer plate (That money old, yeah)
If he fuck around and take the stand on her dude
He gon' have to raise his baby from the visitin' room

Fed chirp on scanner (Scanner)
Got blurped with the hammer
I ain't playin' with the DA
I'm finna hit the corner, do a relay (Hit the corner, do a)
Fed chirp on scanner (Scanner)
Got blurped with the hammer (Hammer)
I ain't playin' with the DA
I'm finna hit the corner, do a relay (Hit the corner, do a)
