25 ContributorsWhoâ€™s On Top Lyrics
MPA, what up?
It's Thugga, Thugga baby
Got my whole crew behind me

I want you to say, say
R.I.P. to my big dawgs, let's pray
Me falling off any time soon? No way
I'm ballin' for a lifetime and a day
And I get money, that shit run in my family
Let them goons get on your head, yeah they from Los Angeles
Anything I ask them to do, do believe they handle it
I got one question just answer it
Who's on top?

And I'm sitting back thinking of a master plan (What you thinkin' 'bout?)
Trap going crazy, we smoking shit from Amsterdam (We on that loud now)
I been doing this for a very long time now (How long?)
The only option is climbing up, ain't no falling down (Ain't no fallin' down)
And I been a Young Thug (Thugga), and I'ma get wicked 'bout that paper (Wicked)
Momma always told me to shit on all haters (Rrr)
They're real VVS ones or you can call 'em glaciers (Them VVs)
Comin' to get they cash, this ain't the movie Takers (This ain't the movie)
Send me a scout, send me a scout, I could shoot the work (I could shoot the work)
I don't need no shooter with me 'cause I'm shooting first (Bitch, I'm shooting first)
I'm such a boss, somewhere eating a healthy meal
Runnin' in and out the marina (Where you at?), we in Beverly Hills (Duke)

Say, say, hey (Ayy, what you tell 'em Thug?)
R.I.P. to my big dawgs, let's pray (Ayy, put your lighters up)
Me falling off any time soon? No way (I can't come down)
I'm- I'm- I'm ballin' for a lifetime and a day (Hey)
And I get money (What? What?), that shit run in my family (Okay, cool)
Let them goons get on your head, yeah they from Los Angeles (Yeah, yeah, yeah, what?)
Anything I ask them to do, do believe they handle it (Yeah, yeah)
I got one question just answer it (Yeah, yeah)
Who's on top?

They got me thinkin' like Einstein with the number (Number)
I got a money vision, all I see is commas (Commas)
I want the sleep dreaming, going down the money tunnel (I dreamed)
Dreams come to reality, don't you wake me for nothin' (Right now)
I'm livin' out my dream, everyday countin' money (Count up)
Rental car traffic traffickin', movin' strong packages (Strong)
I stay strapped so the kid move rapidly (Ooh)
Ain't shit sweet, let the iron fill his cavity (Brrt)
Goons on go, and they kill for the passionate (Brrat)
Bitch I got a money high, I think I lost gravity (I ain't comin' down)
And it ain't shit you can tell me (Nah)
Money runnin' out the ass, you can smell me (Ha)

I want you to say, say (Hey, hey, hey, ayy, what you tell 'em Thug?)
R.I.P. to my big dawgs lets pray (Ayy, put your lighters up)
Me falling off any time soon? No way (I can't come down)

And I get money (What? What?), that shit run in my family (Okay, cool)
Let them goons get on your head, yeah they from Los Angeles (Yeah, yeah, yeah, what?)
Anything I ask them to do, do believe they handle it (Yeah, yeah)

Who's on top?
Oh, who's on top? (Who's on?)
Everyone's on top (Haha), so let's see who flopped (Better not fall, nigga)
Yeah, this a wonderful life (Yeah)
My goons'll kill a nigga for such a wonderful price (Brrat, brrat, brrat)
My weed smell like poop rocks (Ayy, what, ha)
My blunts are extra fat like a tree top (Hey, hey)
I say, I smoke weed until I pass out (I smoke weed all day)
Haiti Slang's the reason why you bitch got her ass out (Okay, cool)
I know Haitians that'll take over the city (They'll take your city over)
Make big dogs feel like midgets (Yeah, take your shit over)
Chickens, my J.R. no crickets
You wanna get it? I'll eat you alive (Talkin' 'bout)

Say, say, hey (Ayy, what you tell 'em Thug?)
R.I.P. to my big dawgs, let's pray (Ayy, put your lighters up)
