This DJ Scream, it's Chief Keef, nigga
This that Almighty SO
This right here a soundtrack for real niggas to ride to
Ayo, fuck them fuckboys
Ayo, fuck them snitch niggas

I just spent a lot of money, now I'm tired
Remember when I used to fantasize
Got this nina with me and you know that she gon' ride
Blow a nigga down, do or die
(Yeah, Hoodrich)
You scared, nigga, to go to church, bitch, kum ba yah
Them pistols get to bustin', boo-yah-yah
You ain't with the Glo Gang, nigga, who are ya?
Steady textin' my phone, this just bitch just blew my high

This bitch just blew my high
And I was high off all of these drugs
I walk in the mall and buy all of these stores
Nigga came out with two bags, he thought he was
I was off that dope
And I was high off all of this lean
Let a nigga try me, I got my Glock 40
It got thirty shots in it, gon' make 'em scream, I mean
(Scream)
Hey Sosa, why you so high?
I gotta get high to balance my low
I'm movin' too fast, I gotta pour a four
Spend lots of cash, 'member we used to be broke
Hey Sosa, what you got a gun for?
'Cause I'ma shoot when I see my opponent
Shootin' late-ass nights and in early-ass mornings
But hold up, I gotta roll me a Dutch
You might also like
I just spent a lot of money, now I'm tired
Remember when I used to fantasize
Got this nina with me and you know that she gon' ride
Blow a nigga down, do or die
You scared, nigga, to go to church, bitch, kum ba yah
Them pistols get to bustin', boo-yah-yah
You ain't with the Glo Gang, nigga, who are ya?
Steady textin' my phone, this just bitch just blew my high
