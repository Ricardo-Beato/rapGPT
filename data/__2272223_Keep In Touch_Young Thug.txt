7 ContributorsKeep In Touch Lyrics
Won't you keep in touch with me?
Don't lose it, don't lose it
Won't you stop beatin' up on me?
Ayy, don't abuse it, don't abuse it
Won't you fall in love with me?
I say, stop losing, stop losing
You gon' end up winning with me
Ayy, don't lose it, don't lose it

Ayy, I'ma ride it like a Kawaski bike
When you feel down, I'ma be the one that make you feel right
If he gon' have you riding, I'ma be that one that make you catch flights
I'ma flood you in the black diamonds, they gon' think you a knight
Ayy, I got them dark blue true's with the buttons like pendants
Walkin' down Rodeo, your real hair like Indian remy
Mix match bottoms, pockets fat but the true's will fit it
'Cause I got pounds of the kush, and I sold tons of the midget
And everytime I think about you, I, I want sex baby
Dancing down the pole, you the best baby
I know you kinda busy but I want next baby
I-I want next baby, have my next baby, yeah
Fuck what they saying about me and you
'Cause I'm on garden food, and you on garden food
And I done did so much wrong in these streets
God gave me back, 'cause I'm miss you and you ain't missing me
But try to just
You might also like
Keep in touch with me
Don't lose it, don't lose it
Won't you stop beatin' up on me?
Ayy, don't abuse it, don't abuse it
Won't you fall in love with me?
I say, stop losing, stop losing
You gon' end up winning with me
Ayy, don't lose it, don't lose it

Ayy, I'ma fuck you like I never did tonight
Choppas everywhere, you have no reason to fright
If I try to talk to you, you were mad we had skype
You gon' get the text I sent said "everything gon' be alright"
Ayy, I'ma come to you right home when I get back
Girl, you know your loving got Young Thugga like crack
Girl, you know you kill me when you act like a brat
You said the only noise you wanna hear when they rub is br-aaaat
Ayy, and I'ma treat it like it's never ever been treated
I say I'ma beat it like it's never ever been beated
I say I'ma feature like it's never been featured
And I'ma eat it like it's never been eaten, yeah
Ayy, and I'ma come back for it
Oh, that roadblock? I'ma ride past for it
Oh, I will bust my ass for it
I ran my money up, now I can afford
But you should
Keep in touch with me
Don't lose it, don't lose it
Won't you stop beatin' up on me?
Ayy, don't abuse it, don't abuse it
Won't you fall in love with me?
I say, stop losing, stop losing
You gon' end up winning with me
Ayy, don't lose it, don't lose itEmbed
