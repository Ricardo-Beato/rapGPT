6 ContributorsThose Who Know Know Who Lyrics
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked

I’mma point a finger and the fingers at you
I know what you did and I know what you do
Flipping that news got the people confused
Abusin’ all the rhythm leaving us the damn blues
Wicked while you winnin’ while the rest of us lose
Nobody knowin’ just who the fuck who
So I identify, I identify you
Those who know, know who

Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked

Got a first and a middle and an unknown name
Signed the dotted line and charged your game
See they be lyin’, nobody knows names
X the damn rhyme in a low down shame
Pushing all the buttons, pulling all the levers
You know who it is, it’s the so called devil
Beyond what you see and now another level
Deeds of evil, Pick, hoe, axe, shovel
Get to picking while they politickin'
Known all alone in a room like quicken
Expose who they are and what they do
Those who know, know who
You might also like
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wickedEmbed
