25 ContributorsYour House Lyrics
Man, I don't even know what happened
I was born inside of this shit
My fucking parents scrappin', I was mortified as a kid
Police always at my house all because of my daddy's temper
Man, this shit been going on 'bout as long as I can remember
He always blamed my mom for the shit he didn't accomplish
I'd hide in the corner like a guinea pig in the process
Just knowing he 'bout to smack the fucking teeth out her mouth
It's like when it came to some type of drama
He got aroused, no joke
There was the moments where dad would slowly be creeping up
I would jump in front of my mama: "Please don't beat her up"
I ain't never spoke on this shit, the memories are rough
Smiles and hugs, that's just something you'll never see in us
You know the pain when your parents tell you to go and play
Then hours later you see your mom and she got a swollen face
I hope you don't relate, I just learned how to cope today
From the days when I would pick up the phone and say

I gotta leave here now
My mom and dad acting crazy and this ain't right
And they've been going back and forth all night
I wanna stay at your house tonight
'Cause I don't wanna hear my dad fightin’ momma no more
I don't wanna hear the police at the front door
Can I stay at your house?
I wanna stay at your house tonight (Your house tonight)

I would go to school feeling so frightened, yeah, I was scared
Not knowing if I'ma go home finding my momma dead
Every other fucking day, dad was always losing control
He was acting like a fucking ape, runnin' loose in our home
Man ever since I was born they was pessimistic and torn
It's evident, but regardless they'd never get a divorce
God, I wish they got around it, just checking into some counselin'
We could have been a happy family inside our house again
I said again as if we ever were, that's false
Shit I dealt with growing up, will forever hurt, I'm lost
We were nothing like the families I used to see on the sitcoms
We were horrible with bonds, I can no longer sit calm
I would see that my friends had a life at home that was peaceful
They were lovable people, who didn't function like we do
Oh how I wish I could redo the pain of the wicked days
When I'd pick up the telephone, call a friend and say

I gotta leave here now
My mom and dad acting crazy and this ain't right
And they've been going back and forth all night
I wanna stay at your house tonight
'Cause I don't wanna hear my dad fightin’ momma no more
I don't wanna hear the police at the front door
Can I stay at your house?
I wanna stay at your house tonight (Your house tonight)
I ain't placing the blame saying it's mom or dad's fault
But all those traumas I had stuck with me as an adult
And it ignited these mad thoughts that I seem to have often
Yeah, that's Hopsin, music is where my last straw went
Now I'm devoted to always give you my true life
The love I never felt growing up I get it from you guys
Please don't get it twisted, I love both my parents to death
I just think there's issues a lot of fucking parents neglect
We all got these traumas we carry and sometimes it's scary
'Cause we buried a nest, right there in our chest
And we subconsciously air and project our nightmares and the stress that we dealt with when we were younger
And that's why therapy’s best, listen
If you got kids of your own and you throwing tantrums
Don't be oblivious and assume that it won't impact them
Children follow the protocol of their parents blueprint
So when there's an issue, they might handle it just how you did (You did, you did)

I gotta leave here now
My mom and dad acting crazy and this ain't right
And they've been going back and forth all night
I wanna stay at your house tonight
'Cause I don't wanna hear my dad fightin’ momma no more
I don't wanna hear the police at the front door
Can I stay at your house?
I wanna stay at your house tonight (Your house tonight)16Embed
