20 ContributorsTravelin’ Man ’09 Lyrics
Uh
The High Life
You know I stay on the move

Memories don't live like people do (Uh-huh)
They always remember you (Yeah)
Whether things are good or bad (Uh-huh)
It's just the memories (This the motherfucking The High Life)
Memories don't live like people do (I'm your host)
Baby, don't forget me (Mac Miller)
I'm a traveling man, moving through places (What?)
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do (The always grindin')
But lord willing I'm coming back to you (Aha)
Baby boo, I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do (Check  right here)
But God willing I'm coming back to you (Let's do it)
Baby boo

Uh, uh, uh
Look, look, yeah
Yeah, I keep my bags packed, always back on the road
Headed back to baby girl right after the show
But now I got clothes, hoes, piff and kicks
Always twist a couple spiffs while I'm in the whip
First thing, you need to gas, hit the pump, fill the tank up (What?)
Tell my homie at the register to stay up (Yo)
I'm on the parkway, feeling like a straight month
Going through the tunnel 'bout to break up (What?)
Phone gets hanged up, tunes turned way up to the max (Max)
Hit the L twice then pass it to the back—breath (Yep)
My medication comin' in for recreation
Ain't no pause or hesitation, tryna catch my respiration
I ain't never had no patience, so I'm hardly ever waitin'
Just creatin' money makin' with creative preparation (Uh-huh)
Sick of all these cats with false representation
Too bigger words? Maybe need some translation
Intellectual boy, figurative with language
And that there (That there,) that ain't shit (Uh-uh)
You feel me?
The High Life, and I'm gone (What?)
You might also like
Memories don't live like people do (Uh-uh)
They always remember you (Yep)
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do
Baby, don't forget me
I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do (What?)
But lord willing I'm coming back to you (What?)
Baby boo, I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do (Uh)
But God willing I'm coming back to you (Back home)
Baby boo ()

Look, look
My plane coming down and I'm happy to land
Every time I gotta go my girl grabbin' my hand
Tryna pull me back to her, and as mad as I am (What?)
I gotta make this money, I'm a travelin' man (Uh-huh)
So through airplane, boat, or packed in a van
Baby, I'ma hurry back to you as fast as I can
It don't matter what I gotta do (What?,) dreams: I gotta follow you (What?)
Love is what I fall into and ever do it follow through
So I'ma put it all on you (Yep,) just know that I ain't got a clue
But, baby, I be watchin' you coppin' you some Prada shoes (Haha)
Hurt me when I watch the news, the doctors in the hospitals
Tryna heal the sick, but all their chances is impossible (Uh-uh)
Givin' the word like literature
Spittin' the verse for all of those who live in the 'Berg
I travel the world, the land and the sea
Just here to open up your mind, just hand me the key (Aha)
Memories don't live like people do
They always remember you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do
Baby, don't forget me
I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do
But lord willing I'm coming back to you
Baby boo, I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do
But God willing I'm coming back to you
Baby boo

I'm leavin' on a jet plane
And don't know when I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me
Go (Uh, uh)2Embed
