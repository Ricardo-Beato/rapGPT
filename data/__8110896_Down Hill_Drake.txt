Baby, I think it might be too late, we're too far gone
Chemistry's frozen, we feel disconnected and exposed
I can't remember, when last did we feel familiar?
Tell me you're ready, tell me you're ready to walk away

Overnight
Overnight, we're done
Overnight
Overnight
Overnight, we're done
Overnight

We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried
We tri-tri-triеd
We tri-tri-tried, tried, triеd
We tri-tri-tried
We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried, tried, tried, tried
Tri-tri-tried

I used to wonder how you could swear it's for life
Constant confusion, nearing conclusion, going downhill
We spent last summer, we spent last summer so differently
I can't pretend, I can't pretend it was final

We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried
We tri-tri-tried
We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried
We tri-tri-tried
We tri-tri-tried, tried, tried, tried, tried, tried
Tri-tri-tried

We don't connect anymore, far, far, far gone
We don't connect anymore, far, far, far gone
We don't connect anymore, far, far, far gone
We spent last summer, we spent last summer so differently
Tell me you're ready, tell me you're ready to walk away

We're goin' down, we're goin' downhill
Oh, we're goin' downhill
We're goin' down, we're goin' downhill
Oh, we're goin' downhill
We're goin' down, we're goin' downhill
Oh, we're goin' downhill
We're goin' down, we're goin' downhill
Oh, we're goin' downhill3Embed
