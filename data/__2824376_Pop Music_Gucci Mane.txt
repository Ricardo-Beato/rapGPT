Pow-pow
Pow-pow
Pow, pow
Gucci
Gucci
Gucci
Yeah

I'm hearin' rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci
In my convertible 'Rari, they call me Drop Gucci
Rappers havin' conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music (Bang)
We call it pop music, we call it pop music (Bang)
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music (Grra)

The studio in the house, so we makin' house music (Skrrt)
Come ride with me through the six and see how the South do it
'Cause I got old 'anna, but I'm on old Candler
But I'm so East Atlanta, still got all my old hammers
Take my .44 handle, shot through the door panel
Fuck all that rap beef (Beefin'), let's have a gun battle (Huh?)
You might also like
I'm hearin' rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci (Gucci)
In my convertible 'Rari, they call me Drop Gucci (Huh?)
Rappers havin' conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music (Pow, pow)
We call it pop music, we call it pop music (Pow-pow)
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music (Pow-pow)
We call it pop music (Pow), we call it pop music (Pow)
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music (Grra, yeah)

I think it's funny how y'all think 'cause y'all don't really know (No)
These niggas actin' like they ballin' but they really broke (Yeah)
The trap God, I make it rain and I make it snow (Woah)
I use my money as a blanket, it was bitter cold (Burr, burr)
In Buckhead in a drop head, pulled me over Lenox Road (Gucci)
Versace slippers with the matchin' sunglasses and robe ('Sace)
I bulletproofed the Sprinter 'cause I got a hunnid foes (Fuck 'em)
I spent a million, so how the fuck I not gon' get parole? (Fuck 'em)
I feel like Lester Coke
'Cause I don't touch the dope
You feel like Lester, man
You took the oath and told the folks (Snitches)
Don't think that I don't know, they wish I was on death row (Pussies)
But imagine how these crackers feel that I moved next door (Fuck 'em)
I'm hearin' rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci (Gucci)
In my convertible 'Rari, they call me Drop Gucci (Huh?)
Rappers havin' conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music (Pow, pow)
We call it pop music, we call it pop music (Pow-pow)
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music (Pow-pow)
We call it pop music (Pow), we call it pop music (Pow)
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music (Yeah)
