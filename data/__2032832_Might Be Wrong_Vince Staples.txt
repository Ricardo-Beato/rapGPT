45 ContributorsMight Be Wrong Lyrics
I might be wrong, might be guilty
You might be right, oh (This time)
You tried to warn me, swore it would kill me
I sacrificed
Die to the world, I took the money (Wouldn't you?)
So for my life
Couldn't sleep at night—should've seen the crib, though
So fucking nice

Speaking on the unjust way the justice system is justifying crimes against our kind
Justice is supposed to be blind, but continue to cross color lines
"Hands up, don't shoot?" You shot
"Stand your ground?" Blacks don't own no ground to stand on, so we stand on our words.
"Black and hooded" is the official probable cause for cops to keep weapons drawn
"I can't breathe" through the chokeholds and gunsmoke
These realities drift in the pen to inform Black boys and men of the dangers outside their doors
Slain in society by sworn protectors, protected by their peers, grand juries full of friends; no charges brought against them
They kill and arrest us, transgress and oppress us

Damn, cuz
It don't even matter. You can start from the beginning...

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Hey, ayy (Hey)
Hey, ayy
You might also like
I might be wrong, might be guilty
You might be right, oh (This time)
You tried to warn me, swore it would kill me
I sacrificed
Die to the world, I took the money (Wouldn't you?)
So for my life
Couldn't sleep at night—should've seen the crib, though
So fucking nice

They searching—they searching cells
Hold on, cuz
Oh, it's the—
There's police in this motherfucker, you ain't hear them? You ain't hear the alarms?
Three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine... ten, eleven
Another day in Ironwood

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Hey, ayy (Hey)
Hey, ayy

I might be wrong, might be guilty
You might be right, oh (This time)
You tried to warn me, swore it would kill me
I sacrificed
Die to the world, I took the money (Wouldn't you?)
So for my life
Couldn't sleep at night—should've seen the crib, though
So fucking nice12Embed
