5 ContributorsMoney In Da Attic LyricsMoney in the attic (yeah)
My money the attic nigga (my money in the attic nigga)
Gangsta Grillz you bastards
Waz hannin, boss status stand up
I'm fuckin wit ya Jizzle
Mo, Jizzle
Wassup Mojo Crackpot comin' real soon fuck nigga
Wassup Fat, what it do

Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it

I'm that fish in the rental, my fish scale in the middle
Pill man on the low, got the numbers on the Skittles
I'm that boy you wanna fuck I'm that boy that shot you up
I'm that nigga in the hood, drinking liquor iced up
I'm the one you wanna see, if you wanna buy some D
I'm the nigga V-I-P, smoking in front of police
I'm the one don't really care
I'm the one that take it there, and it's Fatboi on the track
And its Gucci Mane La Flair
Haters thought it's over, but it's only the beginning
Never made the league rapper, but I'm thinking independent Bitches tellin' visions Gucci Mane done bought a Bentley
I'm the trapper of the century, hottest thang that hit the city
Gucci!
