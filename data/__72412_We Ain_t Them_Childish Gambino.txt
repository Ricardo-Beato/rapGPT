103 ContributorsWe Ainâ€™t Them Lyrics
Pickin' out my fro with my fist comb
I got a tab at the Stone baby, this long
My little brother was havin' a little trouble
I hope that he doesn't care that it's in this song
Koreatown lunchin', talkin' 'bout how to run things
He said Atlanta wanted somethin'
Waka, Jeezy, and Future got the streets locked down
Copycats making sure T.I.P. keep that crown
I'm fucking 'round with the truth, went to see The Roots
Quest brought me back on stage in a suit
I went hard 'cause niggas say that I'm soft
Even Black Thought thought
I'm aiming a little hard, I gotta be honest
Feelin' like the other stuff is kinda behind us
Makin' jokes here and there done got us some dollars
I'm tryna show the whole world what it is and it ain't a game
He said, "Homie, stay the course, ain't shit changed
Weird night, and everybody was tipsy
Hangin' out with Questlove reminiscing 'bout Whitney
He like, "Man, we can't even make it to 50?!"
That reminds me
I sent a long text message to my mom and pop
I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock
My mom like, "Why you wanna leave a good job?"
My dad like, "Do your thing, boy, don't stop"
Shout out to my nigga Lud, shout out to my nigga Swank
For hanging at the crib and telling me what you think
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel's real
And never let these white people tell you how to feel
Never let anybody tell you how to feel
I wanted what they had back in the fourth grade
Family vacays, you know I did it all
Just to see my lil' sis by a waterfall
My great granddad bought his own freedom
Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
So don't be alarmed, man, I'm royalty
Jam of the week, V103
No cosign, no bovine
More swag, pull back on the punchlines
Starving, every track means lunchtime
Huh, I'm a star, how could I not shine?
Fuckboys chase hype and scrat chicks
And niggas who stopped texting after 1.6
DG Lover ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
D-Money ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
And what's a leader if he isn't reluctant?
Too bad for y'all, I'm blastin' off
I'm not Asher Roth, I don't sleep on my bread
Dick riders stay close, I might flash a ball
Sometimes, all this shit make a nigga feel guilty
I used to sleep with them roaches
Back of my mind though, I hope the show gets canceled
Maybe then I can focus
Hawaii touch down, go ahead baby, put your shades on
East Side! East Side to the gravestone!
Brown liquor, but my girl in Bed-Stuy
Nigga, you got drive like a sale at Best Buy, ugh
Hold up, hold up, we can do better
Put my voice on the track, man, that shit is much wetter
At the studio at 8 AM, hit the booth then eat
Nigga, we ain't them, nigga, we ain't them!
Drop a line, it's your Facebook status
Said that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us
If there's something on your chest, nigga, let it out
'Cause I'm the best, da-da-daYou might also like40Embed
