Yeah
(Statik Selektah)

Time waits for no man, life is but a two-step, slow jam
Dancin' with the devil, tryin' not to lose my balance
But God blessed the kid with many talents, he was chosen
It's why you see him livin' in the moment
Every second, gotta own it
'Cause you never know when could be your last
Time breathin', now you bleedin' from the gun blast
Then you thinkin' 'bout the past, see your whole life in a flash
Best friends lowerin' your casket, now your son a bastard
Pressure on his shoulders make him gotta grow faster
Wherе I'm from, the stories nevеr end with no happily ever afters (Uh)
Just broken families forced to start new chapters
A natural disaster, the cycle in a loop
And we caught up in a rapture
Not to mention all the other factors
Government agendas against rappers
They wanna see us either dead or captured

So I hold my head high 'til they put me below
Best know 'til the day I die I'ma keep my heat close
This is for my niggas who took a day to relax
Huggin' the block but the block ain't hug 'em back
So we hold our head high 'til they put us below
Best know 'til the day we die we gon' keep this heat close
This is for my niggas who took a day to relax
Huggin' the block but the block ain't hug us back

Took a trip to Miami that March (Uh)
Couple weeks right before my daughter got born (Uh)
To meet up with this kid by the name of X
Had to go to him 'cause he was on house arrest, nonetheless
Our first time meetin', we was always on the FaceTime
He offered me his place to stay, "Thank you, but I decline"
First impression in my mind, "Now that's a stand-up nigga
Someone I could call a friend of mine and that's tough, nigga"
Shit, I could talk about any type of stuff with him
Never gave a fuck about who didn't fuck with him
See, that's my nigga, I had to keep it a buck with him
When he played me his album, I told him what he was missin'
A lot of niggas woulda took that shit different, woulda thought that I was dissin'
Instead, we found this beat and started riffin'
Shit had me reminiscin', had me thinkin' 'bout Steelo
Now that I can see his vision

So I hold my head high 'til they put me below
Best know 'til the day I die I'ma keep my heat close
This is for my niggas who took a day to relax
Huggin' the block but the block ain't hug 'em back
So we hold our head high 'til they put us below
Best know 'til the day we die we gon' keep this heat close
This is for my niggas who took a day to relax
Huggin' the block but the block ain't hug us back10Embed
