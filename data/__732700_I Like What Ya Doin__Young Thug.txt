5 ContributorsI Like What Ya Doin’ Lyrics
I like what you’re doing
Don’t stop it baby, keep it popping baby
Don’t, don’t, don’t
I like what you’re doing
Don’t stop it baby, I watch it baby
Cause I love it
I like what you’re doing, I said I like what you’re doing
I said I like what you’re doing, I like what you’re doing

Ok babe come here, come pick up  slack for me
Lose your attitude, you might get a slap from me
No gravity, I dress casually
She said she bored so I let her sip this Act with me
And now she acting, butt attractive, and Imma smash her
Then Imma kick her out of this castle
And let my lil niggas smash and grab her
Cause she’s a naughty nothing, they come a dime a dozen
I think her old man mad like a 
Big chest , back the fuck up off me
Blowing on dank, got your bitch at the office
Oops I meant the loft with a whole lot of bosses
I run around with paper, call my money equator

I like what you’re doing
Don’t stop it baby, keep it popping baby
Don’t, don’t, don’t
I like what you’re doing
Don’t stop it baby, I watch it baby
Cause I love it
I like what you’re doing, I said I like what you’re doing
I said I like what you’re doing, I like what you’re doing
You might also like
Yeah, come here
Not you, your friend
Come here
We don’t drink beer
I got lean for days
Come over to my section
And join the Js
We got party parades
We drink lean and rave
For real, no play
Make you tell your old man what did I say
Rock, rock, rockstar baby
Drop the spike off your shoe and rock the star baby
Them bitches you got on is the latest
Cause I get more green than the Navy, yeah

I like what you’re doing
Don’t stop it baby, keep it popping baby
Don’t, don’t, don’t
I like what you’re doing
Don’t stop it baby, I watch it baby
Cause I love it
I like what you’re doing, I said I like what you’re doing
I said I like what you’re doing, I like what you’re doing1Embed
