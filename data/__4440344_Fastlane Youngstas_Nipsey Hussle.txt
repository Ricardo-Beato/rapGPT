Fastlane Youngstas livin' on the go-go
Contestin’ a kid with chips is a no-no
Guns, money, weed and bitches; man we oh-so
Slauson raised and taught to be a showboat

...
Fastlane Youngstas livin' on the go-go
Contestin' a kid with chips is a no-no
Guns, money, weed and bitches; man we oh-so
Slauson raised and taught to be a showboat

...

Fastlane Youngstas livin’ on the go-go
Contestin' a kid with chips is a no-no
Guns, money, weed and bitches; man we oh-so
Slauson raised and taught to be a showboat

...
Won't visit your
Ask any nigga rested, one question
I bet he teach you one lesson:
"Nigga, life is one second"
You born alone, die alone
Most of yo' homies is yo' enemies with smiles on
So watch em', guns, money, bitches and a fly home
Just motivate to get yo' paper
Keep yo' mind strong
I ain’t never lyin’ holmes
You might also like
Fastlane Youngstas livin' on the go-go
Contestin’ a kid with chips is a no-no
Guns, money, weed and bitches; man we oh-so
Slauson raised and taught to be a showboatEmbed
