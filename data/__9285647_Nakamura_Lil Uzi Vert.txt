Huh

I'm too focused when it comes to the cash flow (Yeah)
Lost my mind, worried 'bout my last ho
They took all my last flows
Makin' sure this time that I got the door closed (Woah)
Now I'm back on (Woah)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Ayy, huh? Ayy
They thought I fell off and they said I wouldn't be back on (Back on)
Had to toughen up and gave myself a back bump (Back bump)
Mask off, fuck it, mask on
I'ma go hard, this time, I'ma crack stone (Go hard)
I'm like, "Oh, God," this time, I'm a bogart (Yeah)
Last year, I was way too friendly, now don't know ya (Yeah, woah)
They said I talk too much, but I thought I told ya (Shh)
Actions speak louder than words, this time, yeah, I showed ya (Woah)
Bought my girl a Birkin, Chanel, myself Goyard (Woah)
I don't care 'bout these new rappers, I'm before y'all
On my bully, so I'm standing like a bulldog (Grr)
I'm thе king of the ring, I could take all four of y'all (Woah)
Take all four of y'all
You could think hе tough, but I got more heart
I can't trust no one 'cause I ain't sure, ya
I wanted this so much I broke down to the floor, yeah (Yeah)

I wanted this so much I broke down to the floor, yeah (Woah)

I put time and dedication into education (Ayy)

She said, "You goin' insane, you need a vacation" (Huh?)
I don't got go overseas to get your top off (Woah)
Girl, you way too fake, you ain't on baecation
She tryna eat it up 'til she get lockjaw (Yeah)
You know I'm scarred just from all my old relations
I don't want your love, getting hearts knocked off (Woah)
We not sellin' mid, we be gettin' flock off (Yeah)
Feel like Nakamura jumpin' off the top dock (Woah)
She ain't let me in, but now she took the locks off (Woah)
Made it all the way to the top, I got 'em shocked off (Let's go)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
