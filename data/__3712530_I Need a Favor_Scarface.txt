Yeah, that’s how I like it, just like that
Check this out

Hello?
Hey, what’s up?
Hey baby, how you doing?
What’s happening?
Are you in town yet?
Nah, I’ll be in about 9:30, 10 o’clock—what you up to?
Nothin’ baby, just waiting on you
Oh, like that?
Mmm-hmm…
Ay look here, I got some potnas out here right
Uh-huh…
They showed me a real nice time while I was down here
Damn, that’s good, baby
You know me, I’m good-natured, I kinda wanna return the favor
You know?
Yeah…
So look here, we need to have a little fun tonight
Let’s do something different
What you wanna do different, baby?
Why don’t me, you, and my potna take a ride?
Uh, well, you know, baby, I’m down to take a ride
Where we going?
Uh, let’s go out to the water
Mmm, that sound kinda cozy
You know what I’m sayin’, go out to the water
Yeah, let’s go to the water, baby
I want you to do something different with him too, though
I mean, what you want me to do that’s different?
I want you to show him a nice time like you show me a nice time
Damn, baby, you know…
But see, if you was really really down with me like you say you is
You could respect that coming from me
Well, baby, you know, I cherish you, you know, and uh…
You supposed to
I’m just willing to do everything you want me to do
You supposed to
Well, what is it then?
I want you to do what you do to me
Damn baby, you know, I wanna do it
But I don’t wanna do it better than I do you
Shit, I ain’t jealous
I don’t know, his girl mighta did me better than she did him
Damn, well, you know, I know I’m a winner, you know what I’m sayin’
So I can’t let his bitch outdo me, you know what I’m sayin’
Can’t let her outdo you, baby
But, uh, I just wanna know one thing
What’s that?
Will you look down on me if I do that?
Look down on you?
Uh, well, will you still respect me as being your lady?
Shit, if anything, that’ll, you know, make me respect you more, you know
Well, damn baby, you know, uh, that’s the way I like to see it, you know
Mmm-hmm…
Well, uh, I think we should do this shit, you know
You gon’ have to
Well, let’s get it on
Show me that you, you know, really appreciate me the way you supposed to
You know
Well, baby, you know, your wish is my command, baby
I hope so—ay look here, I’m running up my phone bill
Let me call you later
Okay, baby
But yeah, just pick me up from the air—nah, nah, don’t do that
Uh, I’ll call you when I get home
Alright, baby
Alright
