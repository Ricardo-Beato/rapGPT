17 ContributorsOpposites Attract LyricsFreeze

Heaven hell, hella heaven, Sunday school
Mac 11, prison camps, colleges and crash courses
Driving lessons, bad bitches, prostitutes
Death threats, hospitals, gang-banging
Private schools, chains hanging
Drama too, blang blanging
Cultivating new cribs, home invasions
Child abuse, motivation
Talk to God, smoke with Satan
Wedding rings, divorce paper settlements
Court cases, medicine
AIDS victims, Malcolm X, racism
UFOs, airplanes, crop circles, man-made
Demolishing, landscape starvation, pancakes
Skinny jeans, baggy pants
Relationships, back-up plans
White rice, Zatarains
Open lanes, traffic jam
Bloods, crips, Latin kings, intelligence
Lack of brains, negligence
Accolades and skeletons
And plastic veins, lucid dreams
Sleep walking, dry snitching
Streets talking,competition
Police calls in the projects when the beat starts
You might also like
Now put your motherfucking hands up high
(I've been having such a bad week)
Now put your motherfucking hands up high
(I've been having such a bad week)
Hands up high
(That's when opposites attract me)

Let it go
Hella heaven, heaven hell
Falling off, record sales
Balling out, broke as hell, free at last
Back to jail, candy paint
Candied yams, candy canes
Can he pass? Can he reign?
So for real, black teeth, golden grill
Thug life, honest life, real life
Drama life, urban life
Healthy life, broke life
Wealthy life, rag, riches
Riches, rags, fags, bitches
Bitches mad, bad Christians
Hypocrites and half niggas
Niggas half hit the deck
Planet ships, cigarettes
Cancer sticks, Smith & Wes'
Banana clips, niggas death
I'm hearing shit, carnivores
Herbivores, all the wars
All the facts, hieroglyphics
High blood pressure, heart feeling heart attacks
And call the cab, walk the block
Mouth shut, you talk a lot
Open field, car garage
Unemployment, morning jobs
Kill the youth, multiply
Keep it real, falsify
Make a mess, organize
Fake my death, all the time
Now put your motherfucking hands up high
(I've been having such a bad week)
Now put your motherfucking hands up high
(I've been having such a bad week)
Hands up high
(That's when opposites attract me)


They say my temple is a magnet
My brain is a gadget
Yeah my soul is a rapture
This that opposite attraction
I got opposite intentions
I got positive incentive
I should rob a nigga senseless
I hope them cops'll get defensive
There ain't no stopping this I've been it
Fuck yo' confidence I've been sick
Fuck yo' opposition, I'm kinda different, I hop inside a spaceship
I've been lots a different places
Bitch I'm locked into the matrix
Put my thoughts in different cages
Watch me turn portraits into paintings
Who told you right is wrong in your eyes?
Who said wrong is right with no lies?
They said I was wrong the whole time
Turn them lights off its show time
Who told you there wasn't no God?
Who told you that I don't know God?
Who told you that I don't go hard?
I'll give you something big to choke on
I never follow rules and no laws
Turn your fucking head to coleslaw
This that winter flow, that mistletoe, kiss you goodbye, so long
I'm that Martin Rocka 
I'm that Maserati two-tone
Ain't no cavities in this jaw bitch
Ain't no gravity in these songs
And I've been wanting it for so long
They've been talking shit for so long
This my ocean now, when them sharks lurking boats or coast guards
Bitch my coat rocking so raw
This what happens on a two way street when I'm opposite roads cross
All your common sense'll go lost
All your common sense'll go lost
All your common sense'll go lost
Tell me what happened to you?
What have you done? Where your mind at?
Hol' on
Tell your daughter put some clothes on
Tell your son put his coat on
Tell my father pull his skirt down
He ain't did shit for me in so long
Fuck your opinion nigga I'm grown
They don't like the shit that I'm on
Can't accept the fact that I'm grown
Just accept the fact that I'm on
Ain't no evil practice in here
I got Jesus all in my bones
I got angel wings on my back
I got 808's on my track
Shit I been wanting this for so long
They been talking shit for so long
This my ocean now, when them sharks lurking boats or coast guards
Bitch my coat rocking so raw
This what happens on a two way street when I'm opposite roads cross
All your common sense'll go lost
All your common sense'll go lostEmbed
