Bad bitch know somethin' (know somethin')
Give her that money, go and blow somethin' (blow it)
She want a rack 'til I pop somethin' (rack)
She want a trick, I'm not one (not one)
Pull up and hop on a baddie (skrrt)
She wanna text me the addie (text it)
They know we havin' it (woo)
Drums to the face, closed casket (brrr)
The pot look greasy (woo)
Suck me up, she please me (woo)
Chanel like CC (CC)
Upgrade a bitch from Bebe (Bebe)
If she see money, she go get it (go get it)
All of her friends, they go with her (yuh)

The bricks come from Japan and Korea (Korea)
I done made 2.5 on my Nokia (brrr)
He got kidnapped after that shit too real
Bad bitch, she walkin' with Chanel on her feet (Chanel, Chanel, Chanel, Chanel)
Litty got her titties done, now she on fleek
Plain Jane rollin' with the bust AP (plain, plain, plain, plain)
I make the thottie meet me at the Grand Marquis (thottie)
Playin' for keeps, gotta move it low-key (playin' for keeps)
She tryna fuck, she in heat (hey)

Tip toein' back door and creep (back door)
I don't know no tricks, but I treat (no tricks)

Put Emerald sets in my links (emerald)

Turn the housewife to a freak (freak)
And I got the ice on fleek (fleek)
Chanel, double down, CC (Chanel)
He'll tell you, it's a price on me (he'll tell you)
Ran off, made your life on me (ran off)
No gun, pull a knife on me (knife)
Back back, get your wife off me (back back)
On sight with me (on sight) my diamonds fight with me (my diamonds fight)
Can't clone, we on, fly like drones, they bitin' me (argh)
A sight to see (sight) this gas tank on E (E)
North Pole, wrist on freeze (ice), wait 'til my dawg get free (free)
