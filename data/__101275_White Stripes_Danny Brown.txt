26 ContributorsWhite Stripes Lyrics
Check!

Nigga get a life, 10 Deep crewneck
Blunt to the face, nigga, never ask "Who next?"
Homie I ain't Two-Tecs, that's B.I.G, homie, ay
Where the fuck was his gangsta ass out in LA
Ay-bay-bay, this is not a diss
But your bitch looks like Hurricane Chris
And nigga it's fact, that what you rap fiction
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Your bitches do my braids, say dog I be hitting
Never knew my dick be where you be kissing
When I shoot missions, gotta keep a clip in
Or I roll deep like roaches in my kitchen
Dog, I ain't tripping, but they never gone
They don't even run when I cut the lights on
Holmes, what's the biz? Nigga, watch your kids
Your bitch say my dick bigger than John Holmes' is
Limes in Corona, 2-for-18
Might pop Adderall, I don't fuck with no lean
Sitting at a mall, nigga fuck them all
Walk in thrift stores, now watch daddy ball
Vintage ass fleeces, skinny no creases
Me and these is like ETs and Reese's Pieces
Laying on beaches, hoes' toes pedicure
Bitch give me head cause she liked my metaphors
'bout getting head, isn't that ironic, like Alanis Morisette?
You might also like
Check!

Tight like corsets 'round the waists of S&M bitches
Bitch ass fat like Deelishis' is
Hoes say I'm inconsiderate
Cause I make 'em treat my dick like licorice
But they can't get a pack of Twizzlers on me
Light-skinned bitch that I call darky
Always in beef like Eek the Cat and Sharky
So I ate the cat and now she heart me
Roll another spliff, pop another pill
Live every day like a nigga going away
When getting locked, fucking with the pot
Gotta nigga two hots and a top cot
Some niggas like to plot, I move on instinct
Nigga, I can lock down a year in a precinct
And these bars will still be hotter than your new shit
Why you try to keep it warm like somebody else piss?
In that drop on the way to the P.O
You talk shit, turn his bitch to El Nino
Rap jalapeno, flow Neo Geo
Crunk like Lil' Jon, "Bia Bia" live in Rio
Nigga do a peep show, fucking quarter freak ho
Hit you with the cinco, now you niggas el finito
Sipping on Cleco, rap like a cheat code
To the game of life and I'd done passed twice
Now tell me mothafucka that I ain't nice
Roll another dime sack, nigga just rewind thatEmbed
