31 ContributorsI Got Lyrics
We turnt up nigga
We doing everything new like the year of the money nigga!

I got, bitches in the dirt just like a fucking termite
And this bitch must think I'm green, but ho, I'm red like a car light
And him against me, bae I'm a win like a pipe
Now give me 8 million, I come to the rescue
Yeah, I'm a protect your heart just like a vest do
Yeah, I'm a prince I don’t wake up like the rest do (No way)
I'ma, ride on your ho like she a Mongoose

I'm in the booth, and yeah I’m goin', yeah I'm flowin'
My bitch no speak English, she ching-chong and ching-choing
I make her sister suck me up when I get bored
I make her momma suck my bro every time he yawns
Money, collars, and dollars, paint shine like a Prada
I'ma holla at momma tomorrow just for a follow
Piña Colada, bosses make it her pop it like a collar
Lord knows just what she’ll do for guala
Baby, give me hat, oops, I meant head
Baby, ride it like a track, oops, I meant pack
Baby suck it for a sec, oops, a minute
News said they only shot, oops, she was dead
Hey, yeah (Ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah)

I got, bitches in the dirt like a fucking termite
And this bitch must think I'm green, but ho, I'm red like a car light (Skrrt)
And him against me, bae I'm a win like a pipe (Longway, bitch)
Now give me 8 million, I come to the rescue (Rich Gang)
Yeah, I'm a protect your heart just like a vest do (On Blood)
Yeah, I'm a prince I don’t wake up like the rest do
I'ma, ride on your ho like she a Mongoose

She on the same drugs like me, can’t wait to meet her
Pump that dick inside her stomach like a test tube
There’s pinky boogers in my pinky ring, don’t bother me
Givenchy-vest over your heart  just to protect you
Ride that Bitch booty like a mongoose
Pourin' up mud, sippin' lean up out a big flute
4 oz. ridin', can’t get it with a big roof
8 milli, Longway is comin' to get you
Slum-dog Millionaire, pourin’ that Jesús
I dream of Genie, my bitch live in vases
They politicin' on me 'bout catchin’ cases
Packaging OG, stash it in the basement
I got that Jungle fever, them white chicks
Crippin' in Su-wu Kanyeezy’s, dope residue on my Nike’s
Thugga tell me, said that ho mama easy
She with the hit it, one night
She eat up that wood like a termite
Switcharoo, I got what these bitches like
She can’t think I'm green cause I’m red like a light
My homey be bleedin' and bangin' on the right
Longway, bitch
(Rich Gang)
I got, bitches in the dirt like a fucking termite
And this bitch must think I'm green, but ho, I'm red like a car light
And him against me, bae I'm a win like a pipe
Now give me 8 million, I come to the rescue!
Yeah, I'm a protect your heart just like a vest do
Yeah, I'm a prince I don’t wake up like the rest do
I'ma, ride on your ho like she a Mongoose13Embed
