Boy, ooh
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah (Mmm, mmm)
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone (Ooh, ooh)

Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate (Mmm)
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see, I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath (Mmm)
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step (Mmm)
As we speak, I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness got 'em overwhelmed
(Mmm, "Please, God, I want to go to Heaven")
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail (Mmm)
See, I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand (Mmm)
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife  (Mmm), like

I know you desperate for a change, let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from— (Ooh)
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from— (Ooh, oh, woah)

Chosen religion, Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions (Mmm)
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard  (Mmm)
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates (Mmm)
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel, 'cause I'm supposed to have a halo (Mmm)
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly (Mmm)
Fiends wan' get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do? I just supply
It's economics, my business ain't got the suit and tie (Oh, wait)
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine (Oh, wait)
I can't oblige, dawg, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga (Mmm)

I know you desperate for a change, let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from— (Oh, hey)

But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from— (Yeah)
Prodigal son, got a new gun, this one
Don't run out of ammo, lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain myself? (Myself)
If I fall, dust it off and regain myself (Myself)
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved (Ooh)
I no longer bury demons
I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing (Ooh)

Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more, yeah, yeah (I, I, yeah)
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little (Oh, no)
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more (Oh, oh, no)
"Time is short," that's what somebody told me (Told me, oh)
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Ayy, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands (Ooh)
All of a sudden, niggas poppin' trunk and then we scram (Mmm)
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man (Ooh, yeah)
Eyes wide, that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills (Ooh)
Bloodshed done turned the city to a battlefield (Mmm)
I call it poison, you call it real, that's how you feel?
(Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop)
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go) Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, 'cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was twenty-two
(Last night at around 7:45) He was twenty-two
(Twenty-two year old black male, suspect, reporting on the news)

(I swear to God, bruh, no)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr. (No)
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro)
We got to do better, people
Twenty-two years old, this boy was too young (Oh my God)
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentlemen
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words (I'ma kill them niggas)
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—112Embed
