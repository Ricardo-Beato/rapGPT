Rico's going crazy again
Beat by Yamaica Productions, baby

Sweetheart (Sweetheart), uh (Sweetheart)
What's a thotty (Sweetheart), to a gangster? (Sweetheart), uh
(Sweetheart, sweetheart)
I'm wildin' (Sweetheart, baow, ma), got no answers

Niggas know they gettin' boomed (Niggas know they gettin' boomed)
You see my face, you better move (Baow)
Bullets flyin' through the room (Baow, ayy)
They want static, I'm in the mood (Ayy)
100K what I pay for the jewels (Ayy)
I ain't got nothin' to prove (I don't)
You either win or you lose, look (Ayy)
I see an opp, he'll be devastated, uh (Devastated)
None of them niggas ain't never made it (They didn't), uh (Uh)
When I do a crime, it's premeditated, baow (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Pay attention, watch close
It's Fivio Foreign and Pop Smoke (It is)
I see an opp and I drop folk (Baow)
I see an opp and I drop folk (Baow)
I'm heaven-sent (Uh), devil in me (Devil in me)
You niggas know I need extra Henny (I do)
I shoot at niggas 'cause they messin' with me (Baow)
Police'll never come catch up with me (Skrrt)
Uh, uh, sweetheart
I cannot drive, I got three cars (Ayy)
I took a Perc' and I think smarter (Ayy)
I'm off a Perc' (I'm off a Perc')
When I fuck, I make it hurt (She do)
Whatever works (Whatever works)
The bitch gettin' money, you better dig in her purse (Bitch)
I take whatever she worth (I take whatever she worth, ayy)
Ayy, I take whatever she worth (Sweetheart, ayy, ayy, ayy)

Sweetheart (Sweetheart), uh (Sweetheart)
What's a thotty (Sweetheart), to a gangster? (Sweetheart), uh
(Sweetheart, sweetheart)
I'm wildin' (Sweetheart), got no answers

I got an extendo on this fifty clip, shit look like a broom (Sweetheart)
When you see me, better Woo (Woo)
Or bullets start flyin' through the room (Sweetheart)
I pop a Perc', hold on (Uh)
To get in the mood
And its twenty-five for the walk
I leave with like three baddies when I'm through
I spend like a hunnid bands in jewels (Jewels)
Drippin' like I came out the pool (Like I came out the pool, wait, wait)
I'm so exotic, like I came out the zoo (Ayy, ayy, ayy, hold on)
Stupid bitch, do I look like a fool? (Do I look like a fool?)
I'm from New York, where they Woo (Woo)
In a two-door, I shot out the coupe (Sweetheart)

Sweetheart (Sweetheart), uh (Sweetheart)
What's a thotty (Sweetheart), to a gangster? (Sweetheart), uh
(Sweetheart, sweetheart)
I'm wildin' (Sweetheart), got no answers10Embed
