FEAR OF GOD
EVIL IS COMING ALIVE
INSIDE
TERROR INSIDE
I'LL REACH INSIDE AND TEAR OUT YOUR HEART
I TOOK YOUR SOUL RIPPED IT ALL APART!
FEAR OF GOD
DARK INSIDE
COME ALIVE
COMING ALIVE!

In my town
This is my town
This is my country
Anything here belongs to me
You want a piece of candy?
Hey little bitch, do you want a piece of candy?You might also likeEmbed
