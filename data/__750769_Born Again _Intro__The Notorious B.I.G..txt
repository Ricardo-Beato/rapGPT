13 ContributorsBorn Again (Intro) Lyrics
What about ten years from now?
Ten years from now, where do I want to be?
I wanna be... just livin', man
Just living comfortably with my niggas, man
In a pool and shit, smoking plenty indo, you know I'm saying?
I got my wife, just lounging with my wife, you know I'm saying?
With my daughter, her daughter, you know
Just laid back, just chillin', you know I'm saying?
Living all my niggas is living where I think I be?
Ten years, I don't think I will see it
For real dog, for real, man
That shit ain't promised, man
I don't think my luck is that good, I hope it is
But if it ain't, so be it, I'm ready
(You're dead wrong)

The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
