Uh, just point out the bounce, uh-huh
Show me the bounce, yeah
Just point out the bounce, geah
Timbo the king, yeah
Young Hov the king, yeah
Just point out the bounce, yes
Just point out the bounce nigga
Yo, listen

Rumor has it The Blueprint classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevara
Now it's a whole museum of Hov MC'ers
Everybody dupin' the flowâ€”you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like they tryna make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and Kanyeezy
See how we adjust to the game so easy
Chicks belly dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like, "Oh shit, he's so handsome"
Still in demand in the longest run standing
Kidnapped rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back, no rap
Young Hov's going to Canton, I'ma land ya

(Point out the bounce) I'll show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
(Point out the bounce) I turn a eighth to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R-O-C
(Point out the bounce) Timbo the king, nigga (Uh-huh, woo)
Uh-huh, ay, uh
(Point out the bounce) Geah, young Hov the king, nigga
Uh, I got y'all

For those that think Hov fingers bling-blingin'
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is
And single that out to be the meaning of what he's about
And being I'm about my business, not mingling much
Running my mouth, that shit kept lingering
But no, dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinkling
The album with to keep the registers ringing
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Geah, you jingling, baby
See, I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real OG should
"Oh, he's good"
"No, he would never sell out, he's so hood"
(Point out the bounce) I'll show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
(Point out the bounce) I turn a eighth to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R-O-C
(Point out the bounce) Timbo the king, nigga (Uh-huh, woo)
Uh-huh, ay, uh
(Point out the bounce) Geah, young Hov the king, nigga
Uh, uh (Yeah)

Magazines call me a (Rockstar) girls call me (Cock star)
Billboard (Popstar) neighborhood (Block star)
Chi-Town go-gettin' pimps (We mobsters)
Gingerbread Man even said, "You're a monster!"
Yeah, that's how I feel (Uh-huh)
To be down, you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated R
O-C, OG, Bobby Johnson son
Ask me, "Ray-Ray, is that yo' car?"
"I seen MTV, I know who you are"
"You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas?"
I did take over the game, brought back the soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum to go, yeah, that's the flow
All I know, I gots to blow
And I don't play pause, I'm from Chicago
I'll show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
(Point out the bounce) I turn a eighth to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R-O-C
(Point out the bounce) Timbo the king, nigga, uh
(Point out the bounce) Geah, young Hov the king, nigga

Point out the bounce
Point out the bounce
Point out the bounce
Point out the bounce
