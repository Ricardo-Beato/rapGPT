92 ContributorsCellz Lyrics
Born like this, into this
As the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs
As political landscapes dissolve
As the oily fish spit out their oily prey
We are born like this, into this
Into hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die
Into lawyers who charged so much, it's cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed
Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this, walking and living through this
Dying because of this
Castrated, debauched, disinherited, because of this
The fingers reach toward an unresponsive God
The fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
It will be guns and roving mobs, land will be useless
Food will become a diminishing return
Nuclear power will be taken over by the many
Explosions will continually shape the earth
Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
The rotting bodies of men and animals stink in the dark wind
And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard
Born out of that, the sun hidden there
Awaiting the next chapter
You might also like
DOOM from the realm of El Kulum, smelly gel fume
Separating cell womb to Melle Mel, BOOM
Revelations in Braille, respiration inhale, view
Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail, make due
Blazing swords trace the haze, praise the Lord
Saving Grace, lace your broad, she say she bored
A crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin
Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison
A bad samaritan averagin' above average men
Rancid rants havin' ramblin' savages scavengin'
For scraps, perhaps roadkill, if that
Gift of gab, and he flow ill, chrome stiff hat
Known for writin' lightnin' tight lines, chiefin', beefin'
Bein' off deep ends, divine bright shines even
Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine
Slight rewind, tightly bind, blind lead blind
Need mines now, that was this is then, listenin'
To sizzlin' officialtons whisperin' "Him again"
Metal Face Finster playin' with the dirty money
Sinister, don't know what he sayin' but the words be funny
Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet
Save your breath, gave a F, pay your debt, they forget
Make her sweat bullets, crime pays no benefits
Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates
Three thousand years ago, Moses said:
"Every human being is responsible for his actions
Or thy being is still a beast, not yet human!"

You ought to let your uncle flow, my motorcycle trunkfuls
From two-one two-one, lose crumbs to chunks in bundles
Hands down, better than what your mans used to get
Standin' around from where the translucent looses spit
Missin' wheel, you don't listen, you're a feel-head
Sittin' in the kitchen pissin', twitchin', kissin' steel lead
Crime pays no dental, nor medical
Unless you catch retirement, county, state or federal
You heard like roaring waters in a seashell
If a tree fell, you couldn't tell from three cell
Be real careful, they tell him by the earful
Kids doing skid bids, acting out is terrible
Word is bond, fix your clothes, put a shirt on
Pants sagging back when you used to meant you had a skirt on
Squirts posin' as thuggers and hustlers
El Eloh closer than y'alls ball huggers and jugglers
Motherfuckers!

DOOM is transmitting a message to you
Super fools
