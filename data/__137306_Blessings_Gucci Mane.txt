12 ContributorsBlessings Lyrics
To wake up in the morning is a motherfuckin' blessin'
Grab my AK I ain't motherfuckin' stressin'
Standing in the kitchen and I'm whippin' up the babies
Only thing on my mind is how to buy me a Mercedes
Scrapin' up the pot, tryna come up with the extra
Young niggas rob and I heard that they finesse ya
Ain't no pressure, get the .38 special
Only thing on my mind is how to put you on a stretcher

I pull up solo dolo in a motherfuckin' Lambo
Sippin' lean all on my Polo, makin' niggas out examples
Your girlfriend want a photo cuz she say she like my wardrobe
Got Louie on my feet and I got diamonds in my earlobes
My prices buy so low but shawty tell me somethin' I don't know
My niggas are so cuthroat man they dirty like a dope bowl
I made a hundred thousand right on Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Worth a half a million when I moved over to Creel Road
Servin' through the _____ with the do' closed
Got more blocks than Dikembe Mutumbo
Gave holmes a whole thang to blow a nigga head off
.44 bulldog when I drop the bread off

To wake up in the morning is a motherfuckin' blessin'
Grab my AK I ain't motherfuckin' stressin'
Standing in the kitchen and I'm whippin' up the babies
Only thing on my mind is how to buy me a Mercedes
Scrapin' up the pot, tryna come up with the extra
Young niggas rob and I heard that they finesse ya
Ain't no pressure, get the .38 special
Only thing on my mind is how to put you on a stretcher
You might also like
I pulled up with a chauffeur and my motherfuckin' Rolls Royce
Glock 19 bought my purp and a pair of Jordans
Gucci Mane my nigga so you know I fuck with Bricksquad
My ___ speak bilingual don't do English, they the brick squad
2 tops on my Vette, middle finger to a squad car
Cool hundred bricks, that fill up a smart car
Energy efficient niggas winnin' on the gas rate
48 a pound, want 10? Okay 38
Amaze me, while the kitchen slave me
One time to the dope boys, they the ones who raised me
I fuck with the robbers, I hang with the murderers
Finna get that new Bentley, but then didn't come convertible

To wake up in the morning is a motherfuckin' blessin'
Grab my AK I ain't motherfuckin' stressin'
Standing in the kitchen and I'm whippin' up the babies
Only thing on my mind is how to buy me a Mercedes
Scrapin' up the pot, tryna come up with the extra
Young niggas rob and I heard that they finesse ya
Ain't no pressure, get the .38 special
Only thing on my mind is how to put you on a stretcher

I been gettin' money since I motherfuckin' came here
Same shit, cop and go, naw ain't nothin' change here
Know I got that haze, sour, and a couple kushes
Shorty got the rock, and the Glock is in the bushes
One already in the head, hollows in a full clip
All my niggas bout that bread, we ain't bout that bullshit
Work is good, make sure your connect keep it real with you
Hundred on the chain, quarter million on the vehicle
Spit a couple bars, get some budgets, sign a deal or two
Drink some liquor, fuck some bad bitches, pop a pill or two
Killin' you, young black rich nigga, ain't no need in stressin'
Be thankful for what you got my nigga, it's a blessin'
To wake up in the morning is a motherfuckin' blessin'
Grab my AK I ain't motherfuckin' stressin'
Standing in the kitchen and I'm whippin' up the babies
Only thing on my mind is how to buy me a Mercedes
Scrapin' up the pot, tryna come up with the extra
Young niggas rob and I heard that they finesse ya
Ain't no pressure, get the .38 special
Only thing on my mind is how to put you on a stretcher1Embed
