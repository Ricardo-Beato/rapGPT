I ain't got my eye on you
Ain't been hypnotized by you, yeah
Ain't in here tryna find my dude
I take it you just like the way I wine pon you

How I wine pon you

Take it you just like the way I wine pon you
Take it you just like the way I wine pon you, yeah

You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens
You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens

Yeah, yeah
Pop that like Ginkgo biloba
That booty don't need no more soda
Too hot, now this boy don't need no more doja
Leg on the seat, that's a photo
See that you focused
If there's no room, boy, we squeeze in the corner
Way that he talking, you think that he know her
Hold up
See baby, this for the night, I won't see you tomorrow
Yeah, but when I dance here, boy you better man up
Be like a museum, got you looking, boy you can't touch
Yeah, I got him speaking, got him geeking, tie them hands up
Tappin to the beat, you wanna freak her 'cause she random
Know you got your girl here, looking for your ass, run
Faking that you loyal, boy, you playing with her passion
Even when the beat slow, I shake a lil' faster
Twerking on the speaker, know you need her in your fan club
