Haha
Yeah
Had to do this one
One time

Hello, death, it seems that we meet again
You keep taking friends that I'll never see again
I guess they gotta leave
But if we pretend that they never left
Well, we gon' see them then
Never leave our heart, never leave our thoughts
As time goes by, they'll never be forgot
Life goes on, though I wish that they was there
Shit like this never gonna seem fair, yeah
So can I have a moment of silence
For anyone who's gone from the coldness of violence?
And I know you wanna see me go to college
But I'm sorry, I don't think that I'ma make it
Because this world is mine for the takin'
So when I get famous, they gon' know what your name is
And no one understand what the pain is
And how the blood run numb where my veins is
I'd like to thank you, 'cause you made me a man
Told me to never let it go, so I'm taking a stand
Always in the crowd when I played in the band
Your grandson is everything I say that I am
And maybe I am a little bit over my head
But I'm feeling so alone tryna cope with your death
Holding my breath, wishing I had one more day
Wishing you could be there when I graduate
Ugh, and it's sad to say
That no one in this room understand me
I know you had to leave, so rest in peace
But please, can you watch over Nanny?
'Cause she loved you, and I love you
All the prayers I'm saying may bug you
But I'm just checking in on what you up to
So, how they treating you up there?
Too stubborn for a cane, way too cool
Sleeping at your house, walking me to school
Thought I was a fool when my grades started slipping
When I played ball, you was always in admission
You loved me more than I've been loved before
And that's a type of thing that everyone ignores
But not me, you got me
Always and forever, Poppy

Time goes by, going without you
Hope you know I've been thinking about you
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That they took you from your home
But you're in my heart
So I'm never gonna be alone
Time goes by, going without you
Hope you know I've been thinking about you
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That they took you from your home
But you're in my heart
So I'm never gonna be alone13Embed
