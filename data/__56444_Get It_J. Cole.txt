34 ContributorsGet It Lyrics
Gotta get my groove back, you know?
It's been a little minute
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

Label me greedy, but see me finish what Petey started
From Carolina where niggas spray like graffiti artists
The south nigga, niggas used to think we retarded
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggas (yea)
I fuck with non rapping niggas, non clapping niggas
Niggas is real, y'all is action figures (Ha)
Ain't into acting bigger than I really am
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man
Where the beef at?
Back in the days I ain't even go out for recess
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes
And niggas GATs got bodies like video hoes
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04
No disrespect to my favorite player
Niggas praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich
So I'm slaying niggas, yeah
You might also like
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead, up in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Uh)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Yeah)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Yeah)
I'ma get it, nigga, I gotta get it

Yeah
Niggas in the streets know
Nigga bless beats, I got that priest flow, heavenly
You gonna cross over if he reach for the rock
Just a figure a speech for the Glock
From the Ville, where police know the heat flow a lot (Yeah)
Like a beach, yo, itâ€™s hot, niggas laid out
Caught a fake nigga centerfield, it's 'cause they played out
Watch our boys fade out, niggas tryna hate
If he only knew my dick's in his dame mouth
Just made out, came out the woodworks
Now they tryna peep a nigga footwork
I'm getting real green, y'all niggas playing on some good turf
Fake money, scared money, never make money
And a nigga never fear nothing but God, fuck a facade, I'm just
Focused on stuffing my pockets up with them wads and shit
Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit
Been dreaming 'bout millions since a nigga was five or six
And so I strive, I'm the God, this some bible shit
Nigga I
Yeah
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead, up in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Uh)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Yeah)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna get it (Yeah)
I'ma get it, nigga, I gotta get it

Tell 'em visions Geppetto, my niggas in ghettos with Scarface dreams
On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen
Niggas killing niggas in broad day on all they screens
Watching cops loving car chase scenes
Niggas arrested
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested
All created equal looks like equal to a less than
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man
I hate to see the position my niggas left in
Sling dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage
Ashamed
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle?
Yeah, it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though
Instead they wanted us to break, they never wanted us to make it (Yeah)
To my niggas: smarten up until we smart enough to take it, nigga2Embed
