35 ContributorsLove Me Forever (Chopped & Screwed) Lyrics
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever

She let me ride it like a caravan baby
I swear I need you to come lay right there with me
She say she down and she gon' lay and care for me
I don't know why she like the air that I'm breathing in
Baby, breathe in with me
You make me go brazy, I know you won't judge me
You might turn to wifey, give you wife things and babies

I want you to love me forever
Baby you know that I came here for your destiny
She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby
She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage

She want it heavy like a bear
I told her drop that shit right here
I cut that pussy, barber chair
Then I'm goin' psh off in the air
You might also like
Shine it up then bounce it, climbing in it just like a mountain
My bankroll big like a bouncer, spitting game like a counselor
Big old cross like a pastor, pop that pussy like a Snapple
Bitch I'm bleeding, where the napkins?
Body red like an apple
Screaming free my brothers, I still sleep with my mother
Last week I made a quarter, plus I still respect others
I can't believe it's not butter, that little bitch might be my supper
I get respect from her brother, Crenshaw boolin', Nipsey Hussle
Still prepared for them arrest, YSL we gon' wrestle
Chanel pouch on my left, fuck the cops we don't play
Benjamins, Grants talk back, I be like "who is that?"
They be like "where you at?", meet at the Valet at Saks

I want you to love me forever
Baby you know that I came here for your destiny
She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby
She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage

I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
Until we meet each other, oh
I want you to love me forever
Love me forever
I want you to love me forever
She love my life and she don't care
I flood my bitch and I don't care what they say about it
You just a diamond in the mine and you dirty
I like my bitches brown like James, no Worthy
Scratched out the alphabet, 'cept B bitch
Woah, she standing naked bookin' bhicken
Woah, I need them thick thighs on my chicken
You know, just got dropped off by Scotty Pippen
Woah, and I just wanna be loved11Embed
