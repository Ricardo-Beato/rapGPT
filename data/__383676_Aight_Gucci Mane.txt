16 ContributorsAight Lyrics
I know why they fuck with Bricksquad
Real recognize real, it's Gucc'

My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, 'aight
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, I'm straight
My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, fuck nigga
I'mma get mine by any means

Don't worry about me I'm 'aight
My pockets on take off finna take flight
My momma told me go and get that cheese
Gotta help the family put the shit on me
Shit get real out here in the jungle
Ion' trust a young nigga, I'm just tryin' to stay humble
Nigga wanna hit my phone bout some marijuana
I wrap the pack up and get that shit to Tijuana
My daddy died, I miss you
But still nigga I'm 'aight (Aight?)
You niggas is fake, you niggas is snake
You go left, I'mma go right
When Gucci called my manager, that night it changed my life
Now all my hard work paid on, Young Quavo I earned my stripes
Gone!

My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, 'aight
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, I'm straight

My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, fuck nigga
I'mma get mine by any means

Every time you see me nigga I be with a thousand
Young niggas that's wildin', all my dogs be growlin'
All my wolves be howlin', all my shooters prowlin'
Goin' hard in the paint on these pussy ass niggas
Cause a fuck nigga tried to foul me
Bitch get the fuck from 'round me
Crown me cause I'm royalty
All my niggas loyal to me, all my hoes they spoil me
You are not a plug if you don't charge what I'm charging
Caught a murder charge, thanks to God I beat the charges
Shooters jumpin' out the van when the van park
In East Atlanta my house is a landmark
Your favorite rapper in the Gucci Mane fan club
I had to run out just to run my bands up
You wanna be a CEO then get your grands up
You wanna jack me you better change your plan up
Broke into my house and they keep bringin' your name up
Decapitation now you can't put your hands up
It's Gucc'
My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, 'aight
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, I'm straight
My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, fuck nigga
I'mma get mine by any means6Embed
