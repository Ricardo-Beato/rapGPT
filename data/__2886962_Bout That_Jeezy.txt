26 ContributorsBout That Lyrics
Yeah, ugh
Man (Ugh), D. Rich what's happenin'?
(Haha) Yeah
For real niggas, though
Best of the best, nigga, you fuckin' with the champ
Know that

I put them O's in the microwave (What's up?), but you ain't 'bout that there (What's up?)
Talk a whole brick of white today, but you ain't 'bout that there
Got that Muller on my wrist today (What's up?) but you ain't 'bout that there (Yeah)
Don't make me fuck your bitch today, 'cause you ain't bout that there
You ain't 'bout that (Nah), you ain't 'bout that there (No way)
You ain't 'bout that (Nah), you ain't 'bout that there (No way)
You ain't 'bout that (Nah), you ain't 'bout that there (No way)
You ain't 'bout that (Nah), you ain't 'bout that there (No way, what's up? What's up? Let's go)

Star let the hammer go, I ain't talkin' 'bout astrology (What's up?)
For any pussy got it, lil bitch you owe me an apology (Haha!)
Only talkin' bout that trappin' shit, I opened up the door for that (Yeah, Young)
I coulda stopped at 101, tell me who shit comin' close to that
But you know how the saying goes how I cut the tape make a wish (Woo)
Call your clientele, say I'm 'bout to make your favorite dish (What's up, haha)
My wrists can't keep my arms close, yeah I'm talkin' Arnold Schwarzenegger (Schwarzenegger)
Dropped the mixtapes, changed the game (Yeah)
Whoever thought it'd be a Georgia nigga? (Young)
Jumped off the porch but I landed on my feet (Me)
Heard it's real in the field, went and bought a set of cleats (Haha!)
See it in the air, nigga (Woo), yeah, the crib like Disneyland (Damn)
I ain't stop since I started, guess I've been a busy man (Ayy)

Talkin' all that shit then we gon' have to talk to you in private
What block you on? We gon' spin around it, leave dead bodies, fuck them zombies, goddamn
And you ain't bout that life (That life), not the combat life (Uh-uh)

Bitch I'm still winnin', yeah it's like I got some trick dice (Trick dice)
And if that pussy so and so then I won't hit that bitch twice
You heard about what's-her-name who ran off on the plug, right?
Caught him and they opened up his top like a muglite
Posted in the spot, look like a zebra with these damn stripes (Young shit, nigga)
Hopped out the Porsche like, "Fuck The Source"
I still ain't get them five mics (What's up?)
Find a nigga better, if you let a nigga know the nigga
Yeah, I hear the shit they talking, it ain't like a nigga slippin'
Nigga I can make it hustlin and I can make it rappin' (Yeah)
On the gram with a pic, now that's a mean caption (Haha!)
Now what you know about that 36 (Six), I can make it double, hoe (Double)
They hit you when you ballin', they don't see you when you struggle though

I put them O's in the microwave (What's up?), but you ain't 'bout that there (What's up?)
Talk a whole brick of white today, but you ain't 'bout that there
Got that Muller on my wrist today (What's up?) but you ain't 'bout that there (Yeah)
Don't make me fuck your bitch today, 'cause you ain't bout that there
You ain't 'bout that (Nah), you ain't 'bout that there (No way)
You ain't 'bout that (Nah), you ain't 'bout that there (No way)
You ain't 'bout that (Nah), you ain't 'bout that there (No way)
