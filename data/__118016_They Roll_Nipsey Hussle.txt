25 ContributorsThey Roll Lyrics
Rollin on slauson rollin on slauson rollin on slauson
Compton's in the house
Compton's in the house

Blue converse nigga
Rich rollin from the dirt just bangin my turf
Like Snoop did
Same color rag just a new crip
Blue bandanas blue dickies and a deuce fifth
Slauson ave ain't the side you could truce with
Homicide city turned these young niggas ruthless
With loose lips will make a snitch nigga shoes slip
Pistol introduce a pussy nigga to the pulpit
Blue rag "S" hat gold on my neck fat
Gun case catch that cause neighborhood I rep that
Bust heads peel caps cook coke sell crack
Hit the county jail make yo enemies run that
Momma know my gun clap granny know my gun clap
Shoot it out fuck that
Duck down bust back
Deuce deuces on my cadillac
California state of mind since Kurupt dropped with battle cat

Some niggas crippin and some niggas don't
Times get so crazy when you're out on your own
Some niggas bloodin and some niggas don't
Times get so crazy when you're out on your own
We gets it crackin like the old G's used to do
We keeps it crackin like the old G's use to do in 85 and 87 and 91
Them gangstas they roll them gangstas they roll
You might also like
Red converse nigga
Soo woopin from the dirt nigga
Bangin my turf like snoop did
And it's still 187 on a mothafuckin cop
When I'm dippin down the block banging Black Superman
And CJ Mack naw Game wasn't the first with the L.A. tat
It was Keita Rock I'm the blood him straight from Cedar block
Name still painted on the wall I never leave the block
Can't stop won't stop gotta keep the heater cocked
Fiends like S Dot they'll never leave the rock
Palm trees crips bloods hundreds in the strip club
Game soo wooped out and Nipsey all cripped up
C walk B walk stompin in my red chucks
Red rag pants sag nigga I don't give a fuck
Bigger rims on bigger trucks
California state of mind since Pac drop Hit Em Up

Some niggas crippin and some niggas don't times get so crazy when your
Out on your own some niggas bloodin and some niggas don't cause times
Get so crazy when your out on your own we gets it crackin like the old G's
Use to do we keeps it crackin like the old G's use to do in 85 and 87 and 91
Them gangstas live on them gangstas they roll3Embed
