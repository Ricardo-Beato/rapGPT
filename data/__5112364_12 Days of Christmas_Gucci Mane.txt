14 Contributors12 Days of Christmas Lyrics
True story
I used to hate Christmas
For real

On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
A half of a brick, told me feed my family
I took it to the hood, then I dropped it in the sink (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Then I whipped it into a whole thing
Jumped off the porch early, man it was '93
I had old hoes on my dick when I was 13 (Facts)
On the second day of Christmas, I bought an MC
Supersport and I set it on G’s
Wopped so many niggas had to paint that bitch green
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas, nigga ask about me
On the third day of Christmas, my old plug sent to me
Ten milk jugs full of pills and like eighty bales of weed
On the fourth day, said, "Fuck that shit," went on a spree
I got niggas still want payback for shit did in '03
It’s vibe, what the fuck you want a fifth and on the sixth
On the seventh day of Christmas, got a new drum for the stick (Wack' em)

Shit funny now
Ain't funny then, yeah
Fuck it

On the eighth day of Christmas, I got into a beef (I did)
Ninth day of Christmas, they beggin' me for peace (They did)
Tenth day of Christmas, they callin' up police (Chill)
Niggas try to stop it, but they started it with me
Rentals called the house, they gon' terminate the lease (No)
Eleventh day of Christmas, put our shit out on the streets (Fuck)
Twelfth day of Christmas, got my momma losin' sleep
It might be Christmas to you, but just another day to me

I hate Christmas2Embed
