3 Contributors1st Time (feat. Consequence) Lyrics
There’s a first time for everything
There’s a first time for everything
But don’t be afraid of what’s in the dark
Just open your eyes and see what’s in they heart
I remember the first time I left it up to you
But I learned from the first time to never trust in you

Ay yo, the first time ever I saw your face
I recall the case
Cut the grass now I see all the snakes
My lawyer man cake
Cause of you he’s been employed by the beef
And now it’s time to half court in the street
Falling asleep on your boy is not recommended
He felt the weapon in your chest because I’m well respected
So when you disrespect reflection then your health effected
I go harder than any demon that hell invented
I never felt threatened
By none of these industry motherfuckers
Cause they smucks and they blood suckers
You can come quicker than sideways or backwards
I always come straight up in your face
Your mistake is confusing me with a rapper
That interviews and a fashion
You assuming I’m passive
I’m really truly a master
Of lyrically moving masses
It’s true but if you attack us
I’m never the one to back off
Never the one to slack off
I’m making them take the mask off
It’s beautiful when I black out, it’s natural like disasters
My body is like a host for a ghost of the middle passage
You not imagining the noise you hear is laughter
They giggle behind your back you enacted your family matters
You read into what’s happening and kill it like an assassin
Looking for that applause when all you get is the clappin’
I’m serious about my craft don’t ever confuse the masses
By taking my outtakes and trying to repackage them
It’s never forgive action
You might also like

You only get one chance to make a first impression
That’s why I always make sure I come the freshest
Whether I start or my words ending
I’m here to exercise my first amendment
Which gives you the right to get your verse played
I almost lost that after the third grade
Cause on the first and fifteen before I stayed
My team was the first to get paid
So why would you cross us in the first place
Unless you willing to catch a first case
You better all go on on your first date
To see if you can get past first base
This the first taste of what the pain gave me
You listen to the rumors you would think they played me
But they my juniors, my first babies
I only deal with presidents like the first lady
Who pay me on a first name basis
I don’t like you niggas I’m almost racist
That’s why I’m cursing the first person or cursing the first person who didn’t make my first purchase
But type my name in they word searches
Cause I kill the flow bring out the first hearses
And this will be the first crime you ever seen
But it’s cool cause there’s a first time for everything

Before the ink dried and the deal was finalized
And the money changed hands and the plan was monetized
We used to eat mcdonalds fries
Shop for economy size
Know when economists lie
We poor we trying to survive
Another stat-istic of a man with some kind of pride
I’m getting black listed like I’ve got a communist tie
Little did I know it was myself I was trying to find
Getting all kind of high
Crashing like vehicular homicide
But now I’m self employed and I’m chilling
I’m waking up with the millionaires
You looking for the building I’m still in there
Still in fear
Scared of the dark that don’t matter
When the lights come on the cockroaches scatter
Exposing the data
Yo get a load of these actors
They cloak and dagger
See how I broke they swagger
My spirit is rich
Yea the lyrics is sick
Get prepared lyricist of the year in this bitch
