Yo yo yo
Microphone, microphone check
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus
My hazeus, my hazeus view?
You ain't running with the apes yet, apex at the Empire State neck
Hand no crown, my niggas take that
In this state of mind, gotta state facts, suspect nigga
Get your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999
Who'd've thought that 19 I might be in my prime?
Thought of the right scheme, everything else align
Here's a penny for your thoughts, another one, another one
Eventually the dream was bought
Now that's a real, real, real mind fuck
Might fuck up your mind if you're lighting up
Make sure the ting is tight enough
If you tough, I'm a titan, like Zeus I enlighten them
Kick flows 'til it's kung-fu fighting them
Is it him, it is you who was nice as him?
I don't see nobody, no, no
I don't see nobody, no, no
You might also like
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?

You rap niggas ain't safe yet, hah
I keep the bombs in my basement
When I detonate, you can feel the vibrations
I got your mind shaking, am I right?
My light gon' spark for generations
One day my voice will be heard on every radio station
Cause fake to real ratio changing and it's
Everyday living in this life I see
That in every way they wanna see my life decease
But I survive the question is for how long
Since my homie died, I been trying to hold on
The happy days of my life is now all gone
But I cope with that weed I smoke and writing these songs
But it's should I stay should I go? Oh!
Should I stay should I go? Oh!
I don't know, I don't know
Lord please let me know
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?

Every thing cool like in the state of mind
That this state of mine correct, cool, calm, collect
Deflect the corrupt with intellect
I talk too much, the jig is up, he has risen up
From a division of most kings
With their vision, positioned for precision
It's mind splitting and soul uplifting
But still feel so trapped in the solar system

And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
If I see you through my hazeus view
See you through my hazeus view
See you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus
My hazeus, my hazeus view
And I see you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus
My hazeus, my hazeus view71Embed
