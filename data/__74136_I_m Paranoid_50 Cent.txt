10 ContributorsIâ€™m Paranoid Lyrics
Shh... quiet... you hear that?
What the fuck, son?
I'm telling you, man, you gotta watch these niggas

I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggas looking at me like I'm something to eat

We thought the coke and the dope would help us escape poverty
When that didn't work we resorted to armed robbery
Yeah, I done it, but I ain't the one they said did it
Before my first verse my Benz had been kitted
I'm so hood, that's what the bitches like about me
She bob and weave, she up and down, she suck the life up out me
I tell you 'bout my regimen, I blow a stack stunting
The coldest shit I'm on it, kid, I'll blow a nigga fronting
I'm dirty, yeah, I do that dirt, I'm down to put that work in
I kick the door to get them bricks, that Eagle get to chirping
You see that beam on ya head, nigga leaking
Yeah, screaming and shit, man, shut the fuck up

I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggas looking at me like I'm something to eat
I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggas looking at me like I'm something to eat

I had a dream niggas got me
Woke up, a nigga shot me
I ain't slept in three days
My eyes red, something wrong with my head
The MAC stashed right under the pillow on my bed
It's not hot, why the fuck am I sweating?
My heart beating, I'm bugging, I wreck it
Bitch, don't move, it's dark, I might panic
Just sit still, I mean it, God damn it
My back against the wall
Fuck the world, I'll kill 'em all
Ain't a nigga too big or too small
Chop 'em down, watch 'em fall
Watch 'em bleed, watch 'em crawl
Watch 'em bleed 'til they gone

I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggas looking at me like I'm something to eat
I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep
Niggas trying to get me, man, give me my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggas looking at me like I'm something to eat
I'm paranoid
I can't even fucking sleep (I'm paranoid)
Bitch, quit playing, hand me my heat (I'm paranoid)
I can't even rest my head (I'm paranoid)
I'm fin to leave me a nigga dead

What? Niggas ain't fucking with me
I wish a nigga would
I've been taking it easy on these niggas, mane
I've been easy on 'em ,mane
I'ma turn it up now, yeah1Embed
