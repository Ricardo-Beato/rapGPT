9 ContributorsWelcome to Atlanta (Interlude) Lyrics
Hi-errr, this is the Captain ... speaking
We are now descending into Hartsfield International Airport
I'd like to welcome you to Atlanta
We have clear blue skies over Atlanta
Which, by the way, is the home of the Atlanta Hawks, the Braves, and the Falcons
To the far left, you can see the Georgia Dome
Which by the way still flies the Confederate battle flag
Atlanta has been called the new Motown of the South
And is the home of LaFace Records
Organized Noize Productions
If you look to your far right, you can see Decatur
And below you, to the right, is East Point and College Park
Home of the red dogs, rap cats, and robbin' crew
And home to the player, the 'Lacs, and the motherfuckin' OutKastYou might also likeEmbed
