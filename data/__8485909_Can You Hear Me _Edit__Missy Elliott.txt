3 ContributorsCan You Hear Me  Lyrics
Missy, it's Diane
The information for the
Where you can send the flowers to
The florist for Aaliyah
I'll give you the phone number in case you need it
Okay, Missy, take care of yourself
I love you
I love you, bye-bye

I been checkin' on your moms and dad (Uh)
And your brother since the day you left (Left)
Passed on and went away with God (Uh)
But for your mama, it's been so damn hard
I hate to even hear her cry (Cry)
Aaliyah, she asked me why (Why)
Would her baby girl go this way? (Oh)
Can you give me better words to say?

Comе one day, she'll see you again
With the samе old beautiful smile
Long hair and the voice of a hummingbird
You'll be singing them same old songs
Aaliyah, can you hear me?
I hope that you're proud of me
Me and Tim, we been doin' our thing
But it's never been the same since you had to go
I ain't never met a friend more incredible, oh
You might also like
I know you in real good hands (Uh)
With God, but damn, I miss you
Aaliyah, if you see Left Eye, will you (Uh-huh)
Tell her me and Boz miss her too? (Uh)
'Cause no one's gonna fill her space (Uh-uh)
T-C, L not replaced (Uh)
All the reasons we learned to love
Fly high with your twenty-two doves

One day, we'll see her again
With the same old beautiful smile
Crazy, but sexy cool
And she'll be rappin' them same old songs
Lisa, can you hear me?
We hope that you're proud of us
TLC has come a long way
But it's never been the same since you had to go
'Cause the healing process will be long and slow (Yeah)

Aaliyah, I know you in a safer place
You're face-to-face with the creator and our maker
And if you and Left Eye happen to chat
Tell her me and Tionne, we know she much safer
If you see Biggie Smalls up in the clouds
Tell him he's still the illest emcee we had around
2Pac, there is only one, Big Pun, R.I.P.​
We say one, yeah, yeah
One day, we'll see y'all again
With the same old beautiful smiles
All styles, so many styles
And y'all be doin' the same old things
The last time we seen ya
We hope y'all can change the world
Let 'em see how short life be
It will never be the same since ya had to go
To the music world, y'all are incredible

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

This is the end
Bye, motherfucker, nah, I'm just playin'
Anyway, uh, you know, once again, I hope y'all enjoyed what y'all heard
You know, I know somebody gon' walk through the door who say they still don't feel me
They, you know, don't like my album or maybe somebody just shitted in your corn flakes, so maybe somethin' stink
But, far as I'm concerned, I do what I do the best way I can
So hopefully you felt some old school flavor in there
You, you may not feel like I'm, I'm a real hip-hop artist, but
I don't have to be, I grew up on hip-hop and that's what motivated me to do music
Uh, beef back then wasn't death threats between two artists
Beefs was, you know, uh, who had the realest skills, who was the dopest on the mic
So magazine, ready your folks, whomever, you know, this shit is kinda in your court
I know sometimes you want the best stories and you gotta eat too just like everybody else
But sometimes we gotta sacrifice and say the best stories don't have to be somethin' negative
Let's not wait 'til we lose another important emcee in the rap game to start sayin' chill out with the dumb shit
And all of that, you know, um
We could all stand for goin' under a lil' construction
So right now, I ain't gon' turn into Reverend Elliott on y'all
I just love music and if you don't like it, I don't give a shit
Aight, basically, I love ya, God bless, goodnightEmbed
