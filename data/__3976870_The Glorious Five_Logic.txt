68 ContributorsThe Glorious Five Lyrics
Yeah
We gon' let this shit rock
Hey
That's the "Cole hey" from back in the day
Hey, yeah

Just a youngin' with a dream
Tryna get this money, yeah, I'm tryin' get this cream
Not a lot know what I mean, for this rap shit I'm a fiend
Not one to talk about poppin' pills and sippin' lean
Just a passion for pussy, I'm tryin' to get up in the spleen
This is my mentality rappin' at nineteen
Back in Maryland just tryin' to break out on the scene
Buyin' fake chains at the mall so girls be like "Ooh, he clean"
Daydreams that my life is like a movie scene
Sippin' liquor, puffin' green, so obscene
Ride around the city with my homies in a gat
We was lookin' for trouble, now where's it at?
Paint the picture like Picasso, matter fact like Sam Spratt
Even younger I was trippin' skippin' school writin' raps
Never on the road but on the roll like them craps
Check the facts
Endless rhyme books in my backpack
Like that, uh
I guess I acted out from lack of a father figure
Go figure, performin' at open mics wishin' I could go bigger
I was never in it for the money like a gold digger
Every time my daddy call me he be like, "Ayo nigga, where the money at?"
Yeah, that's what he'd say, "Little boy, you know you know I saw you on a PJ
When you gon' fly me out, when you gon' smoke me out?"
Always throw demands out, motherfuck a handout
All I ever wanted was a daddy
But that man priority was huggin' with a fatty
But I'm glad he did 'cause it made me who I am
Now I'm the man that I always wish he woulda been
And never started smokin' crack; imagine just what could have been, damn
Always felt like somethin' it was missin'
Wish we could have played catch, had talks, and went fishin'
But had no one there to listen
Now it feel like my life mission is to be the best dad when the time come
For my daughter and my son when the time come
Teach 'em 'bout they heritage and where they come from
Teach 'em 'bout they family history and then some

I've been on the grind tryin' find my way (Ayo, ayo ayy)
People come and go but I'ma be the one to stay (Ayo, ayo ayy)
People tell me I should live my life they way (Ayo, ayo ayy)
All I know is that I'm gonna make it one day (Ayo, ayo ayy)
I've been on the grind tryin' find my way (Ayo, ayo ayy)
People come and go but I'ma be the one to stay (Ayo, ayo ayy)
People tell me I should live my life they way (Ayo, ayo ayy)
All I know is that I'm gonna make it one day (Ayo, ayo ayy)

Yeah, yeah
Bobby, don't do it to 'em
You're beautiful and you don't gotta prove it to 'em
Come on, come on Bobby, you ain't shit though
Why your personality be split though?
One minute it's PLP, the next that shit be slit throats
Devil and an angel on my shoulder, that's my conscious
Greatest rapper alive but never actin' Pontius
Keep yourself in check like a dollar amount
You ain't better than nobody based on your dollar amount
Yeah, you've grown accustomed to the lifestyle but you never bougie
Nah, you never brand new, no it's never who's he
See, I hate when I get recognized
And while the fan is hypnotized
I'm approached by random guys who feel the need to emphasize
"I don't know who you are"
I reply "I'm a gentleman and a fuckin' rap star"
Put your lighters in the sky if you got 'em
This for anybody that feel like they at the bottom
Nobody to tell 'em they special, you know I got 'em
Nobody there to tell them they love them, well I got 'em
Uh, no matter where you go you gotta persevere
Ain't no fuckin' around, ain't no makin' a sound, no you just gotta murder the fear
Yeah I've been thinkin' about it, been tryna get out of it
Fuck what I'm thinkin', it's time to break out of it
Findin' myself in the thick and the debt of it
Had a bit and I knew wanted to murder the son
And I'm ready to get it, motherfuck a critic, I'm livin' my life and
I've been on the grind tryin' find my way (Ayo, ayo ayy) (Uh, yeah)
People come and go but I'ma be the one to stay (Ayo, ayo ayy) (Yeah)
People tell me I should live my life they way (Ayo, ayo ayy) (Oh yeah)
All I know is that I'm gonna make it one day (Ayo, ayo ayy) (Oh yeah)
I've been on the grind tryin' find my way (Ayo, ayo ayy, ah) (Oh)
People come and go but I'ma be the one to stay (Ayo, ayo aye) (Like yeah)
People tell me I should live my life they way (Ayo, ayo aye) (Yeah)
All I know is that I'm gonna make it one day (Ayo, ayo aye) (Uh, yeah)47Embed
