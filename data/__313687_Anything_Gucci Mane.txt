You can't tell me anything, no you can't talk to me
You can't tell me anything, no you can't talk to me
Unless want 2 or 3, bricks they go for cheap
Shop with me, I got what you need
What you wanna get, two or three, nigga fuck with me
I be in the dope game, and I can sell ya anythang!
That boy that price too high, he a lie, he can't fuck with me
Gucci Mane got fire, I got fire, come and fuck with me!

Trash bag fulla this shit
That bitch so ugly, can't get a pull of this shit (naw!)
Treat me off my dick, that bitch so slick, I might just sue that bitch! (damn!)
Trap house ballin' so hard, they makin me - Lord I might just move this bitch! (woop!)
Lost 200 grams on water wippin', need some better bricks (fuck!)
Peep my new shit, Gucci Mane glue brick
I'm so slick, one brick be two bricks (yea!)
Cooler than a penguin in a cooler with a lot of juice
Shawty swallow yea your daughter and she use a lotta spit
I'm Mr. Million dollar dick, and I can pluck your bottom bitch
You better pay me in full, a nigga fully auto
Before I have your black ass burnt like charcoal (haaa)
Man-hunt for me just like Chapo (chapo)
And French Montana can bite my swag, but I'm still head honcho (wop!)

You can't tell me anything, no you can't talk to me
You can't tell me anything, no you can't talk to me
Unless want 2 or 3, bricks they go for cheap
Shop with me, I got what you need
What you wanna get, two or three, nigga fuck with me
I be in the dope game, and I can sell ya anythang!
That boy that price too high, he a lie, he can't fuck with me
Gucci Mane got fire, I got fire, come and fuck with me!

Sellin' bow after fuckin' bow, I just broke the bow
Serve it half or I serve it whole, I just broke the stove
Cash drop on the fucking spot, need another spot
I get top, get a nigga top, Gucci Mane got guap!
Drop my top with your main bitch, damn she off the leash!
Gotta mean lookin' at them jeans, as she po' my lean
Try to refrain from smoking the green, cause of all my friends
My girl said, "Me or the fucking lean!"  , and I choose the codeine
Bitch go 'head and leave, Ho just leave my keys
You can take this bullshit cause it means nothing to me
Said, "She ain't got nothin' on ya" , bitch he ain't got nothing on me!
And matter of fact bitch where's my pint at, cause you ain't my cup of tea!
(Guwop!)

You can't tell me anything, no you can't talk to me
You can't tell me anything, no you can't talk to me
Unless want 2 or 3, bricks they go for cheap
Shop with me, I got what you need
What you wanna get, two or three, nigga fuck with me
I be in the dope game, and I can sell ya anythang!
That boy that price too high, he a lie, he can't fuck with me
Gucci Mane got fire, I got fire, come and fuck with me!
If I can't top ya pridna, I got fidna
I got fidna for you widnite
Take a one-five put it in ninite
Take another one-five tryna hercule
And buy that bitch a burganby
You know that big convert for me (damn)
That all blue Bentley, pew! , I drop the top they papa smurfin' me
You fake-ballin' like Nerf
You on the turf
And you not worth a fuckin' thing, I think you're cursed
My ice is water you can surf (whoosh!)
Yea-yea-yea you can surf, that's what its worth
Wussup Lil' Dirk, 3 Hunna spent on a shirt
Yo' bitch wanna go berserk
On this stick, I'm on this stick wussup Lil' Tic
I left like seven bricks on the table, came from Eagles like Mike Vick
I got like six bitches controllin' me, like a muthafuckin' theist
(woop woop woop)
I drink that lean I got that fisker, got that fisker just like this bitch!2Embed
