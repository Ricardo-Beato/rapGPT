Aw-aw-aw-aw yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we goin' hard all year
Aw yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we goin' hard all year
Aw yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we goin' hard all year

Yeah, yeah
Came back to the scene, came back with a team
Like rap ain't a thing, I'ma do anything
I'ma rap, I'ma sing, yeah, I'm back, I'm the king
Came back from the trap to supply all the fiends like

Aw yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, wе goin' hard all year
We like "Aw yеah", just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we goin' hard all year

I'll be right back in a bit, sippin' on something, I'm lit
Internet throwin' a fit
Couldn't give a shit, bitch, get the fuck off my dick
This is that shit that gon' hit (Bet!)
Bobby don't claim no set, but it's just me and my gang
Ready to fuck up the game, BT3, now we at it again, man
You might also like
Aw yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we goin' hard all year
Aw yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we goin' hard all year

Yeah, yeah
Just me and the beat's got you feeling defeat
I came up on the street now I'm bringing the heat
Yeah, you know I got heat, ain't no need to repeat
I got happiness, ain't no need to repeat
I got number ones
Got no time for these rappers, I only got time for my son
Him and his mama the one
I got no time to attack all these people 'cause money is time
And you spend yours in all these places
While I'm on tour with all these faces
In these arenas you wish you was in
Maybe stop talkin' 'bout me and you'll win
I'm goin' in, yeah I'm goin' off
When they talkin' that shit, I just blow it off
When they talkin' that shit, I just show 'em love
'Cause when I speak, they gotta look above

Aw yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we goin' hard all year
Aw yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we goin' hard all year9Embed
