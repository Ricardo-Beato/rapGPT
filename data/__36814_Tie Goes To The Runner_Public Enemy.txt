1 ContributorTie Goes To The Runner Lyrics
"An outrage as a rap music group called Public Enemy... But these days, America is on a hair-trigger, and Public Enemy is taking some incoming fire on its own. It is music that is becoming more and more popular, so you should decide for yourself: is this art, or dangerous propaganda?"

Hold it, hold it! This is serious business, serious business, serious business! I don't stop time and again, y'all! Ninety-three, you know me! Operation Taxin' Station in the Nation! Serious business, you know me! Tie 'em 'round the neck, light the match, and go like this
"Yeah!"

Here a track I found underneath, findin' beats is a treat
And I don't care if it top, pop
Abracadabra can't keep a tab a
This stickin' around like D and it stuck, Chuck
Into a mode, unloadin', pop, pop, pop
Go the weasels that dropped from the hip-hop
Kissin' the bass beats good bye, goin', goin', gone (Goin', goin', gone!)
I keep it flowin' on
I'm like a lemon, I ain't livin' like a lime, here's a line to those
Here's a rose keep the casket closed
Gone and in check, the next is from the X
Wrecked and affected by the rest, huh!
How I'm gonna go, I gotta flow 'cause they figured I'm a goner
Tie goes to the runner

Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
You might also like
Politickin', I be wreckin', I reckon he's the electrician
Pullin' switches on brothers who be in disposition
I never got along with the long arm of the law
I saw where they place the hardcore (Yo!)
To them, it doesn't matter where it splatter
Our blood from the bullet, not ballot, I vote for Jim Brown
I know it don't rhyme, does it matter that he in fact he won't find
Excuses inside of Murphy Brown?
I'm on a level livin' low, here we go, I know
If this was Africa, I'd try to give a necktie
To those runnin' and lyin', disguisin'
Three guys, surprise, ayy yo
Tie goes to the runner

Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner

One more time! One more time!
One more time! One more time!
One more time! One more time!
One more time! One more time!
Not surprised at all about the riot zone
And I moan, "I wish they leave me alone, yo" (Yo!)
This was predicted, not self-inflicted
By the rap outta the 'hood, they picked it good
Hittin' heavy critical aim at all the phony names
Prezzes, VPs, embezzlers who gettin' voted mayor
Lookin' at 'em with a evil eye, why lie?
I don't buy the fly look as the fall guy
I'm livin' low across the tracks
Politicians who stickin' had better watch their backs
In another long hot summer
Tie goes to the runner

Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner
Tie goes to the runner, tie goes to the runner

And I quote, I freak the notes
I double the dose and all she wrote
Devour got the power of a double, man
Get excited, just don't bite it, you in trouble, man
Got a rhythm to ride, a rhyme to side
A thought provoke 'cause I don't joke
Here's a brother with an attitude, don't get me rude
Chew it up, was up it's like food, yo!Embed
