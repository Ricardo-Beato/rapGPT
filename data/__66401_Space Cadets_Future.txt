23 ContributorsSpace Cadets Lyrics
We some space cadets, keep a stupid ass check
In designer specks, on my face show respect
I'ma rockstar, yeah nigga outta space
I'ma rockstar, hell yeah I'm outta space

Rockstar outta space penthouse hideaway
Fountain blue getaway King of Diamonds where I lay
Yeah, fresh wheneva we wanna play free band A.1. F.B.G man we global
Yay, yay yeah we selling plenty coke have a drink have
A toast nigga we don't brag or boast so Rolls Royce
Lamborghini doors suicide open up your brains now your casket closed
I'm in NASA outta here 3 carats in my ear
I can make you disappear drape like a chandelier
Astronaut when I shine racks on racks
Now Im understanding crystal clear

We some space cadets, keep a stupid ass check
In designer specs, on my face show respect
I'ma rockstar, yeah nigga outta space
I'ma rockstar, hell yeah Im outta space

I'm drinking on dirty my wrist cost a 30 my chain in the
Ocean I'm floatin' & rollin got skeleton's on my arms
Got skeleton's on my back angel wings on my tatt's
Benjamin's in my rack's put spikes on my converse
Desingner frames on my eye's you making the movie's now
To me it ain't no surprise started in crack houses
Now we in mansion's free band the finesse game we done expanded
Thumb through a crazy check, I keep me a dumb check
I got me a combination of bitches want freaky sex
A black & a white girl a dominican cypher
They ain't nothing but some dracula's they suck me spectacular
You might also like
We some space cadets, keep a stupid ass check
In designer specks, on my face show respect
I'ma rockstar, yeah nigga outta space
I'ma rockstar, hell yeah I'm outta space2Embed
