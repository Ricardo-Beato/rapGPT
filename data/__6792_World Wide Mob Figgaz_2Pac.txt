Uh.. world wide mob figgaz.. (for real)
World wide mob figgaz (O-U-T-L-A-W-Z)
We world wide mob figgaz (for real)
Uh, world wide mob figgaz
Check game you little young punks
We world wide mob figgaz
All you niggas is jealous cats
What, what?

Uhh, Uhh, now put them hands up
Rich niggas throw the grands up, and what?
I gotta prosecute to get what's mine in the nine lime
It's my time motherfucker try to stop it gon' see nine lives
 that's all I see when I open up
Baby girl, fuckin' you now before I blow up, you know what?
I seen your kind before
High saditty, but really like it raw, in the closet like the rider type of whore
By the shore, I  a trick on her
But I'm collectin' these vicks when I put the dick on her
O.U.T.L.A.W.Z
You fuckin' with a nigga livin' destructively, pump and pee
Tuckin' T's often it counts from the flow on
I'm tryin' to handle my business full grown
This shit is on, it's gettin' crazy after dark
Where the real thug niggas? Here you are
We world wide mob figgaz
You might also like
We got homies on the front line, livin' it up
We got ladies in the back straight, givin' it up
It ain't nothin' but a thug thang
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
We got homies on the front line, livin' it up
We got ladies in the back straight, givin' it up
It ain't nothin' but a thug thang
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang

Nigga, duck down, bust first, make 'em feel somethin'
Shouldn't shot your gun if you ain't kill nuttin'
Nephew gotta face the devil and got four heavily armed
Outlawz did that (split they ass), heavily gone
So we ride with the left of us, best of us
Plus we wake up with our TEC on us
We test yo' nuts in a heartbeat, sleep on the street
Obey the rules of the ones who want yo' beef I'll eat
Y'all niggas weak, in a motherfuckin' way it's so pitiful
I'll leave you motherfuckers critical
We heard the slick shit you said on fuckin' Too Short tape
But you only stepped your way into an early wake, early grave
That's what you brave niggas get for fuckin' with this
You had your chance to mob first you didn't you missed
Just switched to fake
Napoleon be the motherfuckin' last nigga with the gat to break
The last to fade, earthquake aftershock, is what you got
Fuckin' with niggas that give a damn about hip-hop
This how it go in our family
Cause this Outlaw shit is what we stand for gradually
We world wide mob figgaz
We got homies on the front line, livin' it up
We got ladies in the back straight, givin' it up
It ain't nothin' but a thug thang
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
We got homies on the front line, livin' it up
We got ladies in the back straight, givin' it up
It ain't nothin' but a thug thang
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)

World wide motherfuckin' mob figgaz
Weed smokin', gun-totin', drinkin'
Ridin' on our motherfuckin' enemies
Y'all know how we do it
World wide mob figgaz
World wide mob figgaz

I be the Young N-O, to the B-L-E
Last name O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
M-A-R was the for starters, squeeze the whole cartridge
Your lady called the squad and the whole sausage
Clip for , hittin' donuts in a 6
Sip Coronas when we bendin' the corner, brothers hit
Urban legend, dirty third still reppin'
Still double-S to bumrush your session
I get it dirty and burn ya' just a nigga in a skirt
Drinkin' Squirt, punk duck, hit the dirt
Sprint to the church that you got comin'
Outlawz on the ride picture God runnin'
Ain't nuttin but a thug thang, bust your brains
'Pac passed the rock so we tucked the game
Under our belt, we huntin' the wealth, you fuckin' yourself off
Don't you know not to go against the Outlawz
We got homies on the front line, livin' it up
We got ladies in the back straight, givin' it up
It ain't nothin' but a thug thang
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
We got homies on the front line, livin' it up
We got ladies in the back straight, givin' it up
It ain't nothin' but a thug thang
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)

Hey watch out man, look out
Known for doin' scandalous deeds, no handlin' me
And nah, it ain’t the drugs, it’s the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery is automatic, lettin' niggas have it
I've been labelled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks
Ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a—catch a nigga world wide
A fuckin' mob figga West coast, who-ride
When we rob niggas money make my squad bigger
But we ain't sell our souls
Bustin' on my enemies, murder my foes
At my shows I'm a nut, lights camera time for action
Now get to clappin' to my cuts, a world wide mob figga

We got homies on the front line, livin' it up
We got ladies in the back straight, givin' it up
It ain't nothin' but a thug thang
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
We got homies on the front line, livin' it up
We got ladies in the back straight. givin' it up
It ain't nothin' but a thug thang
World wide mob figga let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)
World wide mob figga, let me see a nigga nuts hang (nuts hang)

Ayo, get that motherfucker right there

Hey bust on 'em, bust on that nigga
Ayo Yak, c'mon, Fatal, let’s get the fuck outta here
