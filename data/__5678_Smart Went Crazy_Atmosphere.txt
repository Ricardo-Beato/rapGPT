24 ContributorsSmart Went Crazy Lyrics
Smart went crazy, truth went trendy
The story got lazy so I rewrote the ending
Manipulated the entry, more user-friendly
Now a city full of pain pills and tattoos defend me
I waver from the dead to the half-dead
Grey space between the fan base and the crackhead
Sunset, sailboat set course for hell
A cross and a hammer, but you'll have to get some nails
Take credit, for anything embedded in the edit
As long as you meant it when you said it
And all of the kids laugh, when you admit that
It mighta been witchcraft that made my noose fit bad
Well I'mma act like I don't give a make love
Take what I got to teach everyone to break stuff
I'mma act like there's poison in the pancakes
And amputate the one that wasn't loyal with the handshake
Proud to know ya, Minnesota missile
Never sold coke and I never had to hold a pistol
Civil and simple, but set the freak show loose on the nipple
Watch her whole fuckin' titty ripple
It's why we battle, it's why we travel
It's why the mascot thinks that I'm an asshole
We made the team without puttin' on a uniform
Smart went nuts and rode a unicorn through the storm
You might also like
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, where did you go now?

Smart went crazy, kissed Miss Daisy
Loved you when everyday was Christmas, baby
Maybe, we can take it back to the way we was
Still on some "What have you done for me lately?"
No gravy if the bass is porkface
Tour dates ate my big little brother's court case
Poor taste got passed off as gourmet
This beer is foreplay
We'll meet up at your place
I sting like a first divorce, or them first Newports
Whatever hurts you more
"You're headed for self destruction" been there, did that
Kicked back with the wrong angel to fuck with
Carved my charm into your arms
Fuck around, unravel this tall ball of yarn
Snuck round back to disarm the alarm
From the plantation to the reservation to the farms
And nobody knows where you'll end up
Only guarantee in life is death or a headfuck
Yeah, you thought it was a set up, well guess what
Now you can catch up with the rest of my "Best Of"
I got a few blocks left before I reach my destination
And retrieve my breath
And God blessed every step I stole
Just to let me know, she wouldn't ever let me go
 (2X)
 (4X)
Smart went crazy, the rubber band went snap
This goes to those that hold it down 'til I get back
Hold on to me, grow along with me
I don't know where I'm goin' but I'll end up in your arms5Embed
