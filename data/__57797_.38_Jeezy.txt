20 Contributors.38 Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don’t think they know the time
I don’t think they know the time
I don’t think they know the time
I don’t think they know the time

I don’t think they know the time
Heard the streets fucked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can’t lie, man that shit got me .38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire

Uh oh, your boy's back
And he way too flashy, got my toys back
Nigga I just left the lot, I ain't come to play
He pull me for my dealer tag, fuck you tryin' to say
Know some niggas doing 10, blame it on the yay
Clip hold a half a hundred, blame it on the K
Still the realest nigga in it, these niggas CB4
This is "Fuck A Nigga" records, and I’m the CEO
Got them stacked long and wide like some Lego blocks
This ain't even my real home, this my Lego spot
You ever seen so much money in a duffle bag?
Soon as you open up the zipper, bitch the duffle brag
You might also like
I don’t think they know the time
Heard the streets fucked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can’t lie, man that shit got me .38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire

I’m in that purple Lamb’, looking like some dirty Sprite
Catchin' passes with them birds, yeah that Roddy White
Where I’m from them things hot, and that talk is cheap
And ain't nobody hearin' shit, cause they trying to eat
All they can eat, buffet style
Nigga sellin' anything, buffet wild
DB9 stupid grill, yeah that overbite
Need me 9 stupid deals, this shit is overpriced
Got it vacuum sealed up, that’s to hide the scent
So much that if they pull you over, smell it through the vent
If them peoples hit the lights, I be a nervous wreck
When you don’t fear nothin' but the lights, now that’s a nervous check

I don’t think they know the time
Heard the streets fucked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can’t lie, man that shit got me .38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire
That black tee with them nice hoodies
The ski mask is my uniform
You know I heard your homies don't like them
If they the right price I might go shootin' 'em for you
Take the heaters out on you hoe cakes
Niggas took a stand on that dope case
Got murked out chillin' at a bird house
Shoulda seen the look on that ho face
When we kicked the doors off the hinge
Niggas that don’t really go all out to win
Six feet deep when you catch a nigga sleep in the streets
Man I bet he won't doze off again
Niggas took a Chevy and blowed off the lid
Show a hundred pounds and balled off the bitch
A couple hundred shots will hold off the pigs
'Til my homeboy Will get home off his bid
I'mma still do stickups
Two Mossberg pumps in the pickup
Everybody keep your cool cause if anybody move
The bust shots will tear your whole clique up
Niggas get rushed out the ambulance lift up, lift off
Face in his ribcage, ripped off
Niggas tax 30 badges for the 36
I'd rather rob and steal than flip soft I'mma stay on...fire3Embed
