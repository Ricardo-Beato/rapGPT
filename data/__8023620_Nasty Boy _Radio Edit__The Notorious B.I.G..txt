2 ContributorsNasty Boy (Radio Edit) Lyrics
Yeah, word
I remember I met this one bitch
'Cause you know me, I don't see— I'm the nasty motherfucker
I just thought— I thought I'da did anything in the world (yeah?)
I meets this one bitch, I comes up in the spot or whatever
The bitch got the candles lit or whatever, so
She tell me whatever, she wanna get her freak on or whatever
So I'm like "What's up? What'chu wanna do?"
Know what I'm sayin', I'm read to wear it out or whatever (ksss)
The bitch told me she wanted me to shit on her (hahaha)
Ya know, shit, I was like, "Whatchu mean shit?"
I mean I might shit on you, after I hit it I won't call you no more
Shit on you like that (hahaha)
She talkin about no she want me to cock over her
And shit, on her stomach! (hehehe)
I said bitch what the, what the fuck??
What the fuck I'm sposed to do after I after I shit on her
I'm s'posed to hit that after that?
She's just wilding out, so after I shits on the bitch right (hahaha)
Ya know I shit, after I shits on the bitch
The bitch, ya know, washed that shit off or whatever
(Ohh shit)

Come on, yeah, come on
Come on, yeah, come on, yeah
Come on, yeah, come on
Come on, yeah, come on, yeah
Come on, yeah, come on
Come on, yeah, come on, yeah
Come on, yeah, come on
Come on, yeah, come on

This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Representin' on the freaky freaky
Fuck 'em all day, fuck 'em all night
We don't love these hoes

I go on and on and on and
Don't take them to the crib unless they bonin'
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay, dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin' home tomorrow
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin', she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "Well I don't usually"
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
Threw that back out, in the parkin' lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked, it all work
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty

I remember we went to Tennessee
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Simone
Screamin, she fiendin' for the semen
Me bein' the man that I am
Took it to her condo pronto
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the chron' chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow
Satisfyin' all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? What?
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty

Ladies, my Mercedes
Hold fo' in the back, two if you're fat
Keep a gat 'cause cats try fi test me
They just fans like De Niro, Wesley
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin' on
Gardeur jeans look like they painted on
Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently
She like the way the dough fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal 'til she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's DeGenero
Dripped out, Iceberg apparel
Intro goes without speaking
Call me Cease 'cause I keep 'em, we can go freakin'
All weekend, so, roll in
Ain't it good that my Lex seats foldin'? Uhh

You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nastyEmbed
