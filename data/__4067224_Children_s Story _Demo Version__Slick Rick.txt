6 ContributorsChildrenâ€™s Story (Demo Version) Lyrics
Put the shakers in it!
Okay you kids enough TV, enough TV get to bed, get to bed
"Ohh uncle Ricky, we wanna watch TV please"
No more TV, get to bed
"Oh uncle Ricky I don't like you anymore"
"You're gonna read us a bedtime story uh, please? Uh, uh, uh, please?"
Ahh, all right, all right you kids get in the bed I'll get the Arabian story book
*Happy babbling*
All right kids, you tucked in?
"Yeah"
Here we go

Once upon a time, not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behaving really, really good
There were three mean giants that came from the east
They were up to no good and some ugly beast
They lived in the forest where no one goes
And were evilly inflicted from their head to their toes
Everytime they came around they snatched a few humans up
Then eat their poor souls and throw their bones in a cup
For years and years the peasants lived in fear
But nothing could be done besides to pray, my dear
For the giants were rulin' and the peasants were not
And the little bit of happiness was now forgot
So three brave boys full of spunk and youth
Went on a mission trip to find the king of truth
For when he'd come, justice be done
None only as the most high ruler, son
None only as the most high ruler, son
None only as a hoe's high ruler, son
Hit it!

Will the peasants survive and justice be done?
Or will the giants continue to rule as one?
Well, nevertheless we'll see son
Story's begun

*Kid humming along the melody*
Heyo, imma stop right thereEmbed
