6 ContributorsRomance Lyrics
And this is for the romance
It's the reason that you hold hands
And even though there's no chance
You'll wish that we could slow dance
And this is for the romance
It's the reason that you hold hands
And even though there's no chance
I like what she had to say

She said, "We still haven't liberated Mumia"
She said, "The name of the strain was Eureka"
She synced up the Bluetooth to play Aaliyah
I made myself a drink, tastes like pruno sangria
Nice to meet ya, knock on wood
I said, "I'm sorry, that my English is not so good"
She said, "It sounds like you're fishin' for compassion"
I said, "You're dressed like an assassin"
And it's true, though, she kinda looked like Trinity
It's kinda cool, though, reminds me of Italy
The only time I've ever been there was a short layover
In Rome, didn't even leave the airport
And that ain't even the important part
But somethin' started warmin' up her broken heart
And I ain't tryna send any faulty signals
Went to the bathroom, climbed out the window
You might also like
And this is for the romance
It's the reason that you hold hands
And even though there's no chance
You'll wish that we could slow dance
And this is for the romance
It's the reason that you hold hands
And even though there's no chance
I got you wishin' we could slow dance

Ay, pretty mama, are your kids at school?
You and I should go and find a swimmin' pool
Better if it comes with a hotel room
That'll let us check in before noon (Aight)
Too many memories to fit into a shoe box
The cops caught a bad tip and raided the rooftop
She opened up a roll of quarters into a tube sock
All of y'all are poseurs, go and kick some moon rocks
I might be the droid that they lookin' for
Or I might be the boy you mistook me for
I might float across the ocean on a horse back
Just to get closer to your outdated format
I might be the gecko from Geico
Got the white women celebratin' Cinco de Mayo
They finished off a whole fifth of mayo
I grabbed the queso, flew away like an angel
And this is for the romance
It's the reason that you hold hands
And even though there's no chance
You'll wish that we could slow dance
And this is for the romance
It's the reason that you hold hands
And even though there's no chance
I got you wishin' we could slow dance

Ay, pretty mamaEmbed
