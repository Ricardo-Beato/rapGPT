14 ContributorsA Million Lyrics
All Money In (All Money In, All Money In)
Yuh, real shit
Cookin' Soul

A million, a million-million, a million
A million, a million-million, a million

I got my mind on a million 'fore I turn 26
But that's just what it costs for that condo at the Ritz
I got this European belt (Belt), European bitch
Ever seen an African in a European whip?
I got my top off in traffic playin' this, got 'em pissed
Police hot 'cause my operations legit, suck my dick
All my life they've been shootin', thank god they miss
I'm convinced that I'm here for a reason, it don't make sense, how they miss?
All my niggas is gone, but I still exist (I exist)
So I got on my knees and I told him this (I repent)

One in a million, a million-million, a million
That's real talk
One in a million, a million-million, a million
We made it
You might also like
I got my first hundred thousand 'fore I turned 22
And then I went to jail for some shit I did not do
Them niggas think it's rap, huh, 'til bullets make 'em back up
Know I'm in them movies, bro, but I am not no actor
Way before these contracts, I knew I was all that
Bet she say Nip Hussle if you ask her where that bomb at
She don't even smoke weed, she's just high off contact (All Money In)
Way before I launched that I understood the concept
Got it from my bro, bro, never drove a six-four
Used to push that Cut, dawg, but now I drive that Benzo
I don't got no girlfriend 'cause, baby, I'm against those
We say that we just friends, but really know that is one in a

A million-million, a million
A million, a million-million
Oh yeah, Hussle
One in a million (One in a, one in a)
A million
A million, a million-million
A million, a million, a million
A million, a million, a million2Embed
