35 ContributorsCan I Get Witcha Lyrics
Huh?
Cease-a-Lee'
Doggystyle.. YEAH!
B.I.G
Uhh.. to all the ladies in the house!
Where they at?
Uhh, uhh, check it out
C'mon Big

Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nothing to do
Uhh, I'm interrupted by a phone ring {*Brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfucking thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo, who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don't ya hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with
You might also like
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

She said "If I get with you
I gotta get witcha whole hood rat crew, whatcha I think I do?
Sling skins for a living,my name ain't November
This ain't Thanksgiving, you ain't Michael Bivins
Mack it up, flip it, rub it down
Do me baby, I ain't down
My name ain't 2Pac I don't "Get Around"
You hitting this nigga, how that sound?"
Huh, first of all you got me mixed up with
Somebody ya done slept with, hold up
That's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got something slicker
Let me just sip up on this liquor
All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic
Slam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on
This Biggie Smalls phonics, 102
How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?
Can I get witcha (Can I get witcha)
Can I get witcha (Can I get witcha)
Can I get witcha..
'Cause I got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha (Can I get witcha)
Can I get witcha (Can I get witcha)
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my Phillies
She said "I don't care, so don't be acting silly"
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
'Cause, "I wanna get freaky with you"
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

Can I get witcha (Can I get witcha)
Can I get witcha (Can I get witcha)
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

To all my hoes, respect due
Tamika sorry I left you
Michelle I'm glad I met you
You make the head feel special
Now I know it's official
That I can touch and tease you
Pull up my pants and diss you
And hit the door you came through
It's Cease-a-Lee, a.k.a. Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chickenhead with sex appeal pass me
That's her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the flashy type, who pass with dykes
With long hair, and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right, huh
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T2Embed
