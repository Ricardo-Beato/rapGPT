4 ContributorsThin Line Between Law and Rape Lyrics
Ya took me from a place Where the race didn't matter
And gathered up bodies Without a choice So I rather
Pass my opinion back Run ya over
With my rack an pinion Never stop the engine
For watcha fathers did do the indian
North & south America Plus the Carribbean
I got a vendetta Cause I know better
Better come right Better black than a stereotype white
No cash flow wit out work
I'm talkin about the past You busted our ass
Now you afraid cause I never got paid
Now sucka jump
No You can't take whatcha want
Chorus
You can't take whatcha want
Cause ya took whatcha want
Can't get away cause we got it on tape
You can't take whatcha want
Cause ya took whatcha want
Thin line between law & rape (scream)

You can't take whatcha want Dont cha know
We ain't got nuttin left Cause you took the rest
We ain't got jazz rock n' roll rappin the lose
Wit a few fat ladies left singing the blues
Go abracadabra to make a wish I can mess with
Wonder why I'm underneath a crew I can't get with
I never knew land was an acquisition
BS from the best man in position
And come again with it and get hit like a punk
No, you can't take whatcha want
You might also likeChorus 2X
Break
You can't take whatcha want
I open up the trunk
I see your phony ass
Try to counterfeit funk
From land to land

To sea to sea
Allover got the other man
Messin wit me
Took the motherland
Made a slave out of my mother and man
Got a good man
Sayin goddamn
And to hell with
Back in the days
Unless we go way back
To the black ways
Always
Watch your back
If ya crooked dont front
You can't take whatcha want
Chorus 2X
We died on the line
We walk the fine line he talked a good lineEmbed
