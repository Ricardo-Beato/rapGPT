8 ContributorsIntro (Idlewild) Lyrics
Ah, yes, well I myself, Larry Olivier, am a method actor, and I studied at the prestegious school of Julliard, and you know, I feel as if, you know, the rappers, and the musicians, and what not, get into acting, you know, you know, it's disrespecting the craft. I feel as if, you know, they're taking jobs from us, from us trained actors and I feel as if they should just leave it to the pros

Man, shut your ass up. You telling me if you made a song and it was jamming, we ain't 'posed to listen to it? Man, these boys got opportunity man, let them do they thing. And why you talkin' like that? Ain't you from Bankhead? Anyway, I heard that that Idlewild shit gonna be fire. I'mma be there on Friday, and where yo pussy ass gonna be nigga? Tryna get some work. Think you Denzel or somebody
