Sometimes you have to get all the—
All the crap out the way before you hit the good stuff and you're like, "Okay, I'm getting good stuff now"
But, um, uh, I had a b— I mean, the stuff I write about, what do I really write about?
I've got my weed songs and all my songs about my boy— uh, my ex-boyfriend, George
Songs about relationships that are kinda doomed from the start
You know, songs about when I fell in love and it went wrong
And I was so in love at the time, you know, I was like...
And I was with someone that I was in love with, you know what I mean? We were in love
You know what I mean? We were together, so
When it— and that's like a real drug, isn't it? So when it— when it didn't come together, I was just like...
You know? It really hurt
But I needed enough distance from it
So that it wasn't like raw emotion anymore
But not enough— enough distance that I'd forget
I'm quite a self-destructive person, so I guess
I guess I keep giving myself material
Raindrops on my windowsill
Longing for your nature's feel
Loved that song when we were kids
Now it makes me want you here
Sometimes, people disappear
Think that was my biggest fear
I should have protected you
Sometimes I wish it would rain
Sunshine, blue skies
Please go away
Sometimes I wish it would rain
The girl has found another and
Gone away
With her went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day
I stay locked up in my room
I know to youYou might also like12Embed
