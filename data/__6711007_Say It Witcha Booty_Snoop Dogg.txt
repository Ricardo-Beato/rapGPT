Now you want it, if you want it
If you really need it, if you really need it
You want me to get it, want me to get it
Then say it witcha booty, say it witcha booty
Now tell me if you want it, bitch, say it witcha booty
If you really need it, say it witcha booty
Want me to get it, say it witcha booty (Yeah)
Just say it witcha booty, bitch, say it witcha booty
Like woo

Fee-fi-fo-fum
I'm watchin' it go dumb
Titties jigglin', ass wigglin' (Shake)
And my bitch wanna come
Big ass, bring it over (Bring it over)
Rev it up like a motor (Rev it up)
Talk that shit witcha booty (Talk that)
Leg up over your shoulders (Fuck that)
Fuck that soft shit, bitch, make it bounce hard
Like you ridin' on the dick of a superstar
Ass everywhere, bitch, you got some true skills
Fuck around and we gon' do it for real

Now you want it, if you want it
If you really need it, if you really need it
You want me to get it, want mе to get it
Then say it witcha booty, say it witcha booty
Now tell mе if you want it, bitch, say it witcha booty
If you really need it, say it witcha booty
Want me to get it, say it witcha booty
Just say it witcha booty, bitch, say it witcha booty
Like woo
You might also like
Bitch, slide down the pole (Slide)
Ass on super swole (Fat)
Another bitch right on top (Ooh)
Pussy right on your nose
This bitch on freaky shit (Freaky)
She know how to squeeze a dick (Nasty)
But after all is said and done (What you do>)
I'm just gon' leave the bitch (See ya)
Headed to the strip club, straight to the DJ booth
And made a quick dub, and I got a dick rub
Bitches on my line, they gon' keep tryin'
But if you wanna shake some ass bitch, I got time
She got slow work, on that pole work
She can stretch that ass, but it don't hurt
Lookin' like an hourglass, treat 'em the same, with no difference
Look at all the ass on them bad bitches

Now you want it, if you want it
If you really need it, if you really need it
You want me to get it, want me to get it
Then say it witcha booty, say it witcha booty
Now tell me if you want it, bitch, say it witcha booty
If you really need it, say it witcha booty
Want me to get it, say it witcha booty
Just say it witcha booty, bitch, say it witcha booty
Like woo
Work, work it, work, work it
So big, so perfect
Twerk, twerk it, twerk, twerk it
Don't break it, don't hurt it
Work, work it, work, work it
So big, so perfect
Twerk, twerk it, twerk, twerk it
Don't break it, don't hurt it

I love it how you make your booty talk
I didn't know you could make it talk
I knew you could make it clap
But now you sayin', you sayin' somethingEmbed
