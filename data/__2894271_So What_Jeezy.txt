8 ContributorsSo What Lyrics
Oh-nanana
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Yeah

So what, yeah, so what, yeah, so what, yeah
So what, what else? So what, what else?
So what, yeah, so what, yeah

Girl you're fine as fuck, you say you got a man, so what?
And that pussy ass nigga ain't a fan, so what?
Designer belt holding up designer pants, so what?
Make money, fuck bitches, diamonds dance, so what?

I'm liking where it's going Snow, sounding like it's winter time
Operation feed the streets, y'all let 'em know it's dinner time
They say I'm too classic, said I'm still the under dog
Yet my black ass stay shining like some ArmorAll
Top be candy apple red but them seats be Peter Pan
Call me Jizzle iron chef, can chef it up with either hand
Yeah I got the answers, Walt Disney of this trap shit
To keep it 100, the Isaac Newton of this trap shit
Rap niggas acting funny, I ain't with the sucker shit
Balling in the streets but still shoot out like the Rucker bitch
All hail to the general, salute me when you see me nigga
Or I'ma take your bitch and go fuck her in Tahiti nigga
You might also like
Girl you're fine as fuck, you say you got a man, so what?
And that pussy ass nigga ain't a fan, so what?
Designer belt holding up designer pants, so what?
Make money, fuck bitches, diamonds dance, so what?

So what, yeah, so what, yeah, so what, yeah
So what, what else? So what, what else?
So what, yeah, so what, yeah

I ain't no psychiatrist but I know that walk is mean
Might just pull a Plies bih only if that pussy clean
Before you get your hopes up, I'm lying like a motherfucker
Treat me on my square, these niggas trying like a motherfucker
Fucking with my baby they gon' play it like a flute
When you know the bear looking like a Ferragamo loot
Jizzle in the pocket and the flow is unbelievable
They tryna be who you was and that shit is unachievable
Nigga do you know what this is?
Fuck all that hating just let a nigga live
If you making money then you making noise
Your nigga say he know me? That don't mean we boys

Girl you're fine as fuck, you say you got a man, so what?
And that pussy ass nigga ain't a fan, so what?
Designer belt holding up designer pants, so what?
Make money, fuck bitches, diamonds dance, so what?
So what, yeah, so what, yeah, so what, yeah
So what, what else? So what, what else?
So what, yeah, so what, yeah

Fuck you talking about? So what nigga1Embed
