4 ContributorsExclusive Freestyle 5 (Stuntin Hard) Lyrics
Gucci Mane La Flare
We ain't done yet
It ain't over until I say it's over
What's happenin'?
It's ya boy, pimp so hard nigga (Pimp so hard)
Swag up, nigga, boss up, nigga, man up (Yeah)
Gucci Mane La Flare, put ya chin up

I don't do the push up, I do the kush up
I'm booked up, look up Gucci, overbook me
Shawty gone stupid, diamonds look Cupid
Red diamond shawty, floor, just overdo it (Uh)
Supersized watch, baby check out the bezel (Bezel)
Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm ahead of the schedule
Learjet showing G5, shawty
I'm red mic, and shawty, no Levis
I'm so high, I'm so fly, I'm DUI and I don't know why I drive
But, I'm suicide, my doors up like a Lamb
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, call me gamblin' Sam (Lets do it)
Fruit Loop, I'm Toucan Sam (Frooty)
Gucci Mane, I gives no damn (No damn)
I'm fly as fuck 'cause I'm so kushed up (Kushed)
And I'm so drawn up, and I sip that lean (That lean)
And I smoke that green (Green), do you know what I mean?
Don't snort no white (No), but I sell that shit
Man I got that Chanel (Yeah), man them bricks exist
Right here in the 6, right there exit
You the exit, right there, I'm Zone 6
 bitch got the seventy-four O's, I restarted it, bitch
In the store, it's horrific, flow horrific
I glorified it, sex and violence, man, I supply it (Supply it)
Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm a firebreathin' dragon (Huh)
Your girl diggin' me, show to her clique, I'm attractive (Attractive)
Gucci, nigga, boy I go crazy
My diamonds ain't clouded, they never been hazy
Shawty got a chain on, but it don't amaze me
You spent five grand, I spent one-eighty
Hey, pay me (Pay me)
Fuck you, pussy nigga, don't play me (I don't give a fuck)
I don't give a damn 'cause I get money
I don't talk crazy, I just talk country and funky
Bunky, I be stitchy (Gucci, nigga), stanky, stunky, skunky, bunky (Huh)
Booster-ass bitch, you can get the fuck from 'round me
Gucci Mane La Flare, you can sign here (You can sign here)
