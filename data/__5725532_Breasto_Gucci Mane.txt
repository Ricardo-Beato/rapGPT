13 ContributorsBreasto Lyrics
Huh?
(30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)

She a tease, real calm, not skeezo
Real fiend for the bling, bling, blingo
Got cheese, I can really say bingo
I'm a star, but I'm nothin' like Ringo
Golf windows on the door like Jagged Edge
Hell no, my name's not Wingo
Gringo limpin' out of the casino
Where's Waldo? Lookin' for the cargo
My main foes fell off, where did they go?
In Diego lookin' for the yayo
I met a Mexican man that'll bust a head
And for a peso, he'll make you wait, though

Yeah, that's my breasto, that's my besto
My vest on my chest, he protect my flesh, so
Let my best ho invest my escrow
Bless her flesh 'cause she made my nest grow
Bullets start ricocheting, think I need an echo
Earthquake, aftershock, bitch just won't let go
Family callin' for him, lookin', think they need to let go
Hope they got insurance for him, probably need gecko
You might also like
Drop my nuts, don't push my test
Throw your foot on they neck, protect your threshold
This the type of pressure, you don't need no stretcher
Or the ambulance and then I let the alligator get you
Bullets go to rippin', make the neighbors start trippin'
Trap closin' early 'cause the Gucci Mane comin'
Gucci Mane LaFlare, I got all kind of money
Five thou', fifty thou', anybody count it (Well, damn)
All I really care about is did you do the business?
Did you leave a witness? Nigga, did you pay attention?
Heard what I said, nigga? Anybody get it
I don't give a damn, nigga, you can really get it
Mama in the business, then your mama 'nem can get it
Broad down with it, whole family can get it
You stupid little bitch, you put yourself in this position
All this inchin' on my riches got my trigger finger itchin'

Yeah, that's my breasto, that's my besto
My vest on my chest, he protect my flesh, so
Let my best ho invest my escrow
Bless her flesh 'cause she made my nest grow
Bullets start ricocheting, think I need an echo
Earthquake, aftershock, bitch just won't let go
Family callin' for him, lookin', think they need to let go
Hope they got insurance for him, probably need gecko
Gotta keep a breasto just because my neck froze
Try to take my bankroll, I'ma leave his eyes closed
Me and Wop together, all these bitches goin' psycho
Where we keep them poles like a motherfuckin' pint store
I come from the gutter (Mob)
Now my mouth full of ice, she suck me like a sucker
Shit done gave me poltergeist and I would never love her
Better try that other guy, just blow me like a bubble
And I'll cum on your pretty side, yeah, I'm rich forever
My bitch do not come around
She don't wanna double cross 'cause bitch, I'm the triple cross
I'll get 'em knocked off, sit back, use my dental floss
Yeah, it's the Mayor, told you I'm the fuckin' boss
Wop said, "Get this in your Mob and it's gon' go down"
Send his head to his mama house to say I'm lowdown
1017, So Icy Boyz, and we don't fuck 'round
Bitch, I got my breasto, we can have a showdown, ho

Yeah, that's my breasto, that's my besto
My vest on my chest, he protect my flesh, so
Let my best ho invest my escrow
Bless her flesh 'cause she made my nest grow
Bullets start ricocheting, think I need an echo
Earthquake, aftershock, bitch just won't let go
Family callin' for him, lookin', think they need to let go
Hope they got insurance for him, probably need geckoEmbed
