My life is all about riches, and bitches
Snitches get stitches
Want me to put you on? Keep wishin'
You need to learn the rules and conditions
There's facts that you missin'
Sit back and take notes man, listen
First of all, the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The C.R.E.A.M. will have you shittin' on your people
Livin' like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothin' changed but the clothes that my money bring
I'm makin' figures that I never thought possible
You tryna slow me down, you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of Tecs, and Amacuras
Kid, you get your cap peeled backward
For years, I been tryna blow for years
Gettin' bent off my wet, spend a G on beers
Livin' life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet
'Til the coke oil drops to the bottom of the pot
My invincible  crew will never stop
If you lookin', you can find me risin' to the top, I'm a classic
Approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floatin' in the river witchya body wrapped in plastic
I'm tryna make a half a million, triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I could still hear his voice while he up in the skies
While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love, and I can't give it up
You might also like
I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the nine, let my heat serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organized fiend service
Tryna make a mil, it's stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills,  get your cap peeled, cause everything is real
But I wanna chill, laid up, in a jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
You get your life lost, never found again my friend
Mission completed, watch you droppin' less than 10
On the road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place will be your ditch kid
No one can stop me, try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me, you're just an imitation copy
The theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' fat whips and livin' comfortably

My life is all about riches, and bitches
Snitches get stitches
