They say age catchin' up, so I'm runnin' from death
I done walked through the fire, trippin' on Heaven's steps
Gotta keep shit movin', time won't stand still
Movin' on with my life, can't cry when the milk spill
Rap a young man game, and ya missed ya mark
Probably never win a Grammy or chart on the charts
Should I still keep goin' or call it a day?
All night thinkin' 'bout dumb mistakes I made
Tell me where you're 'posed to go when it ain't fun no more
If you don't rap, you don't eat, and that's the way it go
Can't have writer's block, might be out on the block
Didn't sign up for this it's like I'm punching the clock

Even with all the stress a nigga still feel blessed
Could'vе end it right there on thеm Clairmont steps
Even with all the stress a nigga still feel blessed
Could've end it right there on them Clairmont steps

Time wait for no man, so you can't waste time
Can't get time back, time after time
Time waits for no man, so you can't waste time
Can't get time back, time after time

Shall I proceed and continue?
Ain't got no choice when the rent due
Know some homie takin' penitentiary chances
Don't wanna do it but they kids need Pampers
So, what's the answers to the question we all ask?
Forgot what I was sayin', let's move on from the past
Life don't last any day, that day
It's your time to time, don't care how much you pray
Put my life in my verse when I'm dead in a hearse
You done read between the lines, see that pain and that hurt
All the trauma I endured, drugs and drink was the cure
Had to sin to make ends, but my soul was pure

Even with all the stress a nigga still feel blessed
Could've end it right there on them Clairmont steps
Even with all the stress a nigga still feel blessed
Could've end it right there on them Clairmont steps

Time wait for no man, so you can't waste time
Can't get time back, time after time
Time waits for no man, so you can't waste time
Can't get time back, time after time
Time wait for no man, so you can't waste time
Can't get time back, time after time
Time waits for no man, so you can't waste time
Can't get time back, time after timeEmbed
