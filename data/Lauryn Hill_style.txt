Uh-uh
Uh
And yo
Uhh, uhh (Like fungus among us)
Yo, yo (Haha), uh

Yo, I treat this like my thesis
Well-written topic, broken down into pieces
I introduce then produce, words so profuse
It's abuse how I juice up this beat, like I'm deuce
Two people both equal like I'm Gemini, rather Simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it, you can't stop it
Drop it, your whole crew microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles, and on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother (Nah)
Business, I been in this third LP you can't tell me
I witness first-handed, I'm candid, you can't stand it
Respect demanded, and get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel
And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad

You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall trying to ball while my team win the pennant
I'm about to begin it, for a minute, then run for senate
Make a slum lord be repentant, give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival documented in The Bible
Like Moses and Aaron, things gon' change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna be seen through
Let God redeem you, keep your deen true, you can get the green too
Watch out what you cling to, observe how a queen do
And I remain calm reading the 73rd Psalm
'Cause with all that’s going on I got the world in my palm

You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

Now I be breaking bread sipping Manischewitz wine
Pay no mind, party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
Now I'ma get the mozzarella like a Rockafeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Mirabella in Couture
Or collecting residuals from off The Score
I'm making sure I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war
Word to Boonie, I make salat like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power

Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us
Although them again we will never, never, never trust
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Them nuh know what them do
Dig out your eye, while I'm sticking like glue
Fling, skin, grin, while them plotting for you, true!

Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Me a tell you, dem nuh know)
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Fi be real, them nuh have a clue!)

Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you
To you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do
Oh

Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do

You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized, like Menelik
And other African czars, observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gon' idolize the missing? To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they coming, gunning I stand position
L known the mission since conception
Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers, then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle?
March through these streets like Soweto, uhh

Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judas, backstabbers do this
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do

It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?

Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Forgive them, forgive them)
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Forgive them, forgive them)

It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication lead to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand, L-Boogie, non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you wanna bawl over separation
Tarnish my image in the conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?

I was hopeless, now I'm on Hope Road
Every man wanna act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always wanna play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come

Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have ‘til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become

I was just a little girl
Skinny legs, a press and curl
My mother always thought I'd be a star
But way before the record deals
Streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that I'd never go too far

Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in New Jerusalem

Story starts in Hootaville
Grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
"Kill the Guy" in Carter Park
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones

Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in the New Jerusalem

As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurried my sight
And I used to love him

I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain)
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
See, torn and confused, wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated, I waited, debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no then I just should have heeded
Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone

Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans

Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold, see, I took back my soul

Or I quitted, now I spit it, however do you want it?
Now you get it!
Writing rhymes, in the Range, with the frames lightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (Lauryn Hill!)
And if your lines sound like mine I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)
Unprecedented, and still respected when it's vintage
I'm serious, I'm takin' over areas in Aquarius
Runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots
Just as Christ was a Superstar, you stupid, star!

My world, it moves so fast today
The past, it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe
And every time I've tried to be what someone else has thought of me
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve

But deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that His strength is within me

And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny (And deep in my heart)

I get out, I'll get out of all your boxes
I get out, you can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out, Father free me from this bondage
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

Your stinking resolution is no type of solution
Preventing me from freedom, maintaining your pollution
I won't support your lie no more
I won't even try no more
If I have to die, oh Lord, that's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more
I can't be victimized no more
I just don't sympathize no more, ‘cause now I understand
You just wanna use me
You say "love" then abuse me
You never thought you'd lose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin', repressin' me to death
‘Cause now I'm choosin' life, yo
I'll take the sacrifice, yo
If everything must go, then go: that's how I choose to live

Afraid to face reality—the system is a joke
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul

For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
Conformin' our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin' our tape recorders
From hearin' like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate, worse than Sodom
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits

PhDs in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors in past delusion

Or confidence in the tale
Conferences is Yale
Discussin' doctrines of Baal
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail
His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin' me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still, dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong, in true enemies defeat
Destitute in a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in

Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity

Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores

Mother of human history
System of social sorcery

How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection
Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority

Only follow in the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord with all thy heart
And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him and He shall direct our paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore

We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated 'cause he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss
Why still do evil? We don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light, hey
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright

Oh, to suggest that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me

Do whatsoever, you asking my name he may give to you

Is an abomination to Emmanuel

Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
For why would he die? Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and His Word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive

I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years

Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me to find my inside sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of mind
Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If I only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you

He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water, the water
I ain't felt this way in years

Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on a mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination? No no!
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land

He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
Cleaning me
He's purging me
And moving me around
He's bathing me
And he's claiming me
And moving me around
Around and around and around
And around
Watching me, claiming me
Moving me around
He's purging me
He's been cleaning me
And moving me around
And around
And around
Around
Around
Moving me around

They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say

I'll never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ
I'll never forget no way, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice
I'll never forget no way, how they turned their backs on Paul Bogle
So don't you forget no way...
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle

They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so very many things, to say right now
They've got so much things to say

And I don't come to fight flesh and blood
But spiritual wickedness in high and low places
And don't you fight me down
I'll stand firm, and give Jah all the thanks and praises
I don't expect to be justified, by these laws of men
Though the wicked find me guilty, Jah will proove my innocency
'Cause when the rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top
Remember that
See when this rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top

And I, I'll never forget, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice
Said I, never forget, how they turned their backs on Paul Bogle
So non of you, non of you forget...

It's the mystery of iniquity
Said it's the misery of Inequity
Said it's the history of Inequity
When it all, all falls down
Telling you all, it all falls down

Children, eat your bread
Little children, eat your bread
'Cause it all, all falls down
Telling you all, it all falls down

Yo! Y'all can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors, witness despised
Crooked lawyers, false indictments publicized
It's entertainment, the arraignments, the subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon, black-robe crooked-balance
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the circus on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that "In God We Trust"
Cross-examined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator receiving the judge's favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers
See the bailiff representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
The prosecution, political prostitution
The more money you pay, the further away solution
Legal actors, Babylon's benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants, morally non-compliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isn't making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist 'em
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used
To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness (the paid authority)
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Of disinterested peers, dodging duty for years
Hating the process, waiting to be returning to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct? Properly serve and protect?
Materially corrupt, spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause, prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind, guilty never defined
Filthy as swine, a generation purin it's own mind
Legal extortion, blown out of proportion
In vein deceit, the truth is obsolete
Only two positions: victimizer or victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma
Trying to own a piece of the "American Corona"
The Revolving Door, insanity every floor
Skyscraping, paper chasing, what are we working for?
Empty traditions, reaching social positions
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
The standard is Thief; brethren, can we candidly speak?
Woe to the men, trusted in the chariots dem'
Leaning on horses, they run their intellectual sources
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white
Internally they absent of light
Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse, evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first, angelic being cast to the earth
It's time for rebirth, burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turn and be healed, let him who stole, no longer steal
Oh it's real, surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep, troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap, causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come, find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh, self-interest: Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed, hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die, let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be re-taught
You'll find what you sought
Was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught where the majority remains caught
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die

Thought that I had lost you
I can hardly make a sound
When I thought I couldn't hold you
Knew the world had let me down
Should have took the time to tell you
You keep my feet on the ground
I hope that you can hear me
Cause I know its not profound

I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around

When I thought I was without you
I got used to being down
It was my fault I used to doubt you
But that ain't me next time around
Please believe me when I tell you
Cause all my words are bound
This is my cross now let me bare it
I was lost but now I'm found-found-found

Okay, we just finishing tuning.
Okay, let's see what's up1Embed
One day, I'm gonna understand
Zion

Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
"Look at your career," they said
"Lauryn, baby use your head"
But instead I chose to use my heart

Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!)
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, uhh, Zion!)

How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

Okay, how many people here have ever been in love? I know none of the guys are gonna raise their hand. How many of y'all ever been in love?

(Mumbling)

I know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? Oh! Let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, 'cause not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. About your personal definition, don't tell me what Webster thinks. Huh?

Willingness to do everything for that person

Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk, c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

The way they act

Uh-huh

The way they carry themselves, stuff like that
Okay

The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know?

Yeah

It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

That's deep

That's what I'm talking about

I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?

It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you. 'Cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

Love is not phony!

The way it was born was very, st- was interesting
Um, my husband's brother came by the house to visit us one day, Brother Ziggy and, he, he was, um he was talking about a song of his called "I Get Out", and uh, uh
It was so powerful, the concept
And, and what it meant, to, to me, you know?
And what it meant for me
He just said that phrase
He said, "I get out"
And he said, "I get out of all your boxes"
And immediately, I just said
"That's it, man, that's it right there"
And the next day, you know
I got in the shower, and while I was in the shower
'Bout three verses and a hook
And all this stuff just came, you know?
And I called him, and I played it for him
Over the phone, all excited, you know
I was like, "Ziggy, you like, but no, ha-ah"
I don't know what's gonna come of this song
I know that he wanted to do one
And we'll see, you know, but, uh, see what happens
But, this is um
My version of the same powerful message
Because it most certainly, is, is very power, powerful
But, uh, I-I'm gonna read this one a little bit
'Cause it, it's fresh, you know, it's fresh
Still a little fresh, I, I wanna make sure that
I get all the words in So, if I pause a little bit, you know
Like I said, its g-, it's reality, so
But ya'll got, I think ya'll got that by now
You know, ha-ha Heh heh heh Alright, let's see
Not that I wrote it in, in a size that I can even read
It's like litte... Okay
Alright, alright, Zig, heh-heh-heh-hehYou might also likeEmbed

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men

Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men

Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?

(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(She poetic)
She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?
