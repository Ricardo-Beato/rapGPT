12 ContributorsFugitive Lyrics
Big Money Talks
There goes them folks
We all we got
Officer, I got 50 bands on me
You do the math
You ain't got to say nothing, keep my mouth shut

Gucci a fugitive, Style is a fugitive
Think that I’m Boosie I stay in exclusive
Fly as a stewardess, trappin' this lucrative
Think crime doesn’t pay, I think that is ludacris
Part of the city, the nucleous
When niggas are humorous, snitches are numerous
It’s hot and it’s humid and business is booming
Bogus ID because I got a warrant
I’m on the run, I got a gun
Talkin to mom, son what have you done?
Put on my Jordans 'cause I’m jumping the bond
Parking lot dead, I valet them a sign
I diss you to show you man I’m not the one
Fugitive top, I’m in love with the sun
My girl is a fugitive, brother a fugitive
Mother a fugitive, I’m on the run
You might also like(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
El Chapo mane he a fugitive
Griselda Blanco was a fugitive (RIP)
Big Meech, he was a fugitive
Al Capone was a fugitive
Gucci Mane was a fugitive
Bugsy Siegel, fugitive
Wrist cost 10 bricks, fugitive
No serial number, my uzzi a fugitive
(Verse 2: Young Dolph)
Get all my money, leave town like a fugitive
Waitin on another nigga, that’s foolishness
Yo ho with me and yo botch gone
Can’t control that ho, that bitch grown
I done got down to my last five pesos, time for me to get going
Disappear for a minute, pop back up
Forty pack nigga, guarantee everything’s strong
Play with me, been off the top on shoe shit
Been turnin to a fugitive, can’t catch me cuz I’m too legit
Yo money short, you can’t go to war
I’m bustin whoever I feel like it
Yea, that’s yo bitch my nigga
But I fuck here whenever I feel like it
Yo best friend next to you, tell him I said fuck him too if he don’t like it
After I fucked that bitch
I put the girl out and told er get to hickin
Sprite was clean but you know I had to spike it
The smile on my face but I know they don’t like it
But why I got to keep that burner concealed?
I’m just like nigga you for real?
(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
El Chapo mane he a fugitive
Griselda Blanco was a fugitive (RIP)
Big Meech, he was a fugitive
Al Capone was a fugitive
Gucci Mane was a fugitive
Bugsy Siegel, fugitive
Wrist cost 10 bricks, fugitive
No serial number, my uzzi a fugitive
(Verse 3: Peewee Longway)
I finesse the plug with a fugitive mane
3 minutes later finesse the cocaine
I heard they lookin for fugitive Longway
With yo old lady, getting fugitive brain
True, little man got a fugitive brain
Gas, molly, Rick James in my vein
Gotta be dressin me, going insane
Fugitive Boot the Versace Balmain
Exclusive the Louie, 10 wallet with chain
I smoke on no dooby, don’t fuck with no lame
Kid Cudi with Future Squad know my name
Set for the crib, fugitives on a plane
Out of here bitch like my name Martin Pine
Know that bitch here with a fugitive name
Serial killer, clique fugitive gang
My mama birth me with the top that’s so fugitive
Try Dillinger was a top it’s a fugitive
Wrist game the dopest, the talk is a fugitive
Don’t hocup pocus, turn deuces to 4
Fugitive squad tryna kick down my door
Fresh out the bed, flush the dope down commodes
Underground railroad, they call me a mole
Bonny & Clyde, fugitive with yo ho
Summertime fugitive, even in snow
(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
El Chapo mane he a fugitive
Griselda Blanco was a fugitive (RIP)
Big Meech, he was a fugitive
Al Capone was a fugitive
Gucci Mane was a fugitive
Bugsy Siegel, fugitive
Wrist cost 10 bricks, fugitive
No serial number, my uzzi a fugitive1Embed
