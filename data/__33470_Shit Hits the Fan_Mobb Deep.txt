2 ContributorsShit Hits the Fan Lyrics
God damn, nigga left bleeding with his head in his hands
Wishing that he never crossed fam
And but still niggas like that get left slain
Found days later on the ave in a can
We used to dance all night my main man
We used to give each other pounds wit da webs of our hands
Its a click thing, yall niggas wouldn't understand
We used to get off loose cracks and bag grams
Hold each other down, duckin the blue van
The d's on the roof, plus the 6-Y cab
Who'd ever thought u was a snake in the grass
One of my stash whip and keys to my lab
You wanted me shot dead, some things you can't have
I pulled out the 8, when you almost got stabbed
We followed the same path, cryed and shared laughs
Now I can't wait, for the day to see your bloodbath
Plug dat, fill you up wit slugs rat take that...

They never think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
They don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
They never think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit them

I'm in a benz for stealth, thinkin on plans
Stopped at a red light, the birds like damn
I saw one whisper to the other, thats him
That MOB nigga I think he platinum
Pulled to the next corner hopped out and asked them
If they knew directions to rhode island
We was in East New York, they thought I was wildin
Its a click thing they wouldn't understand
Meanwhile I looks to my left and see some niggas frownin
As if they was go flip now peep this
I'm writin shorties math on the trunk of the Six
The bitch wanna blow dick cause its deep dish
These niggas wanna twist me because of my necklace
I'm calm though you know I got the stash in the whip
I clap though, these niggas better blast very quick
They coming towards me, I sat in the passenger seat
Reached underneath, grabbed the big Fifth
Acting like I'm not knowing whats happenin
I'm still havin conversation with these hens
I'm bout to have a confratation with these mens
I know I'm going home wit my chain and my head
Yall won't dead me, I sleep in my own bed (pop pop pop pop pop)

Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
They don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
They never think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit themEmbed
