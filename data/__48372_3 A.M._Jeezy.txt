13 Contributors3 A.M. Lyrics
It's Young Jizzle and I'm back with Timbo
With another hit
You still stuck in a limbo
An adlib here and an adlib there
Fuck it adlibs everywhere (yeeeeaahh)
As I proceed to give you what you need
Spit straight drop, nigga cocoa leaves
A-Town pimp, tell me what you know about it
Wanna talk white, I'll tell you what I know about it
I'm on that Grey Goose, higher than a pelican
Sophomore year but I spit it like a veteran
Gangsta, gangsta you can tell by the swag
And it's fresh off the lot
You can tell by the tag, what's up

It's about three in the morning
Gotta leave with somethin hot cause a nigga horny
Now I'm in the parking lot, baby all over me
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha
It's about three in the morning
Got my thing cocked cause them boys they be on it
Niggas they be talking but they don't really want it
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha
You might also like
The flow's so cold and I'm so cool
Let a nigga try, I'mma act a damn fool
Got that Will Ferrel, we call it Old School
Then we mix it all up, call it Pro Tools
Serve em demo tracks, let em demo that
All these bitches in the club, where the bad ones at
She got a mean walk I got a big stick
I see you mugging homie, I got a full clip
See I master that, and then I mastered this
Then I bring it all back, I gotta master wrist
I was on dro and she was on Hen
She was on her, and I was zoning, let's get it

It's about three in the morning
Gotta leave with somethin hot cause a nigga horny
Now I'm in the parking lot, baby all over me
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha
It's about three in the morning
Got my thing cocked cause them boys they be on it
Niggas they be talking but they don't really want it
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha

Verse three, I'm back to the basics
Fresh out the jeweler
Came back with the bracelet
Blowing haze yeah dogg I can taste it
Parked the 430 came back in a spaceship
And my whip game is so sick man
I double up everytime I flip man
Birds by the flocks, clips in the Glocks
Multi-platinum, still watchin for the cops
Ya girl keep sweating me, she staring at my rocks
Me I'm G'd up, grabbing on my, huh
I walk it how I talk it, play it how I say it
Me and Timb on the track, but everybody play it
It's about three in the morning
Gotta leave with somethin hot cause a nigga horny
Now I'm in the parking lot, baby all over me
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha
It's about three in the morning
Got my thing cocked cause them boys they be on it
Niggas they be talking but they don't really want it
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha1Embed
