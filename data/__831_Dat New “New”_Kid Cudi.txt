61 ContributorsDat New “New” Lyrics
Head, head, HeadBanga
Hello, what it be
To you and yours

Salutations to all, you can call me Cudi
Or Mr. Extravagant 'cause I'm getting my money
Way my doors are swayin', it's like a bird on wheels
You can come to Ohio and you can see how it feels
And this the premier of that new-new here
It's gonna take you beyond
Where a jet can't Lear
But all you gon' hear
Is somethin' crazy in fact
How I be burnin' the booth
We'll get you looser than Yak
Yep-yep, you got it right
Now don't get left
Get on your good foot
It's only right that you step
And keep boppin' to this shit unfamiliar
If your main line got time then I be drillin' her
I keep you in my realm
I keep you in the sound
I keep myself up high
Because the haze by the pound
And my imagination
You can look all over the nation
But they ain't see
You might also like
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop, it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
'Cause I provide
That new new

Salutations my niggas
I'm aware that I'm different
You can still keep it hood
While you're smokin' just listen
It don't matter your race
Just take a blunt to the face
And we all gon' rock
Got to keep up the pace
And them girls gon' twerk
Because the vibe is poppin'
As well as the bottles
Keep it rockin', don't stop 'em
At the Motel-8
We can park out front
Yeah the flow is unleaded
You sucka niggas will front
'Cause I'm Super-Cudder-Realistic-Leaner-Alidocius
And rap ferocious
I been coaching the league
I bobble head the public
If you love it, M dub it
Blood, sweat, and tears; homie, I'm made of it
Finish the class if you think nothing 'bout it
Tell 'em like grandpa, you don't know nothing 'bout it
Wear kicks once, then the Leaner come up out 'em
I been sayin' it, you was playin' him
Now you know
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop, it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
'Cause I provide
That new new

What it be to my ladies
With the bodies that kill
We ain't boppin' on money
Fuck with me 'cause you real
See you shakin' it fast
On some Mystical shit
You could slap that nigga
If he call you a bitch
Yeah I see you with that
But you should be on this
It's that Henney and Coca-Cola
Come over and sit
Won't you tell me your name
Tell me where you be at
I know you know that them hot
But I don't wanna hear that
You see I aim for a check
Before I aim for sex
Niggas aim for death
They tryin' to fuck with the blessed
Ain't no fuckin' with amateurs
Run passed the novice
Sip hella lean
To see who talks the slowest
Ain't no stoppin' me at all
You'd need a sawed-off, or maybe a chainsaw
And even at that
The crack that I brew is still new
Y'all niggas think acute
But Cudi is obtuse
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop, it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
'Cause I provide
That new new40Embed
