24 ContributorsPolluted Lyrics
They say a cat got nine lives, but a young nigga got one of em'
Little girl just killed herself cause little kids make fun of her
My homeboy was getting money his plug used to sell a ton on him
Some of the niggas used to run with me be the same niggas you run from
Some of these niggas still richer than me
Some of these niggas got bigger than me
Some of these niggas 
What a better position for a nigga to be
Some of these niggas still down with me
Some can't even come around to see
Some of these niggas be doubting me
When they know they should be crowning me
Real street nigga, real Kingpin nigga
Got two, three, four, five families
So much dope in the city feel like i ain't give a nigga like a gram a piece
Let me rephrase that, a gram for free
The apple don't fall far from the tree
What's a stripper bitch to a nigga like me
When a half a brick nigga will whip it up free

My hood polluted, my mind polluted
If I pull that pistol out my nigga i'm a shoot it
My hood polluted, my mind polluted
If you pull that pistol out my nigga you better use it
My hood polluted, my mind polluted
If I pull that pistol out my nigga i'm a shoot it
My hood polluted, my mind polluted
If you pull that pistol out my nigga you better use it
You might also like
My hood polluted, my hood confusing
My young niggas ridin' round with sawed-offs AK's, AR's and Uzi's
Ain't no pick and choosing
You know how we do it
We pull up four deep in a highbar shoot everything that's moving
Last night we got into it
Pussy ass nigga shot up my Buick
Broke in my house and you stole my music
Now you dealing with embalming fluid
Sorry to tell you you're man's not moving
Chopped off his head now his forehead's moving
Ten out of ten bitch your boy ain't snoozing
Got a Mac 10 and I just might use it
Time after time gotta show these niggas
That the Gucci Mane just don't make good music
Talkin' all out what point you proving
Why you getting mad cause your girlfriend choosing
I be constantly be crossing the country
These niggas constantly trying to prove this shit
I'm callin' my partner to bring my choppa
I told 'em to bring me that new stick

My hood polluted, my mind polluted
If I pull that pistol out my nigga i'm a shoot it
My hood polluted, my mind polluted
If you pull that pistol out my nigga you better use itEmbed
