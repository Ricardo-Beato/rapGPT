Ladies (Yeah), fellas (Ayy, ayy)
Let  me tell y'all musty crusties something (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ho)
Like  that, look

I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I'm  not single no more
I  ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I  ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I  ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I'm not
I done messed around and found a good one
Made just for me, yeah, made just for me
And I found one
I done messed around and found a good one
Made just for me, for me, for me, for me
You might also like
Now what you witnessed was a parallel paradigm
You was there, you just wasn't there in time
Turns out she the marryin' kind
Very smart and she very fine, and she very kind
Gimme kisses in her spare time
And she's very mine
With her hair up in a bun, she surprise me with the lunch
She just tell me when it's done, it's Aries sign
I be cryin' in the club, like this birthday is a dub
Okay this birthday is a dub now where's my boo?
Twenty/twenty, twenty/twenty vision, I see you
2020 I'ma try and be around you
This shit is exactly what our twenties for
Let's keep goin' we got plenty more, ayo

I ain't single no more
I ain't single no more
I ain't single no more (Like that)
I ain't single no more
I ain't single no more (What they do, what they do)
I ain't single no more (What they do, what they do)
I ain't single no more (I ain't single no more)
I ain't single no more
I done messed around and found a good one
Made just for me, yeah, made just for me
And I found one
I done messed around and found a good one
Made just for me, for me, for me, for me
Now what you witnessed was the turn, was the pledge
The prestige, you can feel it in the breeze, turn the bird to debris
Turn the fur to thin air, it's a thousand degrees, set it free
I prefer if you pop lock with me

Slow motion (Motion, motion)
What you witnessed is a girl and a man
Coming together in love

Look
I ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I'm not single, I'm-I'm not single, no I'm not s-
I ain't single no more
I done messed around and found a good one
Made just for me, yeah, made just for me
And I found one
I'm not single no more
I done messed around and found a good one
(More, more, more, more)
Made just for me, yeah, made just for me
(More, more, more, more)
And I found one
Look
I ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
I ain't single no more (And I found one)
I ain't single no more
I'm not single no more
I ain't single no more
More, more
I ain't single no more
More, more
I ain't single no more
More, more
I ain't single no more (What they do, what they do)
