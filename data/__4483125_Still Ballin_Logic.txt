81 ContributorsStill Ballin Lyrics
'Cause that's uh, Seth MacFarlane shit
Orville, we on that outer space
Fuck it, we keeping this in the beginning too
Nyeesh

I'm ready to kick it
Give me the sample, you know I'ma flip it
Writin' this shit like I'm Lemony Snicket
If she lookin' bad then you know I'ma dick it
I whip it out, then let her lick it
I'm wicked, I'm awesome, I'm icy, I'm flossin'
Literally, shit is literary
I eviscerate any my adversary
When I rolled up, showed up, leave 'em toed up
If you represent, then throw up
Tell me how you really wanna get it
'Cause you motherfuckers better be ready for the moment that I'ma give it
I'm a monster like Nicki, I'm twisted
Don't look away, no you don't want to miss it
I'm glad everybody can listen me spit it
I hit 'em with the brrat like gat, don't miss it
Ayy, bitches, they all on my dick
I know you lovin' this shit
Rappers, they run when I spit
Wait, let me reload the clip
I'm kicking this shit like kung fu, kicking this shit like Cordae do
Kill 'em all, then hit the rendezvous
Killing these beats like Kanye do
Like Yeezus, believe us, my Jesus, I'm ballin'
Top five alive but number one callin'
They say, "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, you so busy, so shameless
Hit another level when your ass got famous"
Now they taking shots at the boy but it's aimless
That purple micro, red dot, I'm high and I'm killin' shit
Since 2009, feelin' fine, yeah, I'm still in it
Changin' with the times when I rhyme, people feelin' it like braille
They say, "Logic different now," and I be like, "Oh well"
I'm rich, I'm healthy, I'm happy, and I'm wealthy
Money like my last name Banks
Bitch, you Geoffrey, bitch, you Geoffrey, like shit
You salty, uh, I said you salty 'cause you sluggish
I made it 'cause I'm me, ain't switch the image like I'm thuggish
I'm ballin' like the Nuggets, they hatin', I'm like, "Fuck it"
Every shot I take, I make like Kobe, I'm like, "Buckets"

I'm ballin', I'm ballin', y'all

Told you way back when that I ain't fuckin' with y'all
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', y'all
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')
Wasn't with me way back when, then I won't answer the call

Wasn't with me way back when, then I won't answer the call (Okay)
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')

One foot out the door, one foot in the Wraith
I do what I want, you do what they say
Gucci, I don't rock, only Taylor Gang
New chain I just bought so icy, freeze your brain
Party on the plane, party when I land
I just left the snow and now I'm in the sand, y'all don't understand
Everywhere we go, people turn to fans
I don't mean to brag but I get the bag, y'all don't see the plan
Pressure, all I smoke is pressure
Million dollars in the bank and fitted on the dresser
And I ain't ever gonna change, I'll stay the same forever
You niggas better play it safe 'til everything is settled
I'm in the new levels, I keep my cool better
Just copped a new crib because the pool better
Just got a private flight, that mean I flew better
To kill this fuckin' beat, me and Logic, who better? Hahaha
I'm ballin' (Uh), I'm ballin', y'all
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')
Told you way back when that I ain't fuckin' with y'all (Hahaha, yeah)
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', y'all (Yes, sir)
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')
Wasn't with me way back when, then I won't answer the call
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', y'all
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')
Told you way back when that I ain't fuckin' with y'all
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', y'all
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')
Wasn't with me way back when, then I won't answer the call
(I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm ballin')51Embed
