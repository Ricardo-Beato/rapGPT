10 ContributorsShopping Spree Lyrics
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Shopping spree, shopping spree

Shawty want to take a shopping spree
So she need a nigga on his grind
Shawty want to take her shopping spree
Then she want to make that pussy mine
Shopping spree, shopping spree
You never took a
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Want to go on a
Shopping spree, shopping spree

I'm a young dope boy getting money (racks)
Ain't nothing buy a bitch new purse (designer)
Need a fly here on earth (space)
Find nigga who sell T-shirts (work)
T-shirt that shop for the work (lean)
Ain't got panties up under that skirt
Walk red bottoms til' you feet start to hurt
Want to go splurge
Want to go Gucci
Want to go Dolce
Want to go shopping
Want start over
Want to go brag
Want to go boasting
All to you friends
Tell them where you went
Shopping for the Benz
You got you a nigga
And all do win, win, win, win, win
I stay hitting licks again, again, again, again, again and again
You wanna set a trend
That's never gonna end
You wanna to have a mojo
Drive foreign Bouton
You want to have a style
That can't be denied
You love big house
Drive a fly ride
You want to hit the bank
With a check that's blank
Want rodeo
Tell you about the flank
Go to New York, Fashion Week (turn up)
Drink champagne, and don't even think
You might also like
Shawty want to take a shopping spree
So she need a nigga on his grind
Shawty want to take her shopping spree
Then she want to make that pussy mine
Shopping spree, shopping spree
You never took a
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Want to go on a
Shopping spree, shopping spree

Put designer all on your body
Presidential your wrist (Shine)
Gucci, Pucci, Louis (wassup)
Christian Louboutin
Let's take trip at fifths
And shop like your birthday here
You fuck the kid the best
I'mma buy gifts every day this year
Your purse matching you earrings
Your earrings matching your shoe
Chanel o-nel o-nel (what's that?)
You sick of Jimmy Choo (eww)
You would think I played for the falcons
All them birds coming through
Yo nigga grind 365
Get shot to the face
Turn blue
Your Louis V drank champagne
You spit you buy five racks
You keep your little mouth close
I'm a let you play with that sack
This set right here full of Hundred (Cash)
Them boys jumped out that hundreds
We can go to best buy today and
Buy two flat screens for your mama
(Future)
Shawty want to take a shopping spree
So she need a nigga on his grind
Shawty want to take her shopping spree
Then she want to make that pussy mine
Shopping spree, shopping spree
You never took a
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Want to go on a
Shopping spree, shopping spree
