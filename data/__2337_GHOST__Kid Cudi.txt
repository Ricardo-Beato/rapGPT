Yeah, woah-woah, oh
Yeah, woah-woah, haha
Yeah
My name is Scott Mescudi, yeah
Yeah

Gotta get it through my thick head
I was so close to being dead, yeah
Life, live it, with nobody's help tips
Man, I'm just walking without being led
See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and man
I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah
The beginning is always followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah, haha, yay
Yeah, whoa, whoa-whoa, yoo

Tried to fight it, but soon that gave in
Went down a road with no lights on
Can't describe it, and you don't move like them
You become their worst nightmare
You remember the things that your parents had said and well
Rather find out the hard way
You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
I keep with my stroll, I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things still trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah
Yeah, woah-woah

Oh-oh-oh
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
I really understand that they...
I really think I, umm...
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
