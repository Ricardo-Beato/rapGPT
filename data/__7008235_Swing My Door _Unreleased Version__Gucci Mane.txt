You are tuned to another street classic
DJ Scream, Supastar J. Kwik (DJ Scream)
Trap-Tacular: Heavy in the Streets
Hood rich, bitch

I'm a gold mouth dawg, definition of the South
Ain't no quarters, ain't no halves, just some wholes in 'dis house
Ain't no bitch, it ain't no bed, it ain't no clothes in dis house
It's a drought, and my price will make yo eyes pop out
I can't neva count my stash 'cause I always loose count
I can't neva keep no bitch 'cause I put them hoes out
I was corner store and in the motel in it, selling it
You can check my rap sheet, its numerous felonies
I took twenty-three stacks, and bought some jet skis
Have pity for the cop who gotta arrеst me
A front street, jump street, then jump out, it's a track meet
Use to havе a ten-speed, now I got a Bentley

Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down (We Heavy in the Streets, boy)
Every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
And you know they swing my door
And it's 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
You might also like
I got my rims finger-fucked by a god dam J
Gave him 1.8 of some hard ass yay
It's a lot of crack smokers in the apartments where I stay
And I know they name and face 'cause I serve them everyday
Had a '98 Caprice, was a rollin' drug store
You ain't got all the money, what you call my phone fo'?
Rob me, six feet, in the dirt you 'bout to go
Layin' with the coroner with a tag placed on your toe
I can lock the whole town if I break the shit down
But it might be slow, so I'm sellin' shit whole
I can lock the whole town if I break the shit down
But I'm lettin' shit go and I'm sellin' shit whole (DJ Scream, nigga)

Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
And you know they swing my door
And it's 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
Niggas call me "thrift store" 'cause the know the price low
I count 18 rubber bands every time I swing my door
Breaker, breaker, beaker, beaker
Spent 350 for the sneakers
It came from servin' geekers
Yella' 'Vette nicknamed Chiquta
A clear coat Chevy, same color Aquafina
Quarter million dollar lick, that changed my whole demeanor
Ridin' a scooter through South Beach, lookin' for a Trina bitch
Diamond necklace, diamond anklet, diamond princess, Bimmer bitch
I change lanes, paint change, hangin' out the brain dawg
Bottles of champagne and it came from sellin 'caine dawg
Coca-cola, pickin' yola, and it stank, you smell the odor
When I sk-sk-sk-sk-skrrt, I bet it jump back over, over
Ridin' in my rental, got a Rover in my pocket, though
84 stack, 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Nigga violate, I'ma kill him and slit his throat
Smoke a blunt of dro and then take my ho to Pappadeaux's

Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
And you know they swing my door
And it's 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door, nigga1Embed
