34 ContributorsFrozen Lyrics* sound of bomb dropping *

Music is life I ain't in to fashion or ice
I ain't into chain snatchin', ain't into smackin' a wife
Fan supportin' don't never ask him the price
If you new you can't afford it, you better askin' advice
Stick to the point if I ever had me a knife
Y'all gas better hope I don't ever have me a light
Meth, not the type you do in a pipe
But the type when you feel it you know I'm doing it right
You know I spit it but hate to love to admit it
They criticizing the lyrics, guess everybody's a critic, look
I push the limit while rappers is pushing gimmicks
I use it to push my pen and then add it to the premise hook
Yah, still talk about it and I still live it
Underground without a shovel and still diggin'
It's always been about the struggle, y'all just didn't get it
My hood trouble, if y'al don't live here then don't visit

Most of us poppin' pain, sellin' drugs in the rain
I don't sweat money, neck chills in the frost
Make money, maintain and build me a train
Rollin' Buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose, and a big Ruger
Most of us poppin' pain, sellin' drugs in the rain
I don't sweat money, neck chills in the frost
Make money, maintain and build me a train
Rollin' Buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose, and a big Ruger
You might also like
And do you know the penalty for that?
What penalty?
The penalty is death and there is no alternative

Color me bad
Face emerge, blood in the bath
Switchblade, quick raid, drugs on the glass
Ugly villains, hunchback, gun for the killin'
Suitcase, FBI plant a bug on the millions
Shoot-outs, hang glides on the train ride
Mafia's assassins, cocaine's inside
Fat man with the pinky ring laughin'
Movin' the static through traffic
The hoss, boss called The Dragon
His head's bald, enemies are mauled
His hands are claws, cigar's lit, targets are hit
His broad is fit with the largest tits
Through the fog, they sit
Helicopters over Nicaragua
Scuba divers dig for lobster
The zoo are tigers, pits, and jaguars
The bets, NASCAR
Threats, Nasaw
Fools wear wires, shooters was hired
Most of us poppin' pain, sellin' drugs in the rain
I don't sweat money, neck chills in the frost
Make money, maintain and build me a train
Rollin' Buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose, and a big Ruger
Most of us poppin' pain, sellin' drugs in the rain
I don't sweat money, neck chills in the frost
Make money, maintain and build me a train
Rollin' Buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose, and a big Ruger

Like a Shaolin astoundin', pound grounds like mountains
Bouncin', be the largest nigga, pounds and ounces
Well-rounded like cursive, my verses birth inertia
Converge and surge, hurt and burn ya
Philosophical, spit prodigal, son quantical
Known to bust a clip and swift kick right at your opticals
In a hot pursuit, I split particles, follicles rift
Punches hit with nautical drifts, spark up the spliff
Chris Samurai, mesmerized, strikes cleaner than sanitize
You fantasize, real, couldn't show it more if I pantomime
Bronx symphony, stomp lyrically, chomp bitch MCs
Earn mine, wouldn't even give you niggas my sympathies
Feelin' me? Said you feelin' me, you niggas feelin' heat
Brave hearted, you leave departed like Hawk's enemies
Marvel, marvelous, my art is bliss
If you ain't the nicest, you a target, bitch
Chris
We the first niggas that did that. I don't give a fuck what nobody say
Alright bring it back a little bit

Most of us poppin' pain, sellin' drugs in the rain
I don't sweat money, neck chills in the frost
Make money, maintain and build me a train
Rollin' Buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose, and a big Ruger
Most of us poppin' pain, sellin' drugs in the rain
I don't sweat money, neck chills in the frost
Make money, maintain and build me a train
Rollin' Buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose, and a big Ruger

Are you kidding? I don't necce? it's brutal. You deserve to be punished
Well, I'd like to see you try that
You think this is going to work out? It isn't going to be quite so easy. He who kills will be killed. Those who kill will have to be killed
Wh-what now?2Embed
