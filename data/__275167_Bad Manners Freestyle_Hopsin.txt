46 ContributorsBad Manners Freestyle Lyrics
Uh, Hopsin, yo, check it

I've come to conclusion that life sucks
The only good that comes out of it is sticking my dick in nice butts
So if it's wetter than normal inside your wife's cunt
It's my nut, I busted inside her that hasn't dried up (Yuck!)
I'm such a contradiction, I hang with Dizzy Wright
And all he does is smoke so when I'm breathing all the ganja gets in
Not to mention I'm condescending, my mind is missing
Plus I'm kinda sending the wrong signal, oh god, I'm sickening
I'm not the one you wanna start shit with
I'm part animal, part dimwit with bad manners like Bart Simpson
You Hollywood niggas who write songs
I'll give you a black eye, that's a good reason to put some ice on
I'm like a Jedi with the Obi-Wan bars
Lyrics are shocking just like a phoney gun charge
My niggas we only fuck with the dopey blonde broads
We play 'em, and trade 'em like they were Pokemon cards
I excel in rap, it's 'cause I been through fucking hell and back
You ain't close to dope, it's just that everybody else is wack
Niggas getting jealous tryna diss me, scary!
I'm an animal, fuck a Mink coat, bitch wear me!
Yo, all you rappers quit your bitching and sit and listen
I'm the new sick edition of Pac, this is the demolition
I'm so tired of all the reminiscing
So I'ma leave these niggas shook like my dick when I finish pissing
(Yo, you fucking nasty dog) Get off me
I love Christ, but guarantee you wouldn't wanna cross me
I'm as frustrating as lost keys
My sick mind's a good example of what the crooked law breeds
I'm trying to die as the greatest rapper
Shit, I'm so hungry I could stick my fist in a blender and drink it after
You climbing up then I'ma break the ladder
And you'll fall off so damn hard that every bone in your face will shatter
Fuck these niggas, I'm a racist bastard
You hear the devil speaking in tongues on this song if you replay it backwards
Tell your sister I can't wait to smash her
But I heard that her pussy stinks so make sure that she fucking takes a bath first
I come second to none
My verbal weapon is perpetuous, and it's just as effective as guns
You destined to plunge, homie, I find it pleasant and fun
Like having sex with a nun (What the heck have ya done!?)
Whoa, I'm known to hate, I use foul language to motivate
I know I'm dope, okay, but Hop ain't real was just a role I play
Earth, I don't know this place, but I just wanna stroll away
Into my home in space wearing a pair of flying rollerblades
