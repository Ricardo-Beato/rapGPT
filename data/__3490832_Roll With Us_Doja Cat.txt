Baby, you can roll, roll with us
And I know that you know, you know bitches
You should bring them hoes and bros with us
And baby, you can roll, maybe you can roll, roll with us, yeah

We can roll, baby, yeah, we can ride
I do this all the time, you living that trap life, yeah, yeah, yeah
You could come and party with my bitches, yeah
Nobody at your neck, not monogamous
This ain't gon' be over 'til you done with it
Never thought that you'd ever get used to this
Doin' stupid shit but you won't do it
Doja Cat

Baby, you can roll, roll with us
And I know that you know, you know bitches
You should bring them hoes and bros with us
And baby, you can roll, and you know you can roll, roll with us, yeah

Roll, roll with us
And baby, you can roll, roll with us (Roll with us)
Yeah, roll, roll with us
And baby, you can roll, maybe you can roll, roll with us, yeah

Leave all that drama out the door, that shit can wait
And boy you know you ain't just fly, 'cause I'm in LA
I know you know I know you and you know me
And we won't bring nobody that can infiltrate
Oh, baby, it's okay, BYOB
Got a big ass Jeep, bringin' all them freaks, yeah
Come and smoke my tree, I'ma fill my drink
We done had a long ass week, ah, yeah, yeah

Baby, you can roll, roll with us
And I know that you know, you know bitches
You should bring them hoes and bros with us
And baby, you can roll, and you know you can roll, roll with us, yeah

Roll, roll with us
And baby, you can roll, roll with us (Roll with us)
Yeah, roll, roll with us
And baby, you can roll, maybe you can roll, roll with us, yeah

Maybe you can roll, roll with us, yeah
Maybe you can roll, roll with us, yeah3Embed
