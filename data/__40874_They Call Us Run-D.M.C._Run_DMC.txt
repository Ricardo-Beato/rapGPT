6 ContributorsThey Call Us Run-D.M.C. Lyrics
Yeah! Now that I waxed the crowd, I’m feeling proud and loud
Shoulda screamed on a sucker, but I stepped and bowed
Now that I’m back to ‘tract, I’ll attack for fun
Darryl Mack and  is never wack or lack they call us

Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– MC
Run-D– Run-D–D– Run-D— Run-D– MC

I’m strapped with rap when I attack, I’m stunning
Darrly Mack on track and I’m off, and running
Don’t sneak this peak, because I keep on taking
The lead with speed, and records keep on breaking
I pop and drop, all op-position
And pop Hip-Hop, cause I’m the top, position
I ill and chill, cause my skill is super
For a mill I thrill, but I’m still a trooper
I’ll slay and stay ‘til there are none
So romance and dance and prance, a to the chants of

Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– MC
Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– MC
Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– MC
Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– MC

Well I stomp and chomp, all com-petition
Make break and take you cold on a mission
Raise hell, excel, and tell you, who’s winning
I’m boss, you lost, before the game first inning
Let’s go and flow, to the rhymes, I’m saying
Cause it’s fun for Run to see the crowd obeying
Mic be checking I’m wrecking we’re never second to none
So let’s snap and clap and tap, to the to the rap of

Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– MC
Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– MC

I’m not the king, because (cause) I sell the most
I just bring the laws (laws), cause I’m the host
I got a crown I wear… So what it mean? I rule
I come to town they stare, cause D.M.C. is cool
 because, the crowd, is on it
Drop this beat and pause, the tables are turning
Break backs on track and I can even act
So max, relax, new jacks, and get the facts from

Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– MC
Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– Run-D– MC
They call us on the phone, they call us all alone
They call us where we roam, they call us when we’re home
They call us up to par, they call us in our cars
They call us in the bars, they call us superstars
They call us…
