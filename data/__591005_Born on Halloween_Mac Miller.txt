4 ContributorsBorn on Halloween Lyrics
Ayo, Ghost, you crazy for this one, man
Ha, East End Empire
Let's get this one real quick
Trick or treat, muhfuckers

Yo, look
I'm pickin' a fight, deliver this, finna get rid of your life
Isn't it nice? I'm rippin' it once, it's hittin' you twice
Ghost deliver it nice, so take it as a present (You know)
Fuck sittin' in college, I kick this knowledge for the lesson
It burn ya chest, the words are blessed, confuse and bring ya questions
'Cause with my complexion (Yep), a fingernail could cut the tension
And in case I didn't mention: spittin' it better than anyone did it before (Uh-huh)
I'm rippin your corpse (Yep), dippin' and lettin' you live in the morgue
Shit on the porch, trick or treat, I'm here to piss on the floor
And if I didn't come with the whip, I'm gettin' in yours (Gimme that)
On Devil's Night, we bless the track
Mischief, so we rest from raps
Steal your soul, snatch your heart, laugh and let your chest collapse
I'm dressed in black, ready to run up inside your crib
Smack you upside the head while you sittin' beside your kid
I laugh 'cause your son's in my history class
Make him cry while he see his dad kissin' my ass (Haha)
Spittin' razor sharp cancer, so I'm pissin' out glass
Sit and relax, you bitches stay and live in the past
And here's a toast to me and Ghost
We be the dopest with this rhyme skill (You know)
 explode like you wander through a minefield
Time kill itself, clock blowin' out his brains
'Cause you are the Average Joes and John Does without a name (Cheah)
You might also like
Yeah, hand over them candy bags and all that shit (All of it)
Okay, yo
Aight, yo

It's like now for a word from a motherfuckin' scholar (Uh-huh)
Late October, homie, I was born a monster (Monster)
Blowin' on that ganja, just listen, don't hate the rhymes
 and them dimes 
I'm Frankenstein, brother
So I wonder what the talk's about, playa, watch your mouth
A small amount of Ghost will turn your crib into a haunted house (Uh-huh)
I'm on your spouse, dick on her blouse, jizz on the couch
I put you on game 'cause in my brain, it's stickin' out
So pick a different route, you 
A slender cat, I'm one of the skeletons in your closet (Yeah)
Our shit is speculator, see you still MC Dracula
Still approach beef with the spatula
The black cat scratches like NASDAQ
I'm past crack, I  duckin' in tents
They might despise, I see a fire and I'm 
We got the nicest lines and 

Yeah, y'all know what it is
Hey, Ghost, let's give 'em sixteen more (Oh yeah?)
Of this straight hip-hop monster shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Ah, we definitely got this shit, man)
East End Empire, let's get it
I'm ready to vote, my  and dro up in my bags
Got a scale to weigh it out, my paper route, I'm gettin' cash

Crew is  for you healthy rappin' clowns
Smack you down, crack your crown, 

You don't wanna talk shit to us (Nope)
We live to bust heads with these fisticuffs
Then dap you like, "What up?" (What up?), just to pick you up
'Cause we splittin' cup while you spittin' butt

Matter fact, your clique is  (Ass)
 ridiculous, knock you out with the verbal
Smellin' , twist it up, cook a track, whip it up (Uh-huh)
Hook that ass, fix him up
I think I'ma skip the shit you spit, nigga, I'm into 

Yo, let's wrap it up
I think we made a point and that's enough
Ghost and Mac is rough, so muhfuckers start backin' up (Cheah)
Man, your squad is  enough
Don't start actin' up like your sinuses and vagina lips
I'm inclined to spit

Yeah, all day, man
East End Empire, The Ill Spoken, The Scholars
I see you 
What up, Beedie?
Big Will, all y'all, what's good?
Franchise
Oh, and I made the beat, bitch1Embed
