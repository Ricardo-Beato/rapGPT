2 ContributorsGot This Money (Acoustic @ Ace Hotel) Lyrics
1, 2, 3

I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it with you
I got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like, I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you, oh

I don't know where to go, I don't know where to hide
Everywhere that I go, you're right by my side
You're the only girl that I have ever dreamed of
I wanna tell you everything, but everything just seems dumb

I really like you, girl, really wanna dress you up
I wanna buy you for real
I really like you, girl, O really wanna feel you up
I wanna feel you for real

I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it with you
I got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like, I promise then, I'll be true, baby
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you, oh
You might also like
I got an upstairs, downstairs in my loft
Check the mixtape, baby, I don't talk
Yes, I run this shit, like it's hard to walk
And you think that I'm dope, like a mound of chalk
I'm recession proof, I work to relax, ho
Weird voice catch beef like a lasso
New fresh prince, you can chill in my castle
Spit real shit, so I must be an asshole, right?
Nah, that's why I'm makin' out in your car
These blogs are a dude's A&R
Got a big tip for these girls at the bar
But I don't mean money
Ever since the money, they just treat me funny
Girls look good, she can take green from me
Ain't trickin' if you got it, know what I mean, buddy?

You've got your yellow sun dress on
I'm tryna write you the best song
With your Wayfarer shades, you drive me insane
I wanna hold hands, and call you pet names

I really like you, girl, really wanna dress you up
I wanna buy you for real
I really like you, girl, I really wanna feel you up
I wanna feel you for real
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it with you
I got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like, I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you, oh, oh

Ooh-oh
Ooh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
For real
Ohh-ohh-oh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-oh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-oh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-oh-ohhEmbed
