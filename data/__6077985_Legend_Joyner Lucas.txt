24 ContributorsLegend Lyrics
Shit, I close my eyes sometimes and I just think, like...
Like, did you really do this shit, my nigga? Like...
Is this shit even real, cuz?
Ha, this shit crazy (Buck, buck, buck, buck)
I go to sleep and I try to wake up with a clear conscience and shit, you feel me? Like...
I done been through the mud, nigga
Sacrificed a lot to get to the endzone, my nigga
Just tryna give our kids a better life than we had, my nigga (Buck, buck, buck, buck)
I always wanted to change the cycle and
Create a new generation and pass down everything I worked for, my nigga
I'm just, I'm just thinkin' out loud
Look (Yеah)

I wonder where lifе would probably take me, yeah
Won't break me, yeah
I show some love to niggas who hate me, yeah (Yeah)
That's crazy, yeah
I kept my cool without no AC, yeah (Word)
Got somethin' to prove, I jumped in the pool and now I'm wavy, yeah (Splash)
And lately, I've been tryna hold my blessings
You talk to God, but you don't know the message
Those are lessons (Yeah)
Walkin' in circles without no direction
No exceptions (Woah)
Don't give advice if you don't know the pressure
Close your lips 'cause half of you more full of shit than colon cleansers (Woo!)
I was born in inside a manger (Word)
And no one ever did me favors, now I'm highly-favored (Yeah)
I finally made it out the hood, now I ain't got no neighbors (Nope)
So before you talk to me, you gotta sign a waiver (Woo)
Post-traumatic stress disorder keep my conscience racin'
Deep inside my thoughts
Wonder how much I can grow if I just even out my flaws (Yeah)
How I teach myself I'm still a winner even when I lost?
And if I lose, I know I'll still be on even when I'm off
I took my chances and I'm eatin' now
I'm finally learnin' all the shit I used to read about
Now I could live all of the shit I used to dream about
'Cause niggas tried to leave me out
But I learned to get revenge through my success and so we even now (Buck, buck)
I stare at my reflection 'cause I like what I see (I like what I see)
All them years at CVS workin' them nights on my feet (Nights on my feet)
Ain't a nigga where I'm from'll reach the heights that I'll reach (Word)
I'll risk it all to give this life to my seed (Buck)

And if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
They gon' play this when I'm gone and I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Look)
Said if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
And if they play this when I'm gone, then I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

I done seen a couple niggas lose they life over a dollar (Huh)
And they hit the hardest when it's not an outsider
Better keep your money close 'cause that's the only thing that's honest
Everybody thuggin' 'til they gotta face your honor
'64 Impala, hoppin', scrapin', bumpin' chronic
Ridin' solo 'cause these pussy-niggas out here countin' pockets (Huh)
Stackin' all my money, at the same time, lackin' knowledge
Homegrown in the south, it's in my blood and body-body (Oh)
You say you own your masters, can you tell me what they worth?
I still be havin' flashes 'cause it came from doin' dirt
Fifty restaurants all poppin' and I still be poppin' Percs (Huh)
Get you to support, but then they rob you for your merch (Why?)
Shot her in the foot, what pussy-boy, you rockin' skirts (Gang)
PJ to Miami where you know who got to work
Got the condo on the beaches, let the bitches come and twerk (Twerk)
Woke up out a coma, fuck around and fuck a nurse
And if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Huh)
They gon' play this when I'm gone and I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Look)
Said if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
And if they play this when I'm gone, then I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

And if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
They gon' play this when I'm gone and I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Said if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I was lookin' to the Dope Boys in the FUBU (Yeah, yeah)
And if they play this when I'm gone, then I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Now they lookin' up to us, you heard me? (Uh)4Embed
