3 ContributorsThe Last Laugh LyricsWhen i first stepped off in this game thought i was lame
If you ever had a doubt in your mind should be ashamed
I would look everyone of you niggas dead in the eyes
Ask where the fuck you were at when i stuck with them pies
Wanna save me today it's uncertain stops you won't 75
They searching and it won't be funny when the jokes on you
Here in the far lane and the cokes on you
5'8'' dark skinned and the nigga strapped too
Never bitch never snitch man shit you don't do
So ya'll worship the ground niggas walk on
All those ain't ridin with young get your walk on
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said the streets all dried up no more cain
Niggas still hold they nuts on young it's no tame
Nigga leave you and get caught with the whole thing
You could hope he don't tell them your whole name
How you gonna compare me to remy the hennessy
I think it's time i remind you niggas remember me
And just as i master the streets i master this
Youngs as real as it gets none after this
So this is it the last moheken
Grind all week pull the coupe on the weekend
So ya'll worship the ground a nigga walk on
All those ain't riding with young get you walk on
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Better back 6 i'm a straight young going strong
You in it for the ride of your life so hold on
Not a album this is a way of life
Only rules of the game you gotta pay with your life
If a nigga asked you for everything what would give him
Break bread right on the spot or would you spin him
Exactly that's why the fuck i took a first class window to the top
Tell em to book it first they said it could'ntbe done tell 'em i did it
Then they said it could'ntbe got tell 'em i get it
So ya'll worship the ground a nigga walk on
All those ain't riding with young get you walk on
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
I said i got ya'll niggas
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
Who laughing now
