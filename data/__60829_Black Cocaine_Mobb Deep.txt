10 ContributorsBlack Cocaine Lyrics
America's public enemy number one, is drug abuse

Pay attention, everything I mention's a jewel
All I gotta do is whisper to make the fetti move
The Constitution I go by, cash rules
Everything around me, through movements' grass roots
Started from the bottom, bottom of the pyrex
Hand in hand until that money went high tech
Keep a ledger in the macbook
The crystal ball to us was watchin’ the crack cook
Forseen undisclosed amounts
Bentleys, Ferraris, overseas accounts
Major assets, forgot my address
Got too many of 'em, I don't believe I can have stress
And I’m straight from the projects
Niggas gotta heart, but we don't got a conscience
But I gotta complex, I don’t ever wanna be a bum
So I’m counting money 'til my fingers go numb

Black, black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, black, black cocaine

Black, black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, black, black cocaine

Ask around who’s laid up, sharp and straight up, Maffiosi
The most infamous dangerous rappers on the earth surface
I serve purpose, I don’t bullshit with it when I spit it
Leave a burn like the alien blood in this age of Aquarius
Fear me not, I’m here to guide you through the various stages of changes and consciousness
High of the life and haze, am I a hypocrite?
Chunky black with cat piss, call it Wiz Khalifa
Swinging trees like Tarzan and Latifah
Got me hide in sun, moon, stars and wheezy
All the hash smell, hoes in ya clothes be easy and
Close ya eyes while I rhyme these lines
These black cocaine lines
Now picture me in ya mind
At the concert live
We well worth the ticket
A 120 minutes of ya favorite P lyrics
Yeah that dirty New York, reality rap, that Mobb shit
Classic like Biggie, but we fresh like Minaj is
Now who you know got a flow so timeless?
Who write about more than just cars and diamonds?
It’s more than just whatever new gun's in style is
Prodigy the brainiac kid
Word to baby Jesus
This baby faced genius is lasted so far for 80 seasons
What makes you believe that I will stop now
And allow Mobb Deep to collapse to the ground?
You crazy? I even make that thought get up?
Wipe the dirt of and come again, his is not luck
This is hard work, dedication an passion
You just a flash in the pan
We endless and everlasting
Black, black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black, black, black, black, black, black cocaine
Black black black, black, black, black, black cocaineEmbed
