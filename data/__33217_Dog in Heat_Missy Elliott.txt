8 ContributorsDog in Heat Lyrics
Gimme that funk, um
Funk, um
Yo, gimme that funk
Oh yeah, baby, gimme that funk
Sho' nuff that funk

Yo, yo, beware of the dogs, off the chain (Woof, woof)
Fuck your whips at the club, we piss in the parkin' lanes
Blow it up ten frames so you see it wide
If your broad ain't fuckin she don't need to ride (Beat it)
She can crawl in the trunk with her knees inside
By the spare, she hungry? I'll feed her fries
'Cause I'm a dog nigga (Arf), shot-call nigga
My shotgun talk with a lecture hall scripture
Applaud, bitch, shake that ass
I getcha drunk and high and duct tape that ass fast
Then leave you on your daddy front lawn (Ding-dong)
With your hair all fucked up, with one pump on
Get stomped on, I take the money and run (Run, run)
I'm a dog, shit, I fuck right in front of your son (Get out)
If you ain't got Missy and Meth
Want me to spit the hot shit for you? Nigga, write your check

When you come home from work
I'm gon' make you do more work
Pour some wine in the cup, sip-sippin' on sizzurp
Uh, now we gon' make love to an end, yeah
Slide, wanna take a ride
When you with me, oh so right, tell them boys, not tonight
Say you chillin' with your bitch and this is one you don't wanna miss
Uh, 'cause this love right here is on fire (Fire)
Slide (Oh), wanna take a ride
You might also like
(I love) I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on (Turnin' me on)
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
(I love, yeah) I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on (Turnin' me on)
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks

You on the block layin' low, from the cops layin' low
When you done, let me know
'Cause my love make you be like, "Whoa" (Whoa, uh)
'Cause I got yo' mind in the trenches
Slide, let's take a ride
Baby, come give me some, hey woadie, ain't no other one
Can shine on my life and make me wanna stay the night
Mmm, mmm, 'cause you put butterflies on my stomach
Slide, baby, won't you slide?

(I love) I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on (Turnin' me on)
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
(I love) I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on (Turnin' me on)
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
Yo, yo, I wanna gangsta boogie with my gangsta bitch
Love it when the pussy talk back, thank the dick
All my dogs (Woof) playin the wall, get at these broads
You ain't got no ass at all, we ain't fuckin wit' y'all
I'm not your smooth lovin', see me at the Casbah thuggin'
Hands where your Stove Top be stuffin'
Never catch Tical hand-cuffin', I'm in your party puffin'
Smellin' like that Wu-Tang production
Cousin tried to tell me pussy come a dime a dozen (Uh)
And when it come around I'll beat it down like percussion
Missy come and get me (Yeah), I'm 'bout to call Doc
We can all meet up at Peanut's, I heard it was the spot
Somebody roll the weed up, push the car lighter
Kick your feet up, Saturday night, who got the fever?
Brought the flavor of Indonesia, puff-puff-give-type procedures
And this joint bumpin' out your speakers

(I love) I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on (Turnin' me on)
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
(I love) I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on (Turnin' me on)
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey woadie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
I'm gonna take you high to the top
And let your body not reject me, babe
I'm gon' make you really love me
I'm gonna make you scream, don't stop
But you must first respect this lady
You must respect this ladyEmbed
