"You will be punished" ("Wu-Tang style")
"For all your evil deeds" ("Wu-Tang style")
"Be warnedâ€”you will suffer" ("Wu-Tang style")
"Justice is here!" ("Wu-Tang style")

Slept on this hazardous enterprise
Hit from the back from a long range attack in disguise
Weeks of captivity became months
Those who were holdin' it down now hold a pump
Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin' niggas wanna eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin' wider circles of destructions
So we attack with the cannon blazing
From the terrifyin' to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But their bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear peace in my voice?
Or that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus
The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style
You might also like

"Wu-Tang style"

Ayo once again, all blunts again
Yo the real remain silent, any type of violence I'm in
Allah's helpful most innovative raps
That brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
We holdin', automatic semis with sick lines
Run up, body niggas, break down shoddy niggas
Styles so sharp, state of the art
Greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin' darts
Flowin' like water, "Apocalypse Now"
Gun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us
Runnin' through parkin' lots, don't get caught
Let off, bark your shots, we out of here, off the blocks

It ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin' in the hood
Gotta a hundred wolves waitin' in the woods
For the Clan's forthcomin', I'm issuing the game a court summons
And fugitives of rap caught running
Y'all get locked up, everything was wack 'til we popped up
And got it on and poppin' like Orville Reddenbacher
Partner, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Wu-Tang got ya like every ghetto got a Tasha
Request lines are now open, you see these MCs chokin'
And thinkin', "What's that shit they be smokin'?"
I'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis
Keep my shit funky when I spit this braggadocious
{*hach, spit*} Y'all niggas got some fuckin' nerve
To critic what I write, that's my muh'fucking word
Blah blah blah, like N'Sync
Kiss that ass bye bye bye knahmsayin'? I ain't playin'
Many shall come, few chose to stay exact
Track after track I'm fightin' for survival
Before me I see hills and mountains then sway
The words got 'em moving, the crow is like the ocean
I walk water holdin' y'all suspended with the vocal
What's the total people that came to see the gods?
I gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
Potency, high-level content
Side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
All ages, streets to cages, split faces
Shoutin' nuff love to the peeps from Miami
We live from Pulaski, it's Fred Glassy
