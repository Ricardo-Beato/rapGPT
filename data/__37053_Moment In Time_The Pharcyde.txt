12 ContributorsMoment In Time Lyrics(yo, yo, yo)
If you're listening (x3)
(yo, yo, one two)
This one here goes out to my man Pooky
This one goes out to Tamiko
And all those who passed away, my aunt Bertha
And we go round and round
Life is just a moment in time (x4)

I recall being three when Sunny passed away
One of the greatest in my eyes till this very day
Too young to understand but understood the ways of good and evil
Life and death was in the breath of times fate
And God only knows what kept Peggy straight
Cuz in the very next year my Aunt Dorothy was the late
More beautiful than the word it was like killing a mocking bird
She was so young like the new year was all you heard
Almost saw it so clear the good times that we had
When my Momma showed me pictures life wasn't so bad
I got baby sat By Pat when Bedie was a small guy
And in our cousins eyes we were both small fries
Jazzywazzys growing up to be a big girl now
Father figure understands a man might like her profile
I let sink in a while and told let 'em like ya style
Both you and Ebony I be damned if this short life
Ain't heavenly peace and harmony family season and it goes...
You might also likeAnd we go round and round
Life is just a moment in time...1Embed
