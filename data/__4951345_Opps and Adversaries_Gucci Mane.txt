7 ContributorsOpps and Adversaries Lyrics
Wop
Huh
Brr

No opps or adversaries left, they all are dead and buried (Gone)
Glizock in my Bur-Bur-Bur-Bur-Bur-Bur-Bur-Burberry (Burr)
Slam the dunk on Maynard Terrace like LeBron did Jason Terry (Woo)
You pussies super scary, put that on the Virgin Mary (Huh?)
You make the hood embarrassed, but I made it legendary (Six)
Spend money, I don't cherish it, can't spend it when you're buried (Nope)
I tatted my hood on me, I'm really from the slum
Diamonds look so good on me, I came up off of crumbs (Bling)

Tattoos on my face, the media said it was dumb (Dummy)
Mama threw me out her house for trappin', I was young (Money)
A crook, I get no sympathy, the judge denied the bond (Fuck)
Niggas know what's up with me, this ain't no water gun (Bow)
Missed the shots they took at me, the pussy tried to run (Run)
Keep speakin' down on Gucci's name, I'm gon' cut out your tongue (Rrr)
Chopstick like a guitar, yeah, he ran, didn't have a chance (Huh)
Dancin' with the devil, got my man and did the line

Nobody said nothin', somehow haters bring me up (Huh?)
Suck it 'til I nut, then clean me up (Huh?)
One just ain't enough, sometimes I got 'em teamin' up (Guwop)
Summer over with, Gucci hot as fuck (Guwop)

You pussies super scary, put that on the Virgin Mary (Pussies)
You make the hood embarrassed, but I made it legendary (Six)
Spend money, I don't cherish it, can't spend it when you're buried (Nah)
I tatted my hood on me, I'm really from the slum
Diamonds look so good on me, I came up off of crumbs (Bling)

Haters don't exist, we can't co-exist (No)
What's trap rap to you? Before I rapped, I had a brick (Oh)
Like gettin' a rebound, goin' coast-to-coast with no assist (Go)
Your ho on my dick, you can't throw her shit (Woo)
My ho, your ho, they know, can't play broke, they know I'm rich (They know)
The secret out the lid, (Huh?) I tried to keep it hid (Damn)
My ho act like a jit, don't get what she want, throw a fit (Wah)
I'm thinkin' that I'm tonin' down, they say I'm goin' big (Big)

Nobody said nothin', somehow haters bring me up (Huh?)
Suck it 'til I nut, then clean me up (Huh?)
One just ain't enough, sometimes I got 'em teamin' up (Guwop)
