11 ContributorsBring the Pain Lyrics
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
Are we on air?
Woo (Uh)
Huh? (Uh)
Huh? (Uh)
Huh? (Uh)
This is (Uh)
A Missy Elliott (Uh)
Exclusive (Uh-huh)
Woo (Uh)

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Ooh, baby, what's your name? (Huh?)
I love the way you're spittin' the game
You made me change from thinkin' all guys the same
You the type of guy I wanna marry in months
Got exactly what I want (Huh?)
And ain't no fakin' the funk
Your attitude and spunk and you're makin' me crunk (Come on)

Yes, it's real, baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Oh, you won't be sorry
My papi, I'm your mami
You might also like
I'm in your life to come and let you explore (Huh?)
And take you on a tour (Okay)
The kind of guys that be talkin' that noise (Woo)
Is the reason I ignore (Uh-huh)
And you the one I wanna take to meet moms
"He's a rap superstar" (Uh-huh)
I wanna be the one that you like
I'm sure to do you right

Yes, it's real, baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me (Ooh, ooh)
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Oh, you won't be sorry
My papi, I'm your mami

Is it real, hon? If it's really real (Let's chill)
Maybe pop an X pill (How the sex feel?)
Come and get your next thrill (You the raw deal)
Yo, I'm sayin', if your man won't (Mr. Meth will)
That's amor√©, all day
Mind over matter and my forte is foreplay
Sex on a platter, have it your way
Then who serve you everything on the menu
And all that freak shit that you into?
Sweet lady, you drive me half crazy
Maybe we can go half on a baby (On a baby?)
Papa got a brand new bag
Hidden in the stash of his brand new Jag'
Lovely, kick your shoes off and get comfy
We can bump uglies if you ain't got your monthly
Yes, I like American Pie
Tell 'em M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-Y
Yes, it's real, baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Oh, you won't be sorry
My papi, I'm your mami

M-E-T-H-O-D Man
M-I-S-S-Y, I am
I came-came to bang-bang the boogie (Come on)
I see you lookin' to bang out my nookie
You want my cookies I baked for you rookies
Work hard to book me to bang-bang and stick me
If you want my nookie, you gots to come quickly
M-E-T-H-O-D, is you with me?
Mr. Meth, is you with me?1Embed
