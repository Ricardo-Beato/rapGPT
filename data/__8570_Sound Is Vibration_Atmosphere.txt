45 ContributorsSound Is Vibration Lyrics
I'm sparked, waiting for the dark to hit
'Cause once the moon gets above my apartment
I catch fits for starting shit
I'm smart with it, I give it that special touch when I push it
'Cause I'm also a label rep, and I can't allow no bullshit
So shush kid, shush baby! Shut your eyes
Lay your head back, shed the fear and let the tears crystallize
I wish the flies to land upon your forehead
When I extract the essence from your head
And leave your body resting Moorhead
I left more dead reputations than HIV can
But for every killing there's a reason and it's not just MC's, man!
I'm watching C-SPAN, waiting for the first state rep
To take the first step, to have to kill off to make this world perfect
Well lets get shit right, right here! Right now! Right away!
Atmosphere motherfucker! If I need to I could fly away
I'll grind you and your weak crew into beef stew
Serve you with seafood
You can't cloud my vision cuz you're see-through

You need to recognize the size of the Atmos
You ain't as tall as half this - Madness- past what you practice
RSE you can't fuck with my tactics, you bastard
Thats why you breath fast bitch - no need to ask
You might also like
We dug the fingernails underneath the skin of your scalp, then peeled it
Sent your underdeveloped pre-school style on a field trip
Now bite your tongue, this is how the mic gets stung
A whole tree to pick some fruit from, man! You had to choose the ripest one

That said it all, it comes from inside, and how you ride
The sound wire when it's live and the vibes feelin right
Catchin' the motion given by rhythms when you hit 'em on time
With lines, makin' sure your rhyme soundin' tight
Your voice should travel without the babble of the average emcee
So listen please use discretion when you breath
Sound is vibration, I choose to use it with a vision
And then comes the style and precision...

No more longer will we hold your hands, Why? Cause you're too damn old
Oh yea, the network called, they told me to tell ya you've been cancelled
They also said big up for all the support
Thanks to your devotion, they now control the world
So let your hair down and eat the poison with a tall glass of Tang
I'm rising past the bank, with the smile I flash my fangs
I tumble over some 'cause some I don't over stand
I got the plot from Spawn, from now on I know the plan
It's the noise it makes, that generates the passion I have
It's the void it breaks, that stimulates when mics get grabbed
It takes shape - escapes from these vocal chords I have
Atmosphere: music makers from the Rhymesayers lab

Come now, who fi me gwan test the giants when we apply this
Vice grips to your eyelids to make you read the fine print
The tyrants that gave you crisis, left you silenced
Don't breath a sigh of relief 'til you hear the rescue sirens

Supreme, be this team, we got this shit on lock
RSE we hid the key under an upscale rock
So you could knock all you want to but you ain't gettin' in
Now you can try to crash the door but you ain't gettin' in
Nigga, what! My definition is raw, I got you all
Wishin' I'd fall, so things could get better for y'all
But I'm tall, and got game, remain the same for the duration
Area code 6-1-2, my present location...

Atmosphere...embellished with talent and the wisdom not to abuse it
Blessed with insight, friends and influences
That's what keeps us dope, what makes us dope is the surroundings
Inspiration stems from love and stress compounding
Stamina: that's achieved over the course of time
In fact, time taught me how to breath, battle, not to court my mind
Defined as lyricist - the Atmosphericist
Makin' sure y'all fear this hit every time you hear this shit
 Sound is vibration
 This sound is taken
 Sound is vibration
 And the ground is shaken
 Vibration is sound
 Yo, we found your replacement
 Vibration is sound
