9 ContributorsSo Gone Lyrics
I'm so gone
Ayo, I get so gone
I said, I'm so gone

Uh, uh
Ayo, I'm so gone, somewhere in a cloud
The room is filled with smoke but the blunt still goin' 'round
We blowin' pounds, I'll admit I'm just a weed head
My mom say by age 40 I'ma be dead
But I live free in a world that's make-believe
To say the least, I be goin' like I'm off the leash
I'm pretty chief, roll another four-a-piece
Hit the crib, get it Jerm, have him sendin' me some heat
The beats I speak on, I'm spittin' like my teeth gone
Off an L a couple hundred feet long
Cop it by the pound, smoke until the weed gone
That's when you'll find me goin'
I'm so gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, feelin' like I can't go
On, on, on, on
On, on, on, boy, this weed so bomb
I been high for so long, long

I'm so gone
Ayo, I get so gone
I said, I'm so gone

Uh, uh
And this purple got me paralyzed, the reddest pair of eyes
That you ever seen, never wearin' Visine
I ain't tryna hide it (Nah)
See, I'ma superhero, Mary Jane just my sidekick (What?)
Yeah, something I can't live without, girl, you got me lifted
Those who tell me not to smoke, it's really not your business (Haha)
They say I'm so young and so gifted
But fuck it, more blunts gettin' twisted (Uh-huh)
I love it, I'm so drunk, so piffy
Find me at the spot with mo' skunk, no middies
Y'all know this blueberry so pretty
I'll only come if Mary Jane can go with me
Haha

I'm so gone (Haha)
Ayo, I get so gone
The Sour Hour
Sour Hour
I said, I'm so gone
TreeJay, what up, boy? 'Bout to get Chik-Fil1Embed
