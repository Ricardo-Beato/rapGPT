Got buddy, my buddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
My buddy, pour muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Real mud, that boy pour mud
God damn that boy pour muddy

I got a buddy pour 'da shit real muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
I got a buddy pour the sprite real dirty
God damn, god damn, god damn
I got a buddy from the country
Buddy thank me from the city
He ain't country shitty nigga
But the nigga really picky
Drinkin' on a pint and he cost a pretty picture
Gucci Man and Dolph, freshest niggas in the city
I'dda , trap suit with the rats
He cost a large 99, I was sellings sack
Waka threw me out the house and I moved in with pot
Sleeping on the floor, I didn't even have a stack
You might also like
Got buddy, my buddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
My buddy, pour muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Real mud, that boy pour mud
God damn that boy pour muddy

Take a whole 2 litre
Throw a whole pint in it
Man I'm the club 'sleep
Cause that lean got me trippin'
And I smoke an ounce with it
Plus I'm on the mollies nigga
Clear crystals keep me up
That lean break me down nigga
When we pour it up it be muddy
South Memphis niggas I'm with OG Boo Dirty
I'm on a paper route, I gotta fuck with Young Dolph
100 dolla' ammunition, Pee Wee take 'em out
, punch 1000 pint suck
Nigga wanna spend a 80, no I hear ya' do
Soon as I lift out of court, I stared pourin up
And we don't pour red, we pour purple bruh
Got buddy, my buddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
My buddy, pour muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Real mud, that boy pour mud
God damn that boy pour muddy

All I drink is mud
Take your girlfriend turn her to my night time slut
But we don't hardly ever fuck
I swear I'm scared of that bitch cause her pussy too good
Damn; or maybe could be me
I'm full of that syrp, jumped in that pussy and fell asleep
Shit, I can't be doing this
Walk up with my pistol in my hand and went and took a piss
Damn, yeah I've been going ham
Ask the streets about me they goin' tell you who I am
Yeah, your lil' sister say she love me
Your baby mama wan' fuck me
And my cup extra muddy

Got buddy, my buddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
My buddy, pour muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
God damn that boy pour muddy
Real mud, that boy pour mud
God damn that boy pour muddyEmbed
