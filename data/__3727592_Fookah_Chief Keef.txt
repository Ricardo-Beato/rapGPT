13 ContributorsFookah Lyrics
GGP
Ooh, lolli ooh
I'm still high
I pull up stuntin’
Trying to get some money
Through with the onion
Sosa on the beat

Ayy, I pull up stuntin’
I was trying to get some money
I came through with the onion
They say that shit smellin’ funky
The cops pulled over me
They say they ass smellin' weed
'Cause I be smoking on the Tooka
And you be smoking on the fookah

I’ve been smokin’ on the dope
Made my lungs black, oh well
You better stand where you at
Don’t try me, pussy, don’t go there
You better watch your hoe
Cause’ she give me top so well
All the Keke’s call my phone
They hit me like I got a dope sale
I’m ringin’ like I got a doorbell
All my fiends and they say give 'em more hell
Hop out the whip, it feel like the floor fell
He squeeze, he can't breathe, give him more air
I'ma wait outside his house and build a fort there
Midnight, ring his bell, give him more mail
Gotta lot of beef, taco meat, more shells
You know my cash longer than your whore hair
You might also like
Ayy, I pull up stuntin’
I was trying to get some money
I came through with the onion
They say that shit smellin’ funky
The cops pulled over me
They say they ass smellin' weed
'Cause I be smoking on the Tooka
And you be smoking on the fookah

The cops pulled me over and I swerved on 'em
He say he smoke Tooka, he got nerve on him
Your bird boring, call another bird over
He think he hard 'cause he got shot but we gon' put another burn on him
Bitch thinks she's bad, gotta curse on her
I be fresh to death, I grab the hearse for him
Stop hatin', sit back and you can learn somethin'
Bitch, I'm Cyclops, I'm always tryna burn somethin'
I know you need some money and you can get some
Wipe me down to the ground, like I spilt some
Enough about you, here your bitch come
I was doin nothin' and she suck me off like I did somethin'
I don't talk about muscles when I say I got big guns
You think you real, but your ass really fiction
You niggas really pussy, I'ma get you all some tampons
You want a autograph, I need something to put my step on
Ayy, I pull up stuntin’
I was trying to get some money
I came through with the onion
They say that shit smellin’ funky
The cops pulled over me
They say they ass smellin' weed
'Cause I be smoking on the Tooka
And you be smoking on the fookahEmbed
