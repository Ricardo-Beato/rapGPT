146 ContributorsD.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune) Lyrics

La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye... (Good riddance!)
Hold up...

Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...
Begin

This is anti-Auto-Tune, death of the ringtone
This ain’t for iTunes, this ain't for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct (uhh!)
This might offend my political connects (uhh!)
My raps don’t have melodies
This should make niggas wanna go and commit felonies (uhh!)
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn (Uhh!)
I know we facing a recession
But the music y'all making gon' make it the Great Depression (uhh!)
All your lack of aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set, men (uhh, uhh!)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
You might also like
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...
Only nigga to re-write history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...
Begin
Hold up...

This ain't a number one record (uhh!)
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon (uhh!)
I made this just for Flex and... Mister Cee
I want niggas to feel threatened (uhh!)
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light (That's too far, nigga!) (uhh, uhh!)
I might wear black for a year straight (uhh!)
I might bring back Versace shades (uhh!)
This ain’t for Z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 100 (uhh!)
This is for Hot 9-7
This shit for Clue, for Khaled, for we the bestin... (uhh!)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...
Only nigga to re-write history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...
Begin
Hold up...

Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy... Ay!
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Get this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it (uhh!)
Get 3 Thou' to style on this
I just don’t need nobody to smile on this (uhh!)
You niggas singin' too much
Get back to rap, you T-Pain'n too much (uhh, uhh!)
I’m a multi-millionaire
So how is it I’m still the hardest nigga here (uhh!)
I don’t be in the project hallway
Talkin' 'bout how I be in the projects all day (uhh!)
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta, this is how you prove it to me (uhh, uhh!)
Nigga, just get violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...17Embed
