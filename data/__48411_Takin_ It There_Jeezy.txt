5 ContributorsTakinâ€™ It There Lyrics
Clear, yeah, ahaha
It's official, yeah, yeah
Ay Ziggy, I told them niggas
They won't believe me though
I do this shit by the way

It's 3:45, she pulled up to my house
Grabbed my strap, got the door with a blunt in my mouth
Say I'm 'bout to put this mack down, you know I'll put this mack down
And while I put this mack down, some Pac in the background
Look at me, I'm standin' tall, she know how to keep it up
We just left the club, so you know we both drunk as fuck
30 mins in, second wind, call it cardio
I go up and down, round and round, Super Mario
Oh wee, oh wee, she bustin' like a uzi
I'm ridin' the suzuki, she wet as a jacuzzi
Call it in, code 10, get ready for the waterflow
Number 16, "Tear It Up", yeah I told you so

What can I say, there ain't no easy way to say this
And I don't know if you can handle it
But I'm thinkin' 'bout takin' it, takin' it there
'Cause that's the only way you ain't get it
You lay around with them boy shorts on, layin' around
And I've been thinkin' about it all day long
And I too don't think that I can handle it
But her, I think I just might end up takin' it there
You might also like
I'm thinkin' 'bout takin' it, then 'bout receivin'
She can get it right back up, just give her a reason
Any given season, winter, spring, summer, fall
I came to see the show baby, gon' and make that waterfall
She know I'm the one to call, when she want that good dick
She know I'm the one to call, when she want that hood shit
Baby lookin' all good, my demeanor all hood
Left the chopper in the car, you know the handles all wood
I stepped up in the spot, smellin' like a pound
Yeah, you know I'm takin' that, you ain't gotta pull 'em down
You ain't gotta take 'em off for me, I'm over aggressive
Said it's 'bout to be a accident, just call progressive

What can I say, there ain't no easy way to say this
And I don't know if you can handle it
But I'm thinkin' 'bout takin' it, takin' it there
'Cause that's the only way you ain't get it
You lay around with them boy shorts on, layin' around
And I've been thinkin' about it all day long
And I too don't think that I can handle it
But her, I think I just might end up takin' it there

I don't know If you can handle this, know if you can handle me
First I'm gonna start right here exactly where your man should be
I don't know if you can handle this, know If you can handle Young
If you ain't never had a real nigga, better get you one
Come through on some thug shit, gotta respect it
Yeah, I come through on some thug shit, gotta accept it
She know that I'm never shy, most of the time I'm probably high
Mr. Kidnap-The-Kitty-Cat, yeah you gonna need a alibi
What can I say, there ain't no easy way to say this
And I don't know if you can handle it
But I'm thinkin' 'bout takin' it, takin' it there
'Cause that's the only way you ain't get it
You lay around with them boy shorts on, layin' around
And I've been thinkin' about it all day long
And I too don't think that I can handle it
But her, I think I just might end up takin' it there

There, there, there, there, there
Takin' it there, there, there, there, there
Ay, ain't that how you do it Jeezy?1Embed
