Whoa, sun comin' up, and I still feel numb
In the dark, my secrets hide, I run
Few more drops up on your tongue
A night to remember, that can't be undone
Head spun, meanwhile, you're done
Had a little too much fun
I cannot stop touchin' on you
This just took my high to the moon

It don't get no better
Moments like this reveal the truth
Alone with only you
Take a picture 'cause we'll need proof
Nobody will believe we saw the sun
If this don't work out, remember all we've donе, ooh

Hoo-ah, hoo-ah
Ee-ah, hoo-ah

(Yeah, yeah, yеah, yeah)
It don't get no better (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Take a picture 'cause we'll need proof
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Nobody will believe we saw the sun
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If it don't work out, remember all we've done
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah

Just let your imagination run wild, let your heart be your guide
In the time you sit around worrying about it and trying to plan a painting, you could've completed a painting already
Let it happen, let it happen
And I would spend, sometimes, weeks just working on a picture, drawing it out, getting all the little sketches and stuff
And then I'd go back and spend maybe a month trying to fill in the blocks
And here, we let it happen, it comes out here
It's in you, and you put it on the canvas, 'kay?
