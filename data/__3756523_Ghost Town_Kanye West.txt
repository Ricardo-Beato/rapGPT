Someday, someday
Someday I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown

Someday, someday, someday
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Someday, somedays, I remembered this on a Sunday
Backway, yeah, way, way, burning, mhm-mhm
Uh, somedays, I'm gonna tell everybody
Somedays I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Somedays, ohh (Heatstroke)
Everyday I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Everyday I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, oh, yeah

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Someday we gon' set it off
Someday we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what they had in mind
But maybe someday
You might also like
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Woah, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free203Embed
