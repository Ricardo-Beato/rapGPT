45 ContributorsBack Door Lyrics
My mama tell, mmm
Mmm, mmm, huh?

My mama tell me "Be careful, better stay out them projects (Projects)
Better watch for them haters, you never know who be watchin' (Watchin')
Talk less and do more, you never know who be talkin'
And if you up that chop, you better aim for your target, yeah"
I up and squeeze on a pussy ass opposition
Cops askin' me these questions, I don't know nothin'
Hit that nigga up, get through the backdoor
My mama tell me "Be careful, better stay out them projects
Bettеr watch for them haters, you nevеr know who be watchin'
Talk less and do more, you never know who be talkin'
And if you up that chop, you better aim for your target, yeah"

Stay down out on the Nawf (Stay down)
Too much money, don't know what it's 'bout (Uh-huh)
We was the first ones out (Out), the hood
We brought that shit back to the house (House), it look good
Inside the mud, inside the rain, no more pain
I had the hundred round drum, just for shit that look strange
I had to kick through some doors just to ice out the chain
We had to fuck a few hoes, since they claimin' they gang
Jumped off to pull some chains, doubled back and they came
Huncho hustle mentality, just like Kobe with rings (Mamba)
I don't wanna mentions names, but some can't even hang
One thing I learned about this game that it's gonna show if you lame (Show if you lame)
Huncho and Pop Smoke, yeah, we turnin' the page
I don't know, but it feel like we go back in the day (Back in the day)
I put food on the table, niggas won't touch my plate
Momma let me go outside, but I ain't out here tryna play
You might also like
My mama tell me "Be careful, better stay out them projects (Projects)
Better watch for them haters, you never know who be watchin' (Watchin')
Talk less and do more, you never know who be talkin'
And if you up that chop', you better aim for your target, yeah"
I up and squeeze on a pussy ass opposition
Cops askin' me these questions, I don't know nothin'
Hit that nigga up, get through the backdoor
My mama tell me "Be careful, better stay out them projects
Better watch for them haters, you never know who be watchin'
Talk less and do more, you never know who be talkin'
And if you up that chop, you better aim for your target, yeah"

I might be goin' numb, I ain't show love, then it died within
My mind on so much drugs I think my sliders tryna slide on me
I bet that none of these rappers got more war stories than he do
Every night I pray that my lil' soldiers keep it zeeko
I just wanna make a lot of money for my people
I just caught a case, but I thank God it ain't a RICO
Can't stay out the hood, I'm like a magnet to the projects
Every time I do good, Lord, all the bad shit be followin'
I don't know who be hatin', 'cause they still shakin' hands
I don't know who be fakin', 'cause they still shakin' hands
I know everybody smilin' in my face ain't really my friends
I know niggas be hollerin' like they gang, but really gon' bend
Bussin' at the opps, and I'm duckin' from the cops
'Cause I'm still clutchin' Glocks, momma
I'm bussin' at the opps, 'cause every time I try to stop
They be playin' with my top, momma
My mama tell me "Be careful, better stay out them projects (Projects)
Better watch for them haters, you never know who be watchin' (Watchin')
Talk less and do more, you never know who be talkin'
And if you up that chop, you better aim for your target, yeah"
I up and squeeze on a pussy ass opposition
Cops askin' me these questions, I don't know nothin'
Hit that nigga up, get through the backdoor
My mama tell me "Be careful, better stay out them projects
Better watch for them haters, you never know who be watchin'
Talk less and do more, you never know who be talkin'
And if you up that chop, you better aim for your target, yeah"

Squeeze
Nothin'
Backdoor
Yeah, yeah, yeah7Embed
