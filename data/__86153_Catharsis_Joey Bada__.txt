71 ContributorsCatharsis Lyrics
Vigorous, the illest realest lyricist
I'm sick like syphilis
Got a certificate for killing shit
And any innocent who witnesses the fucking incident
Got a team of militants
Punch lines, crunch ligaments
This is Mr. Bada$$, the young villain
Hide the children and hide the women
There's no slides when you're caught slippin' so be cautious
A homie keeps a gorgeous twelve gauge
So if you run your mouth, your jaw gone
The double entendre, monster
Niggas thank me, say I'm number one in the rankings
I tell 'em it's an honor
Cause these niggas faking and they nada
Fuckin' stupid Malagas, part of the Espana
I sip on Coladas and feel your chick tatas
'till I bust like pinatas
Only true Shotta, come kill 'em with the Patois
Same time, met the gal, and up for dagga, that's word to Spragga
I'm a young Wayne, I'm going insane, Liu Kang
Super Saiyan whenever the loops be playing
Only be a kid, but yo, see if the youth's playin'
When the doobs flamed, I get enlightened 'til I be in Zeus' lane
Find that quite amusing, I bone her like museum
Sit back, relax, and watch her bring it back, Boomerang
Now bring that back like poo stains in your new jeans
No need to be too ashamed
If you didn't get that the first time like new names
In my city, I be Bruce Wayne
Yup, cause when I get put on
I got them like new J's
He say, she say, who say that I'm not the next young Lupe
The one-handed shit you got to say, to you, touche
I'm the type to pull a dyke and only hit it on Tuesday
You the chump that when I come, it feel like it be Doomsday
Cause the flow is Apocalypse
You say them niggas ill
But they still ain't even shocking us
Yo, who the fuck is stopping us?
A bunch of nice niggas with aim like who blocking us?
BK where we stay, but you can still see the Pac in us
Oh, no disrespect to Diddy
Don't mean to be saditty
But I plan to conquer my city like yo, it's no Biggie
No really, it's no biggy and 50 can't bother
In a few years I plan to outshine Mr. Shawn Carter
Look at the war I done started
