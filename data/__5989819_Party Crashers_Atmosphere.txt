5 ContributorsParty Crashers Lyrics
Hey bartender, how you gonna put me in the dirt tonight?

Crash the party, crash the party
Catch a body, catch a body
Crash the party, crash the party
Catch a body, catch a body

Go
I didn't come to dance here
I'm not looking for answers (Go)
Gotta move around with the anger
Go ahead and let 'em down like the anchor (Splash)
Another hot summer for the ice devils
Got me pushing on the bike pedals
If loving you is wrong then I might be right
I don't wanna be around when that lightning strikes (Right)
And we still the same a whole life time trying to kill the pain, huh
Now put my name up on the back of the train
You can watch it pull away out of the camera's frame (Ayy)
Can't complain when no one hears you
Trapped in the belly of the hourglass
Made of the same grains of sand inside your mirrors
Move back and give me space before the planets crash
You might also like
Crash the party, crash the party
Catch a body, catch a body
Crash the party, crash the party
Catch a body, catch a body

Ooh
And I don't even know why I'm here
Two tears in a bucket of beer
Stuck here trying not to hear what you're saying
The music turned up my love disband (Uh)
Whatever you believe in is fine with me
Ain't trying to argue ain't trying to agree
I want the big payback but can't afford the tax
Got nothing to stand on the floor collapsed (And I)
And I don't mean to be unsociable
But I prefer to be alone in my own bubble
So subtle, you can't roll a broken stone
I probably should've stayed home for my fucking troubles
I feel the temperature max out
I'm on the couch, I rock and I lean forward
Look around and when I finally tap out
I hit the porch and crash through the screen door (Uh)

Crash the party, crash the party
Catch a body, catch a body
Crash the party, crash the party
Catch a body, catch a body2Embed
