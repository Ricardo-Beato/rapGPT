31 ContributorsEverytime I Come Around Lyrics
N-Y, N-Y, 'til I D-ie
N-Y, N-Y, 'till I D-ie

I'm on it
Everytime I come around, me I keep my gun around
It's never on safety
I'm on it
Niggas know when I'm around, fuck around it's goin' down
No if's or maybe's
Ring around the rosies, pockets full of OZ's
Niggas gettin' cake made
Fuck with the homies while I got it on me
You'll get your big break, man

You niggas ain't seen shit yet, one false move and I click clack
That oo-wop bitch I spit that, that hard white I flip that
That bad bitch get my dick wet, damn how hot can my shit get?
Boy, get outta line get your ass checked, got 10 mil' my last check
Bitches stay where that cash at, diamonds on me I flash that
That 'Rari pedal I mash that, you pussy niggas I laugh at
That fuck shit that you fuck niggas be doin', man, I'm passed that
Hood nigga down there on Wall Street, my stock run across NASDAQ
Girl face on my time piece, ridin' around with my crimeys
These broke niggas so grimy, I let 'em hold the steel, I tell 'em shoot to kill
I put south side on my back, I ain't talkin' 'bout no tat'
When I'm outta town I hold it down, I mean everywhere I'm at
You might also like
I'm on it
Everytime I come around, me I keep my gun around
It's never on safety
I'm on it
Niggas know when I'm around, fuck around it's goin' down
No if's or maybe's
Ring around the rosies, pockets full of OZ's
Niggas gettin' cake made
Fuck with the homies while I got it on me
You'll get your big break, man

All my niggas crazy stupid, cuckoo, got a loose screw
I might pew pew with that two-two then small bullets will mob through you
My bitch come from Honolulu with that dope ball in her doo doo
Put it on a train and choo choo and the feds don't have a blues clues
Thumbing over, don't know voodoo but I sure know how to shoot you
If I get caught I don't boo-hoo, I pick up the phone call BooBoo
He gonna bail me out in seconds, please don't let this rap shit fool you
I send shooters to your home, see I don't need no songs to move you
My gorilla goin' ooh-ooh, boy your family could lose you
Put you in a box like new shoes, you's a bitch pull down your tu-tu
When it come to gettin' money all I know is we need bookoo's
Speakin' only in my Ryda Gang, know what we gonna do to you
Everytime I come around, me I keep my gun around
It's never on safety
I'm on it
Niggas know when I'm around, fuck around it's goin' down
No if's or maybe's
Ring around the rosies, pockets full of OZ's
Niggas gettin' cake made
Fuck with the homies while I got it on me
You'll get your big break, man15Embed
