Baddie, he makin' me thicker (Makin' me thicker)
Rob his heart, bitch, it's a stick up (Stick up)

Only around me when it's beneficial (Grrah)
Stop textin' my phone, nigga be feenin', like leave me alone (Like leave me alone)
Damn, back in my zone
Don't want the feelings, I just want the dome (Grrah, I just want the dome)
