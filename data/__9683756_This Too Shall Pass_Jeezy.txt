7 ContributorsThis Too Shall Pass Lyrics
Tell 'em this too shall pass

Down on my luck, I was fucked up
Pulled up on cuz in my Ram truck
This is where he live, Slap Trap house
Full of Southside niggas like a frat house
Friday afternoon, so the block hot
Cars comin' through, nigga, non-stop
We on that white liquor and we reminiscin'
And somethin' in my mind sayin', "Pay attention"
Now, I ain't the type of nigga just sttin' 'round, lollygagging
Bullshittin', caught up in some shit
And I ain't hear, "Hut one, hut two, hut three", swear to god them bitches just blitzed
The DEA and the task, "Need a search warrant", my ass
Had a hundred sixty thousand in the armrest
Yeah, them dirty motherfuckers took my last

You ever went to sleep with no cash? (No cash)
You ever woke up with no bag? (No bag)
Walk around, lookin' all mad?
Tell 'em this too shall pass
One day I'ma be back rich
I'am pop out, I'ma pop my shit (My shit)
You ever woke up with no bag?
Tell 'em this too shall pass

Now I'm in jail, and every nigga with me got a million dollar bail
Wish I could order us some pizza
Yesterday, I was rockin' twenty thousand with Khalifa
Nigga got popped by my tour bus
What them bitches do? Yeah, they blamed us
Mind you, I don't even know this nigga
Let alone, pop off and blow this nigga
Niggas in Oakland think I chipped they man
Now they talkin' 'bout they wanna chip my band
San Diego got cancelled 'cause it's way too hot
One note from Chris Brown the night Suge got shot
Locked me up at the show, nigga, that's on my momma
Ask Rich Homie Quan, nigga, DJ Drama
Haha, yeah, I'm talkin' so much drama (Damn)
They fucked my bag up, at least two, three commas

You ever went to sleep with no cash? (No cash)
You ever woke up with no bag? (No bag)
Walk around, lookin' all mad?
Tell 'em this too shall pass
One day I'ma be back rich
I'am pop out, I'ma pop my shit (My shit)
You ever woke up with no bag?
Tell 'em this too shall pass
Tell 'em this too shall pass
Tell 'em this too shall pass
Tell 'em this too shall passEmbed
