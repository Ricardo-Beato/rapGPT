14 ContributorsOddfather Intro (from the Inside) Lyrics
Ayy man, it's The Oddfather
Not The Godfather
A.K.A. The Trap Father
Trap God 3 on the way
Guwop vs. Gucci on the way
I'm the only nigga can make 5 mil' sitting down
20 mil' on the first month I get back
100 mil' 'fore I get out this shit
It's Guwop, 1017 Bricksquad, the Oddfather, enjoy

Father status, La Cosa Nostra mentality
Last night I plead insanity, in court screaming profanity
Free my nigga Chapo Guzm√°n
R.I.P. to Griselda
Feel like we the Felix brothers, Mexican Mafia Records
I might buy a laundry mat just to clean the monefa
I done let Keyshia see too much, so now it's cheaper to keep her
Got so many enemies, can fill the Phillip's Area
And I hunt like an hyena play, with racks like Serena
I was born broke in Alabama, man my family was poor
A young snotty nose sleeping on my granddaddy floor
Is this a crack house, 'cause junkies keep walking through the door
Plus my stomach having cramps about going to steal out the store
And if my school lunch wasn't free I wouldn't have nothing to eat
So many cousins at my house, I didn't have nowhere to sleep
Didn't notice I was poor till I walked down the street
Rather have holes in my shoes than have no shoes on my feet
My family tree filled of alcoholics, nigga, gangstas and theives
Had to learn how to fight before you learn how to read
Wish my grandma was still living, miss my sister Charlese
'Cause she the only one I know kept it realer than me
