Niggas die off of Poppy street, bet my mama vouch
They drive by, we don't run inside, bitch, we shoot it out
On my grind, Benz color of the crimes I've been committing
I've been fighting all my life, and I ain't stopping 'til it's finished
Rapid firepower sound just like a helicopter engine
Hell ain't threatening to niggas who ain't never had religion
In this field, you Phillis Wheatleys ain't gon' never catch me slippin'
Serve that three-piece, now we sneaky, tell the medic to come and get him

Yeah, my niggas built for war, my niggas built for war
They sending threats, we sending shots
They sending threats, we sending shots

Fuck the pigs alive and dead, 'cause they ain't never had my back
They see you black 'fore you a man, and you a nigga 'fore you that
And that, you'll never understand if you done seen it secondhand
You ain't ready for that war then, please, don't step across them tracks
Rent money low and pressure high, no sellin O's, just selling dimes
These California sunny skies done looked down on me all of my life
Is you really 'bout what you write? Know they waitin' on my demise
And I been waiting, too, my patience through, blue paisley noose in the sky
You might also like
Yeah, my niggas built for war, my niggas built for war
They sending threats, we sending shots
They sending threats, we sending shots

Martin Luther had a dream, I thought Tookie dream was better
Bunchy Carter had a plan, but they shot him 'fore he led us
To that ghetto promised land, it ain't no hope for the darker man
Just the folks who you bump for the Arm & Hammer
The nigga prolly gone die when his mama had em'
That pissy mattress fit three or four, taking shit when we leave the store
Ain't a shoulder to lean up on, chauffeur in the back, the police been called
Same ol' gauge, same ol' trigger, same ol' cage, brand-new nigga
Front-page when you 'kill em, mothafucka, pay attention

Yeah, my niggas built for war, my niggas built for war
They sending threats, we sending shots
They sending threats, we sending shots

Niggas die off of Poppy street, bet my mama vouch
They drive by, we don't run inside, bitch, we shoot it out1Embed
