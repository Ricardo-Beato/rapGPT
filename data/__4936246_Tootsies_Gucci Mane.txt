19 ContributorsTootsies Lyrics
Burr
Cook that shit up, Quay
Burr
Bling, blaow
Bling, blaow

This dope'll make you do the Kanye, took so many opiates
The mall ain't even open yet, but Gucci made 'em open it
Dr. Trap-enstein, and I just prescribed a Percocet
She ain't even fine enough, so I don't even wanna hit
Fishtailin' out of Tootsies, bag full of hundreds
And I told the dealer he can keep the top 'cause I don't want it
Think my house is haunted, woke up, seen a done bitch
Gucci on that don shit, so wealthy that my son rich

Yeah
Hop out that new Maybach like I come from paper (Like my fam, bitch)
You been cuffin' bitches, you a super-saver (Superhero)
My lil' boy already rich, he got my future paper (Trust fund)
We just parked the Wraith inside the elevator (Elevator)
Tootsies on Tuesday, in a private room making a movie (Movie)
I got some vibes with me getting groovy (Groovy)
We at the top floor in a jacuzzi (Jacuzzi)
Ridin' with some hot boys like I'm Juvie (Lil Wayne)
I'm on that dumb shit like I'm Gucci (Guwop)
I just spent twenty-six thousand in Gucci (Gucci)
Go ask about me, this shit ain't no new cheese
I was gettin' money before it was music (Music)
I don't drink, I don't sip, I abuse it ('Buse it)
How I did what I did, got 'em clueless (Clueless)
Think these Adderalls got me all lucid (Yeah)
Got your bitch on my drip, she been choosin' (Yeah)
She been checkin' me out, I been movin' (Yeah)
So much money, it's getting confusin' (Yeah)
Only winnin', ain't doin' no losin' (Yeah)

Show me that pussy cat 'cause El Gato got a cat wrist (Brr)
Shooter got that rocket on him, call him James Harden
We be straight ballin', wet T-shirt contest
Top off, call us up, the coupe color Sunkist (It's Gucci)
I be going hard on 'em, I'm on that Lil Pump shit (Pump)
I don't even know how my money got so retarded
Trap God (Trap God), Gucci sandals on like I was Jesus (Yeah)
Bitch fine as Kim K, and these are not Yeezys (It's Gucci)

This dope'll make you do the Kanye, took so many opiates
The mall ain't even open yet, but Gucci made 'em open it
Dr. Trap-enstein, and I just prescribed a Percocet

Gucci on that don shit, so wealthy that my son rich
Wizzop (Hah)
