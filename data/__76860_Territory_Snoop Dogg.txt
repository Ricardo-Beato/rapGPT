5 ContributorsTerritory Lyrics
What do you talk
What do you talk
He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory
Woo what's up man
Damn you one of my favorite rappers man
You know we got love for you on the West Coast man
Keep moving on we got big love baby!

Man what yall think
West Coast motherfucker we go hard in the paint
We'll take your bank
Or else you're going to take that shank
End of story
(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)
Out of pound
Out of pocket
You want what with me
You out of town rap niggas wanna fuck with me?
How could they do me that?
Dogg get my jewelry back?
(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)
Shit's real
Yall niggas better keep it real
See they ain't giving west coast niggas rap deals
So we got to take what we want from the coast
What's yours is mine
Get those
Get most
Get ate
Get shot
We'll take your shit and make a little bit a whole lot
You're just a scene to the story
(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)
You might also like
I'm up out of here man
It sure was nice seeing you man
Damn that's a nice chain you got on too homie
Yeah that's cool though
But give that motherfucker up nigga

That's whats cracking
California home for jacking
Fuck a B
We be Cadillacing and dipping
Why you tripping?
(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)
Lay down nigga
Give it up real quick
On some real shit
Believe it's on
Yeah the squeeze is on
(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)
We going to bullshit most of the time
That's why niggas stay close to the 9
I'm posted with mine
I never leave the pad without it
But best believe I can smash without it
See sticks and stones may not break your bones
But hollow points will definitely leave a hole in your dome
I'm and OG nigga and I'm holding my own
What's wrong?
(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)
Check this out dog
I just came up on this chain
From one of them out of town niggas man
It's got to be worth about 100
You know what I'm saying?
But for you give me 5 G's and we cool

Straight up out the Garden B-L-O-C-C
Spiderman lyrical vitamin
Off wet and vicodin
Ready to push your cap backwards
Just like a bat catcher, body snatcher
You know I had to gat you
Leave you stiff as a statue
Gettin' at you
I act up
I'm loco
In the car there's a gun
In the dresser wit my loco homie
How could you not know
We pop those lead toes
Right out the window of the 64
????? there it goes
Coming to the west plus
Bringin' the best equals
It won't be no sequel
We go as hard as a desert eagle
We make'em dead people me and SN
Double O-P
Trouble gone Be coming your way
????
I twist it two middle fingers at you motherfuckers
Touch ya, gut ya and..
9 millimeter fuck ya
You don't want to know the rest it's a scary story
(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)
Yeah
Yall niggas know where yall at
West Coast
West or nothing
Taking no prisoners
Snoop Dogg Brotha Lynch Hung
You know what the fuck time it is nigga
Creep crawling on yall motherfucking assEmbed
