Yeah
I'm so through with that
I'm so through with that
(We got London on da Track)

Hundred bands, hundred bands dropped on the head of any nigga want it, man (Woo)
Pop me a xanny, I'm fast, I'm so fast, I'm so faster than Sonic, man (Woo)
True the man, true the man, true to my nigga True Religion Buddha man (Woo)
My money stack tall as Ludacris afro and I swear I'ma shoot with that (Woo)
I just hit for nine birds, what I'ma do with that?
Pull up on the curb, then you hop out and be through with that (Ooh)
I'm so fresh like dish detergent, if you not fresh, you so through with that (So fresh)
If you are a nerd, everything here, you not cool with that

Yes, you not cool
No, you not bool (What?)
I don't give no damn, I'm not calling you boo (Uh-uh)
My bitch, she a jewel (Whoa)
You can't prove a point, boy, you know you so doomed (You dig?)
You know you so doomed (Yeah)
I swear I'm so lost with no clue, don't know what to do (What?)
Over loud, over loud (Yeah)
I over loud on these niggas
Ain't know how to milk these cows
She made that dick grow, now it's big like a tower
Yow, front pockets filled up with bands, no Bible

Pull up on the curb, then you hop out and be through with that (Skrrt)
I'm so fresh like dish detergent, if you not fresh, you so through with that (Clean)
If you are a nerd, everything here, you not cool with that (Hey, dork)

Pull up, hop out the block, they tuck in they tail, I go, "Who the clan?" (Cacaw, cacaw)
We dressed in all-black, I'm always on the road just like a Uber man (I'm textin')
We wrappin' and sendin' them packs, soon as they land, we movin' 'em (Wrapped, shipped)
Blame it on the OGs, they influenced me (I'm ridin' with felons and fugitives)
Ain't gonna count money, nigga (Uh-uh, nah)
I ain't just met money, nigga (Ain't just met money, nigga)
