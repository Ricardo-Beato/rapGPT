31 ContributorsUp All Night Lyrics
One, two
One, two, three, go

(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up

Let me get another cup, please
I ain't drivin' home, so you can have my keys
Got a bunch of tricks all hidden in my sleeve
So I'ma get drunk, won't be leavin' 'til three
Yeah, I got a reputation of gettin' wasted
Everything in sight, homie, we ain't tryna save shit
Leave the spot dizzy, so nah, I can't see, bitch
Sexy bartenders always get a really mean tip
Life's so good, please enjoy it
End of every night when your head's in the toilet
Yeah, we party hard, give a fuck about employment
Kill the whole bottle, we'll be spinnin' like a coin flip
Yeah, we ain't goin' home no time soon
I'm on shot number four, times two
Stand by the keg, let the hoes find you
Gettin' nice, I'll be up all night

(Hey, hey, hey) We stayin' up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night

Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink 'til we can't no more (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink 'til we can't no more (Hey, hey, hey)

Head starts spinnin' and my legs get wobbly
Every mornin' wake up, liquor in my coffee
Yeah, I'm tryna party, find a open house crib
Screw the law, we just some motherfuckin' kids
Never listen to nobody who was tryin' to tell me "No"
'Cause I got no problem bein' way outta control
Got these ladies goin' crazy at every single show
But you ain't drunk enough until you takin' off your clothes
Not me, you can do you
Do some crazy shit that's poppin' up on YouTube
Finna rock out, I ain't talkin' U2
Passin' out, wakin' up without shoes
Live life on the edge, sharper than a razor
Like my liquor straight, I don't ever need a chaser
Have a good time, ain't no reason we should fight
Party with me, we stayin' up all night
(Hey, hey, hey) We stayin' up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night

Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink 'til we can't no more (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
Drink 'til we can't no more (Hey, hey, hey)

(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey) Fill it up, fill it up
(Hey, hey, hey) We stayin' up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow
We up all night

Drink, drink, drink, drink (Hey, hey, hey)
