16 ContributorsGet It Lyrics
I ain't even trippin', girl, I get it
I'ma throw this money while you get it
You say you want this money, come and get it (Ha, let's get it)
I throw this shit up 'cause I get it
Call your friend up, and tell her, "Get it"
I'm a fuck around, come and get it
She gon' see me in this big buildin' (skrt, skrt)
That's when she gon' let a nigga get it (bang, bang)

When I was 16 I knew somethin'
That's when I knew I had to get it
Fuck that lyin' on wax, shoot somethin' (bang, bang)
Let my dogs out on ya, let 'em get it (bang)
Nigga, do something, move something
I'm in a strip club, still stuntin'
Ten thousand on a futon
I'm Margiela walkin', oh yeah
I'm in a strip club, throwin' benjis
They let us in this bitch with the semi
I fuck around and ice out the Fendi
I fuck around and pipe out a Bentley
I fuck around and platinum on my semis (yah)
I fuck around and platinum, not an Emmy
And my chopper hit the folks, I call 'em Jimmy
Make it sway thru your block and let it empty
You might also like
I ain't even tripping girl, I get it
I'm a throw this money while you get it
You say you want this money, come and get it
I throw this shit up, 'cause I get it
Call your friend up, and tell her, "Get it"
I'm a fuck around, come and get it
She gon' see me in this big buildin' (skrt, skrt)
That's when she gon' let a nigga get it (bang, bang)

I done fell in love with foreign whips (skrt, skrt)
I done got used to foreign trips
I done went to Paris for some coats (Louis)
Come and get it if you want some smoke (chill, chill, chill)
Baby, call your friend, tell her slide (skrt, skrt)
We in this bitch throwin' racks all night
We see the pressure from the engine off the pipe
I'm in this bitch lookin' flyer than a kite
Hit a nigga bitch, tell her "Come over"
She see it's me on every fuckin' poster
And on my whip game proper
I don't really let the bitch chauffeur
I'm pourin' more pints than a doctor
Tell 'em hold the motherfuckin' boxers
I be ganja smokin' like a rasta
Get it at the same time with my partner (bang, bang)
I ain't even tripping girl, I get it
I'm a throw this money while you get it
You say you want this money, come and get it
I throw this shit up, 'cause I get it
Call your friend up, and tell her, "Get it"
I'm a fuck around, come and get it
She gon' see me in this big buildin' (skrt, skrt)
That's when she gon' let a nigga get it (bang, bang)Embed
