Gettin— Gettin— Gettin— G—Gettin— Gettin— G—Gettin—
Gangsta Grillz! Early!
"Dedication 2"

I was gettin some head, gettin— gettin some head (Yeah! Shout my nigga, Thrash Own Music!)
I was gettin some head, gettin— gettin some head (Weezy)
I was gettin some head, gettin— gettin some head (Shout to Leah Rose, XXL Magazine! Cannon!, yeah)
I was with the kind of girl that make your toes pop (YCut me up in the phone, man! Trendsetter! Yeah)
I was gettin some head, gettin— gettin some head (Can't forget Backstage! Cut the music up, shawty)
I was gettin some head, gettin— gettin some head (Shout-out to  and my nigga, Hassan! Alright)
I was gettin some head, gettin— gettin some head (Can't forget my nigga, Remo—New York City! Now I'm feelin' myself)
I was with the kind of girl that make your toes pop (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

Ridin' with a bitch I call "Hot-Mouth Shelly"
She pop them ecstasies and get that cottonmouth heavy
I give her bottled water; bitch break out sweatin'
And then, she get straight to that head, like a fuckin' Excedrin
I'm a fly-ass nigga—take a look at me, bitch
Now, ho, go and tell the cops I got a crook in my dick
Straight gut a bitch open, like a hook in a fish
I got a lady from Paris who French-kiss my shit, yeah
Why you think I gotta tint my whips?
'Cause I be gettin' some head—right in my shit
You say you love that woman, but that been my bitch
And if you kiss that woman, then you suck my dick
These hoes is nasty—y'all niggas is trippin'
I got a bitch with a mouth like that boy, Ken Griffey
When I'm out in the streets, better believe I'm pimpin'
And if you ever saw me with one of them video vixens— (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

You know me—I smoke a blunt while I'm gettin' brain
Stick my finger in her butt while I'm gettin' brain
Yeah, I'm nasty bitch! What! Lil Wayne
I like them Mac'd-up lips and two tongue rings
I gotta say it: I'm the President—I run things
Now, all these hoes tryna save a nigga' cum-stains
Real talk: I get head on the airplane
Bitch be climbin' all over that lil' chair-thing
I pull her hair back—she holler "Yeah" back
I like a bitch with some lips like a bear-trap
And I don't mind goin' down—I take care of that
I have homie at home, like, "Where she at?"
She with me in my bad-ass ride
Givin' me a blowjob like a nine-to-five
She said she eat her vegetables so she stay alive
So she slob on my knob, like corn on the cob
I was— gettin— gettin (Yeah)
Gettin— gettin some head (You know)
I was— gettin— gettin (Gangsta!)
I was with the kind of girl that make your toes pop (Yo, it's the Aphilliates, nigga! Pay attention)

Check it out, man, I make her fiend for that ****
They be pumping the P; P be pumping them ****
Stick out they ass, look how they tell me, "Just go"
You ain't ******* with me when it come to these ****
***** fast across the chin
What I'm saying to them? Man, I don't pretend
Push one button, in the chrome *****, ducking
Keep it going like the grille in the air, *******
She's a freak—she want E's and the ****** *** (Yes)
Show her keys and the skirt'll go, she sure to go (Yes)
She say I hurt her, though (Yes), in the cervical (Yes)
She mean murder, though (What?), give her vertigo
Baller, G, ain't no apology
Wanna have a couple words? Better call a G
Man, I seen your sports car, but it's smaller, B
The Enzo's outside for you all to see
*****, look at my chain, look at my rings
Rocks and watches, bracelet, bling
Keeping it going, *****, 'til the break of "dane"
Can't compare, so you just complain
Mad as a ***** (What), grabbing your ***** (What)
Get O.J.: Start slapping your ***** (Um)
I'm A.C.—here's a cap for you, *****
While me and my ***** sit back and laugh at you, ***** (Ha)
AC: gotta stay cool, man
"Never, ever let 'em see you sweat"—that's the rule, man
Hit it 'til we through, man; send her back to you, man
That's what we do, man; bubblegum, chew, man (Ugh)
Other than that, catch me gettin some bread
When you see my billboards, I be... (What?) Yessir
I was gettin some— (Ooh), gettin— gettin some— (Ah)
I was gettin some— (Mm), gettin— gettin some— (Ayy)
