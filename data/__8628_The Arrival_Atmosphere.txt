17 ContributorsThe Arrival Lyrics
I'm not really supposed to talk about this.....but

(They've arrived) with the excitement of a newborn
Came to join the main event and fight against the luke warm
(They've arrived) with nothing but their word and they history
Take a can of paint and try to decorate their dignity
(They've arrived) it's not what they anticipated
Fuck, it doesn't matter put your fists up and instigate it
(They've arrived) and they can't save the planet
Or the children, or the pandas, or themselves goddamn it
I'm just a man that loved rap
So much in fact I put every piece of myself inside these fucking tracks
What is that, you whisper something from the back
You think your personal attacks make up for what you lack
I'm just a cat searching for a clean lap to crash
In a world hurting, waiting for their turn to take a nap
Sorting through the bills, fan mail, and life threats
Wondering why the postman ain't delivered my wife yet
(They've arrived) they call me Sean, this is Anthony
No need to act hard cause we got extended family
So I smile while I try to use my words wise
Say what I meant, just in case this is your first time
(They've arrived) ooh child are the wings tired
Smilin' like a couple of fools that the Queen hired
(They've arrived) can't wait for the vibrate to thicken
So we can watch the world's hips gyrate
(They've arrived) even the dead's getting live
It's a little deeper, you can float, c'mon baby, dive
(They've arrived) to fall in love with this bitch
From the petals on her flower to the pimples on her tits
Fuck the insults and fuck the compliments
Just wanna see the mommy free the honesty and common sense
Stop followin' the wind that you swallow
Cause it's too simple to aim for a target sittin' on a fence
(They've arrived) we do it for the candle in the sky
Here's a toast goes out to those who can't handle their high
You and I, we can swim into the tide
And watch these other children lose they mind
(I'm doing fine)
(They've arrived) and they landed safe and sound
Better try to take em out before they make your saviors proud
(They've arrived) so fix the beef, quit actin' like a sheep
Either spit your speak or sit there and grit your teeth
(They've arrived) to spread the info to the kin folk
Fuckin with the climate on the inside of the windows
(They've arrived) they're here, the baby farmer
Gonna take it farther, make a mark and break apart your fake martyrs
Planted firm, let the planet burn
Understand the terms, you don't wanna open up this can of worms
I'm tryin' to keep my prize on the eyeball
But people wanna see you fly, all to watch the sky fall
Who's to blame for your lack of conviction
I wasn't drafted, I asked for the mission
Put your name on the list at the bottom on an empty line
And hold in plain sight whatever gave you the right to question mine
The night prowler, gonna crawl past all the rap politics
You can put that on your last dollar
Wake up, it's bigger than a pay stub
There's the door, get your money, go wash off your make-up
You might also like
(They've arrived) and they don't need your lovin'
If you don't wanna give it, keep it
Doesn't really mean nothin'
(They've arrived) gonna beat it til it stops breathin'
No need to even try to even reason with, they're not leavin'Embed
