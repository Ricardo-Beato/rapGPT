Niggas (Niggas), Bitches (Bitches)
Uhmm, this is some player shit right here
I'mma holla at my home girl on this one, (Mia)
Mama Mia, Have you seen her (seen her)
Yah, real G's shit. Tell me
Mama Mia, niggas wanna G her (Snoop Dogg)
Bitches wanna be her
Motherfuckers can't see her
Give it up for Mama Mia

Now wat'cha wan do nigga, its fine with me
Name your game, scamming, sprees, or robberies
Moving keys for your needs, from state to state
I send my broad takedown a boy around tha way
But if you fake I'mma let you know up off the top
And leave that dick in your mouth, and put them infrared dots
On your whole crew, nigga betta ask fasho
And they gon let that ass know it's goin' down like Waco
This is business, and who the fuck you think is runnin' this
Mama, and who's the first to shoot they gun in this
Mama, drama, Lady No Limit and when its intended my hands all in it
Now, we can do this like intelligent folk
But fuck around, I be that 7th ward ignorant hoe
Hard headed, with the soft behind, niggas real hittin' it
So Snoop Dogg for the keepin' it real with this Tru bitch
You might also like
Now picture, Bonnie and Clyde, We side as we slide
Side by side, to keep this pimpin' alive
Hit a lick for me, set a trick for me, get us some chips
It's all about you and me Mia, fuck that bitch
You need a fall girl, go get it all girl
You in my world, I"mm make sure you ball girl
Do it for me, do it for you, now it's our world
(Our world, It's our world, gon and get it boo gon and get it boo)

Now everyone in my click know I don't love no hoes
But I'm quick to get a bitch to rush ya boy to get a new set of them MOMO's
Cause I attack 'em, crack 'em and smack 'em
All on the same note, until the bitch is broke
Charge it to the game, man it's a cold game
But somebody gotta do it, that's real for sheezy
It ain't easy
Pimpin' to me is four girls on your team
Down to scheme, and aim the beam, for the cream
Cross country trappin', greyhound bus ridin
Down to get the muthafuckin' fetti-o, you hear me though
See ain't no limit to what she does
On the real-ly, if you feel me, lemme get a right on cuz!
Ghetto love, and every thug need a little
All I want is the money, motherfuck the middle
No backbone its back on to get ya
Unless you got a down ass sister to twist her
Picture, Bonnie and Clyde, We side as we slide
Side by side, to keep this pimpin' alive
Hit a lick for me, set a trick for me, help me get these chips
It's all about you and me Mia, fuck that bitch
