I feel like I’m driven by the
Sacrifice just to suffer from the hunger for composure
And structure environment that's under some control
I know it's a dilemma
That’s why I opened the umbrella
And even though the weather looking Armageddon-y
I'm still out here trying to grow some celery
You could be on the other side of the galaxy
That's my reality, it balances me
The gravity keeps me tethered to thе planet everlastingly
That's how I stay distractеd from your pageantry
You're trying to keep the battleship immaculate
Everything changes except the magic tricks
Born and raised in a restless Minneapolis
So y'all should give me cash and giftsYou might also likeEmbed
