42 ContributorsKrazy but True Lyrics
The Benz coupe look like a fish tank with a shark in it
Penthouse got a livin' room with a garage in it, I can park in it
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
Wheezy outta here

I'm God to you niggas, I worked too hard just to spoil you niggas
You need to pay me my respect
Your socks, rings, and your lean
The way you drop your mixtapes, your ad-libs and everything
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
They jumped on my wave before they throwed Max in the cage
I was gettin' 30K a show
I was the ghost behind the page, I freestyle every day
I never depend on none of these rappers, they bite me anyway
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
Who a bigger influence than me in fashion? And I ain't kissin' asses
Far from social media happy, I'm lookin' past it
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
If you look into my eyes, tell me what I'm thinkin'
I'm smellin' like kush, promethazine drinkin'
This ecstasy the only reason why my heart beatin'
I need you by my side, it's very therapeutic
And I'm goin' to the moon, I'm the man, man
You might also like
I'm fresher than them every day
We makin' love every time she come through
Tell me
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
Tell me, "You a god"
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
I put Rolex diamonds on your neck, baby
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true

The G-Wagen not for the 'Gram
Ain't gon' sponsor no basic bitch who tryna expose who I am
I don't need betrayal
Let me have my way, but now you know you can't share
I know life ain't fair sometimes and real niggas rare
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
I don't do side bitches, they all my bitches
I ain't tryna hide bitches, I don't need the media in my business
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
I've been abused by struggle
I don't know what's real
I'll die for you
Die for you

I'm fresher than them every day
We makin' love every time she come through
Tell me
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
Tell me, "You a god"
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
I put Rolex diamonds on your neck, baby
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
(Look into my eyes, what I'm thinkin')
I need you by my side
Therapeutic
And I'm goin' to the moon, I'm the man, man
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true4Embed
