23 ContributorsRed Sabbath Lyrics
I can't get numb enough
I don't wanna know what's down or up
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, forever

The clouds stay gray
The devil wants to play, okay?
The devil wants to play, okay?
She likes to feed on the weak
Locking in on her prey
Dissolve your soul, fingertips turn cold

I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, and ever

Blood everywhere, blood everywhere
My outfit's fresh, of course it is
You said we do this to death
Cold until my last breath, slowly exhale
One last "Fuck you" to the world
One last "Fuck you" to the world
You might also like
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, and ever
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, and ever

The clouds stay gray
You can't escape me, I will destroy you

Beavis: "You know Butthead, I say this a lot, but that was cool."
Butthead: "What a long strange trip it has been."
Beavis: "It sure has. I feel all different."
Butthead: "Beavis, the world will never be the same. Doves will fly into the sunset and there will be harmony, and there will be rainbows. There will be peace on earth. And there will be no haters, and if there are haters, we shall flex on them. We shall flex on them hard."
Beavis: "Flex on, yeah."
Butthead: "And finally we will score, the whole world will score. It's gonna be cool."
Beavis: "Really? We're gonna score? Are you sure? Wait a minute, are you sure? Because I always think I'm gonna score, and then it doesn't happen. And I don't want to get my hopes up because I'm all like, emotional right now."
Butthead: "Yes, Beavis, it is foretold."
Beavis: "Yeah, cool, that's good. Butthead, a minute ago you said 'hard.'"
Butthead: "Oh, yeah."6Embed
