3 ContributorsLazy Cat Lyrics
Ball like a ball player, think like a coach though (Coach)
You are not a baller, you a flodger with a car note (Ahh)
Gucci got more drop tops- Mixtrap.com
Think I need to carpool, 'cause my cars are too hot DJ Mother fuckin' Rell
If I had a girl, I would buy my girl an anklet (Anklets)
But, since I don't, think I'll buy myself a bracelet (Bling)
Just bought a Jacob, bought myself a Breitling (Bling, blaow)
Gave the J's to Juice, now Juice flexin' diamonds (Juice!)
When I was a quarter- Mixtrap.com, just a lineman (True)
Told you what I wanted and you brought me every diamond (Pussy)
Used to be my road man, call you lips and fingers (Lips)
Half an ounce of kush, work ya lips and fingers (Lips!)
No one's in my bank, but Gucci Mane a banker (Yeah)
Smokin' like a chimney 'cause I'm really not a dranker (No)
Tell me whats the deal-y, silly, don't I look real pretty, baby (Yes)
Homie got his chain on, but his diamonds sayin' nothin' (Nope)
What you doin' homie, I ain't really doin' nothin' (Nothing)
Just bought a Vega at the racetrack, bettin' that crazy money (Gucci)
Never had a job, so I call myself the lazy cat (Lazy)
Gucci Mane, your crazy ass (Crazy)
Bought myself a crazy Jag (Crazy)
Paper bag, paper tag, just to make a hater mad (Hater)
If you wanna gamble me, you gotta bring a hundred cash
Louis bag, full of cash, Gucci bag, full of kush
Prada bag, poppin' tags, bought my bitch a juicy bag
Damn she got a juicy ass (Juicy)
And she call me daddy 'cause I treat her like my daughter man, yeah I spoil her, man

Dually truck, paper tags, sittin' on 'em grown mans (Growns)
Right wrist, eighty bands, left wrist, a hundred grand (Hundred)
Pinky ring, twenty bands (Twenty)
