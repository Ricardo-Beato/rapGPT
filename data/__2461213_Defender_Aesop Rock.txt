Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Keep the pets inside, notify your contacts

New Salem
Brave new voodoo
Wave a witch hammer in a haven for the woo woo
I'm paper china dinner, mostly picking at my stitches
The bloody hair, bad code, bunny ears, dad jokes
Bitch about Lamictal to whichever vixen listen
The skin rash, the schism, a million rash decisions
In truth, he had a capital T terrible 2 days
That chewed his plumage to the root
And proved a prequel to malaise
A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face
He'd been replaying the scenario for days
With the variables replaced
Meh
Loser in the sky with more diamonds than the carpet from the Shining
Part riot, part Orion
We jarred a lot of lightning up
Shook a turkey leg or 10
Maybe we deserve a day of rest
Not to mention...
You might also like
Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Check your trash can lids, notify your comrades
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block
(1 A M)

The coyotes, summon the ghosts of blown diodes
Open and moving like a luchador with no eyeholes
Fried while the pipes froze, life goes Lovecraft
Christ-pose, sitting on invisible hubcaps, up
Call Alex back, daggers in the basil patch
Tell him maybe less badminton more Scrabble Dash
Less Jarts more Rummikub
Whatever keep the scallywags wrapped up in the subterfuge
Gussied up, guarded, and wearing the same armor as the night he argued 'til he dapped his mans up at departures
I could drive into a lake of fire
Pay the piper COD
Aware the pot and kettle shop a little toxin equally at least
It's probably more the kid than the kid
Either way a vital widget in the system is sick
A sea of symptoms in the hinges hit the room all at once
All I can do is plug the roof with my gum
For now I gotta...
Call Alex back, coyotes in the castle grass
Tell him, "Maybe less freeze tag, more hack-n-slash"
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block
(1 A M)

So a third party, who is incidentally not Alex
Seen a black bear catawampus by the college campus
Soon the safety propaganda clamps breeds on leashes
No compost, bird seed out of feeders
Make a lot of noise when you frolic under the ether
Keep a hand on the pepper spray
Sneakers on the detour
They're more scared of you than you them
Although, one of us chews limbs, and one has 2 chins
So leave a couple messages, vomit a couple dollar bills
Guilty in the window romanticizing the potters field
Not sorry, but I never really was a leader
Found money in the speaker, bought lower Manhattan pizza
You meet a few exceedingly forsaken
Sit around the cooler refusing domestication
Then a couple decades pass and you can't even find the wavelength you was on when you was running 1 AM
By the way...
A third party, who was incidentally not Alex
Seen a bear put a thousand chickens in a pot with carrots
I said, "I'll take first watch"
1 AM defend the whole block4Embed
