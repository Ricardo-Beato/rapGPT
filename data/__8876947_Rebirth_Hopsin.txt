(Ayy!)
Behold

Ayy, niggas got me fucked up (What's up, uh huh)
Don't be talking all that shit
If you ain't with that shit I'm with, nigga I said
Ayy, y'all got me fucked up (Ayy!) (Uh huh)
Don't be talking all that shit
If you ain't with that shit I'm wit (Let's go!)

Yeah, ayy man, blow a kiss to God (Talk to 'em)
Nigga, this flow's banned, it's against the law
You want payback, shit, I wouldn't risk the charge
Tell me who's throne finna get pissed upon
I'm from the land where the teenage kids are lost
They got sticks for the beef like a shish kebab
So nigga, don't ask why I'm so twisted dawg
You wanna be me? Better get your dick enlarged, come on
Hip hip hurrah, it's the don Hop the biscuits done popped
This shit non-stop, Em and Pac hybrid with vengeance on top
Nigga, I ain't no shit you thrift at pawn shops
Look, I done blew up more than I should deserve
Maybe it's my cold and odd demeanor
You can not avoid the Hopsin rebirth
Niggas can't destroy my dollars either (No)
Ether, bitch, if you do not know who I am, research (Talk your shit, Google)
I tell a ho I'm considerate but I hope she understand, me first
Ain't having your way that ain't gon' change that's a no brainer, haha
Your radical stage ain't having no place in my face, praise to Allah
They really hate it when the bad guy cheesin'
Might as well be carrying a bat like Negan
I do what I do, never liked you, hated high school, everyday in class I cheated (Haha)
If you mad when I pass by gleaming, nigga, you just walking in the path I peed in
My name got a new transpired meaning
Find new fucked shit to gaslight me with (Ayy!)
You might also like
Ayy, niggas got me fucked up (What's up, uh huh)
Don't be talking all that shit
If you ain't with that shit I'm with, nigga I said
Ayy, y'all got me fucked up (Ayy!) (Uh huh)
Don't be talking all that shit
If you ain't with that shit I'm wit (Let's go!)

White contacts, yeah, I still be on that
Back-back I'm the bearer of bad news
No straightjacket, I'm tearing the straps loose
And I light up any nigga I carry the match to (That shit fire!)
Still repping the PC, yâ€™all never appease me, you stepping in feces right now (That's shit!)
You get left in the deep seas while begging me please, please inevitably, so pipe down (Shut up!) (Ayy)
Amigo, but don't ask how I stack my C-notes (Why not?)
I get a kick outta eating these beats though, so the only way to define it is Hapkido (Hi-yah!)
Oh, he nasty with it and he different
Motherfuckers can't admit it
Jabs is hitting hard, he be slamming niggas
He remind me of Popeye with his can of spinach (Ah guh-gu-gu-gu-gu-gu)
Nigga, I got a flow that'll leave most folks embarrassed
Nigga, if you don't wanna carry no burden don't compare it (Don't do it)
If I ever dissed you, I meant that when I wrote them lyrics (Wrote them lyrics)
My ex and my side ho paired up 'cause they both impaired
You witnessing a live apocalypse with a force like five rhinoceroses
No record of a surviving hostage
I'm colossus who breaking inside the cockpit turning pilots to lifeless objects (Keep goin'!)
If you nice, then I'm twice the hot shit rivals off the hype from all
This chaos, I know it's due to the price it's costin'
'Cause when Hop sin, niggas hope Christ get called in
Ayy, niggas got me fucked up (What's up, uh huh)
Don't be talking all that shit
If you ain't with that shit I'm with, nigga I said
Ayy, y'all got me fucked up (Ayy!) (Uh huh)
Don't be talking all that shit
If you ain't with that shit I'm wit (Let's go!)
I said, ayy, niggas got me fucked up (What's up, uh huh)
Don't be talking all that shit
If you ain't with that shit I'm with, nigga I said
Ayy, y'all got me fucked up (Ayy!) (Uh huh)
Don't be talking all that shit
If you ain't with that shit I'm wit (Let's go!)

(Ayy!)
