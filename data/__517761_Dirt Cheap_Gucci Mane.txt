9 ContributorsDirt Cheap Lyrics
808 Mafia
808, 1017 (Purps on the beat)
Purps on the beat (I'm tryna sell it to ya')
Guwop, I'm tryna sell it to ya' right now
Whatchu want? Call Guwop

I'm trying to sell it to you cheap nigga, dirt cheap (Dirt cheap)
You know I sell dope in my sleep, but I don't sleep (Never)
You know I sell codeine that lean for a good number (Good)
And I got white squares of that clean and that green ganja (Hum hum)
I got that shit that make a fiend have extreme hunger (Damn)
Look like she 50, but I swear she like 10 years younger (Damn)
These 'sace shades on me and now I feel like Stevie Wonder (Stevie Stevie)
But when you go to jail to them your just another number
I called this bitch from jail and made she changed the fucking number (Huh)
That shit be selling to your back and make you goin' under
I'm in that boat motherfucker, traffic bumper bumper (Bumper bumper)
I got your bitch with me and guess what man I'm about to fuck her (Wop)

Ever since 13, I been gettin' lean (Lean)
On the ground, front street, got it dirt cheap (Huh)
Fuck with Gucci, nigga, 'cause I got it dirt cheap (Got it dirt cheap)
Fuck with Peewee, nigga, 'cause he got it dirt cheap (He got it dirt cheap)
I'm trappin' on a BC, nigga, 3D (Huh)
Got a AK, a ruger and a 2-2-3 (Bang bang)
And they dirt cheap, yeah, my prices dirt cheap (Shhh)
You a fuck nigga, y'all I could beat dirt cheap (Guwop Guwop Guwop Guwop Guwop)

She got that dirty white, I'm talkin' dirt no ain't scam (Dirt)
Dealing out these dirty junkie houses, all these dirty dishes (Dirty)
3 days straight wit' dirty clothes, wit' dirty socks and dirty drugs
8 ball under 30 balls, now 8 cost deep Atlantis marble (Dope dope dope)
I'm at Louis, I'm at Fendi, it ain't nothin' in this store dirt cheap (Louis)
I'm wit' my dime piece, a new time piece, I got a new multi-million dollar mouth piece (Burr burr)
More diamonds than a jewel thief, fur mink for animal cruelty
All these accusations of this bullshit make it extra hard to insure me (Fuck)
I'm aggravated, I remeditated, I put my mind on a million (Huh)
Smokin' Kush in my penthouse and they done put me out of the building (Fuckers)
Too many Lambos in the parking lot, move me out the sub-division (Fuck)
I'm runnin' the city, I'm runnin' the streets, campaign like politician (Gucci)

Ever since 13, I been gettin' lean (Lean)
On the ground, front street, got it dirt cheap (Huh)
Fuck with Gucci, nigga, 'cause I got it dirt cheap (Got it dirt cheap)
Fuck with Peewee, nigga, 'cause he got it dirt cheap (He got it dirt cheap)
I'm trappin' on a BC, nigga, 3D (Huh)
Got a AK, a ruger and a 2-2-3 (Bang bang)
And they dirt cheap, yeah, my prices dirt cheap (Shhh)
You a fuck nigga, y'all I could beat dirt cheap (Guwop Guwop Guwop Guwop Guwop)2Embed
