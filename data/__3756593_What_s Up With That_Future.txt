16 ContributorsWhatâ€™s Up With That Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Moon level, moon level
Oh yeah
Moon level, yeah
Future Hendrix, for real (21, 21, 21)
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah

I'm always high as the moon, tell 'em, "What's up with that?"
Made her trap with the dope in balloons, man, what's up with that? (Oh yeah)
Ain't never have a silver spoon, man, what's up with that? (What's up with that?)
I used to feel like a goon, man, what's up with that? (What's up with that?)
Every year, I tat an angel on me (On me)
Better be prepared if the devil came for me (Came for me)
It's blood diamonds in the field and they golden (Yeah)
I'm in five different Range Rovers, back to back

I ain't never had shit, what's up with that? (On God)
I grew up sleepin' on pallets, nigga, what's up with that? (21, 21)
Fuck around, knock your man off, nigga, for talkin' back (Back)
Everybody hold they hand out, then they gon' talk behind your back
Came from the real bottom, I'm a star (I'm a star)
Nigga, I put red bottoms on my broads (On all my broads)
Donald Trump might fuck around, deport my cars
Seventy for a walkthrough, I ain't got no time to bargain (21)
Zone 6 niggas like to get shit started
Instagram shooter, you ain't hit no targets (21)
I'm on real drugs, nigga, I got real problems (Real problems)
From the real trenches, nigga, I hit real models (21, 21, 21)

Better be prepared if the devil came for me (Came for me)

I'm in five different Range Rovers, back to back

We get first dabs on anything 'round the Act', bless
I'ma smoke this OG Kush up to my fingertip
I know hoes when they choose, I can read they lips
Kick them doors down at Fourway, you'll be sleepin'
Flood a few crosses out and fight away my demons (Oh yeah)
I was already saucy in it, when I woke (When I woke)
Grey Poupon runnin' down a leather coat (A leather coat)
Puttin' diamonds 'round my head, so I toast
We got penthouse wherever we go (Yeah, yeah)
Got the spots out the country just to toast (Oh yeah)
Put diamonds on her neck and 'round her toes (Oh yeah)
You really walkin' on diamonds (Walk)
You caught feelings, you can't hide it

I'm always high as the moon, tell 'em, "What's up with that?"
Made her trap with the dope in balloons, man, what's up with that? (Oh yeah)
Ain't never have a silver spoon, man, what's up with that? (What's up with that?)
I used to feel like a goon, man, what's up with that? (What's up with that?)
Every year, I tat an angel on me (On me)
Better be prepared if the devil came for me (Came for me)
It's blood diamonds in the field and they golden (Yeah)
I'm in five different Range Rovers, back to back
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah1Embed
