43 ContributorsAye Girl Lyrics
Ayy, girl, it's obvious you fine
I just wanna know what's deep inside your mind, maybe we could
Play girl, I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand, but I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
Ayy, girl, I could give you my number
You could give me whatever, we'll have a hell of a time

What up, baby girl? Won't you come here
I put it on my life I seen you somewhere, where you stay at? I'll come there, ha
Ain't no stalking shit, I just wanna talk and shit
Maybe grab a bite then after walk a bit, I just wanna converse
Come on, baby, ain't no need to disperse
Shorty got that type of beauty that inspired this verse, so wassup?
I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't wanna cut, but
It's deeper then that, getting knee deep in the cat
I'm looking for that ride or die type of women, it's what ever
I could be your King, you could be my Coretta
Ain't no better, get you wetter, fuck 'em all
Think outside the box, baby girl, you know I ball
Yes, you know I want it all, so make that shit a double
This is Young Sinatra and I'm rising from the rubble
People never say what's on their mind, I'm like, "Fuck a muzzle"
'Cause I got the feeling you're the missing piece to my puzzle
You might also like
Ayy, girl, it's obvious you fine
I just wanna know what's deep inside your mind, maybe we could
Play girl, I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand, but I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
Ayy, girl, I could give you my number
You could give me whatever, we'll have a hell of a time

Whatever she wants I let her pick it like a fence from the suburb
Everything coach but her plane ticket, ya heard?
We real all the time, that's my word
Catch me in the cut tryna book her like a nerd
She a red bone bobby-soxer, I had to stop her
Ha, shorty a dime, so you know I'm tryna cop her
Pop a bottle at our table periodically
Now check the science of that last line, do it logically, no stoppin' me, I
Bet she woulda never guessed I never graduated
'Cause the way I put my words together she infatuated
Mama, I don't want no drama and I'm serious
Pause like a comma 'fore I end it like a period, now
Girl, don't treat me like your ex-man
I'm a beast on the track, but if I am your next man
I'ma treat you tender
Take it slow like one video render
I remember when I seen you for the first time
It was special like when I wrote my first rhyme
So if all I do is grind and never sleep
Then how in the hell is me and the girl of my dreams supposed to meet?
Ayy, girl, it's obvious you fine
I just wanna know what's deep inside your mind, maybe we could
Play girl, I hope you ain't got no man
If you do I understand, but I'm tryna make plans
That body one of a kind
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't tryna make you mine
Ayy, girl, I could give you my number
You could give me whatever, we'll have a hell of a time

I happen to think there's an explanation beyond reason, beyond (Logic), that brought you right to this very spot15Embed
