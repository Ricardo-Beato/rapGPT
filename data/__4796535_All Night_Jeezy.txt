6 ContributorsAll Night Lyrics
Yeah
Anybody seen my drink?
Oh, we goin' all night tonight (Oh‚ I got it)
I'm on that white though
All night‚ nigga
Nah‚ for real though
Talk to 'em, nigga

I'm talkin' breakin' down a brick, yeah‚ to hit a lick, yeah
In love with the bitch, but she still a trick‚ yeah (Yeah)
That ass sittin' right, yeah, I wanna bite, yeah (Yeah)
I could fuck it right, yeah, all night, yeah, uh

Gotta let them niggas know, boy, you got that dough, boy
Fuck what you heard, you ain't nothin' to hold boys
Before I seen them O's, boy, I was a poor boy
Drop my top in the hood, yeah, I'm talkin' dope boy
I be making hits, man, like a hitman
What you say about them dollars, they can suck a dick, man
Keep my dawg on the collar 'cause that boy a pit, man
Streets get deep, yeah, I'm talking quicksand (Yeah)
Straight up out the hood, yeah, I'm ridin' wood, yeah
Rose gold with the pointers, yeah, I'm lookin' good, yeah
Self-made, self-paid, yeah, it's understood, yeah
Still be A-E-W, I wish a nigga would, yeah

You' bout your issue? Is you gon' shine every night?
Phone off, grind it up and get it right
Don't do no snitchin', don't do no trickin', don't do no lackin'
Don't do no cappin', it's all night, let's get it crackin' (Yeah)

Came up on a milli', yeah, I'm a millionaire (Yeah)
I can see the envy, yeah, through these Cartiers (Through the Cartiers)
Neighborhood style, like catch me rockin' cashmere (Cashmere)
Extravagant shop, I can't buy shit from last year (No)
She can heal the pain when I hit like Advil ('Vil)
I drop to explain and I charge for adlibs (Adlibs)
I hop on the plane, show the whole world my drip (My drip)
Talkin' 'bout her brain when I said she give lip (Lip)
I got in my bag, this a whole lot of chips (Uh)
Speedin' in the whip, I got way too many whips (Too many)
Fans across the world, I get paid to take a trip (Trip)
You don't trust these suckers, if you play, you gon' get flipped

You' bout your issue? Is you gon' shine every night?
Phone off, grind it up and get it right
Don't do no snitchin', don't do no trickin', don't do no lackin'
Don't do no cappin', it's all night, let's get it crackin' (Yeah)
I'm talkin' breakin' down a brick, yeah, to hit a lick, yeah
In love with the bitch, but she still a trick, yeah (Yeah)
That ass sittin' right, yeah, I wanna bite, yeah (Yeah)
I could fuck it right, yeah, all night, yeah, uh
