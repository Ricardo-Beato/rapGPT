58 ContributorsAnna Wintour Lyrics
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm so cold, I'm so grown, I'm so real life
I'm so show-off, my diamonds designed to twinkle and bleed light
As the valley fills with darkness, shadows chase and run 'round
I can make them stop for me - and no lamb, no savior's shelter
I'll be better off alone, I'll walk at my own pace
I don't need no one, I've got my own, I've got it made
In the morning I cheer for sunshine and I feel, but I don't feel enough
In the midnight hours I try, ooh

Then you show me, now I believe
Diamonds and dreams come true for girls like me
(Princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess)

Now I feel in love, babe
I really know that your love is enough and I'm
So lucky you
Found me in the day I needed love
Now I feel in love, babe, everywhere you are
You might also like
(Now I feel in love, babe)
(I feel in love, babe)
(Now I feel in love, babe)
(I- so lucky you)
(Now I feel in love, babe)
(I feel in love)
(Now I feel in love, babe)
(I- feel in, feel in, feel in)

Your dude came to rock for me, hot body, yes, I got it, got it
All of the girls are dance floor queens until I put my Blahniks on it
Move and make it hot for me, hot rod, oh yes, I'll ride it, ride it
Dance for me, get naughty, he wild out for these expensive options
You know the glow, stuntin' in front row
Shades always, these bitches can't look, no
Bob, sleek, chic, petite, I fit those
En Vogue, I do what you can't know
I'm runway, you know they a side show
I'm first page, the main stage as I pose
The one dame, the one name that y'all know
Just take notes, stay on top like halos
Make pesos, most of these bitches is my clones
You new puss, this catwalk is my throne
I'm penthouse, you're trap house and rhinestones
These diamonds on my bones be my own
Invent styles, I been crowned, this my home
Bitch, I'm grown in ball gowns - it's french sewn
You take shots, I make shots, the end zone
These bitches overall is some Lauras, they Winslow
Then you show me, now I believe
Diamonds and dreams come true for girls like me

Now I feel in love, babe (yeah)
I really know that your love is enough and I'm
So lucky you
Found me in the day I needed love
Now I feel in love, babe, everywhere you are

(Feel in love, babe)
(I feel in love, babe)
(Now I feel in love, babe)
(I- so lucky you)
(Now I feel in love, babe)
(I feel in love)
(Now I feel in love, babe)
(I- so lucky you)39Embed
