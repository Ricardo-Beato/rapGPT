33 Contributors24 Hours Lyrics
I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stuntin' on the hoes and I'm shittin' on the cowards
I'm 24 hours, I'm up 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours, no shit shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
I'm 24 hours, its Gucci Nigga!
I'm up 24 hours, cut it up some Cori

Damn its a good day. Damn its a good day
Call Drumma Boy and told him lets go make a hood tape
First thang Ima do pull out my 7'4
Candy coated black things sittin on them Forgios
24 towers, 8 bricks of powder, 10 bales of dro
That's what I paid for
Don't talk about my Lambo talk about my Rarri
Talk about my Phantom, talk about my Harley
Brick Squad Biker boy, angel named Charlie
Dudes going psycho white boy gnarly
Every 24 seconds passin me the marley
Lames tryna diss dont effect me hardly

I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stuntin' on the hoes and I'm shittin' on the cowards
I'm 24 hours, I'm up 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours, no shit shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
I'm 24 hours, its Gucci Nigga!
I'm up 24 hours, cut it up some Cori
You might also like
It's Gucci!
Im goin' to the bank again make another deposit
It's gettin' kinda chilly bring my minks up out tha closet
Gettin' kinda warm get my jewerly out the safe
If it be a problem put the hater in his place
I'm slicker than a oil spill, sharper than a razor
I'm screamin' anybody get it like my nigga Magor
Finna cop a condo and fill it up with ammo
Brick Squad Bandana on I think I'm fuckin Rambo
It's Gucci
I'm a killer so don't push me
Brick Squad ain't no pussy niggas
Runnin' wit' dem wig splittas
Niggas screamin' roll one
Gucci let me hold some
But I can't let you hold none
I hit you wit the whole drum

I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stuntin' on the hoes and I'm shittin' on the cowards
I'm 24 hours, I'm up 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours, no shit shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
I'm 24 hours, its Gucci Nigga!
I'm up 24 hours, cut it up some Cori
Im fuckin wit a white girl you can call me Ice-T
Cause I got my crystals on you can call em Spike Lee
Robbin me unlikely last try I drop em
Hollow tip stopped em
I ain't have time to box him
Stuntin like an actor
Runnin like an athlete
Strait to the money like a sprinter at a track meet
First signed Waka, then I signed Gucci
Then I sign Brick Squad tell em come sue me

I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stuntin' on the hoes and I'm shittin' on the cowards
I'm 24 hours, I'm up 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours, no shit shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
I'm 24 hours, its Gucci Nigga!
I'm up 24 hours, cut it up some Cori

I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stuntin' on the hoes and I'm shittin' on the cowards
I'm 24 hours, I'm up 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours, no shit shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
I'm 24 hours, its Gucci Nigga!
I'm up 24 hours, cut it up some Cori4Embed
