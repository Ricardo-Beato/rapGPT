17 ContributorsCouldâ€™ve Been You Lyrics
I gave her books to read, fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts, shit you can't get in college
She's a reflection of me so you know she the shit
If I'm a star she a star, if I'm rich she rich
That's my dog
I tell her stay she wanna go, I tell her go she wanna stay
That's my dog
You know a bitch don't usually mean nothing to me, that's right
But that's my dog I go left, she go right, I go up, she go down
She couldn't listen that, she ain't around
So ungrateful screaming ''I hate you''
She must got amnesia, bitch I made you
Now just think, just think that could've been you
Just think, that should've been you
Yeah, with me, I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't fucking with you

Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit
But tonight you met your match
Cause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya
(Could've been you)
Shopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind
(Could've been you)
Living lavish, instead it's your girlfriend
But you tripping while we sipping
In the back of the club big tipping
You might also like
She say it hurts when you supposed to win then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby, you was confused
I had a thing for you, I had a ring for you
House, cars, kids and a pet name for you
Pussycat, told you I'd make it, you ain't believe
I guess cause coming up was hard it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fucking with you
It's on, the club jumping, I'm trying get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm staring at your thicker friends
I guess I'm like Will Smith in "Pursuit of Happyness"
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think, just think, that could've been you
Now just think that should've been you with me
I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fucking with you

Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit
But tonight you met your match
Cause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya
(Could've been you)
Shopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind
(Could've been you)
Living lavish, instead it's your girlfriend
And it ain't no other way to put it except
I know you understand it girl, it's so
But you see us in the back of the club
Popping bottles and it could've been you, but nope
Said it could've been - could've been you, yeah
Said it could've been - could've been you1Embed
