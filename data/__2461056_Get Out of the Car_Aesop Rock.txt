65 ContributorsGet Out of the Car Lyrics
I see how y'all be trying to front, man
Y'all be fronting, man

Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more loss in the wake
I recall thinking, "Someday, someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect"
And I just couldn't fathom blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains and a slew of unique nuances
Nah mean? When you wake up eight years non-responsive
It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack-in-the-box
To a package of clogged up chakras
Oh, shazbat! Not the "ever after" he wanted
From the "Once upon a time, dot, dot, dot"
Once upon a time, he was so much more
Than a punchline for his own potshots, ah
Watch the Impossible Kid
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out, I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether you his moms or his mans
Whether you his pops or his girl, I was poison
Heart full of canines, head full of voices
Whole life trying to quiet 'em down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay
True friendship in a tugboat way
Ae go dark in the face of the fucked
When the fucked was a friend, that was basically done
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook faking of funk, and I can't
Here go the hindsight:
Eight years been one long blindside
I could pinpoint seven more turns that occurred 'cause he never really healed from the first
Oh, what a world, any hack is a myth
Any dap is a joke, any map is a trick
Any graph is a hoax, ease on down
I'm burning up, I'm bleeding out
Knowing ain't half the battle
That's a bullshit quip written by some asshole
You can own what you are and still sit around stoned in your car
Not doing shit, halfway to nil
Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills
Get out the car, AesYou might also like8Embed
