Everything that I have, I'm thankin’ God for it now
I'm takin' all of my trees, proceed to breakin’ it down
Though with fuckin' with ground level, we in the clouds
Stay reclined in my seat, smokin', leanin' it back
Livin' like rock and roll, but still doing this rap music
Movin' through stats, always movin' the crowd
If Wiz Khalifa's on your campus, then I’m probably smokin’ loud
With a bad one comin' out, talkin’ 'bout
Keep your cool so we don't hear the hate and doubt
They just mad 'cause they ain’t make it to the clouds
Tried they best, but they just ain't gettin' accounted for
We ain't goin' back and forth
I ain't just start multiple trends, I open doors
Provided a style for you and yours
I made the class, you studied the course
Game's to bе sold, not told, hope that you could afford it
Make sure thе private plane cold as soon as I board it
More concerned with stocks and mortgages than little boy shit
Famous girl, she on my line, she need a dick appointment

That's hard, haha
Yeah, yeah (Haha)

Tell me who really want it
Everything that they talking about, I already done it
Don't fuck with they narrative and how they spun it
Like Clive Campbell, I'ma set an example
My flow ample over this sample
Leave the beat trampled, never one to ramble
Head to toe in that camo, blowing up trees like Rambo
This is the way, bitch, I'm repping that Mando
Got a lot of money, don't need a Lambo
Back in the day, I was in a minivan, though
Back in the day, I was in a minivan, oh
Sippin' on something and whippin' it slow
2010, I remember when I was living in my godmother's in G-Burg
That's my word
Bumping Mac Miller K.I.D.S., Kush & O-J Wiz
Look in the mirror, I'm hoping it's his day
Give a fuck what the kids say
Logic bringin' it back to the rap shit
That 2 Dope Boyz, DatPiff (Yeah, yeah)
Give a fuck about a rap list, one in a million, I'm on that list
On the map like a atlas, talk shit, get hit with a fat lip
Smoking that buddha then dip in the pussy, we call it the catnip
Run the game like a 3090, leave 'em all behind me
Step back, motherfucker, don't try me
'Cause I'm me, you know it's Logic

Hahaha (Funkmaster Flex, Funkmaster Flex, Funkmaster Flex)
Crazy, don't try to rap along
Don't try to recite it
Don't waste your time, hahaha
I know no one else can't do that, I already know
I know that5Embed
