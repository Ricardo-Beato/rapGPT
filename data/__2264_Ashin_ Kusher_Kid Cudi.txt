77 ContributorsAshinâ€™ Kusher Lyrics
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Uh-huh... yeah

First things first, been rippin', get it in Cudder
Niggas know the name, it's none other
I know you know me, the double-O repper
Two-stepper, gun toter nah-nah, smoke kusher
I know you lovin' how I do it when I switch up the lizzane
Skinny niggy-diggy in your city gettin' chizzange
Like I'm Carmelo, meet me in the pizzaint
Yammin' on you sucker niggas, yammin' on these hoes
Roll Swishers in the whip, I'm dippin' so quick
Ask Mel, whiskey motherfucker we up in this bitch
Hoes love Cuda, smooth duder, Cudois
I'm climbing, I'm climbing and I, know why

Y'all know I keep it funky, motherfucker, better get it right
Get it right, better get it right, get it right
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh (yeah)
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh
And I'll be rockin' along, zonin', yeah
Movin' along, zonin'
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh (yeah)

Doing what I want, no need to front
Skinny and tatted the fuck up, hey pass me the blunt, baby get up
We in this bitch, 'laxin
Dennis know the game, he in the crowd mackin'
All up off the dome, no need to pen it, friend
Me and my niggas be gettin' ends again
Told my man Plain Pat, dawg, ever since day one
We gon' get it poppin, that's what I'm here for
If you knew me, man
I don't really worry about a nigga trying to judge
Who are you, Judy?!
Girl shake a feather, do your thang 'til you feel right
I know you know the name, the team, we takin' flizzight

Y'all know I keep it funky, motherfucker, better get it right
Get it right, better get it right, get it right

Life, together, we all in together now
All in together, all-all baby
'Cause we all in together now
Life, together, we all in together now
All in together, all-all baby
'Cause we all in together now
Doing what I need, hater I am A-Okay
How many times must I tell 'em we don't care what people say
Even if I do somethin' unruly
I be like "Fuck it nigga, I was probably zooted!"
Off top... Honestly
The kush and Goose combination harmful, G
Find my own rhythm while I'm looking through my Viennas
Everybody gon' talk that shit until they see him
Then they all on my ballsack, word
Then I bounce and they saying I'm absurd
You old jive-ass nigga, look around
Ay, we be around, fam, I'm in the cloud

Y'all know I keep it funky motherfucker, better get it right
Get it right, better get it right, get it right
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh (yeah)
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh
And I'll be rockin' along, zoning, yeah
Movin' along, zoninnnnnnnn
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh (yeah)
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh (hey)
Y'all know I keep it funky motherfucker, better get it right
Get it right, better get it right, get it right
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh (yeah)
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh
And I'll be rockin' along, zoning, yeah
Movin' along, zoninnnnnnnn
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh
Ooooooooh-ooooooooh (hey)

And I'll be rockin' along, zonin', yeah
Movin' along, zoninnnnnnnn
