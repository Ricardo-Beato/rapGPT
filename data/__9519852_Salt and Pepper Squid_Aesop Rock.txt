16 ContributorsSalt and Pepper Squid Lyrics
I could might investigate a exodus
I could find the energy to fetch us
Something dead to skin and beverages
I will not be connecting or checking messages
You'll know I'm made it when it's raining salt and pepper squid
Salt and pepper squid
Salt and pepper squid
Salt and pepper squid

Aes gets a gold star, sophistry gets no cigar
Homies get to chauffeur the only rapper with no car
Sorry Mike, Ford Exploder motor sounding outraged
Pedal-foot a carving knife through a blind mouse tail
Me, I call shotty forеver in all conditions
Recline it way back to takе the pressure off the stitches
They gave me 90 Oxys of which zero were of interest
Chewing shrooms at waterfront in coveralls from the Olympics
Limpin, I like to help the younger rippers clip up
A little hype to re-ignite the nimbus when they hiccup
How's your weekend, is it house on a beach with a view, and tea for two? Round here the beach is a fountain, the view is tweaker soup
Zoom lens Jesus, I'm used to the heat wavin'
Immune to the urine cooked into every meter of pavement
Scrolling credits over dehydrated DNA
10 pm, PSA, I forgot to eat today
You might also like
I could might investigate a exodus
I could find the energy to fetch us
Something dead to skin and beverages
I will not be connecting or checking messages
You'll know I'm made it when it's raining salt and pepper squid
Salt and pepper squid
Salt and pepper squid
Salt and pepper squid

I suitcase squat 2 boxes of cat litter
Then bop to my 8 o'clock at a vacant lot by the river
I'm here to see a friend jump off a bridge because his friend did
To us that's what a friend is, what a terrible question
I'm sorry 'bout your friendships, we were done by 11 and ghost
Shout to the callers who got the FD to check if he's toast
He's not we had disgusting coffee after
Forgot to grab a snack, there's always other flags to capture
When you activate a traveling act
Set a flash up at the rapture in a jacket that says "Staff" on the back
Not a stringer, just familiar with some people who crash
Like it's an actual feature of being at peace with they craft
Look... stop leaving needles at the courts
Leave more free boards
Peel around the puddles that could peel the paint, feeling faint
Ain't seeing straight, I forgot to eat today
I could might investigate a exodus
I could find the energy to fetch us
Something dead to skin and beverages
I will not be connecting or checking messages
You'll know I'm made it when it's raining salt and pepper squid
Salt and pepper squid
Salt and pepper squid
Salt and pepper squid

I have one brain cell
All it do is hum Bad Brains and document whoever sleigh bells raise hell
Triple dog dares get thrown around with no discretion
If you getting kinda froggy come and trip the motion sensor
Yea, perfect foul energy, every degree of D-up
My Kwik-E-Mart receipt is tall enough to ride the tea cups
The stuntmen all get perfect 10s, 11s if you hit the pole
Bonus for the sticks and stones, the kid ain't fixing shit in post
Only church to consecrate the jersey barrier
A worthy adversary for any commercial carrier
Granted I'm all landing gear, post-op and propped up
Coat rack, spotting cars, wanderlust proper fucked
We're doing what we can considering the frame we're left with
Waves of desperate people lighting fires and waving melee weapons
Dog in the trash at the pizza place
That's a good idea, dog, I forgot to eat todayEmbed
