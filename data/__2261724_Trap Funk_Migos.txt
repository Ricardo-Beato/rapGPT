Honorable C.N.O.T.E
Yung Rich Nation!
Migo!
This what they been waiting for...

If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk

Same keys that you're hearing, same keys I am dealing
Same niggas that you're fearing, same niggas that I live with
Couple m's in the attic, ain't gotta count it every day 'cuz I'm havin'
Got the fish in the water, I'm slabbin'
Count up the extras, I'm dabbin'
Eighteen hours land in Moscow, what the hell them niggas doin' in Moscow?
Yung Rich Nation, Migo gang now, havin' international fame now
She don't speak no English, she wanna meet me, her daddy the plug out in Argentina
She try to drink that liquid in the glass, told her "baby girl, it's not tequila"
In Miami I hit the doughnut in traffic in the Lamborghini two seater
Your ho fly, in town, I take her to the telly, I fuck her one time and I leave her

If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
You might also like
I got the blues...
Used to be kickin' them doors in my Jordans, I walk in the club with my Lous (Louboutins)
Now we fuck bitches by two
Dropped out of school, they said we was fools, them diamonds looking like a fool
Mansion, twenty five rooms, we got bananas, baboons
Young niggas we brought the trap...back
We gave you, so fuck it, we want it back
Don't do that, nigga, boy, we on that
Whippin' and flippin', you cloned that
I'm not going back and forth, she knew it was a 'Rari when she seen the horse
Trappin' babies and we never abort
Migo gang we established on the north
We had the bando beating like a pulse
I wanted some money, I jumped off the porch
Hot nigga so I keep me a torch
I will burn a nigga, put that on my lil' boy

If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk

Call it trap funk 'cuz we having gas bags, and we put the fork in the trap
Same keys you're here playing on the piano, I got them wrapped up in saran wrap
Got a plug out in Moscow with the act
And don't tell them too much information they rats
Baby bottle, but no Rugrat
Niggas is old hundreds, call them Thunder Cats
Young nigga be dabbin', hittin' the foam with the spatula
Dab daddy, pull up, these bitches suck me like Dracula
Diamonds pull up, my jeweler from Canada
You niggas still bubblegum wrapping 'cuz you niggas amateurs (pitiful)
Christian Louboutins, a walking mannequin, my balmains full of blue Benjamins
Don't drink that shit just to be cool, I only sip Actavis 'cuz it's my medicine
They put me on the news, they tryna embarass me
Got the Migos looking like we some terrorists
Taking hits, gotta run with the punches
My momma told me it's just a form of jealousy (Mama)
If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk3Embed
