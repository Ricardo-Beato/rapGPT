Pressure, pressure
I can feel pressure
Just a little bit

The pressure weigh a ton, it's gettin too heavy
Had to inspire them again like I didn't already
Real ones still around, release the confetti
God’s Son across the belly ('Cross the belly, 'cross the belly)

I ain’t made it ‘til we all can say that we made it
Been down with the hustle so long, feel like we related
Take my word like you would from thе book of Revelations
Dead prеsidents, that shit come when you dedicated
I invest in education 'cause we wasn’t privy
We got busy, put scholarship programs throughout the city
Jefe, did it my way, chairman of the committee
Rat Pack niggas like Sinatra in the 60s
Come through on some wavy shit
Valentino camouflage on some Army/Navy shit
I know you can feel the pressure, keep up with my cadences
QB lingo, freestyles tapin’ on Stretch and Bobbito
Hit threw me the beat and I had to eat it, ugh
The lies y'all recorded in your session, delete it
Hurtin’ niggas, I think they out for the rest of the season
Tried to play it cool, they don’t wanna see me heated, nah

The pressure weigh a ton, it’s gettin' too heavy
Had to inspire them again like I didn’t already
Real ones still around, release the confetti
God’s Son across the belly ('Cross the belly, 'cross the belly)
Pressure
God’s Son across the belly ('Cross the belly, 'cross the belly)
Just a little bit

The world on my shoulders, it’s gettin’ too heavy
I been bench pressing the problems, ain’t even get sweaty
Cops brutalizing kids, I see it too steadily
Correctional facilities never do it correctly
My main statement is this whole game is triangulated
Little versions of who? Nigga, there’s no replacement
Besides my kids, boundaries are my greatest creation
I been on fire four generations
It’s Nas 'til I’m gone, give my all, give 'em more
Miles on my Peloton, I been working on my core
Colors of Benetton, pastel rugs on the floor
Meal prep me, Ferrari Testi
She out on the terrace, glass of Petrus with her bestie
Drunk textin' while I’m out here tryna spread the message
You searchin' for qualities that I’m already blessed with
R&B exes, charms on her necklace
God’s Son across the belly ('Cross the belly, 'cross the belly)
God’s Son across the belly ('Cross the belly, 'cross the belly)
Weight of the world
Embrace the pressure

Pressure
I can feel pressure
Just a little bit, yeah11Embed
