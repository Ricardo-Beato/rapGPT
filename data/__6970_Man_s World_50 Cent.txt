15 ContributorsManâ€™s World Lyrics
What you saying boy, boy?
Ha ha - said what you saying boy?

See, the weak get walked on, the soft get barked on
See me, I never ever ever run
Niggas say the wrong shit to me like he wanna do me
Somebody be at him with my gun
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world

Listen, nigga you play me and I'mma go crazy
You push me I'mma motherfucking trip
I come tripping through your set busting off my TEC
I gives a fuck if you's a Blood or a Crip
Nigga from J.F.K. to L.A.X., I'm back through the sets again
Gangsta life, that's right, crazy-ass Mexicans
Do it the raw way, broad day, AK
Spray cause a melee, mayday mayday
Freak bitch suck me on tape like Ray J
Niggas that I'm up against know they can't fade me
I'm the last one, you know the last don
She know she wanna come, bitch, bring your ass on
You might also like
See, the weak get walked on, the soft get barked on
See me, I never ever ever run
Niggas say the wrong shit to me like he wanna do me
Somebody be at him with my gun
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world

See, I come from the Southside where niggas is outside
Right now with the rubber grips
Niggas say they gon' see me to hit 'em on G.P
Then I bless 'em with the chains full of bricks
When you come from where I'm from you come from the bottom
They ain't supposed to get this rich
So the Fed's got my phone tapped to treat me like Fat Cat
Now I'm thinking "man, ain't this a bitch?"
Niggas stick cola in cola, from moving the yola
Next thing you know they up in your crib
Saying ''where's the stash at?'' You move they gon' blast that
So I suggest you stand still, kid

See, the weak get walked on, the soft get barked on
See me, I never ever ever run
Niggas say the wrong shit to me like he wanna do me
Somebody be at him with my gun
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world
This a man's world
Watch your mouth girl, this a man's world3Embed
