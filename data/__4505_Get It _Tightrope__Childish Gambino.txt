22 ContributorsGet It (Tightrope) Lyrics
Childish Gambino, doper than twenty kilos
Feeling me, no Aveeno; pardon me, that’s my ego
Nigga, I’m on, my swagger on He-Man
Down for Community, these other niggas Glee fans
You cannot see me, you are blind like Venetians
Eyes wide open, nigga stay focused
Batman on these niggas, I am tired of these jokers
And my brain is too expressive, and your mind is on the local
Motherfucker, I ain’t playing; ironic, I am childish
Addressin’ all you niggas, now you motherfuckers stylish
And get me any indie song, I promise to annihil’ it
My mouth will kill everyone, I guess that bitch a nihilist
Yeah, my girls are the wildest, they’re in love with a weirdo
I am so different, I am protégé, my hero
Self-made phenom, green like tree frogs
Save every penny like Inspector Gadget reruns
My name is Donald Glover, talented motherfucker
Childish is my cover to hide this shit from my mother
She can’t know how I’m livin’, I’m drinkin’ and fuckin’ women
And she is Jehovah Witness and don’t believe in all this shit
But I gotta handle business, kick it like soccer
Upper-class Kit-Kat, break ‘em off proper
I am just a rapper, Sick Boi is my clique, man
You are not a Sick Boi, you are just a sick man
Take some Dimetapp, yeah these hoes a dime a tap
‘Less you get caught by them bitches, better keep your penis wrapped
Then you are just a rapper, the sky is the limit
Don’t put nothing on the game, just put something back in itYou might also like3Embed
