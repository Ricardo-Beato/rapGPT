11 ContributorsBut I Want Lyrics
I done grinded, I done grind, I wasted time, I've been to jail
I been to hell, did everything that I want
My baby mommy stopped beefin' about me
I can't help all of y'all, I want millions and everything that I want
My OGs that believe in me and and achieve with me
Oh yeah, everything that I want
Everything, but I want, everything that I want

Ha, you gon' miss this purse, you gon' be best friends
All your doin' is flexin', give me my necklace
Who the fuck you textin'
When I met you, you was nothin', you was nobody nexts
You was nobody prizes, now you a contestant
And you a lil' messy
But I'ma clean it up for you
You think I'm slow so I'm gon' speed it up for you
I'ma put you on my homie, he gon' beat it up for you
Cuz you ain't true, how the fuck your pants got a U, huh?
Why not your shit they can miss with my tool, hey
Bitch thinkin' I'm blue, really I'm red
I freestyle every time, how I do that?
Just get on the back of this beat like you got paid

I done grinded, I done grind, I wasted time, I've been to jail
I been to hell, did everything that I want
My baby mommy stopped beefin' about me
I can't help all of y'all, I want millions and everything that I want
My OGs that believe in me and and achieve with me
Oh yeah, everything that I want
Everything, but I want, everything that I want
You might also like
I believe I can  and then cut your lights
Young TI, you can have whatever you like
Yeah, we on the plane so we can take our flight
Let's travel to L.A. so we can take a hike
But if she screaming I'm feelin' like Ike
And yeah, I got them yopsters so you should fright
Unless it's Friday the thirteenth
Thousand dollar links, wintertime minks
Lean for the drinks, you can't even think
Money run just like a lake, better yet a sink
Baby, use your brain, better yet think
Now, bend over and let me hit you on this plane

I done grinded, I done grind, I wasted time, I've been to jail
I been to hell, did everything that I want
My baby mommy stopped beefin' about me
I can't help all of y'all, I want millions and everything that I want
My OGs that believe in me and and achieve with me
Oh yeah, everything that I want
Everything, but I want, everything that I want1Embed
