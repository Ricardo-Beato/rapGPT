(Helluva made this beat, baby)
Ayy

I lost my mommy and my granny in the same month (What?)
A bunch of bitches talking down 'cause I’m coming up
I know some people in my own city hating on me (Damn)
And if you hoping I fall off, you gon' be waiting on it, ayy
I'm the only child, I never wanted to be in no clique
You a rat, I ain’t no mouse, I know we ain't finna click
A born leader, I ain't never want to be like a bitch
I been a freak, so I keep a nigga sucking my clit
Okay, let's talk about it, no petty shit, let's keep that shit a bill (Okay)
It's a difference in the bitch who rap and the bitch who rap for real
I'm dedicated, this my passion in me, can't nobody take it (Huh)
Bitch, you know your favorite rapper could never keep up with Megan

Bitch, we ain’t equal
Y’all fucking on the same niggas, pussy in the sequel
Disrespect me and this shit gon' get lethal
Yeah, I look good, but, lil’ bitch, I get evil
Booty club, who gon' show that pussy? This a free check
Throw that ass on me and my nigga get a free check
And I ain't hiding, but I can't let you know where I be at
’Cause it's gon' be the gossip of the city if they peep that
My secrets, keep that
You might also like
Trust me, you ain't scarin' me, bitch, I ain't intimidated (Hell nah)
I ain't gon' argue with no ho who just a fan of me (A fan)
You taking shots at a bitch that'll never care (Bah-bah-bah)
How it's on sight and I don't never see you nowhere? (Bitch)
Niggas coming too strong, wait a minute, hold on (Wait, wait)
Let him eat me out and still put him in the friend zone (Ah, ah)
Bitches wanna hang when they know they really hate me
I'm still winning even if you don't congratulate me
Niggas gettin' mad they can't hit, boy, this my pussy
Stick the whole clip up in your throat and make you feel pussy
Bitch, I been popping, doing numbers, been lit
And since the nigga think he made me, tell him do it again

Bitch, we ain't equal
Y'all fucking on the same niggas, pussy in the sequel
Disrespect me and this shit gon' get lethal
Yeah, I look good, but, lil' bitch, I get evil
Booty club, who gon' show that pussy? This a free check
Throw that ass on me and my nigga get a free check
And I ain't hiding, but I can't let you know where I be at
'Cause it's gon' be the gossip of the city if they peep that
My secrets, keep that

Another bitch shining ain't gon' dim my light (Uh-uh)
Another bitch beef ain't gon' make me fight (Yeah)
I never been a fan of competitive shit
'Cause I'm still a winner up against whoever it is (Ah)
They be talking, yeah, I see it, all that clout, I don't need it
Hoes showing fake love when they really hate to see it
Niggas tryna get some fame off my name, that's a shame
When I started making money, that's when everybody changed, huh
Real Hot Girl shit
Still the same bitch
