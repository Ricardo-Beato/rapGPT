12 ContributorsGo Harder Lyrics
I done been lied to, I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against me
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
I done been lost, I done been crossed
I done heard all kinds of rumors that were false
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder

You can't break me, I'm solid, I go hard body
Can't break me down I break laws, don't never abide by it
I let my hater be my motivator and keep grindin'
I make my moves when I wanna make my moves
'Cause I ain't even tryin' to
Listen to no other nigga talkin bout, what he gon do?
And he lyin'
I see it if I want it ima get it straight up buyin' it
I learned that free band shit cuz Freebandz
Shit clothing line I designed it
Ain't thinking bout the 13 years to see 'bout a young nigga flyin' in
This G5, G6 classified I don't hit the bullseye
When you spread the rumors make sure
You tell them I'm a multi millionaire, ain't playin' fair
Touch ya bag, I don't even care
'Cause I can wake up any day travel anywhere
You might also like
I done been lied to, I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against me
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
I done been lost, I done been crossed
I done heard all kinds of rumors that were false
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder

They try to show and prove, you'd rather see me lose
But I refuse to lose, I run on jet fuel
I'm makin' major moves, you tryna peep the move
I dropped ten hits, I got 'em real confused
I hear they my enemy, I make them in my sleep
That's all you want from me, I know I'm makin' history
I know you greasy and you greedy
But I'm a genius and I been fiendin' to set the streets on fire
You can catch me flyin by
Ain't got no time to stop to kick the bobo
With ya boy, my time is very precious thats right every second
Too many hard times I'm thinking bout investments

I done been lied to, I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against me
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
I done been lost, I done been crossed
I done heard all kinds of rumors that were false
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You watch me go through hell, you see me run through them bales
You know I hit them corners everyday and caught them sales
You hatin' mutherfuckers don't wanna see a kid prevail
Got hit up wit that shell now my CD on the shelf
If I can take a bullet then I can take the rumors
Through all the losses I never lost my sense of humor
I kept pushin' you kept lookin' hopin' I fall
Even at my worst I'm at your best, laws and all
Through scares and all, I'm standing tall I won't fold
I got money coming out my pores, music and my soul
I run the globe, I'm in my mode, this ain't no flow
Throughout the riches, I know that road

I done been lied to, I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against me
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
I done been lost, I done been crossed
I done heard all kinds of rumors that were false
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder
You try to bring me down, I'ma go harder4Embed
