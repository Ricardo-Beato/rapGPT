12 ContributorsWish You Would Lyrics
Freak freak
Let me be your freak
Touch my toes
You can have this beat
I like when you bad
Cause it feels so good
Bring it back
I wish you would

Freak freak
Let me be your freak
Touch your toes
Let me get that beat
Like when you bad
But it feels so good
Bring it back
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
Bring it back
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
Bring it back
I wish you would

It's Gucci, Go
Bring it back
Bring it back
Pull up in a Vette
Jet black
Ass fat, I done met my match
I need the girl in the back with a butterfly tat
Bring it back
Bring it back
Pull up in a Vette
Jet black
Ass fat, I done met my match
I need the girl in the back with a butterfly tat

Her pass me by I won't let that
Got a hundred stacks you respect that
Spent a hundred stacks I regret that
At a strip club where we met at
He's a stalker, cause he desperate
Can't help it he'll need an exit
Money suspect, change the subject
But I control the girl like a puppet

It's Gucci
Freak freak
Let me be your freak
Touch your toes
Let me get that beat
Like when you bad
But it feels so good
Bring it back
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
Bring it back
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
Bring it back
I wish you would
Burrr
She's a nympho so she loved it
Broke up and he loves it
Come to me with that fuck shit
Get your wig split in public
I met your bitch in public
On aisle 9 by the toothpicks
We left there, hit Ruth's Chris
She sucked dick like she toothless
Hit Busy Bee on Tuesdays
I'm easy E, I'm ruthless
Ho deuces and juices
I'm too high, I'm woozy

Gucci
Freak freak
Let me be your freak
Touch your toes
Let me get that beat
Like when you bad
But it feels so good
Bring it back
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
Bring it back
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would
Bring it back
I wish you would
Freak freak
Let me be your freak
Touch my toes
You can have this beat
I like when you bad
Cause it feels so good
Bring it back
I wish you wouldEmbed
