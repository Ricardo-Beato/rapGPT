5 ContributorsFresh As A Bitch Lyrics
Big money talks
Just got off the phone with Dolph
Threeway with Scooter
Mula!

Balenciaga (fresh as a bitch)
Gianni Versace (fresh as a bitch)
Dolce Gabanna (fresh as a bitch)
Maison Margiela (fresh as a bitch)
Ferragamo (fresh as a bitch)
Juicy Couture (fresh as a bitch)
Louis decor (fresh as a bitch)
Shopping for her (fresh as a bitch)
Tom Ford my jacket (fresh as a bitch)
Pucci my glasses (fresh as a bitch)
Fendi my wallet (fresh as a bitch)
And Gucci my khakis (fresh as a bitch)
Can never be tacky (fresh as a bitch)
Prada birkin bag (fresh as a bitch)
My tailor Italian (fresh as a bitch)
Egyptian the frames (fresh as a bitch)

Your boy pussy, the nigga a snitch
Go dump on him and then fuck his bitch
High-tier Alessandro Dell'acqua, but these shades not Prada
Nigga come between me and my dollars, it's gon' be problems
Dsquared on me, I'm fresh as a bitch
Invested a whole brick just on my wrist
Lil' mama she falling in love, but you see my heart, ain't no more love left in this bitch
I'm smelling myself, I think I'm the shit, matter fact, I know I am
Every baddie know me for a scrap for 150 grams
Pouring up with Guwop, counting up with Longway
Nigga this shit ain't nothing to us, nigga we can do this all day
Smoking Skywalker and it's loud as a bitch
That shit that you're smoking is mild as a bitch
It's Dolph a.k.a. Dolph compared to my nigga, 
You might also like
Fresh as a bitch in my Louboutin kicks
Pucci my glasses, Gucci my khakis
Fuck a nigga mean, I never be tacky
Bvlgari Goku, Rari I be smashin'
Designer state in the latest fashion
Nicki Minaj, ass, smashin'
Tarzan Giuseppe Zanotti, the molly I pop it
I boot up on molly and take on Iraq
I cover my body with burning karate
I told him exclusive, a zip in my pocket
I met him on reefer, I pull out my socket
(Blood on the bottom, I caught me a body
Went to the mall and I bought me an Audi
These are Versace, and those are Huaraches
Michaels Kors button down minus the tie, the shoes I got on me they cost me a 9)

My whole crew dressed to kill, we be dead fresh
Trend setter, another trend set
Best dressed, best dressed, yeah, we best dressed
Best dressed, well dressed, wish they well dressed
My whole crew dressed to kill, we be dead fresh
Like a walking dead man, yeah, we dead fresh
So fresh, too fresh, so well dressed
He be dead fresh, she be dead fresh3Embed
