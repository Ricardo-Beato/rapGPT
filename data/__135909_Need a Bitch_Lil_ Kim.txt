6 ContributorsNeed a Bitch Lyrics
Who the flyest bitch in the game? (Lil' Kim)
Who be the baddest bitch alive? (Lil' Kim)
Who the sexiest chick around? (Lil' Kim)
What gangsta bitch you know ride? (Queen Bee, Lil' Kim)
This for my pimps and my hoes
Bang this in your Maybach, Bentley or the Rolls
I asked my nigga Nate Dogg
Outta all the ladies, why he chose the Queen Bee
And this is what he said y'all

I need me a bitch, with some big old thighs
I need me a fine ass motherfucking bitch, with some pretty ass eyes
I need me a bitch, like I need some cash
I need me a bitch, so I can floss that ho, and make my ex mad
I need me a bitch, ain't no need to lie
I need me a bitch, so when I do some dirt, she be my alibi
I need me a bitch, like a need a 6-4
I need me a bitch, that'll shine my rims up and open my door
I need me a bitch, who is all of that
'Cause I'm a fly ass motherfucking nigga who was born to mack
I need me a bitch, like never before
I need me a bitch, and I couldn't care less if the bitch is yours
I need me a bitch
You might also like
All eyes on the Queen, when I'm walking past
I'm in the Fendi mini-skirt, shakin' my ass
It's slow motion for ya, slow motion for ya
I'm working that back daddy, how you like that daddy?
Honey girl Lil' Kim with the mack Nate Dogg
Reppin 3-1-0 to the 7-1-8 y'all
Love to have a Queen on your arm if you could
Take them wings off the Bentley, and put me on the hood
Oh, I'm what niggas want, I got what niggas need
I keep my coochi in Gucci, and you best believe
Get it on anywhere, no matter I'm looking
Sophisticated, I'm sexual so

I need me a trick, that's filthy rich
I need me a fine ass motherfucking nigga with a big ass --
'Cause I'm that (bitch)

I--- I need me a bitch
I--- I need me a bitch, who ain't hard to please
I need me a fine ass motherfucking bitch with some scarred up knees
I need me a bitch, who ain't scared to flirt
I need me a bitch, in the middle of the grocery store, she'll lift up her skirt
I need me a bitch, like I need my crew
I need me a bitch, a bitch to pass on to my boys soon as I get through
I need me a bitch, this I can't deny (I can't deny)
I need me a bitch, I love when she wildin' out, 'cause she still look fine
I need me a bitch, and a Coupe de Ville
I need me a bitch, a car with a big back seat, so I can make her squeal
I need me a bitch, like a need a drink
Who can hold her breath real good, it's either swim or sink
Bitch
I--- need a bitch
I--- need a bitch
I--- need a bitch1Embed
