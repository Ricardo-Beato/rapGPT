10 ContributorsComing Back Lyrics
Yeah yeah
Just know that my time I'm taking it
For the right time I'm waiting
So gone
Jump bad if you want to, get mad if you want to
Gone
Show your ass if you want to, but I'mma blast when I want to
Dre coming, bow down, no options
Big money off and them is no problem
Hard times, niggas out just starving
With no blow, broke niggas get started dog
Niggas plotting trying to rob, don't dodge it naw
Listen closely and I'mma tell you how to solve them y'all
Get your fifty-thousand dollars fly them AUGs in
Pass them choppers out and see what you niggas rob then
Just let them follow you, like they going to try and do
But bet their brilliant ass don't know their being followed to
Going about your business man
Now all you got to do is introduce the robbing crew to who you gave them choppers to
Then watch tomorrow's news, you'll see a car dude, shot down, laid out, look like the car that was trying to follow you
Somehow the follower became the follwee
Man Iâ€™m a shark, think a guppy finna swallow me?
Out his motherfucking mind niggas got to be
You follow me I'mma blast with no apologyYou might also likeEmbed
