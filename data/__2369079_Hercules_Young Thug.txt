Thugger
The Thugger, baby, yeah
(Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro)
Metro! Hee
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
And what?
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Shit, shoot him in his back like Ricky but not Slick
Spent like seven bands on a tri-color pit
All my signs red like a stop, nigga, no pit
I’m on the purple, nigga, high like fuckin' Martians, woah
In a foreign yesterday, I was just walkin', woah
Left my baby mama, now my bitch a Barbie, woah
All-red Dickies suit, I'm ridin' down Slauson, woah (skrt)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hercu-Hercules (whoa, yeah, yeah, hey, hey)
Hercu-Hercules (heeh, heeh, yay, heeh, heeh)
Hercu-Hercules (ooh, yah, yaaaaah, yeah, yeah)
Hercu-Hercules (I got, I got, I got lean)

I smoke gas, that's that Hercules (strong marijuana)
She looked at him, oh, now she watchin' me (Bitch likes my persona)
Bitch, I'm speedin' to that guapanese (skrrt)
Old Chevy mounted up, I can't forget the T
Drop the top, shoot birds at the officers (fuck 'em)
Fuck them boys, they costin' us, they stalkin' us
They know they old lady not runnin', they fall for us
We so tired of takin' losses, ain't no more chalkin' us, I promise
YSL on ape and they donkeys
These niggas pointless, they want me wanted
I'm still a stoner, MAC and cheese on me
These niggas clonin', I'm full but I'm still hungry
Hey when the click clock, I'll make your bitch stop
Ice inside my tick tock, boss cookies, no brisco
I just bought a Cuban link, flooded with big rocks
Snitches tryna juug at me, I gotta dead sum
Whoa, shit
You might also like
Shit, shoot him in his back like Ricky but not Slick
Spent like seven bands on a tri-color pit
All my signs red like a stop, nigga, no pit
I’m on the purple, nigga, high like fuckin' Martians, woah
In a foreign yesterday, I was just walkin', woah
Left my baby mama, now my bitch a Barbie, woah
All-red Dickies suit, I'm ridin' down Slauson, woah (skrt)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hercu-Hercules (whoa, yeah, yeah, hey, hey)
Hercu-Hercules (heeh, heeh, yay, heeh, heeh)
Hercu-Hercules (ooh, yah, yaaaaah, yeah, yeah)
Hercu-Hercules (I got, I got, I got lean)

Okay first of all, I was doin' this shit 'fore I was rich
I don't care at all, I'll go do a dolphin for my clique
Fuck your conference call, pull up with a check and get my sig
Double D, you dig? No firework, it was lit
And then some fuck nigga was hatin' on me
They took ya life, I know some fuck niggas waitin' on it
I grab that TEC, I grab that 40 and the F&N
Then we pulled up ready to squabble, yeah we waited on 'em
Anaconda, we on that slime stuff, here to remind ya
Fucked your old lady, she want the finest
YSL, we shinin', let her stand behind us
Yeah my crew we rock, rock, baby you can climb us
I call my migo, migo come and let me juug through the city
He stuffed it with burritos and he let 'em fly right to me
Bitches call me Casino but I let 'em ride 'round the city
She want bingo, kilo, no sweat, now she can ride in the Bentley
Whoa
Shit, shoot him in his back like Ricky but not Slick
Spent like seven bands on a tri-color pit
All my signs red like a stop, nigga, no pit
I’m on the purple, nigga, high like fuckin' Martians, woah
In a foreign yesterday, I was just walkin', woah
Left my baby mama, now my bitch a Barbie, woah
All-red Dickies suit, I'm ridin' down Slauson, woah (skrt)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hercu-Hercules (whoa, yeah, yeah, hey, hey)
Hercu-Hercules (heeh, heeh, yay, heeh, heeh)
Hercu-Hercules (ooh, yah, yaaaaah, yeah, yeah)
Hercu-Hercules (I got, I got, I got lean)

Thugger Thugger said he have a brand new stick
Thugger Thugger sittin' on some fashion shit
Thugger Thugger still livin' like a boss
YSL my team, my squad
