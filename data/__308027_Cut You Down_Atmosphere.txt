3 ContributorsCut You Down Lyrics
My old lady say I'm paranoid
She thinks that I'm not on point
'cuz I pace around with no purpose
Observant, peek out the curtains
I don't recognize that car
So why's it parked right infront of my yard?
It's been there for the last few minutes
It seems too suspicious
It's gon' be another long night
So set the alarm and the motion lights
Protect my house....
That fence ain't enough to keep the riff-raff out
Somebody gon' test,
....I'm breaking out in a sweat
It make the hair on my arms stand up tall
If it's a private number I don't answer the call
I'm simple, I want some peace
From all the criminals, thugs and thieves
But I ain't tryin to involve police
'cuz I don't trust any government employees
I believe everybody's a threat
You better take it down to the next doorstep
But if you want doubt and pop some
I'm sleeping on the couch with a loaded shotgun
You might also like
And if you wanna fuck around
I'm gonna cut you down
And if you wanna fuck around
I'm gonna cut you down
And if you wanna fuck around

(Shh) I hear a helicopter
I swear it's out there
Calm down, don't make the wrong move
'cuz I don't know who that van belongs to
I'm checking over both my shoulders
I bet they got my name in they folders
I'm trying to stay inside
It's the only way to hide from satellites in the sky
Get off my property
Why you stalking me?
Those guys from across the street
Better keep their eyes off my wife piece
None of y'all watching birds
So who's in the alley with binoculars?
Got more detour to steer through
For the sedan in my rearview
I crouch on the floor
'cuz knocking on my door is an act of war
And if the guy from the bank
Wanna come see me, he better drive a tank
I ain't nuts yet, I'm just upset
'cuz y'all treat me like a suspect
I'm innocent, give me personal space
Before I flip the switch and turn up the bass
And if you wanna fuck around
I'm gonna cut you down
And if you wanna fuck around
I'm gonna cut you down
And if you wanna fuck aroundEmbed
