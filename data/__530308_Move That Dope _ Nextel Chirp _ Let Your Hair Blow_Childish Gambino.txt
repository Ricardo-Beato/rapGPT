Whippin' the Lam', whippin' and grippin' the Lam'
Niggas like 'Bino the man, I was  like damn
I was allergic to not makin' money, the timing was perfect
They used to not pay him no never mind
Niggas these numbers don't ever lie
Fuck wit' your boy like a pedophile
Damn I'm fly, I'm so high I might need a spaceship
I'm on acid, this bitch is basic
We them niggas y'all love to hate on
But when you see us y'all never say shit
Conversation, I'm in that, top 5, I'm in rap
Pussy niggas, y'all say shit and don't do shit
Flew your girl to Saint Lucia
Oh, these niggas are not from Atlanta
These niggas are not from Atlanta
Cause I'm from Atlanta and we would just handle it
Struggle rap, Canibus, Amethyst, my weed purple
Rap game, I'm Steve Urkel, Urquelle
She want some pics, I'm like "oh well, you better Google search"
Money rule my universe, nigga we made it
We had the beat and then we heard the verse
And said "nigga we hate it"
Livin' my life like I'm Jaden (Smith), Tesla the color of Satan (whip)
Bitches are mine for the takin', I understand why you hate us

Smokin' on that loud, what you smellin'?
Cops want a nigga for the sport
Hundred dollars, can't afford it
Made my momma cry in court, fuck them niggas

Patience, congratulations, I'm on my A shit
I met this dude while on vacation, I didn't say shit
When he was talkin' all that bullshit about the nation
His daughter, I just gave a facial, my reparations
Uh, it's a new black renaissance
Uh, all that wack shit they be on
Uh, what's the type of shit that they be on
Uh, what's the type of shit that they be on
Part III: "Let Your Hair Blow" (feat. Young Scooter)

Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
You got a perfect body, all natural
Body that the superstar lookin' for
Hey baby, let's just go for a ride, okay

Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
You got a perfect body, all natural
Body that the superstar lookin' for
Let's ride and let the top down
Let your hair blow, ride and smoke out
We party on the Interstate, shut I-20 down
Even in the winter flexin' with the top down
Top down, let 'em see a king
East side, East side, I'm just bein' me
I'm just seein' Gs, I'm just makin' culture
I just say the realest shit and hope it don't insult you
On stage, yellin' crazy shit
I was high but I meant that shit
Let it out, gotta vent that shit
Play me loud, that's event music
I don't swear to God, I just swear to me
I don't think there's anything I couldn't be
All we know is trust, that's the royalty
Please don't ask a king what it's hard to be

Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
You got a perfect body, all natural
Body that the superstar lookin' for
Let's ride and let the top down
Let your hair blow, ride and smoke out
We party on the Interstate, shut I-20 down
Even in the winter flexin' with the top down17Embed
