25 ContributorsEnemies With Me Lyrics
Young Thugs in this motherfucker
Don't break up the fight, let 'em rumble
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me

Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what's necessary
Niggas wanna see me buried
Worried, if you comin' hurried
I ain't goin' down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothin' stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealin' to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And puttin' money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigga I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the Lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thuggin'
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free
This picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, Don't let 'em change
That's what they keep on tellin' me, motherfuck the fame
I can't sleep 'cause I keep hearin' peeps
Loaded Mossberg wrapped in my sheets
You might also like
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You rather fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me, nigga
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You rather fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me

The game is gettin' deeper with this I couldn't stop, I'm reminiscin'
And havin' flashbacks when them niggas came up missin'
Wish in my heart, these niggas they ain't have to start
Now therefore they gotta see in dark
Played the part with heart when we spark they part
Runnin' silly through the court, they don't really wanna start
How you wanna do?, yo K, anyway
These motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
So I stay, sippin' on my aray to keep my head fine
And I'm where, Everywhere from here to bedtime (yeah nigga)
And I squeeze when I say I'm comin'
Straight gunnin' on enemies if it's really me that they wantin'
'Cause it ain't nothin', y'all niggas is frontin'
Do you really want it? niggas dyin'...
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You rather fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You rather fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me

Now, we're in '94, Niggas get bust through the do'
 in a flash sittin' on that ass And rarely fold
Galitter tell 'em 'bout that trife shit You wanna fight?
I wanna light shit, you lose your life bitch (bee-yatch!)
A nigga struggle too hard for what I got
Hustle And doubled every fuckin' yard that I cop and stop
Hell nah! I couldn't see it
Facin' a century in the Penitentiary but so be it
And Jesus couldn't help me out the state
Prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate
But wait No time for stallin' But death is callin'
You wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start fallin'
True, what I do from sun up is for a come up
Wake up with my gun up 'Cause when I sneak that's when they run up
So It's time to spray like Ray
And put the freeze on these fake G's You know how we do
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You rather fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me, nigga
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You rather fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me
