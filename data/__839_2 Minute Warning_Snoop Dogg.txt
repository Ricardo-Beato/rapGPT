16 Contributors2 Minute Warning Lyrics
Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway, read over the dire
Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away cause I got priors
It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset
Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet
Think shit over? Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-see y'all prayin that a G fall
Tonight it's goin down like free fall
Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see-saw
Trippin off hate, no Hee-Haw
All blacks locs on the loc actin like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you be like "What you mean Dogg?"
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like a M&M
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem
So fuck you, him, and him
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in
No facade, I went from the yard
To a three-car garage to, instant menage it's
Vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless
And thats what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded
Nigga! So buzz on that shit
Backflip back to plaque shit
Blue red white to black shit, but for the green
I send a whole motherfuckin team to clap shit
React to mack shit, problem, terrorist
Fuck this rap shit!
