8 ContributorsStruggles Lyrics
Is it cash what I need?
Push, push
Is it gas what I need?

It's that cash that I need
It's that gas that I need
It's that smash and that weed
It'll be there for me
'Cause I keep pushin' babe
I keep pushin' babe
It's that cash that I need
It's that gas that I need
It's that smash and that weed
It'll be there for me
'Cause I keep pushin' babe
I keep pushin' babe
'Cause I keep pushin' babe
I keep pushin' babe
I keep....

So long, so long, so long
Pluton, pluton, pluton
Spit on it, spit on it, get on it
Villains, dealin, spillin'
Throwin' the key to the ceilin'
This is one hell of a feelin'
They told me I couldn't conquer this, so I had went ahead and bought the building
Pinky on blast, yeah
Flawless my glass, yeah
(I keep) stomp on the gas, yeah
Love is a task, yeah (it's that)
Bitches come last, yeah
When the money come fast, yeah
(I keep) a whole lotta splash
Hold it down if you bad, yeah
(Pushin' babe, it's that...)
