28 ContributorsNathan Lyrics
What up, what up?
Do you motherfuckers wanna gamble with your luck?
Better roll four, five, six, then up and up
I'ma roll headcrack trips, you got the nuts?
I'ma call your bluff like Nynex
Small talks never turn to big bucks fine man
Fuck outta here nigga, where the fuck you find them?
Smoke him like a ciga
Do ya nigga have to bust this nigga?
I don't wanna slump this nigga
I don't wanna dump this nigga
I don't wanna lunch this nigga
I don't wanna hit your little goon in the chest and the stomach
Dutch gut this nigga, you don’t really want this nigga

Y'all niggas stay hatin'
Y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Y'all niggas don't want no drama
Y'all niggas don't want no problems
Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas
None of y'all want it, y'all stay talkin' that shit
Y'all hatin', y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Y'all niggas stay hatin'
Y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Y'all niggas don't want no drama
Y'all niggas don't want no problems
Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas
None of y'all want it, y'all stay talkin' that shit
Y'all hatin', y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
You might also like
Y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Fuck is y'all anticipating?
Y'all gon' make me just lose my patience
Grab a gun and just strip you naked
No Kony, no island
Phony nigga, you was never wildin'
Warrior nigga, I'm forever styling
No trying, four-five 'em
We fifty-fouth, I nine 'em
Two guns up, and I'm ridin'
You ain't looking for me, I ain't hiding
Ain’t the park nigga, no sliding
You could see-saw, see a sawed-off
Or C4, blow the door off
“Bom! Pow!" Nigga Batman words
"Where the juice?" Nigga gat man words
"Where's the bread?" Nigga fat man words
"Where's the block?" Nigga crack man words
Y'all niggas, y'all niggas can't fuck with my niggas
That's my word
Yeah, it's Ghost and Azealia Banks
Go 'head nigga, you can feel that shank
Go 'head nigga, just light your dank
Mind your business and drink your drink
Yeah
Y'all niggas stay hatin'
Y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Y'all niggas don't want no drama
Y'all niggas don't want no problems
Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas
None of y'all want it, y'all stay talkin' that shit
Y'all hatin', y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Y'all niggas stay hatin'
Y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Y'all niggas don't want no drama
Y'all niggas don't want no problems
Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas
None of y'all want it, y'all stay talkin' that shit
Y'all hatin', y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan

Catch up, I’m hot dog
Frankfurters, you’re Nathan but relish hatin'
Trust me, I pop off ain’t one of y'all
None of ya’ll gonna make it
Spread you like mustard, don’t trust em
Burn 'em, boil 'em, grill 'em, bake 'em'
Nada, no problem, zero, zilch 'em, vacant
It’s nothing - Nathan
Back to the basics, poppin' Aces
Poker face, I’ll pop your face in
You already know I got this blazin'
Back up with that cocky statement
Don’t make me have to cock my favorite
How you want it, roof or basement?
Bird's eye view or bottom lake it
How 'bout some hog, come strip you naked
Stripped 'em naked, stripped the bacon
Left this muthafucka with his pistol shakin'
Niggas racy like eight Jamaicans
Bust your nigga grape then I scraped his raisin
Kept my cool then I held my patience
I bet your boy become a trauma patient
I bet your boy ease up the combination
If you ain’t talking money skip the conversation
Y'all niggas stay hatin'
Y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Y'all niggas don't want no drama
Y'all niggas don't want no problems
Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas
None of y'all want it, y'all stay talkin' that shit
Y'all hatin', y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Y'all niggas stay hatin'
Y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan
Y'all niggas don't want no drama
Y'all niggas don't want no problems
Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas
None of y'all want it, y'all stay talkin' that shit
Y'all hatin', y'all niggas ain't gettin' Nathan7Embed
