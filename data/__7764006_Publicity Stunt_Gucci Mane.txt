1017 (Blrrrd)

He tryna pull a publicity stunt (Damn)
These rappers be pussy, they bleed once a month
Don't speak on my name, don't get put in a blunt
You can diss all you want, still won't get a response (Nah)
It's still free the gang 'til they get out the joint (Slam)
Stop beatin' 'round the bush and just get to the point (Slam)
You wanna be me, I know what you want
But you ain't gotta pull no publicity stunt (Nah)
Live by the gun then you die by the gun (Baow)
Ain't gotta cap 'bout the shit that I done
My nigga got bond and he went on the run (Go)
Got my roof in the trunk and my trunk in the front (Dump)
Droppin' the ceilin', I'm thinkin' of Dolph (Dolph)
Kill for a livin' and murder for fun (Graow)
We ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt (No)
Nah, we ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt (Go)

Why you diss me for publicity nigga? (Huh?)
Is you in the streets or a industry nigga? (Well damn)
Is you my fan or my enemy, nigga?
My money too grown to be kiddin' with niggas (It's long)
I beat it with niggas, play tunk on the bunk
One nigga didn't pay, he got stabbed and runned up (Huh, uh)
Say he my opp but try dappin' me up (Graow)
Give a round of applause 'cause we clappin' him up (Clap)
Trappers "R" Us, come in traffic with us
Gon' finesse on your bitch, spend her taxes with us (Mwah)
Say we the reason the prices went up
I ran off on the plug and I doubled it up (Ew)
These old niggas just don't know when to shut up (Shh)
Better call yourself lucky if you walk on a crutch
I got long arms, I can reach out and touch you
We got the same guns they send off to Russia
Ain't no disputin', I kill like I'm Putin
Got a truck full of shooters, I move like I'm Trump
Soldiers stand guard for me like I'm Obama
Try go get some gas and got killed at the pump
Say you got hits, but, look, you in a slump
Say that you rich but you live in a dump
My jit go retarded, a switch on the pump (Yeah)
Tell him shoot when he open, he say he wanna dunk (Shoot, baow)
You might also like
He tryna pull a publicity stunt (Damn)
These rappers be pussy, they bleed once a month (Yeah)
Don't speak on my name, don't get put in a blunt (Shh)
You can diss all you want, still won't get a response (Ha)
It's still free the gang 'til they get out the joint (Slam)
Stop beatin' 'round the bush and just get to the point (Slam)
You wanna be me, I know what you want (I know)
But you ain't gotta pull no publicity stunt (No)
Live by the gun then you die by the gun (Graow)
Ain't gotta cap 'bout the shit that I done (No)
My nigga got bond and he went on the run (Go, go, go, go)
Got my roof in the trunk and my trunk in the front (Trunk)
Droppin' the ceilin', I'm thinkin' of Dolph (Dolph)
Kill for a livin' and murder for fun
We ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt (Nah)
Nah, we ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt (Go)

It's free Pooh and Foo 'til it's backwards, you bastards (Foo)
"Why you sign goons?" I don't fuck with these rappers (Foo)
Claim that they real, but they know they some cappers
I take a trapper and I make 'em go platinum (Platinum)
Fuck makin' excuses, I'm makin' it happen
I put that shit on, itâ€™s spectacular fashion (I do)
Trick on the bitch like I'm Robert Kardashian (I do)
Makin' more money than you can imagine (I will)
When you caught lackin', that's when they attackin'
Thought I was splurgin', didn't know I was stackin' (Didn't know)
White and gold jewelry, they said I was tacky (Brr)
She gave me head and I gave her a rack (Woo)
It came out his mouth, now he can't take it back
Watch what you say, who you callin' a rat (Rat)
These niggas spread gossip then call it a fact
'Fore we give a statement, we'll lay on the mat (Wow)
Free all the soldiers who never roll over
Who fight for their life, gotta sleep with a knife
Dawg went to trial and they gave him a life
But he won his appeal, now he covered in ice (Brr)
Young nigga mixin' codeine with the Sprite (Lean)
He gon' bust you on site and get three hundred likes (Graow)
Shouts to Adidas, he steppin' for stripes
And give back to the hood, I bought three hundred bikes (It's Gucci)
He tryna pull a publicity stunt (Stunt)
These rappers be pussy, they bleed once a month (Damn)
Don't speak on my name, don't get put in a blunt (Shh)
You can diss all you want, still won't get a response (Huh)
It's still free the gang 'til they get out the joint (Slam)
Stop beatin' 'round the bush and just get to the point (Slam)
You wanna be me, I know what you want (I know)
But you ain't gotta pull no publicity stunt (Damn)
Live by the gun then you die by the gun
Ain't gotta cap 'bout the shit that I done
My nigga got bond and he went on the run (Pew)
Got my roof in the trunk and my trunk in the front (Dump)
Droppin' the ceilin', I'm thinkin' of Dolph (Dolph)
Kill for a livin' and murder for fun (Fun)
We ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt
Nah, we ain't 'bout to pull no publicity stunt

(I thought you felt like Gucci Mane in 2006)
(I thought you felt like Gucci Mane in 2006)
(I thought you felt like Gucci Mane in 2006)
