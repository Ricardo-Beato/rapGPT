16 ContributorsFair Lyrics
Big bear
Big bear roarin'
DP on the beat
Ayy

I'm the youngest flexer I know, it ain't fair
Pull up in that motherfuckin' big bear
I'm the youngest flexer I know, it ain't fair
Where I'm from, ain't shit fair
Young nigga snatchin' phones just to get fed
Run up in a nigga home just to get him
And they'll drive a steamer just to get there
'Cause they thought they had a lick on Big Fair

Remember runnin' in bitches' cribs and niggas' cribs
Takin' TV's and everything we see
DVD's and every DVD, ayy
CD players and every CD, ayy
Might find some cash, just might find a heat
We splittin' if you went in with me
My baby mama from Tennessee
I got some shooters in Tennessee
And they gon' shoot you in your teeth
Run up on you for ten of them keys
Ten of them P's
You might also like
I'm the youngest flexer I know, it ain't fair
Pull up in that motherfuckin' big bear
I'm the youngest flexer I know, it ain't fair
Where I'm from, ain't shit fair
Young nigga snatchin' phones just to get fed
Run up in a nigga home just to get him
And they'll drive a steamer just to get there
'Cause they thought they had a lick on Big Fair

I come from Parkway Gardens
It's O-Block now
Front Street shit
Bitch, I'm from Front Street, bitch
061, we out totin' and I'm holdin' one
Come through, we love blowin' guns
Blowin' guns, just for fun
On 061, got some shooters on 061
And they'll do you on 061
Off the counter on 061

I'm the youngest flexer I know, it ain't fair
Pull up in that motherfuckin' big bear
I'm the youngest flexer I know, it ain't fair
Where I'm from, ain't shit fair
Young nigga snatchin' phones just to get fed
Run up in a nigga home just to get him
And they'll drive a steamer just to get there
'Cause they thought they had a lick on Big Fair1Embed
