16 ContributorsSo Cal Lyrics
I can't put the pole down
Babygirl, you know now
Your boyfriend want that smoke, how?
He ain't got no style
I can't put the bankroll down
Babygirl, you really know how
To make a nigga go "wow"
I'm living out in So Cal

I ride a Lamb like a Kawasaki
I take a shot, who is there to block me?
I'm smoking dope, and you can never stop me
I give her D, and she can never rock me
Spanish mami, and she call me Papi
She said she like it when I pull up in that Rari
She say out loud "I know I'm full of shit, I'm sorry"
I'm out here fucking every bitch in every party

I can't put the pole down
Babygirl, you know now
Your boyfriend want that smoke, how?
He ain't got no style
I can't put the bankroll down
Babygirl, you really know how
To make a nigga go "wow"
I'm living out in So Cal
You might also like
That beauty like a monster
She like this Willy Wonka
I know she really really want ya
Let a nigga hug her
I might fuck around and dump her
She get hotter than a summer
She get wetter than a public pool
She told me she don't even really fuck with you
I got on my Tony Montana suit
'Cause I'm getting that Tony Montana loot
Ridin' the city in a Tony Montana coupe
In a suite with a bad bitch from Santa Cruz

I can't put the pole down
Babygirl, you know now
Your boyfriend want that smoke, how?
He ain't got no style
I can't put the bankroll down
Babygirl, you really know how
To make a nigga go "wow"
I'm living out in So Cal1Embed
