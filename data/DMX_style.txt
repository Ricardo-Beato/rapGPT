Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes

What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom, not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that four-four
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me, bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make a move, got a point to prove
Gotta make 'em groove, got 'em all like, "Ooh"
So 'til the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop

Fed a nigga some bullshit , and I took it
That's what I get, an old school fucking with a hybrid

With this fo'-pound, I bust mo' rounds then a circle
The nigga that tried is the same nigga that fried
So he'll never rest in peace cause of the way that he died

Like I shoulda did your peoples before they could conceive you
How's a buck-fifty sound, for a quick ass cut?
I'll have a flashback, I fuckin blow your bitch-ass up
And it's no problem, handlin a nigga with a death wish
Leave him breathless, and hit his wife with a dead fish

Same old shit, dog, just a different day
It is not a fuckin' game (You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play)
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
If it's fuck me, nigga, you know it's fuck you

I kick it to shorty to try to help him understand (Uh)
Hit him with work, 'cause yo, that's my little man (Uh-huh)
He asked a few questions 'bout the game and I told him (Yeah)
So when he made a bad move, it was my place to scold him (A'ight)
Never told him nothin' wrong, kept it fair
Didn't listen, so I might as well have been talkin' to the air (Damn)
Everybody makes mistakes, a mistake is a'ight
But if it ain't, I'ma tell you straight, time to say goodnight
Nobody likes to be played, regardless of the relationship
But shorty's fuckin' up big time, I hate this shit
I'm caught in the middle of havin' love for a lil nigga
And knowin' what's expected of me as a real nigga (Damn)
My next move is crucial, what do I do?
How do I keep it real with shorty and my crew?
Didn't wanna kill him, so instead of puttin' the MAC on him
I did the only thing I could do, turn my back on him

Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you

Niggas that I fuck with wanna get him dead
But I'm cool with shorty's peoples, so I let him live
Under normal circumstances, he would be a marked man
But I hit him with a grand, just didn't shake his hand (Ooh)
Go about your business (Uh-huh), do what you gon' do (Uh)
Be what you gon' be, I wash my hands, I'm through (A'ight)
I can forgive, I just can't forget
You're on your own, little man, don't ask me for shit (No)
If you paid attention to what I taught you, then you good (Uh)
If I see you again, get it, understood?
Go 'head before I change my mind 'cause you know you should be dead
"I just wanted to say—," ah, go ahead
Instinct told me to kill him, but the savior is
I'm a good nigga, plus I owed his peeps a favor (Mmm)
But I also knew the decision I just made (Yeah)
Went against the rules of the game that we play (Damn)

Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do

So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you
I should've followed my first instinct 'cause I knew (Right)
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do (True)
Now this nigga's fuckin' with the competition (What)
Ungrateful motherfucker, should've got him missin' (What)
This nigga got the nerve to take my kindness for a weakness
Gots to get back on some street shit so I can creep this
Rat, when I act, take one, set him up
Take two, get him there, take three, get him done
Wasn't hard for me to get him where I wanted him, confronted him
Bzzt, click, there was a bullet in one of them
Feelin' lucky? Click, looks like you are
Click-click-click, luck ain't goin' too far (Uh)
What you did was put on another pair of shoes
And they just happened to be too big
What you did was stupid (Damn), real fuckin' stupid (A'ight)
Well, shorty, I gave you a chance and what did you do?
Threw it back in my fuckin' face, so fuck you too (A'ight)

Here we go again

What good is it for a man to gain the world
Yet lose his own soul in the process?
God loves you, yes he does, said you're alright with him
I wonder…

I know you've never seen him, but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him, but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

I'm callin' out to you, Lord, because I need your help
See, once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself
Behavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it
But every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it
Losin' friends day by day
I'm in so much pain when I'm here, Lord, please take me away!
I put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done
To live is to suffer, but you're still my son
And there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars
But there won't be a his or hers, just ours
Then you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you all these years
Do the right thing, 'cause after the tears come the cheers
I will, my Lord, with my heart and my soul
That's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold
Lead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow
I'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow

You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

I want you to know, Lord, that for what you given me I'm thankful
Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful
You gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak
And that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach
Can't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much
I reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch
But deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against
Everything I know is right, what I know makes sense
That's when you must fight harder than you've ever fought before
'Cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war
Between good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you
They smile but are not really happy when they see you
Be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
'Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die
Listen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you
If you want me to help, what do you want for yourself?
I know you've never seen him, but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him, but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

My Lord, my savior, don't judge my behavior, but instead
Take what's in my heart and put it in my head
See, I guess I really never knew how proud I made you
My life is yours, my soul I gave you
I don't know if I'll do good enough (He's by your side)
And we both know the hood is rough (Right by your side)
Sometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes!)
But I know what I gotta do (It'll be alright)
You keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song
Talk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong
This is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it
Praises to you, my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it
I was that kid that, been there, did that
Became ashamed so I hid that, but ain't no longer with that
Use me as an example—if I can do it, then they can too
With the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do
I know you've never seen him, but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him (The light with him)
'Cause you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him, but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
Uhh, you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)
I said you're alright with him

He's by your side
Right by your side
X, dry your eyes!
'Cause it'll be alright
Yeah, he's by your side
Right by your side
X, dry your eyes!
'Cause, it's gonna be alright
Yeah yeah, yes it is!56Embed

I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street
'Til I knock off this rock, I don't get to eat
Sometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle
Step on toes, strong-arm and show a lil' muscle
Ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated
I hate it, seein' crab niggas that made it
And I'm robbin' cats just as broke as myself
Livin' foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth?
It ain't in New York, 'cause niggas talk about goin' out of state
Money got an eighth, comin' back hot with a lot of weight
Where's my plate, nigga? I'm hungry too
So I'ma do like hungry do and get a hungry crew
Niggas that ain't never had, and doin bad
Will be glad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad
Grab your bags, it's about to go down

We comin' through, so make some room
Found somethin' that could be somethin' if I pump it up
This kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up
The purple top thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells
But I'ma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
I send two niggas back up top, and come back
We chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop
It's four in the morning, we on the block creepin'
Killin' the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin'
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler
'Cause, nigga, if I ain't know you since I was like six
Then I don't trust ya
And we'll bust ya over somethin petty like two dollars
Put somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (Ah)
You think I'm here for the ho flow? I want the dough flow
And fuck the po-po, nigga keep a .44

I spend my money on niggas, 'cause niggas get me rich
And a bitch ain't doin' shit but suckin' my dick
Niggas is family now, and we stand strong
Thirty niggas over six blocks, makin' the cash long
Shit is good, because niggas gettin' what they been wantin'
And we see the same shit, other New York niggas frontin'
Stick up kids huntin', but I ain't got no love for 'em
I keep the burner and the duster with the glove for 'em
Them motherfuckin' knockers come at us and chop us
And I know they really tryin' to stop us and wanna drop us
So we pump from the alley, and the last house we use as a cash house
It's holdin' 'em strong, it's a stash house
I got runners that work for twelve hour shifts
And when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff
But I ain't tryin to hear that nigga took your pack shit
Ain't tryin to hear jack shit, you fucking black bitch
I ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run
If I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun
Got bitches to transport without an escort
I'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport
Local police ain't a problem, 'cause they don't even stress us
It be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure
Just so you know, ain't gon' never put my Glock down (Why, nigga?)
'Cause I'm a hustlin' motherfucker, and I'm holdin' my block down
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

Lord Jesus, it is You who wakes me up every day
And I am forever grateful for Your love, this is why I pray
You let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good
I influenced so many children, I never thought that I would
And I couldn't take credit for the love they get
Because it all comes from You, Lord, I'm just the one that's givin' it
And when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much
I take time out and pray, and ask that You be my crutch
Lord, I am not perfect by a longshot, I confess to you daily
But I work harder everyday, and I hope that You hear me
In my heart, I mean well, but if You'll help me to grow
Then what I have in my heart, will begin to show
And when I get goin', I'm not lookin' back for nothin'
'Cause I will know where I'm headed, and I'm so tired of the sufferin'
I stand before You, a weakened version of Your reflection
Beggin' for direction, for my soul needs resurrection
I don't deserve what You've given me, but You never took it from me
Because I am grateful and I use it, and I do not worship money
If what you want from me is to bring Your children to you
My regret is only havin' one life to do it, instead of two

Uh-huh (Y'KNOW?)

ARF!
Uhh..

Take it for what it's worth, my birth was a blessing
Sent to live and die, on earth as a lesson
We each have a star, all we have to do is find it
Once you do, everyone who sees it will be blinded (WHAT?)
They'll tell you that you're bright, and say you have a future
When you turn your back, same cats'll try to shoot ya
Niggas ain't shit, I can live on both sides of the fence
Forget what you do, when you talk, see what you really meant (aight?)
That's what I thought, them niggas was bluffin (uh)
They talk all day but say, nothin (uh)
It gets so dark (what?) the pain's so intense
Since this first rained it's like it's reigned ever since (WHAT?)
Never got paid for a rhyme but I flow (whoo)
Never got a plate on time but I grow (whoo)
Nigga life STAY on the line but I go (UHH)
Went from doin crime to bein kind cause I know

I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie

What is about who I am that makes me unforgettable (HMM)
What it is about what I've done that makes it so incredible (uhh)
"More money, more problems" -- well the fame was worse (uh-huh)
I reached out for love and what came back was thirst (WHAT?)
Blessed with the curse (uh) niggas don't hear me
Niggas don't hear me, Y'ALL NIGGAZ, don't hear me (uh)
What'd I just say? "Niggas don't hear you!" See that?
You gots to FEEL ME to catch what I'm sayin, BELIEVE THAT (UHH!)
But leave that, alone (WHAT?)
We gon' make a nigga wanna be at, your home (WHAT?)
Oh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome (UHH!)
If the dog got it he's gonna bring back a bone
Cause we got the chrome (C'MON!)
This is what I live for, or die for
I'm the nigga with the high score, you try for
What you niggas wanna lie for? It changes nothin
I'm the truth for cats, it's some strangers bluffin

I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie

Now if I take what he gave me and I, use it right (uh-huh)
In other words if I listen and, use the light (uh-huh)
Then what I say will remain here, after I'm gone
Still here, on the strength of a song, I live on (HMM)
No second-guessin on what I stood for, I was good for
Stoppin niggas from killin each other in the hood war (UHH)
Comin through showin love, throwin up (UHH)
Them cats not throwin love, you know whassup (WHAT?)
Dark Man baby, that's my name
And I gots to be the realest nigga (UHH) up in this game
Cause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more
Real to the core, big heart but built for war
I stand for what I believe in
Even if what I believe in stops me from breathin
Relatives grievin, but I ain't went nowhere
Listen to the song (C'MON) I'm right there
I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry

Ride or die
Get at these niggas dog
Yup, yup, yup
I don't really trust humans that much these days
Shit, fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans
Shit, nothin' like that dog love I tell ya
Not just any dog, it's gotta be a pit bull
Yup, that's the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
It's all on how you take it

Nothin' goes down I don't get a small piece of
Get the picture, see the beauty in the beast of
The mad man, Mr. bad man is here
'Cause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air
It just ain't fair, the shit that I be doin' to niggas
And get away with the same shit, ruinin' niggas
Cover all ground and I roll thick like the fog
Only mothafuckin' friend I ever had was a dog
Never ate the hog but glad to say I smoked plenty of 'em
The 5th Precinct to name one of many of 'em
In one verse I beat you worse than your momma
I fuck around and eat you first like Dahmer's
I'ma, play that ass out like a bomber
Killed a nigga once for lookin' like he wanted drama
I'm buggin', the pain it hurts I gotta scream
AHHHHH! Lettin' off a little steam
Society was just too much, couldn't hack it
Six mothafuckin' years in a straight jacket
Yo black it wasn't wise for them to let me out the joint
I never really got better, so I'm not on point
I just might flip, quick, but it's too late to be bitchin'
Got more loose screws than the table in your kitchen
I'm itchin', just hope you ain't around when I scratch
'Cause like I said before, I eats what I catch
Searchin' shit will have a nigga hurt and sick
The dirt you kick will get you in the dirt and quick
Word to Miz, you niggas is kids, don't play
I'm too old for the jokes you'll get smoked, I don't play
I'm won't say what's gon' happen if you force my hand
Someone somewhere will be like, "Lost my man"
Take it to heart, it's about to get dark so run that
All that shit niggas talkin' been there, done that
What black? Think it's an act? Then let me know
But he liked what I'm sayin' so shut the fuck up and let me flow
Yo you think it's a game? Keep playin'
They gon' find your ass somewhere in a creek layin'
It's over you just ain't laid down yet
And in a minute you gon' be that mothafucka that they ain't found yet
Hold off from makin' movies and make moves
Stop talkin' about shit that you can't prove
I'm the mountain you can't move, so why you tryin'
Lookin' at me stupid wonderin' why you dyin'
While you flyin' through the air with a big ass hole in your chest
Wishin' you was holdin' a vest
But it's too late for wishin', so you gettin' this rest
Go to sleep, Papa will take care of the stress
God bless and may He have mercy on your soul

Bitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck
If I ain't gettin proper respect
I don't care if you rap, I still spit in your grill
I don't give a fuck, never have, never will
If it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin to die
I ain't tryin to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky
Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time
My niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes
Hundred or more, in front of the store, waitin to bubble
Brand new nine, and an eight in a bubble
I put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set
Niggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh)
Cause the P gonna squeeze 'til no slugs is left (what)
You know I'm good with a hundred of 'dro, gun and an O
You think your shit butter? Hop in front of this toast

Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool
And I hate cops, cause most y'all was dicks in school
No pussy gettin niggas tryin to cuff the God
Play Sheek out in the yard, but that shit too hard
My dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong
What y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song
Check my car, I don't care, I don't play fair
Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew
Why I don't yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin to you
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye?
I'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die
From rappin or tellin some cat to reach for the sky
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga
Bounty hunt your whole crew til my bullets go through, WHAT?

A nice house with five rooms, maybe six
A town where money is coming, eighty bricks
Break 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip
Bet you never even felt the heat
Til I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease
Streets help niggas; niggas don't help the streets
Y'all use beats for help; we help the beats
Who want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P?
If I say so myself, it's a wonderful three
Be in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox
Same niggas that-a rob you love L.O.X. (uh)
All types of burners, even snub Glocks (uh)
Nice size tecs you could carry in your sweats (uh)
Find your man dead in the trunk of a car (uh)
It's Jada {*mwwaa*} responsible for breakin your heart (uh)
Uh

Creep through the streets
For some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard
Me the Security? Protectin my body? I let my shotty guard
Put chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol
Make niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got em noddin off
And take casket naps, fuck that
You shoulda never let this bastard rap
All I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel
No parents, tell from my horror's no morals
Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance
So you dyin? It's no problem, no lyin
Drag's fire; so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em
Drag done ate your food
Like I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up
Drag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up
Drag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well
I don't brag I let the streets tell
Po'-po' now you see he fell
 {*overlapping last line*}
Uh, uh, now you motherfuckers
Know what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh)
Y'all bitches fear it cause you weak
You wanna hear it? I make it speak (WHAT?)
You ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin (uh-huh)
What the science behind that son? (I don't know)
A lot of easy walkin
I bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh)
Ain't tryin to talk about what I got now, but I got now (WHAT?)
I ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggas up (c'mon)
And for talkin too much shit? I done fucked niggas up (uh)
It can get "Dark" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh)
Well think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that
Now don't act, cause actin might get you role you ain't ready to handle
All that's left of your memory, is a candle (WOO!)
It happens quick fast nigga, to bitch ass niggas
Talkin reckless behind your back, them kiss ass niggas (uh)
From the rap shit to the street shit, I keep shit tight
Let them cats spit that weak shit (What!)

Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna.. then I'm gonna..
'Cause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (Nigga!)

I look through the 11th floor window
Take one last puff of the indo
Look through the scope, and let like ten go
Break it down, back in the briefcase
Wipe the sweat off my face so I can leave safe
Outside I breathe safe
Nigga never saw it comin, that's how he got it
Never even thought of runnin, 'cause a nigga plotted
Smart niggas get niggas killed for real
I know, they make a deal? I'm comin with the steel
It's gon' be that cat you don't see that's gon' pop you
Stop you in your motherfuckin tracks nigga and drop you
Get rid of all the clothes (Uh-huh) dump the gun
I hate to be the type of nigga to leave you, slumped and run
But I'm on the job and right now there's more niggas that need to be, left with a head full of lead, restin' easily
And that twenty G's a fee, put to a good use
The only excuse I have for what I do is, love of abuse

Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna.. then I'm gonna..

Which they really couldn't tell apart, because of the bomb
I could be waitin, camped out in yo' car, in the backseat

Clean up the mess and, get away from the cops

Once again it's the darker nigga
Here to spark a nigga, pick apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you wanna get blessed to the chest
With slugs from the Smith & Wess', rest
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin' feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty 'cause I play dirty, the mob way
You don't know, fuck it, find out the hard way
A nigga's job is never done, I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve 'em like salt
Lock it up like a vault whenever wreck is caught
And it's my fault, keep niggas on point duckin' down
Niggas like you need to get bust, you fuckin' clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught, 'cause I creeps, nigga

I'm at the crossroads, look, but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play the low for what I did the other day?
They on their way, the flow got me strikin' this random
I can't stand 'em, fake-ass niggas wantin' to be the Phantom
Lookin' over my shoulder, 'cause it's colder than it was
Extort shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, with the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fuckin' stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon' die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit
'Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't with sellin' crack
I'd rather rob a nigga, leave him with a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the GWB
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth, bitch-ass nigga

When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I smoke 'em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke 'em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in 'em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in 'em
My M.O. is manslaughter, kid
'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, 'cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm goin' to Hell 'cause I choose to sin
All my motherfuckin' life I've been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid
But he does, and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know why I'll split your motherfuckin' brains for
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)

Father thank you for makin' me righteous and accepted through the blood of Jesus
Because of that I am blessed and highly favored by you
I am the object of your affection, your favors surround me as a shield
And the first thing that people come in contact with is my favor-shield
Thank you that I have favor with you and man today
All day long, people go out of their way to bless and to help me
I have favor with everyone that I deal with today
Doors that were once closed are now open for me
I receive preferential treatment and I have special priveledges
I am God's favorite child
No good thing will he withhold from me
Because of God's favor my enemies cannot triumph over me
I have supernatural increase in promotions
I declare restoration of everything that the devil has stolen from me
I have honor in the midst of my adversaries, and an increase of assets
Especially in real estate and an expansion of territory
Because I am highly favored by God I experience great victories
Supernatural turnarounds and miraculous breakthroughs; in the midst of great impossibilities
I receive recognition, prominence and honor
Petitions are granted to me even by ungodly authorities
Policies, rules, regulations and laws are changed and reversed on my behalf
I win battles that I don't even have to fight because God fights them for me
This is the day, the set time, the designated moment for me to experience the free favors of God
That profusely and lavishly abound on my behalf
In Jesus' mighty name we have prayed
Amen, and AmenYou might also like10Embed

Over and over I done told ya, boy
I'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, boy
And when you gon' get it in your brain?
The gate's wide open and the dogs off the chain

I be that youngin' with that gun that’s tellin' ya stop frontin'
I be that yougin' on the run after I pop somethin'
In the Bible I read death is of the tongue
And if you talk about death enough death is gon' come
Jay taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head
Randy ass was there, now he runnin' scared
Some say I'm gangsta, some say I'm crazy
If you ask me I'll say I'm what the hood made me
Now I can stunt 'til my ass dead broke like JD
Or put a hundred grand on every nigga head that play me
See I'm cool with them Haitian mob niggas
They say ''Sak pase Nap boule'' and rob niggas
The media be tryin' to make a nigga look bad, what's with that?
See my flick next to Preme, Papi and Cat
And Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar
I enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers

Knock on wood, my nigga, we both walk the dog
We ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard
But once we got through the trials it's all smiles
'Til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild
Now why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?
I'mma make you remember where you know my name from
45th Street, and blaow-blaow Ave

I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (What)
We're untouchable

Yeah, yeah, YEAH! Be strong

I represent the have and the have-nots
All the niggas with the weed spots
And all my niggas on them cell blocks
We gon' R-U-double-F R-Y-D-E
You can't fuck with my army
My niggas is untouchable, eatin' niggas like Lunchable
.45 be crushin' you when the bullets be touchin' you
Paul bearers'll carry you
To the cemetery where your momma gon' bury you
Black suit be fittin' you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin' man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees
Then it's me against the world, man against machine
S.D.T.S. - stick to my routine
My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggas who be sittin' in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..

All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane
Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggas a break, nah; I gotta chase mine
Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggas that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise
But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
Out in Cali sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas
I'm untouchable, nigga
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (What)
We're untouchable

Double R.. whoo! All day..
Yo, aiyyo X let me get 'em daddy - yo, yo, yo

U-N-T-O-U-C-H, A-B-L-E-S
Sheek the new Elliott Ness (no doubt)
Nigga, Bloodline, D-Block; two of the best
Hang the Double R chain from the side of the car
Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (Uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (Nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?
Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on
That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you
To stay in your place, so you don't get laced
And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face

I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (What)
We're untouchable

Uhh, uhh, uhh, c'mon!
You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines
I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggas is eatin, I'm splittin' the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms
Yeah, my block is real, my niggas is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin' my diamonds and changin' the color
With change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh
I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X whattup?
Me and you is untouchable (Uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable
Guns is fingerprint-proof, we "Ryde or Die"
You drivin' by, we clap at your ride, good-bye

I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable

Got me on the run
Uh, uh

"Boom, boom, boom, open the door, ATF!"
Too late to send my girl downstairs to say, "He left"
Hit the basement, go through the replacement door
Come up in my neighbor's yard, with a taste for war
You know I laced the four with the hollows
Crack the safe, grab the bottles
What you want me to do? Beep Carlos!
Two houses over by the tall black fence
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this
There go Grease, yo, get in, you drive

Who the fuck coulda snitched? Must have been a new guy
Damn, they back on our ass
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast
Trying to pull up on the side, but I'm packing to blast
Trying to take them niggas heads off, fuck cracking the glass
Hey, look out, damn, came so close
You almost hit that bitch! (Like you said nigga, almost)
Shit, the cops hit her and I know they ain't gon' leave her
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather
Drop it on the floor!
Boom! Got it through the door
Pedal to the floor, leave officers flyin'
Death is in the air and I don't know if it's mine
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is
And all I can think of is, "What about my kids?"
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick!
One, two, three, four, five more clips
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
Run through the fire, pull a joint from my boot out
Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear
I'm going out fast, and the last thing I hear is

The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped a nigga from goin' under
And you wonder why I pat you on your head and smile
Look in your eyes and thank the Lord for my child
Meanwhile, there's somethin' I gotta show you, and I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on yo' ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up, you'll see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas'll put a slug through you, over your ends
Cats I fuck with are real, but hey, those are your friends
It's just what you got comin', sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, yet you ask for more

The Devil got a hold on me, and he won't let go
I can feel the Lord pullin', but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin', but we all do the losin'
It's just who does the choosin', is you goin' up or down?
What have you been provin'? Just that you a fuckin' clown
Been seen the bullshit but never spoke on it
'Cause I know that deep down you really don't want it
I was traded the chance of bein' a child with a father
For a talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night, come on

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on

Families by the truckloads, fleein' to the morgue
Full moon, (Ah-ooh), the howlin'

Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need mo' love than an old thug
But hold up, roll up, talkin' out the side of your mouth
Is what's gonna let niggas know why you died in your house

But you and I both know the truth'll never die
Listen, nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared for the morgue
'Cause you dead up in the fog and that's your head by the log

But you know
Real niggas get by

'Cause I'm heartless

Who is this I see coming through? It's like 3 on the A.M
I'ma rob this nigga, and when I'm done, I'ma slay him
For being stupid, like coming through after 1 or 2
And having a gun that he couldn't get to, yeah, that one'll do
Foolish niggas learn the hard way, and I teach 'em
Be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I'll beat you
Like Jigga said, niggas test you when your gun goes warm
So I keep 'em scattering like roaches when the light comes on
From night 'til dawn, right from wrong holds no weight
.357 slugs with a snub-nosed trey-eight
Settin' all them issues straight (Why?)
Squashing all beefs
To the point where the police was blocking off streets
They got me trapped off in the building, but you know how that go (Uh-huh)

Day two of the saga, this fucking drama continues
I'm waking up like every two hours, looking out my windows
Plus, I keep the four-four pointed at the door, just in case
And when they bust in, I'll bust them and I'm gunning for the face
"What a waste of potential", is what my teachers used to tell me
"You can always get a job", and deep shit they tried to sell me
Got me nowhere but broke and fucked up in the game
But now I got a name (Uh-huh), and niggas know my name (Okay)
Knock at the door, "Police! We're looking for a man"
"Who killed a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand"
I played like a bitch, "It's just me here, and I'm not dressed"
"And that guy sounds kind of dangerous, I hope you make an arrest"
That was a close one, now I know I gotta get out of the city 'cause I'm hotter than lava
I'll holler tomorrow
Hit my dog on the horn, he like, "Fuck, you done did?"
"They done ran up in my crib, nigga, patting down my kid!"

Yo, on the real, what the deal? It's a mystery
How is it I can live and make history?
If you don't see it, then it wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born with it, it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be held
Locked down in a cell where the soul can't dwell
This is hell, come meet the Devil and give me the key
But it can't be worse than the curse that was given to me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone

Give me dap, but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road where you were told
That you would go when you were old and if you died young, it was cold
Sold, not for nearly what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like, "What if his birth
Was a miscarriage and I never existed?"
Have I given somethin' that if taken away you'd have missed it?
Didn't know, yet I persisted, it was the call of the wild
I merely say what's in my heart and you call it a style
Don't put it in a cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge? Here it is, eat it

Burnin' in hell, but don't deserve to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
Just because they've heard of me, and they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Peep how I park it and chill, take it over there, walk wit' it
From Y.O. to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flyin', up 1-2-9
Up the School Street 'cause I come through mine
Bark at my dogs, "Get at me, nigga!"
Get at me, nigga
What the deal is? Never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say, "X is the best," know he still is
Can't help but feel this, puttin' goosebumps on your arms

Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time sold an eighth, then told it's not an eighth
But then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made
That's what I get for fuckin' with strangers in the shade
This is it, y'all niggas got to give me a plate
For the same reason that fate chose to give me the weight
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always him versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelin's put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him, so I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly, yes
Look through my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet

When you think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot (Uh)
Niggas gon' ride regardless
Because I'm the hardest rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up for real (What?), get up and feel (What?)
My words, I make herbs split up and squeal (Come on)
Ill is all I've been hearing lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duct tape me and make me (Ah)
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl (Uh)
Too late for that 911 call (Come on)
Niggas stay beefing, but a lot of 'em bluff (Uh-huh)
But not me 'cause I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs (Uh-huh)
You think a lot of 'em's tough? That's just a front
When I hit them niggas like, "What you want?" The battle turns into a hunt (Alright)
With the dog right behind niggas chasing 'em down
We all knew that you was pussy (Uh), but I'm tasting it now
And never give a dog blood, 'cause raw blood will have a dog like what? (What?)
Biting whatever, all up in your gut (Come on)
Give it to you raw like that
And ain't no love, I do 'em all like that
Four right up in they back, clack-clack
Close your eyes, baby, it's over, forget it (Uh)

Ooh, ah, no, get 'em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have 'em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him (Come on)
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Tried to strike back, left him like that
Laying up with the white hat
Getting right back at ya when I snatch ya
Up out the grave, nothin' but bones and ashes (Get 'em)
Hittin' niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat, but the street stay red
Bitches gon' give me head for free 'cause they see (Uh-huh)
Who I'ma be by like 2003 (Uh-huh)
That nigga D took it there, he thought it was a joke
He ran through like twenty G's, thought that I was broke (What?)
Stupid, that's what you get for thinking
And eventually found that's what you get for stinking (Uh-huh)
Blowing up the spot when you rot (Uh)
Plus, if it gets hot, they know you dead for four square blocks (Come on)
Hit 'em with the ox to the grill
Ooh, ah, kill, nigga, kill
Yet and still, you don't know I'ma rob 'em

You tell me that there's love here, but to me it's blatant
That with all the blood here, I'm dealin' with Satan
Plus with all the hatin', it's hard to keep peace (Uh huh)
Thou shall not steal, but I will to eat
I tried doin' good, but good's not too good for me
Misunderstood, why you chose the hood for me?
Me? I'm aight; I just had to work hard at it
Went to grandma for the answer and she told me that God had it
So now here I am, confused and full of questions
Am I born to lose or is this just a lesson?
And who is gon' choose when it gets turned around?
And will it be laying in my own blood and on the ground?
My child, I've watched you grow up and I've been there
Even at those times you least suspected it, I was there
And look at what I've given you, a talent to rhyme
I may not come when you call, but I'm always on time

Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in?
Lord, we're just startin'
But where will it end?

But when the funds are low, the guns'll blow
Lookin' for that one that owe, make 'em run that dough
No! Put down the guns and write a new rhyme
You'll get it all in due time
You'll do fine, just have faith 'cause you mine
And when you shine, it's gon' be a sight to behold
So don't fight to be old or lose sight when it's cold
See that light down the road? It's gon' to guide you there
Two sets of footprints, I was right beside you there
But what about them times I only saw one?
Those were the times when I was under the gun
It was then I carried you my son
Led you to safety, it just wasn't your time to face me (uh huh)
Ayo, a few of them times I thought you would erase me
When all you did was embrace me, prepared me for the worst
Offered me eternal life and scared me with the hearse
And the curse turned to grace when the hurt turned to faith
No more runnin' or slidin' in the dirt, 'cause I'm safe

Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in?
Lord we're just startin'
But where will it end?
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in?
So if I'm your man, I'm in your hands, what's your plan?
Never had a friend 'cause you couldn't trust your man
Learned to stand before I crawled, things were twisted
And if you showed me anything at all, then I missed it
Looked the wrong way, I've done some wrong things
Kept a bad attitude, but that's what wrong brings
And now you mean to tell me that after all this time
It was you that kept the dog from goin' out of his mind?
It was you that breathed life into my lungs when I was born?
And it was you that let me know what was right from what was wrong?
And it was you that let me do, what I knew what could be done?
And it was you that gave me a good wife and a beautiful son?
And it's been you speakin' to me inside my mind?
And it's been you who has forgiven time after time?
It was you who opened my eyes so I could see?
It was you that shined your light on me68Embed
I come to you hungry and tired, you give me food and let me sleep
I come to you weak, you give me strength, and that's deep
You call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
Only askin' that I keep the focus in between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect, but you'd like me to try
Unlike the Devil, who just wants me to lie 'til I die
Lord, why is it that I go through so much pain?
All I saw was black, all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's you who knows
You showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that, when you asked for this story
I put it together, to do our dogs some good
Our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way, but I hid
And I remember once, you held me close, but I slid
There was somethin' that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I could be what you wanted me to be
And I think I've seen it, 'cause I don't feel the same
Matter of fact, I know I've seen it, I can feel the change
And it's strange, almost got me beatin' down your door
But I've never known love like this before
It's a wonderful feelin' to get away from the pain
And up under the ceilin', I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real, so I wipe away the tear, it's on
And I almost lost faith when you took my man
Monty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan
And I fear that what I'm sayin' won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good, 'cause I really didn't expect to live long
So, if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die, but, please, Lord, treat him rightYou might also like17Embed

Then ask you seriously, whatchu wanna do?
Frustratin', isn't it? Wanna kill me, but I'ma kill you

Fuck whoever's standin' there when you get what you got comin'

Places that I've been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know it's only gonna get worse
Love, or a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it began
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end
Thin love, hold me down baby, it's gon' be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, 'cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, 'cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like "Oh, it's him again"
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine
Hot as you ever been, I was that in '89
Seek and you shall find, look within and you will know

-I think I'm going to the top
Me and DMX

I will spend mad time in one spot, plottin' my next move
Tryin' figure out - why is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered (why?), that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, cause they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the grime
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Lighter side of the dark, fight in the park but wouldn't wanna
Stayed and fought, but when they jumped me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it was a joke; I had the last laugh
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

-I go, I go

I feel the ghost from within, comin' back to haunt me
Stay lovin' my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been gettin' love, but instead was plottin'
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special 'til this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the 4-4, leave 'em dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs that I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill 'em
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hatin', when I can show love
What's the sense of fakin', when I can show blood
Now what's the moral to this story?
Come on!

.38-snub, blue steel with no hammer
And I see y'all niggas tryna glance at the 'Kiss
'Cause I walk around with your whole advance on my wrist
Boning your women, drunk off Coronas and lemon
And you know I'm still writing the mean, lighting the green
I need the buggy, even though I look right in the beam
Judge find out it's my team, he boost they bails
Niggas throw us on they album, try to boost they sales
We put our pies on the table and our eyes on a label
'Cause them rednecks up in the mountains'll try to slay you
Call me raspy, tell you what I want you to know
Fuck what you ask me, you probably don't want me to blow
I got a lot of horsepower so I'm able to skip
Usually a good nigga, even though I'm able to flip
You pay thirty for the 'Kiss (Uh-huh), a hundred for The LOX (Yeah)

Me and my two mans gave money, twenty grand
For a scam, they don't get the condo in the sand
And chance of gettin' caught slim next to none
But now we like three deep, need that extra gun
Bump into my man, I remember from up north
I remember he had principles and wasn't nothin' soft
Off to discuss, just what's goin' dizzy
Everybody got it? Aight, let's get busy
Run up in the bank, bitch, *woman screams* hit the deck
Yo, bust money and get the keys off his neck (come here)
We on the clock, three minutes until we finished
Feds are on the way, but I'm tryna see spinach
In and out, duffel bag across the back
Extra large sports coat to cover up the Mac
Feds they attack, I spit lead out, niggas spread out
Run up on a civilian in his car, make him get out

High speed chasin', racin' through the streets
Death's in the air, I can taste it through the heat
My partner's goin' fast, I don't think he's gonna last
But if he don't, I'mma hit his wife with his half
But that's the type of nigga I am, this ain't just rappin'
I made it, he didn't, but hey, shit happens
What can I do, but go on livin'
Fleein' from the condo, I'll go on a ribbon
Life goes on, that might sound wrong, but hey
We all live by the rules of the game we play
Day to day, death is a possibility
The way I play is a vest stops you from killin' me
It's too hot to be in the heat 'cause it's on
Too hot to be in the streets, so I'm gone
Go back to bein' discreet, live long
'Til one day either me or the heat is gone
Come On!

It's what it is baby
It's straight biz baby
We ain't kids baby
We get down like that

Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

(Check it), more money more problems
I thought more money would solve 'em
I spent more money in Harlem
Than Frank Lucas did before the boys got 'em
Now the shit done changed
How I'm feelin'? the shit look strange
I realize that shit ain't the same
'Cause at the end of the day this shit ain't a game
Nigga goin' through it but I slipped and fell
Ran to the hood, took a trip to Hell
Deal when I should, that's why all my shit sell
Always know I could, so I did well

Let us pray...
I thank You, Lord, for my birth and everything that's followed
I thank You, Lord, for today, and I will pray for tomorrow
I thank You, Lord, for the love of my life and a friend
I made a promise and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end
I thank You, Lord, for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now... Lord, this is Your house
I thank You, Lord, for a dream that came true to light
And I ask You to bless everybody in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing and I ask You to forgive me
'Cause I need You here wit me, without You in my life it's empty
I think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's somethin' better after here, but everybody won't go
So I ask You to forgive them and we'll hope they see
And I thank You for the love that they've given to me
I will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray
You see I love 'em like children, that I see everyday
And I pray... no, we pray... together
Get us through the bad weather, and we love You forever
Let Your thought and my heart go hand in hand
I first thought but to start, but I stand a man
And for as long as I can, as long as You permit me
Please give me the strength I need to live, bear with me
Amen

'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

Lord, You left me stranded and I don't know why
Told me to live my life, now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly, I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me You would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still comin' at me, just missin'
Sometimes I think all You do with me is just listen
I thought that I was special, that's what You told me
Hold me, stop actin' like You don't know me
What'd I do so bad that it sent You away from me?
Not only sent You away, but made You stay away from me?
"My child I'm here as I've always been
It is you who went away and now are back again
What did I say?" Follow Your word and be true
"What did you do?" Well, what I wanted to do
"What have you seen?" Darkness and hell at a glance
"What do you want?" All I want is another chance
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight

'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

"Just because you went away, my doors are not locked
Wanna come back home? All you gotta do is knock"
You see, I left home a boy but returned as a man
Full grown and I'm still not able to stand
"I gave you a hand." Well but I was lookin' the wrong way
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer took me from here, over there
Back to over here, now it got me like where
Do I belong, do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryna win, so where do we start?
"Thou shalt not steal." But what if he stole from me?
"Thou shalt not kill." But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
"Thou shalt not take my name in vain
No matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain"
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war

White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him

Our Father, who art in Heaven
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at twenty-seven
No longer afraid to knock on Your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord
'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen what I need to see
Please take me where I need to be
"What have you learned?" It's better to tell the truth than to lie
"What have you learned?" To love my life until I die
"What have you learned?" Violence isn't always the key
"What have you learned?" You can't always believe what you see
"What have you learned?" It's better to forgive and forget
"What have you learned?" Give as you expect to get
"What have you learned?" That I can't go on without You
"What have you learned?" I must've been a fool to ever doubt You

I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

My dogs is dogs with official bloodlines
I say "Stop Being Greedy," get a plate, you want mine
Why do niggas always force you take it back to the streets?
Can I at least go one year without spitting the heat?
Motherfuckers think it's sweet until you get your chest messed up
Two days later he's dressed up, let him rest up
He ain't going nowhere, no time soon
Remember High Noon? Last thing he heard was "Boom"!
Can I get some room or do I gots to, make me a path?
Break you in half, fake niggas make me laugh
Y'all niggas is funny, still talking 'bout money
And ain't got none, get the shotgun 'cause you hungry
It's about to get ugly when the, lights is out
One, two, three, ho that's three strikes you out
His knife was out, I think they found it still in his hand
He in a bag and I'm over here, killing his man!

Fucking with the street, but you ain't feeling nothing but mine
Tired of hearing niggas rhyme that don't say shit
Fuck is on them niggas minds, why don't they quit?
Sucking my dick looking for something new
Let your man hold something with your hold something crew
You know how niggas do, we don't forget shit
If you was there when it's thin, then you there when it's thick
No hitchhikers, fuck that, the Ryde was Ruff
And every nigga that was wit us, that died was Ruff
A lot of niggas that are wit us, ain't cried enough
So now when niggas come and get us, we fires em up

From his camp, get the stamp, grand champ, it's official
Think when you die how many's gon' miss you
Lean over in your casket and kiss you
Send you on your way with a blessing
And pray that another learned a lesson
Smith and Wesson ended money's life, now money's wife's a widow
(Gave it to him full blast?) Nah dog, just a little
Beside rap I don't talk but make plenty of moves
I'll murder, ten of you fools before your men and them choose
You either, win or you lose, and I, love to win
Even if it means I gotta shed blood again
Keep the bank account doubling, but don't hate me
Really thought that what you said would either, make me or break me?
Knowin it don't take me long to write
Matter of fact, I think I'll drop another, song tonight

Or maybe I'm just wrong with the moves that I've been makin
Hatin others cuz they hate me, over envy
Wanna send me, when we used to be friendly
Think I started off on top? With multi-platinum albums?
Naw dog, I started off on the block
I just did shit to get shit
Niggas always knew I was down to hit shit
That's why I stay wit shit
Played with shit, but it wasn't a game
First time locked down, wasn't the same
A whole new world, nothin but clothes to steal
Niggas gettin split for real, miss a good meal

A nigga might flip, and a nigga bite quick
But I stay focused on what's important
Supportin' my family, fuckin with my dogs and recording
According to the man upstairs, we all got our own problems
So why the fuck you worrying about theirs
Learned a long time ago, look away, niggas'll leave you
I hear none, speak none, see no, evil
All I can do is teach you, what I know
How I flow, how I get down, where I go
Maybe what I been through, will send you
Somewhere, other then where, dreams all out the window
I love my people, all of my people
And God gon keep me callin my people

Crazy over money, can't do without it
I got other shit to deal with, I'm like forget about it
It's the one I don't know but must teach that comes first
Because he comes with the thirst of a nigga that had it the worst
It's like a curse that's to be lifted, he was there but he drifted
Got a call and he shifted, once he found out he was gifted
Gotta kick it from the heart, and I hope you got it
It was there from the start, I just hope you spot it
Cuz it's my blood on paper, my soul on paper
Words to live by will leave a hole in the paper
First I'm gonna crawl

I know that my savior lives
And at the end, He will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed
Yet from this body, I will see God
Yes, I will see Him for myself
And I long for that moment

Grandma, I really miss you, and it ain't been the same
I drop a tear when I hear your name
Mary Ella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?
Used to say, "Don't worry, it's gon' be okay"
But it ain't – it's like when you left, you took the Lord with you
Why couldn't I come when He came to get you?
Damn, I really miss you… I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like 10
Crept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein' hard headed
You told me I would get it – you said it!
And boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw that it hurt you more than it hurt me

You left behind a mother, eleven kids, eleven grand-kids
And since then, two of your grand-kids done had kids
I got a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother
That's right, Xavier's made you a great-grandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her acceptin' and lovin' my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my life, I thank you for the Bible
I thank you for the songs that you'd sing in the mornin'
(Amazing Grace…) while I'm yawnin'
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
'Cause I know somewhere along the line the lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
'Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life, like everything, comes to an end
I pray I go to Heaven to see you again – Amen

You got a minute for Yo' son, Father? I need to talk
I'm so tired of tryin' to run, Father, let's take a walk
I'm so sorry for what I done, Father, it ain't my fault
But the devil's been on my back lately, he's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle, but it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual, but I need You, God
Lot of things that I used to, I don't wanna
Run the streets like I used to, I know I'm gonna
Speak the word for You one day
Up in there like, "Hallelujah!" on Sunday
I thank You Lord for the blessings that You gave me
And for my life, with the blessings You have saved me
And for my wife, You have carried me enough times - and that's the truth
Married me to rough times, throughout my Youth
And through it all I saw that You was still with me
I was that one lost sheep and You was comin' to get me

Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...

I look at life a little different now, since You hugged me
And I always loved my peoples, but now they love me
Thank You for the love, Lord, we praise Ya
Jacob's descendants, from Africa to Asia
Pleadin' the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right, just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout Yo' name in times of need
And times of joy, and, when we bleed
And, when we are overcome with greed
You ain't gon' have to tell me twice, I'mma take heed
And because of what You've given me, I know You'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I, never knew I had
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad
All praises due to Ya
That's why I had to dedicate somethin' new to Ya, thank You Father

Aiyo, this is DJ Kay Slay from around the way, and my dog DMX is putting it down with the Bloodline family and the Bloodline kennels! The Great Depression! Fourth time! X keeps it gutta and his dogs are no different! You gotta respect the line... First out the kennel, Jynx repping straight from Y.O. kennel, holding it down...

Let it be known:
Bring it to me, break the fingers that you write with
Mouth that you recite with
Real life shit!
Niggas call me God on beats, cuz I light shit
Quicker than hoes
Shootin big holes, rippin your clothes
Play games and have a thug nigga sittin at your home
See you go walkin with that bitch when he spit at yo dome
Damn, ya brains all over the place!
Bitch cryin and screamin, cuz ya brain's all over her face!
I got love for street thugs and killers, with deep mugs
Who bust they guns first then they start to cuss
Shook niggas hold they guns till they start to rust
Bitch niggas don't want no parts of us: we dangerous!
Tripped a few times off of angel dust
One shot turn yo brains to slush!
Yeah, niggas don't learn shit till the lights is off...
It's too late! Now your life is lost, motherfucker!

DAMN! See what I'm saying?! This shit is real! Next out the kennel, barkin from Dirty Jerz is that nigga Loose!

Let me Loose, nigga! Get the fuck off me!
I can't believe my ears! Huh? These niggas is barely on!
In fact, they wack; they just got a hot song!
Fuckin up the game is cats like you
That make wack niggas think they can rap too!
But Loose at the door now, so come with me
I'mma make sure no more rappers like you get in!
You want it? We can go hard with the beats
Or hard to the body or hard to the teeth
Yeah, I was on Universal, they couldn't have it:
They kept me on the hush, like Whitney drug habit!
Got drafted, then made it to the front line
A year later, got traded to Bloodline
Now it's hard for cats to keep they spot
He rock too much ice, he can't keep it hot!
And when all the ice melt, they all watered down
Loose, fuck that, the streets is mines now!


FIRE! Only stray kills, yaknowhatimsayin? Next out the kennel, my nigga Big Stan from Harlem! Get at 'em, dog...
Uh-oh, who's next? That would be me, BS, ya know?
Uh, y'all niggas ain't ready, uh
I'm like a thief in the night:
I creep in your life one day when you nice
High off the Henny, catch you while you partying, right?
With the semi, put your body on ice
For a price, I'll make a bastard of your son as well as a widow of your wife!
My struggle was tight, love inside my heart has limits
Like anything outside of Bloodline, bound to get it
We bound to win it
What niggas want, we bound to give it
And anything you cowards start, you know we bound to finish
Can you see the cage is open, the muzzle is off?
The nine is sick, the silencer will muffle the cough
The Line is thick, Stan stay solo on cost
My shoulder will frost on any nigga other than dog
I'm the one ya moms would hate you to cross
Of course, if you the only child, who'll be left replacing the lost?
Please think before you go against the B.S
And no it's not a game, I'm one of Bloodline's best, nigga!


Whoa, whoa, whoa, they just keep biting! The last to bite, that bitch, the bitch of the litter: Crazy Kash, Kashmir, get at em girl...
What the fuck y'all niggas know about grease?!
I got enough to put in ya piece
Plus bust ten in ya fleece
Make ya back bend in a crease
That's what you get offend a beast
You hating me like you a friend of Kelis
Load, cock back and release
Bad bitch cracking ya piece
Bullet holes in the back of your peeps
Always catch niggas coming from the back with the heat
Love to watch they knees buckle when they smack the concrete
You ain't gotta love me, just respect the bitch!
Scared to fight me, get your girls, so I can wet the bitch!
Who gives a fuck who ya old lady be?
I put holes in ya old lady tee if she fucking with me!
You know my niggas Stan, Jynx, Loose, Berg and X
Ya niggas switching occupations, 'cause they heard we next
No niggas above mine, 'cause no niggas above mine
And that shit's in my heart, 'cause it's in my fucking Bloodline...18Embed

Yo, yo I told niggas to pack they bags or grab they guns before I come
It's too late, y'all had your fun!
It's all over now! I don't wanna talk to niggas!
Popping shots like corks in niggas!
Sticking forks in niggas' cause they done!
Only reason y'all still breathing is cause y'all run!
When we bust shots, my nigga clutch Glocks
Broad daylight in front of precincts; fuck cops!
Niggas want pops? Then they die for them!
Kiss the barrel, cry for them!
Spirit leave your body, touch the sky for them
Fuck Voltron! See what me and mines form
In the .9 storm; death: time's gone!
I'm that cat that y'all niggas got your eyes on
Go to papi broke trying to get your pies on
The day that I'm gone I'm real fuck stardom
Niggas wanna talk, but they don't want no problems!

The fuck that nigga just say? Try shit here!
Come on, cupcake, y'all cats ain't even built like that
I done seen through the bullshit; I'm real like that
I know how to walk the dog, I know how to chase the cat
I know how to get a bone, I know how to bring it back
I know how to flip on a nigga, split him with the bat
I know how to train a pup to make sure they scratch
You motherfuckers don't want no problems, 'cause my revolver is solving them
One by one until it's all of them
Let that be a lesson to your mans and shit:
Keep your fucking mouth shut if your mans want spit, nigga!


Well it's the kid that'll crush your head into a cake batter
Y'all know that cake mix but y'all don't wanna taste this shit
Guns I should've been arrested for
Y'all gone make my bullets expand like a lesbi jaw
Don't you test me, boy!
Don't fuck with X or Drag-to-the-Dash, 'cause once you dump in these bags
You drag to the trash dumpster, amongst the rest of them fags!
My poker got your skin looking like acupunctures
Keep a silence on the tip; can't afford the noise
My banger got a jagged edge like them four boys
If you hot, I'll Super Soak you, and you won't be able to dry it off
Just relax, take your last breath, and die it off!
Nothing but love I spread
But if you take advantage, the weight that's lead will rush your head
You sweat'll die your hair red, like my bitch Eve!
And no, I'm not a faggot, but I make niggas striptease in front of me
It's fun to me, bitches!

Father God, I am just learning how to pray, bear with me
First I thank You for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank You for the love You give me, why?
I don't know; I don't deserve it, and it hurts inside
Many a nights I cried, and called Your name out loud
But didn't call You when I was doin' good... too proud
And still You gave me love, I wasn't used to that
Most of the people that gave me love, they ended up takin' it back
That's somethin' new to me, so I'm askin' You for time to adjust
Let me make it there, I will be one You can trust
What I stand for, I put my life on, I do!
I guess what I'm askin' is: show me how to stand for You
And I will rap for You, sing for You, preach for You, teach for You, reach for You
I will love You like You love me: unconditionally
And I will always be prepared for whatever the mission'll be
Give the nutrition to me, and I'll properly digest it
And when I give it back, I'll show You word well invested
And whenever I go, before I go, let me give
Thanks to You, Lord, for my birth, for every day that I've lived
You gave me a love most of my life I didn't know was there
In the name of Jesus! I give you my life, 'cause You cared

"I just called you and you said Domino's Pizza, but… and you said you were on your way, but there's just one problem
I'm all the way to fucking Rochester, New York. Wrong ho!"

Uhh, yo yo… yo, not this shit again
Dog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean? Motherfucking dog!
Don't get a dog if you can't take care of a dog
Gotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?
Take it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh
Give me a motherfucking break, will ya?

Shorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough
Come to find out she was a lil hoe, but still, yo
I pushed up, shorty had that ass like blaow
Had me scheming on how I could get that now
Was like girlfriend, let me drop a bug in yo' ear
She was mine cause I told her what she wanted to hear
Was like yeah, she knew how it was going down
She said page me, code zero, cause I know you get around
Didn't have a man, but even if she did dead
Cause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head
I said, we'll get up like nine or somethin'
Don't act like when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin'
That night was right, she let me get that, hit that
Rip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that
But only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust
But I didn't fuss cause, dog, shorty was the bomb

Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life
C'mon, ma, give me a break!

A few days later, I hit her up just to keep it real
Was like, "Whassup, boo? How you been? How you feel?"
She said, "Aight, but my friend's kinda late
Today's the 13th, and it should've been here on the 8th"
I'm like, "For real?! Don't stress it, it'll come
It better cause I can't afford another little one"
She said, "Neither can I", I said, "Cool
Cause I got mad shit to do and you still going to school"
So at least we had the same thing in mind
Not to have this kid and everything would be fine
But I was blind to the fact that she was setting me up
For the kill, damn, why wasn't she on the pill?
And I still would check on her like once a week
Sometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak
And whenever I would speak on the baby
Shorty would be like, "I ain't having this kid, is you crazy?"
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life
C'mon, ma, give me a break!

By now, wasn't looking too good
Cause she wasn't doing things that she told me she would
Like getting the price checked out for what we had to do
And it goes up another yard for every month after two
And a half, I had to laugh out of frustration
Now she's four months, I'm ready to hit the bus station
If I was still on that shit it would've made me rob her
Told her friends, "DMX? Yeah, that's my baby's father"
Her lil' stomach is shown, so now the heat is on
Maybe she'll see the light if I start to treat her wrong
Like if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me, So I played the game on her level, got sneaky
Let her have the kid, she said it was premature
Found out she was six months when she said she was four
So I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm
But she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life
C'mon, ma, give me a break!29Embed

C'mon, yeah, yeah
Now who could do it like the M-I-C, y'all niggas ain't about this life
Runnin up inside of the crib to cut your lights
My A.R. likes the thug life, drugs and gun fights
White on whites, menage and dykes, and nice ice
White wraps for these niggas who scrap and gun clap
Stick up kids, leavin y'all with two in the back
Once you bitch-made niggas started doin the rap
Seven figure shit really started ruinin rap
Take it back to hood shit bulletproof and biscuits
Chips all for hustle and grams go from bricks
And whips for templates, we switch while we movin all of this weight
'til we screamin all of us hate

You see shit's still real
Nothin ever change cause we still in the field
Niggas try to front but the game's too real
We don't give a fuck bout the way you feel
So fuck what you feel and shit's still real
Nothin ever change cause we still in the field
Niggas try to front but the game's too real
We don't give a fuck bout the way you feel
So fuck what you feel, yeah

Y'all niggas better get the guns
Fuck the pep talk, I don't wanna hear it
When it's on it's on, talkin I don't feel it
That's the fake shit, argue and just make shit hot
And with my short fuse I'm always quick to make shit pop
Nigga respect this, catch me on the block and with gloves
I'm ambidextrous, sold with the Glock and the snub
But I ain't reckless, with me it's always one big dot
Then one big shot, and one kid drops
Head shot, closed lid over one big box
And a preacher left prayin over one big plot
Never a mess, now I wanna conquer the world
And I'mma do it, wanna know how? Fuckin with Earl
He's the one that took me in to raise the dog from a pup
With his guidance, help create a beast from a mutt
Just released from the cut goin straight for the neck
B.S., Bloodline, what the fuck you expect nigga?


Uhh, WHAT?! Uhh
Uhh, uhh, uhh

It's time to take out the garbage, y'all niggas want the hard shit
I got shit that'll start shit, rip apart shit and disregard shit
Thought it wasn't real no more, just because I got a deal
What you think, I ain't gon' steal no more?
"Usual Suspects" once again - thus begins
The bullshit we both went through form trusted friends
Bustin him from where? (It's time to peel)
Fuck what you heard baby! Shit's still real
Y'all niggas think your shit don't stink, cause it don't think
Hit a motherfuckin iceberg your ship won't sink
Bitch don't blink, cause I'mma hit you with somethin
I'mma hit you for frontin, I'mma hit you for nuttin? You buggin
I'm lovin it - the obstacles that I go through
It keeps me real, don't make me have to show you
Fuck you cause I don't know you, and listen dog

Sometimes I wonder what life's about
Sometimes I wonder why the lights are out
Sometimes I wonder why I like to shout
Sometimes I wonder what the lies are 'bout
Sometimes I see things I shouldn't have seen
Sometimes I wonder why I'm a hood and a fiend
Sometimes I look at what I've become and cry
Sometimes I get on that bullshit and be ready to die
Sometimes a nigga that's your man might get it
Sometimes even though it's sweet, you ain't with it
Sometimes the pain is too much to bear
Sometimes it rains too much to care
Sometimes if you don't watch your back it'll cost you
Sometimes you wonder who would give a fuck if they lost you
Yet sometimes the sun shines around the clock
But sometimes it's dark, and Hell is hotYou might also like14Embed

Yea, uh
From 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how I got down cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin' that's yo ass
Didn't laugh much cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick half gas half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
It was good if I caught a good vic if I didn't I was bad
Took it out on my regulars
I'd come through and if niggas was broke I took watches and cellulars
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was how not to be sloppy
An older cat robbed me when I was like 10
If anybody wanted to help they should've did it then
But they didn't and all it did was release the beast
So I'm a feast on whatever I come across in the streets

Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest

And clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard
I bag some niggas I knew and some niggas I didn't
I ain't a fuck either way it was no bullshiting
I'm a cruddy niggas out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
Run up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear
Give up the money the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game we'll play let's get popped
See how much fun you having when your heart beat stop
Shut 'em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off a nigga top
Somebody call the cops but it's to late
Cause I'm a hit you in the face
And what will kill you will be something that you ate

If pain is love, why hide my pain with drugs?
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes, no soap or shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
We used to get robbery vics
Until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and start selling crack
But I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
I feel like all my life I was held up in a trap
Like if I go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
But all I really want is (unknown)
And a model bitch sitting with a head up in my lap
But since no dough don't spin
(unkown)
It's obvious I live in a house of sin
I wish I could open up the door and let 'em blow at the wind

Runnin up on hoes, what up ma, I'm X
Cause you know how this goes, come on ma, I'm X
We just chill, sat and talk to the first light
And for the first time I didn't fuck on the first night
And it was aight, shorty was a thorobred
Like "Belly", we ain't fuck, she just gave me head, for real,
From the time that the sun is up
Till the stars show up
It really doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter babe
There's no love like the dog love
There's no love, there's no love
No matter what, I'll hold you down
Nobody else will come around

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong

How I live is simple
Walk through the streets
Talk to the beats
New York! I'mma eat
I never had a problem with surviving
No problem with getting down, busting my gun, or ruff rydin'
Cats talk slick but I talk slicker
My shits for real cause I'm that nigga
The reason that you hurtin' is you gotta take your problems
Straight to the lord, no body else can solve them(?)
See what I see but look through my eyes
The devil is a liar the truth never lies
We all got issues
Shit that we go thru
Shit that we been thru
Shit that we won't do
The pain that we bring upon ourself for no reason, is the worst!
That's why I say I'm blessed with the curse
The Lord gave it all to me
And in the process, I lost my soul
Damn! the devil got a hold
In my mind, I'm like a little boy lost in crime
Like the healthy nigga that the devil forced into dying
The lord knows I'm trying
But at the same time
You hear the nigga with the weight of the world!
Why you gave it to Earl?

To live is to suffer and I'm living it up
Face everyday chin up, I ain't giving it up
Cause if I ain't giving a fuck, then who will?!
So I hope for the best, knowing that its all uphill
Sometimes I wonder what's lifes about
Sometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route
Then turn around and go out
And no doubt, the fate in mine is blind
So whatever, fuck it, I'mma roll out
We all go through the motions
We get different notions
We each have our own ocean
That we can either drown in or float
Like the vessels that we are
Vessels that would carry many far
Dont know what to say, when you talking
Dont know who you gone see, when you walking
If you dont know how much of what you do is dirt
Three things you dont know gonna get you hurt

Let us pray for those that we've lost
We know that we miss them for selfish reasons
Oh Lord my God, indeed you I put my trust
Save me, from all them that persecute me
And deliver me, in Jesus name, GRRRRR

Cause we all go anyway, I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today-ayayyyy

I'ma say goodbye today, cause I don't know when
We gon' cross paths again, until then
I'ma be that, MC that, speaks the truth
Believe that, I'ma see that, to reach the youth
My suffering will not be in vain (NOT)
Neither will yo' pain ever since you passed to hear yo' name
Rest in peace to Autumn - we all know cancer cells kill
But if they caught 'em, they could've fought 'em
If you'd still be here, right here with us
We'd have plenty time before death came to get us
BUT, what is death like?  Should I really care?
After looking at it, was life really fair?
Did you burn any bridges?  Did you make amends?
Did you ask God for forgiveness for your sins?
What is Heaven like?  If you could come back, should you?
If you could communicate for a moment there, would you?
... Just questions that we ask ourselves, every day (wanna know)

So young, so gifted
Direction of life was uplifted, when the wind shifted
And took a turn for the worse, with the blessing come the curse
A nigga stressing took the dog into the hearse
My nigga Divine was way too young to die
Fell out the nest and was way too young to fly
But that didn't stop fate from happening
Idle time make the Devil—HATE WHAT'S HAPPENING!
God no!  Why did it go that way?
Coming from his fans away, why did he go that day?
Lightly, I dare say, life goes on
Donuts, Trey and Jerz I say, please be strong
He was supposed to be on the road with me
I wish somebody WOULD'VE came to get me
And niggas would've had to hit ME
But until then, MY FRIEND
I'ma say goodbye today, cause you never know when

Cause we all go anyway, I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today-ayayyyy
Goodbye today, I'ma say goodbye today
Goin away hey (uhh) goodbye today, I'ma say goodbye today
(It's okay) And I say (let us pray)
Goodbye today (and I say) say goodbye today
Go on your way (and I say when you're, gone) I'ma say goodbye today
I'ma say goodbye today (gotta say before you move on) HEY!
Yes (yeah!)
I mean, this is life (yeah, say goodbye)
We are born, to die, so LET ME FLY! (know what I mean)
Let me fly, we are born, to die (be good)
{"Sometimes the pain is too much to bear" - repeat to end of Outro}
Cause I'm in a better place ('til we meet again)
I'm in a better place (I don't know what form)
See you soon baby! (we'll meet again)
Ha ha! .. (But we will meet again)

Spread your wings (they gon' shed a tear on this one!)
Fly, I'll try not to cry, it'll be hard
I just, miss, not having you here
Even though I know you're in a better place!
I just miss not having you here
Kinda selfish when you think about it
That's nature, that's life
Spirit, never dies, as lessons begin8Embed

In the name of Jesus
Let us pray
Father please walk with us through the bad times as well as the good
May we be heard and understood from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get a breakthrough however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls that will lay our fears to rest
Cause there is no way we can live for Jesus when we're liven in the flesh
So I pray that you allow our sprits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, chapter two, verse 15
Do not love the world or anything in the world
And we know what that means, but listen
We know the distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin
That doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men respect their ladies
But lately so many of us have gone a stray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please bring us back home, instill in us the word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to yet we receive so little
Cause in this time of spiritual warfare we're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the annointing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere
Our heads to the sky you will demonist our fears
In Jesus' mighty name we have prayed
Amen and amenYou might also like4Embed

We all know the difference between right and wrong
We should all live life by one fact

I seen cats go out like suckers
I seen cats get down like, "Yo, them some bad motherfuckers"
I see fake niggas and the games they play
Aiyyo, I deal with that bullshit e'ry day
But that ain't gon' stop me from doin what I'm doin
I got things beside bullshit to be pursuing
It's that craft for me, the half of me
Let through niggas in the door after me
Yo, somebody stop me; please, somebody come and get me
If I go, I'm taking niggas with me!

Stepped in dirt, changed my shoes
Got those dirty - asked God for a new pair
And He musta heard me; thought I was worthy
Taught me to listen cause in New York
The rule is the more you know the less you talk
So if you fake niggas actin like you down for the kid
When it goes back, don't be around for SHIT!

Ain't a damn thing changed just because I was gone
I be robbing mad niggas in the street for loot
Since there ain't no money in jail, I'm taking sneaks or boots
Inmates is getting bust wide open over jew-els
Names rings two bells, so large I got two cells
On the Island it was strictly a bing thing
Niggas know the half, from the L to Sing Sing
Ding Ding! Another knock out on the lock out
Money was kinda big so I bought the soap and sock out
Hit him up quick and ran up in his cell
Robbed him and scared the motherfucker to tell
C.Os give a nigga respect, they know my style

Back on the block, seeing a lot of new faces
Which means more money from a lot of new places
I give a nigga every reason to trust me
But if you don't want to get robbed you better bust heat
Bumped into a nigga, I remember from up top
Looked him up and down (AIYYO), "What's up Hobb?"
In jail he was washing draws and shit
Now that we both out, money gots to be a Vic
A crab nigga so it's only right I shit on him
Should I smack him first, or sick the Pit on him

By the time I finish the bottle them bitches is models
Let me break it down like this, here's what happened
I was y'know, tryin to fuck and, once I get to rappin
We at the crib, bitches leave they panties on the doorknob
Puff somethin, ten minutes later we on the floor hard

And I never really liked the bitch, out the gate
It was those two bottles of Remy, plus it was gettin late
Now I ain't say I ain't had nothin to do or to blame
Man I'm the Dog, bitches stay screamin my name

From the beginnin, shit was cool
Check it, a nigga was hungry and this bitch was food
And I, wanted to eat 'til the Dog got full
Cause I knew how I felt and the things that I would do

DMX is probably, one of the artists that saved Def Jam back in the day
When Def Jam was going down
And-and he saved Def Jam with the, with the cruddy raps
But let me tell you how generous DMX was (Okay)
This is when I was producing
DMX flew me down to uh, L.A. (uh-huh) when he was shooting a movie
And uh, we did about four or five tracks
But the reason I knew DMX was so big
Is in the middle of the movie he stopped filming
And was like "Envy, let's go, uhh, fly helicopters." (ha ha ha)
And we went to the store, we bought remote control helicopters
And started flying helicopters in the middle of the set!You might also likeEmbed

'Cause every time you come around, it's like what?

And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin' to
But I'm not him, aight, Slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue

Fake up North type nigga
Get pushed like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brung out
Run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody burn out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth, I'ma blow his lung out

Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

I could flip that flow, I could stick that ho
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo
Ain't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams
Or nightmares, the light dares to desert me (What?)
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me (What?)
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever (Uh)
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but never
Will I kill? I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin' on 'til what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin' motherfuckas, stay on the floor
Four-four, that's what I get sick with (Grr)

I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk past the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dawgs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the—, start runnin'
'Cause when you hear the—, I'm comin'
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money, give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm drunk so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin' me to stop, but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack

And all the runners up are thankin' me for their health
Hopin' that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's goin' down, you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops
One drops, then another and another
Gun pops, goin' through you and your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight 'cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga, when it's your time to go, you go

'Bout to get a deal and it's as nice as you is
Oh, you think? — Nah, I'm just playin', wassup?
Got some new bitches, I know you tryna fuck
Not really — What, I ain't your man no more?
Just because a nigga don't need a hand no more?
You know how we do, if one goes soft
We all take the pussy and go up in her raw
It's like now, where you goin', I ain't tryin to take it
Fuckin' with a nigga like you, I won't make it
It'll be what it is... — Yo, you in for the night?

Have you ever got up smiling, laid down crying
First you love life then wish you were dying
Bitch so fed up gave up trying
Kept it straight up but niggas kept lying
Ever seen something that you wanted so bad
And got it then wished it was something you never had
You ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it
If you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it
You ever felt so strong or so loved
But when it came down it wasn't meant to be so hard
Wake yourself up like, where did I go wrong!?
Just get back up, pray on it and go on

Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

Have you ever wanted to go right, but then chose left
Deep down with a lift to way shows death
Burn in the night but everyday shows stress
Regardless of what you think I'm going in that
Have you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there
Gaze so in your heart, but really didn't care
Stand out at the wrong turn and now life ain't fair
And all you can do is take it, like ye
Ever found out that the shit you was living with
Deeper, cause to me is tryin' to creep ya
Back your Glock off put your ass in a sleeper
Used to be my dog, now he's the Grim Reaper

This place inside my mind, a place I'd like to hide
You don't know the chances.. What if I should die?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances.. I'm so blind

Living a life that seems to be, a lost reality
That can never find, a way to reach my inner
Self-esteem is low, how deep can I go?
In the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to
See through the grey that clouds my mind

And if you gon' crack a nigga, might as well be a head
Cause if you targeting the L.O.X., you might as as well target a box
That you gon' sleep in for years, all covered wit rocks
Cause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got
Ya hotshots ain't got blocks, ?llabuta? muchacha
From the days in school, now a motherfucker rule
And I could drop my chain in coffee and keep shit cool
That's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest
And I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest
My bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk
The baby nine be on the daily, ain't no poppin a trunk
But if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag
So you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag
Must I brag? My shit paid for, yours tagged
And every bitch you grabbed, Sheek bend em back

Ayo I hope you ain't tongue-kissin your spouse
Cause I be makin love in her in the mouth
Type of cat buck at your house
Too slick, means she be suckin my dick
And before you know it, I'ma have her stuffin my bricks
Jada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later
I been nice since people was watchin movies on Beta
Ready to clap, everybody givin me that
Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps
You listen to y'all hits, then listen to our hits
Ain't nuttin y'all cowards could do but gossip
That's the reason now y'all players ain't got chips
Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick
Niggas thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel

You'll catch a hell of a Backdraft cause my fire retirin, aight then
It's my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a lover slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Wasted, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick
I Love money, but the scrambles hot

Girls are my profession and obsession, I place nothing above them
To me they're not possessions I really truly love them
Short ones, tall ones, big ones, small ones
Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall ones
Yo, I love them all, especially the cuties
The ones with the smooth complexion and shapely booties
With the type of bodies that'll make you say "Oh Boy" ya
But baby if you're ugly, I ain't got nothing for ya
I'm not conceited, I'm convinced that I've been naturally blessed
To be desired when naked and irresistible when dressed
And with that, brings that, breaks down resistance
Of me to a cutie, I bag them for instance
I seen a cutie with a bootie, wiggling just like Jell-O
Me being a player, I approached and said "Hello"
But she didn't hear me, so I tapped her softly
She turned around screaming on me "Back up off me"
I said damn, there is no need for hostility
I'm a mellow type of fellow but still with tranquility
She said "I recognize that all of y'all are the same
After only one thing, and I'm not simp for the game"
I said "Come on now sweetheart, do I look like a Player"
She said "Of course not...sike"
But for the sake of argument let me know the deal
I want to ask you

I'm as real as it gets
My name is not James Brown, but I could leave you in a "Cold Sweat"
And I bet, no ifs, ands or maybes
When I finish I'm a have you saying "Do Me Baby"
She said "Alright, I'ma give you a try"
Because she said "I think you're kind of fly and my type of guy"
She said her name is Crystal and kept a pistol on her
And she said if I ever cheated, believe I'd be a goner
So I played the perfect gentleman every time I was with her
And when I wasn't with her I was gone to get her
And when I wasn't going to get her, she was come to get me
And when she wasn't coming to get me, she was with me
So for awhile, everything was smooth
I waited and contemplated my next move
My instincts told me that the time was right
For us to get together for a magical night
So I called her, I said "Hello" she said "Hey, hold on
I already know what you have to say"
(DMX singing as if he was Crystal)
Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
Because I'm not too sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
For I don't know how I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I
 (Verse 3)
Hold on sweetheart, just chill, relax
You're telling me the answer and I didn't even ask
Don't you think, that we should be alone?
This isn't the type of thing to talk about over the phone
(DMX singing)
Why don't you come over and go with me
Come on over to my place
Where we can talk about it face to face, why don't ya
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
So we can discuss the terms of picking up the pace
She said "I thought about it, and I think that you're right
But my parents are home so it won't be tonight
But umm why don't you come over tomorrow at 8
My parents leave at 7:30 and won't be back until late"
I said bet, let me go and get set
Tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget
So the next day around 7:54
I fixed up like 6 times and then headed for the door
And when I stepped outside, I was asked where I was going
By detectives with .9 millimeters that was showing
I said "To me girls house", they said "No you aren't"
I said "Why not" they said "Because you a have warrant"
I said "That's impossible, how could that be?"
That said "It's right here, robbery, first degree"
Well, anyway, to make a long story short
I ended up in Valhalla going to court
So I called Crystal that night around 8
I said it's just a mix up and blamed it on fate
She told me that she loved me, I promise to wait
She said I'll see you at 4, at your next court date
Despite being locked up, things weren't bad
I still had my girl and for that I was glad
She always came to visit, didn't mind the hike
And every night I wrote her letters telling her things like
(DMX singing)
I can't fool myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say "I love you"
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop

 (Verse 4)
Days turn into weeks, weeks into months
Today's the 25th and I've only got mail..once
What has happened to my love life?
Oh do I feel like I've been stabbed into the back with a knife
I tried to believe, I said "She loves me, she does"
But deep down, I knew what the scoop really was
See Jody has my girl, and now she was gone
Just thinking about it had me singing every love song
I'm saying to myself, how could she do me wrong?
I said it's not her fault, I was away for too long
I thought I had a girlfriend, but now I know better
She told me that she wrote me but I never got the letter
And every time I tried to call her, nobody was home
And since I had to call collect she put a block on the phone
She told me she would visit, but damn I haven't seen her
You wanna know why, because Jody is in between her
Legs and getting busy, he even ate the coochie
Yo, I bought her everything from Fendi to Gucci
But Jody had something better, he didn't even have to sweat her
And if he doesn't have her by now, he's gonna get her
(DMX singing)
Caught in the middle I don't know what to do
What can you do when your girl is untrue
There's another man (another man)
In my life (in my life)
Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)
 (Verse 5)
Beating my time, another man...was lovin mine
I was upset, but there was other things on my mind
I would start trial soon, I was facing a lot of time
And on the day of trial, I was never for awhile
But when they said "Not guilty"
I stepped with a smile
Back to freedom, freedom on the streets again
But I had to go and see what was up with my friend
So I called her, just to make sure she was home
I said "Hello" and a man's voice answered the phone
I was confused, at first I didn't know what to do
He said "It's Jody, and what is it to you?"
So I hung up the receiver, picked up my gun and
Straight for Crystal's crib, I started running
Murder, murder, my finger's on the trigger
Murder, murder, I'm a murder this nigga
But then I thought, why should I do him
He wouldn't have the pussy if she didn't give it to him
I thought about killing him, I thought about it twice and
Nah, because it wouldn't be nice
But for the sake of curiosity I had to go and see Crystal
And I asked, why did it have to be me
I knocked on the door and just like before and
I heard another man's voice play me and couldn't take it anymore
The door opened up and Jody walked my vexed
He looked me up and down and said "I guess you're X"
Now here comes Crystal, yelling and fussing
Hollering and screaming, shouting and cussing
She looked at me inside and got quite in the hall
She said "When did you get home, and why didn't you call"
I turned around to leave, she said "Please don't go"
I said "You used to be my girl but you ain't nothing but a Ho
I understand because I'm a man, but there's no way I could stay"

In the ass and especially the mouth
You get on the radio and now you're from down south, the Bronx, or Brooklyn
Anywhere but from the Schlobohm
Sure you know the place that you left your mom...
I'm from motherfucking Y-O
Where the niggas is real and the bitches act like they know
You fuckin ho, you know I know
Cause my mutherfucking man Knock told me so
So did Little Jo, Big Coup and Derrick
Wash from School Street and can't forget Eric
Ain't you tired of getting hit with dicks
You even fucked my man Charles Oakley from the Knicks
You shouldn't use sex to get away from ???
You got niggas trooping to Fordham Road
Just to drop a load
Bitch you shouldn't have hoe'd
Everybody got your code
The pussy is sold - and your ass is fat
But I asked my man and he said it wasn't all that
Right about the time you were shopping the demo
He tore your ass up in the back of a limo
And you didn't even care
You left your mom in Schlobohm - on what WELFARE
Bitch you know you ain't right
Matter fact what are you doing at about 8 o'clock tonight
You got the boots and I'm coming to get 'em
Is it true that after you fuck 'em, you'll make a record with him
If so then I'll be there and it won't be hard to find me

Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder (aahhh!)
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (fo-fo!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
Man, listen, money is missing and shit is hectic
Found the safe, checked it
Shit looks detected
Just what I expected when I got no word from him
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (cash long!)
But money talks and most niggas is snakes
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take
Me to where he was at, checked my gat
Threw in a four clip, pumped myself up
Cause I can't go for that bullshit
Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you
Takin' back for niggas in New York and how they told me so
Now I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough
Layin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story
The famous "Oh you didn't know I got robbed!" story
Told it's to me he should be grateful to
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do
Now there's love lost and a double cross
Pointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce
So you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly
Five bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys
Ten g's in the shoebox under the bed
And for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head
And from then, the moral of the story if you missed it
Is the grain will always gonna be there (why nigga?)
Just never go against itEmbed
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from going under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, something I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends
Caps I fucked with are real, but hey
Those are your friends
Its just what you got coming sometimes you don't know
What you asking for, did you ask for more?
Should the casket door swing here, it is done
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin up or down what have you been provin'?
Jus that you were fuckin' ground
Bitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it
An I know that deep down you really don't want it
I woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on!

Families by the truckload, fleein' them to the morgue
Full moon, arooooo, the howlin', grrrrrrr
An growlin', shhhhhh, an prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is
What's gonna is what's gonna let niggas know
Why you bad in your house, an they lie up to your spouse
Told her it was suicide, but you an I
Both knew the truth, for we'd never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
Cuz you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here

You knowmsayin?
Any MC that disagree with me
Wave your motherfuckin arm
Cuz it can happen!
It ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cuz he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, yes
Ain't a whole lot to breaking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cuz thats how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin thing going down til I eat
So kill that beef? You betta while you still got teeth
'Cuz they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Copped out, through a you know what
Cuz you know why, and you know my
Motherfuckin name up in this game
And bitch, you know I
Will never be caught slippin', but on some east coast terms

Niggas get ate up, straight up, so bring another plate up
When I bitch slap a rapper if he can't hold his weight up
Last nigga was lucky, he only got mushed
I have the niggas falling off like they got pushed
And I get flows, straight from the get-go
Hit a nigga wit' fo rounds, that's split yo stomach
Coming through niggas like an obstacle course
A lock to the Source, give props to the boss
Unstoppable force, take it as a loss
That's what you get for getting fly with niggas
Roll with niggas niggas cause you cool with niggas
And you'll die with niggas, don't try this nigga
Cause I'm possessed bust a hole through his vest
Into his chest, strap your boots cause I'm stressed1Embed
Keep me runnin from the werewolf, owww

Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Trieed to strike back
Left him like that, layin up with the white hat
Gettin right back at ya when I snatch ya (Aight!)
Up out the grave, nuthin but bones and ashes
Hittin niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red (Heeey!)
But this girl gave me head for free
Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003 (2003!)
That Nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that
I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinkin and eventually
Found that's what you get for stinkin
Blowin up the spot when you rot

Uh, uh
Boom, boom, boom, open the door, atf
To late to send my girl downstairs to say he left
To the basement, go through the replacement door
Come up in my neighbor's yard, wit' a taste for war
You know I laced the four, wit' the hallows
Crack the safe, got the bottles
Whatchu want me to do?
Beep carlos!
Two houses over by the tall black fence
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this
There go a priest, yo, get in, you drive
What the f**k you doin nigga?
Tryin to stay alive
Cops on every corner, I lay back and try to cruise by
Who the f**k could'a snitched? must'a been a new guy
Damn, in back on our ass
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast
Tryin' to pull up on the side, but I'm packin' to blast
Tryin' to take the niggas heads off, f**k crackin' the glass
Hey, look out, (bark), damn
Came so close, you almost hit that bitch
Like you said nigga, almost
Shit, the cops hit her, and I know they ain't gon' leave her
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather
(breathing sounds)
Drop it on the floor, boom
Got it through the door, peddle to the floor, an office line
Death is in the air, and I don't know if it's mine
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is
And all I can think of is what about my kids
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more clips
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
Run through the fire, pull a gun from my boot out
Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear
I'm goin' out fast and the last thing I hear is
Boom, boom, boom, open the door, atfYou might also likeEmbed

Ain't no way for me to say just how deep the flow gets
Still waking up in cold sweats, over old threats
And I done did more time than a clock
From the Valhalla to the Rock
I represent on every block
Its the Dizark! Straight out the Grizound!
And from now on this is how Shizits going Dizown!
Clizown, come through squashing toes
Don't even breathe cause in jail you was washing clothes
Get in front of hoes and start fakin' G
Let you tell it, you getting dough like a bakery
Making me scheme and plot
Since yo ass like to dream I put that head to bed and you can dream a lot
Funny shit is before I shot tha nigga, you shoulda seen how the bitch came up out the nigga
Now I got the nigga but I could run up in 'em made 'em say "Daddy" before I put the gun up in 'em
Put one up in 'em, two three, empty the clip
Have his whole head looking like a busted lip
And I skip, cause I can't stand another case
Went to his wake so I could laugh at the look on his mother's face
Even though I know it ain't shit funny about knocking a nigga off just to get money
I still do what I gots to and just be grateful that I never got you cause I woulda SHOT YOU!

I been cruddy cause just long as I can remember since 1970 the 18 of December
Earl Simmons, the bastard that nobody wanted was born
Niggas showed me a joint made 'em run it, it's on
Can't a bank around the way say I ain't stuck it
Quick as I catch a body I can be one, so fuck it!
I ain't got shit to lose but my life
Plug you in the gut and watch the blood ooze down my knife
I laugh at death cause to me it's funny
Don't give a fuck about shit, what matters to me is money!
Sonny, I could teach yo ass a trick or two about stacking the dough, macking a hoe and what the dick'll do
I drove a bitch until the bitch is worthless
Have her sucking my mans dick and make it look good on the surface
A nigga get the same treatment
I'm leaving guts on walls, and brains all over the cement
But no remorse for the corpse cause I still kick 'em
He ain't bleeding enough so I stick 'em
And I will have another body
Kinda like how I feel when I'm blowing up another party
And shit is clicking in the hood now so I'm good now
Talking bout you good now
Oh, you would? How?

Plenty of niggas know dirty is how I do 'em
Push buckshots from a 30 right through 'em
Cause ain't none of ya'll motherfuckers built for war
And I lay down the law when I spray down ya door
Fuck around and my name'll be 19 5 be 64 11
On the 3 and a half to 7
But even up north I put niggas to waste so if you wanna stop the violence
GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!
Paroled in four, peeps hit the board off
Bitches is fucking but I sleeps with the sawed off!
I got shit to do, crews to break, moves to make
Wait for the news to break, I got dues to take
I don't joke cuz jokers is cards
And cards are what I pull
Infrared with the clip full, no leash on my pitbull
This shit is hot like the wax off a candle stick
But how I handle shit, is to dismantle shit (Dundundundunduhdada)
Like Popeye when it's spinach time, running through niggas like your tape at the finish line
What ya crew gonna do when I put the pressure on?
And it hurts wanna be gangstas in skirts?
And the bitch is coming all up out the nigga!
One false move and they mom's will read about the nigga
And they girls will be without the nigga
Matter fact, I'm tired of talking money throw ya joints up, let's scrap

"Can't touch me kid...word up...
Can't touch me kid...word up...
They can't touch me kid!
Word like can't touch me kid
Word to mans can't touch me kid
Cuz I get big can't touch me kid
Cuz that's how it is can't touch me kid
I lives how I lives can't touch me kid
Fresh off a bid can't touch me kid
Get the body and slid can't touch me kid
Yo I did what I did can't touch me kid

Ain't no talkin cause there ain't much that the dead can say

Rackin the hogs
Desert Eagle packin the morgues
Metal slabs with yellow tags on toes it's
What happens to those that
Chose to be foes and
Bet his man knows
But yo, we only get stronger
And the amount of time we're facing is only gettin longer
Get the mayor on the horn!
It's time for shit to go down
Strapped for the show down
Wet up yo crib, kick the door down
Know you schemin' so I gots to get you first
Put you right up in a brand new hearse
Could be worse
Shoulda seen what I gave this nigga
Two vests couldn't save this nigga
The way I laid this nigga
Played this nigga
But that's what I'm good at
Layin niggas out in fightin' pits and fuckin' hoodrats
Where's my fuckin' hood at?
I flip on niggas like snitches
Rip on niggas like bitches
Then pour niggas in ditches
They ain't found half the bodies that a nigga caught
Or should I say a nigga bought
Cause ain't nothing like getting' paid for, a nigga sport
Killed for what a nigga thought
But that's just how shit be
I know that one day they gon' try that shit wit me
But just as long as I'm on top of shit
I ain't stoppin shit
And ain't a motherfucker droppin' shit
Sat shorty down and told him how much his peeps missed him
Boom, one shot through his respiratory system
Kissed him good night, put him to bed
Put four mo to the head, so he know he understood what I said
Red was all over the place, it didn't look good
But I did what a crook would, searched the crib and took goods
And every night it's the stress
That makes me put another nigga to rest

Im bout to show yall niggas something for real
Catch it if you can baby

Niggas say I'm bugging
And ask me what's that shit I'm on
Cause I did them wrong, carry them greasy, and get 'em gone
What I'm on is some real "fuck the world" shit
And hoes like a cruddy nugga
So I'll fuck your girl, quick, that nigga Earl sick
That's what they used to say in school
Throwing chairs, and jigging niggas with pencils everyday in school
A wise man can play the fool for reasons of his own
I knew that I would understand them reasons when I'm grown
And now it's on
They started something they wasn't ready for
At the age of 10 I'm busting down a steady four
Comin out for visit but what's a visit when there's no home?
Other kids' parents like 'this little boy is so grown!'
I am what happens when you're raised in the streets
All I really want is to get praised in the streets
And he who lays in the streets with your last breath
Ask the Lord for forgiveness and you may have a fast death
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
I wanna see it when it's coming, so I can open faces
Open cases got me paying to stay out of jail
While these streets, got me to praying to stay out of hell
Slipped, and I fell, got back up - slipped again
But no matter what it's been, niggas never got a win
It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good with it
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood did it
Knew what I was doin, everyday that I've been doin it
Seein niggas havin a good time, so i'ma ruin it
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggas is puss!
Frontin like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu
Now peep what I just said and see how long it takes to hit you
Everybody knows you can talk all day
But when it's on what you gonna do - walk away?

To send me to the penitentiary, to knock out a 10 to 20
For the many lives I've destroyed and such
Ways that'll make the days of Freddy seem like a touch
Is it much asking to be left alone not to be bothered
Got bitches on my dick like I'm their baby's father

Every time
Every time they do it to me

I gotta make it out and move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me

I am the last hope, (The Champ!)
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon
I am the last hope

Damn, I went through it again
After telling everybody I wouldn't do it again
I kinda feel like I let my people down (yup)
But to get them right, I got's to pick myself up (come on)
When I heard this beat and hook, it was so raw (uhh)
Looked in the mirror, didn't like what I saw, (uhh)
All I could say was: ahh man shit gotta change (forreal!)
Either get it right or take one to the brain (blam!)
But y'all know the pain that I went through daily, (woooh)

I'mma thank you for it all, the blessings and the curses
And I hope you listening, there's a lesson in the verses
Yeah
I gotta make it out and move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope, (The Champ!)
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon
I am the last hope

Does it bother me?
Yeah off course it bothers me
Cause it's not who I am, I'm not you know, the person the media portrays me to be, ya mean?5Embed
Yo, ayo let's get papers and pop Mo' with hoes up in skyscrapers
In condominiums, overlooking our drug capers
New York City, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole committee like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin' through
I got niggas who pump on yo' block and in your spot
Who sit next to you? Protectin' you?
But they'll murder you, playa
Don status, nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, fronting, fronting in eclipsesis

Ayo, Ma$e and The LOX
We taking knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The Rikers, Sing Sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays wit niggas' names on it
Often I bug, then bust off on a thug
Have a chump coughing blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a TEC at Mason, have a explanation
You bring your crew and 'em and I'm doing 'em
Then I'm beating 'em down with aluminum
Then I'm putting two in 'em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant

Never turned down chocha, be in the Costa
Rica, sipping margaritas with a mami
Cleaning my Tommy, showing love to my army
Whenever The Lox find rippy blocks, we kill 'em
Yeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel 'em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissing us
My 16's be so real
You can feel 'em in your vein
Like Ramello's pops from Sugar Hill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spitting clips at your face
We started from the bottom, you'll see beg niggas' pardon
Whatever, we can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real, B
I'm making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty
I want a palace for my thugs, with oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs, get whacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only getting up, splitting up your anatomy
Official LOX family, grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you're smartest, and retaliate the hardest
Regardless, if you're a thug or a rap artist
Respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffing Nestle
And y'all niggas done starting something
Acting invincible like you God or something
If you God, then I'ma make salat 'til you rot
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start busting off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it

Don't come at me with no bullshit, use caution
'Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion and racketeering
Got niggas fearing, fuck whatchu heard, this what you hearing
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so give me 3 feet
'Cause when we creep, no more than 3 deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on your toe
Now who gon' tell your mother, her baby's under a cover
In the morgue, stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs?
Another hardheaded nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got what you came for
(What's that?) Surgery with the chainsaw
I hit the fucking streets
'Cause, like I said before, ain't nothing going down until I eat
Muh'fuckers think it's all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well, I'm testing bitches game, undressing bitches, and caressing bitches
And dealing with muhfuckers on all levels, what I'm dealing with is all devils
Fucking with snakes running with niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas
And scary niggas get it all the time
'Cause what they got is all of mine, your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck witchu
And if you with my man, then he getting stuck witchu
And gave it the money, 'cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest then I tossed the nine
Boss of crime, black Gotti, I stack bodies with the black shottie
Bitch-ass niggas that act snotty

On the strength that they don't know what they holding
Niggas caught me tail end cause the weight that I be sewing
Shit up cause I get up, off my ass and skate
Making more moves than u-haul, from state to state
I speak the great, and if a nigga tells you different

Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on!)
Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

When I think I don't deserve it, I think about Jesus
And the fact that he was perfect and he thinks that I'm worth it
I know I got a purpose, so when I don't like what I see in the mirror
I learn to look past the surface
Believe me God heard this, 'cause these words came from my heart
I was in pain, it was dark
Then came the spark to light down the road
To let me know that he would lighten up my load
And it's gon' get greater, later
God only wants the best for me, but the devil's a hater
I can see his eyes through the smiles of fake friends
If y'all think hate wins... just keep waitin'
At the end of the day who's will will you think will prevail
Or will you live to tell
Miracle after miracle it comes through
The spiritual individual is in you

Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on!)
Keep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

Motherfuckers' jeans is too tight to be fuckin' with dog

We ain't in no relationship, but do relationship things
No ring, but she slide through when I ring (Hands in the air)
Ha, let's put success to the side
I'd still be this fly if I worked at Popeyes
That's a whole lotta spinach, whole game full of gimmicks

In the name of Jesus, let us pray
Father, please walk with us through the bad times, as well as the good
May we be heard and understood, from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get our breakthrough, however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls and lay our fears to rest
For there's no way we could live for Jesus, when we're living in the flesh
So I pray that you will allow our spirits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, chapter two, versе fifteen
"Do not love the world or anything in the world," and wе know what that means
But listen
We know that distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin'
But that doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord, you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men to respect their ladies
But lately, so many of us have gone astray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please, bring us back home
And instill in us the Word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to
Yet, we receive so little
Because this time in our spiritual warfare
We're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the anointing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise, our prayers sincere
Our heads to the sky, you will diminish our fears
In Jesus' mighty name, we are brave, amenYou might also like3Embed

At the shoulder and beat your head with it cause I’m colder than the Arctic
So I write nothing but frozen rhymes
Only eat frozen foods, but I can cook frozen minds
Run it to bear the mark of the beast, I be the spark of the East
That shit you talk, in the dark it’ll cease
Slide out like grease, cause I’m slick like that
What’s up with your man, sucking my dick like that?
Riding rough is how we do things, it’s a crew thing
And swinging on my nuts cause more than likely cause yes they do hang
Banged ya up so bad you couldn’t get help from Maaco
Stuck into my grave like Dave out in Waco
So take yo, nondescript ass, bitch ass
To back where you came from, quick fast, or get trashed
Like the garbage, cause that’s just what yo style is
And I see y’all niggas really don’t know what wild is
Have you ever been through a fifth story window
Or shook my a jet black pit with some brindle
Got shot at, or got shot, nine slugs is hot
Go through that, and then you might be on my level…NOT
Yo give money some room, not, fuck it you heard my peeps
And they don’t usually say much, cause they just creep
So you know that your ass is ghost with your rep
So the thing is how you leaving, through the window or the stepsYou might also likeEmbed

But it's too late cuz the heat-seaker done found the heat
The concrete done found your meat
Guts hittin the ground still hot from steam comin off
Eyes rolled back in his head, coughin up chunks of flesh
Then niggas'll roll with his monstrous death, beatin punks to death
Ain't nuthin left but the memory of what used to be your life
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on
You up in the casket with some shades, cuz your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid
But you made it happen, with that bullshit you did
Now you want peace? Well take a piece of this ammunition
And get your ass drug out the Hudson by some old man fishin

Time wasting, wrong things that I'm chasing
Eating but don't like what I'm tasting
Everything I thought I want and hunted for
Had me wondering what did I want it for
Headed down the wrong path, self-destructive
What's my function? I know I am good for something
Lord let me know if my suffering will be in vain

Or how much longer will a stain
By the blood has been shed through out my life, remain
Or how much longer will the pain in the flame

In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
Cause I know that this is where I wanna be

Got a lot to say, but don't know who to talk to
Step with a purpose, but don't know where to walk to
Anything I ever said, ever meant something?
I know, because the person I said it to, told me it meant something
My life has a meaning, my life has a purpose
No matter how dark it gets, I knew that it was worth it
Fuck what it looked like on the surface
Seen it all, but not all heard us, like sometimes i was worthless
Can't expect everybody to get what you doing
Can't expect them all to be with what you doing
Don't give a fuck if a motherfucker hate me
What you think it is with me, but whats good with you lately
I hate when i sense this shit, trying to make sense of this shit knowing that its sensitive shit

Born with addiction with fast living with high stakes
I race down a highway of life with no breaks
Make no apologies for the risks that I take
And manning up to the repercussions that I face
No silver spoon, I was raised in a crowded room
Rarely seen the sun, faced a lot of gloom
I hit the streets too soon before 21
Working on the clock since and on it until I'm done
I'm never clocking out, but always locking in
I had a warm heart, lost a lot of friends
And losing them make me feel like I was drowning
So please forgive the chill I know you feel when you around me
Dreamed of living right, big family, the picket fence
Grandkids I will get to share my story with
But here I am, living vile as I stand ground
Just hope it doesn't end, with shots fired, man down


If I could bottle the inspiration
I'd be a billionaire, straight fuckin villain yeah
X, baby you still in here
I feel the air, I can smell the death in it
We were all left in it, so fuck nigga, step with it
The walk is easy, the journey ain't worth nothing
That's why every day a nigga wanna hurt something
But, I made progress, more or less
If I can avoid the stress, I can avoid the rest
A nigga stay dealing with the bullshit daily
Niggas is worse than the bitches, y'all hear me?
Straight up and fed up (what!), i'll have you sprayed up and wet up (what!)
Now you laid up and won't get up
