Yo' trap don’t boom like mine
Yo' paper ain't longer than mine
Aw man, aw man, aw man, aw man
Yo’ bitch ain't finer than mine
Yo' rims ain' taller than mine
Aw man, aw man, aw man, aw man

I got diamonds on my neck, and I ain't even gotta flex
Everybody know we got stacks on deck
Hood rich, another nigga from the projects
With more hoes than a  got Tecs
Aw man, imma' fool on 24's, on the trunk, I got ham on them skinny hoes
You talking pounds? That ain't shit, we got plenty those
And if you talking white, boy, we got plenty 
Dreads hanging out the hat, smoking purple dro’
Big bank in the building, imma’ let em' know
Niggas hating, we get money either way it go
My cliеntele, feed well, еven when it’s low

Yo' trap don't boom like mine
Yo' paper ain’t longer than mine
Aw man, aw man, aw man, aw man
You might also likeYo' bitch ain't finer than mine
Yo' rims ain' taller than mine
Aw man, aw man, aw man, aw man

Imma' lean with it, serving fiends with it, on the block since the age of 13 with it
In the kitchen, water whipping, a thousand eight grams, I'm standing over the stove and I'm doing it with one hand
Aw man, 2 man, , 207 gram, got yam, I'm , I'm selling that grown man
Aw man, I'm on that kush tonight, and I ain't stopping, choppa hit you and your body stop rocking
My chain got Pneumonia, watch got the bird flu, came to the club smelling like a pound of purple
Big Cat Records, nigga it's a movement, this ain't hip-hop this is drug dealing music

Yo' trap don't boom like mine
Yo' paper ain't longer than mine
Aw man, aw man, aw man, aw man
Yo' bitch ain't finer than mine
Yo' rims ain' taller than mine
Aw man, aw man, aw man, aw man

I'm in a drop-top Chevy, same colour as the Reese's car
Chocolate outside, can't forget the peanut butter guts
And call me Coca-Cola, cause I keep the yoda man
I got a hundred pounds stashed in the trashcan
My wrist rock though, same say its frostbit
I'm young money, so the young dude hood rich
I get money partner, I make 
I hit the club, let em' know what it stands for
I'm in the '06, that's a Benz bitch
I clean myself constantly, cause I'm the shit
I got a old school, might remind you of a 
The chain , might remind you of some Skittles
Yo' trap don't boom like mine
Yo' paper ain't longer than mine
Aw man, aw man, aw man, aw man
Yo' bitch ain't finer than mine
Yo' rims ain' taller than mine
Aw man, aw man, aw man, aw manEmbed
