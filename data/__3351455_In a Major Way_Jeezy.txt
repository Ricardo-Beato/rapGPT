9 ContributorsIn a Major Way Lyrics
Multi-millionaire bitch I'm straight from the hood
Sucka niggas hating on me but it's all good
Lil' one just hit my phone said he want a half
Told him thirteen-five you bitches you do the math
Bought a white Corvette with the residue
Run through the hunnids towards the finish I'm counting revenue
Now when my partner walked in like "what's that?"
Let's get money my nigga time to bounce back

Real niggas get the cash in a major way
Lotta horses and it's fast in a major way
Bought the iced out Rollie in a major way
All bright looking holy in a major way
Boss nigga boss shit in a major way
Flaunt nigga, floss shit in a major way
Still do it for my town in a major way
Move that white and that brown in a major way

Real niggas getting real shit
And if you 'bout that floss shit, get loked bitch
Just know that I was hands on, I paid dues
Took 'em 'side that 75, I made moves
You know who I am boy? The living legend
Ever since I hit the boulevard in that 911
You ain't got to take my word, you can ask Lil Zay
Fit the family with them birds you can ask Lil Jay
Niggas talking like they big, but guess who's bigger
Niggas talking like they real, but guess who's realer
Fuck the hating motherfuckers see I came up out the gutter
And I've been on my grind since I came out my mother
Bad bitch on my line I told her she gotta wait
'Cause me and my money on a motherfucking date
Got a trick up on the spot, know I got at least a million there
Tell you 'bout the time I made these niggas millionaires
In a major way
You might also like
Real niggas get the cash in a major way
Lotta horses and it's fast in a major way
Bought the iced out Rollie in a major way
All bright looking holy in a major way
Boss nigga boss shit in a major way
Flaunt nigga, floss shit in a major way
Still do it for my town in a major way
Move that white and that brown in a major way

Balling in a major way, day to day
On a paper chase, no cell phones, it's only face to face
30 for the Rollie just because it shows the day and date
Outside the club killers with me with their favorite K
Damn that coupe sexy that's what ladies say
'Vette white, Mercedes gray
Pockets full of cash off my latest play
I've been getting money like I'm touring heavy state to state
Used to chop every last gram until I scrape the plate
Four niggas looking like we signed to major labels
Dining at Katanas twelve phones on the table
Buncha horses parked outside, the lot a stable
If you know us then you know this shit is not a fable
What you see is diamond chains on everybody's neck, everybody flexing
Hit the club and everybody sweat and everybody's stressed
Niggas talking big shit boy go do better
What you copping man we pass that out as testers, this forever
Real niggas get the cash in a major way
Lotta horses and it's fast in a major way
Bought the iced out Rollie in a major way
All bright looking holy in a major way
Boss nigga boss shit in a major way
Flaunt nigga, floss shit in a major way
Still do it for my town in a major way
Move that white and that brown in a major wayEmbed
