25 ContributorsAll Around The World Lyrics
Just Blaze, haha (Yeah, yeah)
Swag, haha (Aha)
Uh, and this the best day ever (Hey)

I got my cup filled up (Filled up)
We came to have a good time, so turn my music high
We gon' tear this place up (Place up)
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody (Uh)
We party all around the world, we party all around the world
We party all around the world, we party all around the world

Hey, hey, hey, hey
I got my cup filled, bitches all around me, on some bachelor shit
Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world, I use my atlas, make a map of it
Globe trotter, ho hopper, superstar, asterisk
People always wonder, so they ask us who we are (Are)
Rollin' up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar (Bar)
Wanna be on top and tryna get there by tomorrow
See the money, bitches, bubbly, designer clothes, foreign cars
But I (I,) ain't never gonna change, different city every day
You hear these people scream my name
They think I'm underage, and don't know shit about the game
'Til I'm drunk as fuck, on the couch, pourin' out champagne
Livin' life like it's my job, and I don't ever take a day off
Shit ain't been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some "I don't give a fuck" shit
Still with my homies I came up with
So celebrate the fact that we young, rich, and famous
You might also like
I got my cup filled up (Filled up)
We came to have a good time, so turn my music high
We gon' tear this place up (Place up)
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody (Uh)
We party all around the world, we party all around the world
We party all around the world, we party all around the world

Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France
Bitches of every nationality, get up and dance
So, let me see your hands please
We makin' noise like a stampede
So much smoke up in this bitch, you can't breathe
Somewhere where it's sandy, Cali or Miami
This the only way to do, and never made a plan B
Can't we get it how we live?
Tonight ain't the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls comin' all dressed up, then they takin' off their clothes (Clothes)
You know your man a amateur, come party with some pros (Pros)
You need somethin' new, I know your life is gettin' old (Old)
But we ain't gettin' younger, so tonight's the night to go (Go)
So (So,) crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like your cash right
This is fast life, don't you worry, baby, we ain't here to slow it down
Tonight we goin' crazy, and tomorrow you can hold me down
I got my cup filled up (Filled up)
We came to have a good time, so turn my music high
We gon' tear this place up (Place up)
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody (Uh)
We party all around the world, we party all around the world
We party all around the world, we party all around the world

Let's go around the world (Hey), around the world
Around the whole wide world (And it's the best day ever)
The whole wide world, go around the world, around the world
Around the whole wide world, the whole world
Around the world, around the whole wide world
Whole wide world, the whole wide world, the whole wide world
Around the whole wide world, the world
