You! Yeah
The war is on, who you fighting for?

It's like funk to rhythm and punk to rock
Loud like shot that come from a Glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot, that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
They cooking the raw to start to lump knots
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a- (scratches)
Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path, I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered? You forgot the mission
Listen!

All traces of life, in our guts we carry
That's used to dress humanity (it's a new wave, come on!)
All things I yearn for, you need per sanity
That reflex loves reality (it's the new wave, dig it!)
Clean up the choirs, tell me they shouldn't be
The times are reaching to the end (it's a new wave, come on!)
This life is precious, it's goddamn marvelous
Before it likely ever ends (come on, come on!)
You might also like
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
For the people to make or wait is better
In a room called real, I stay forever
Everyday I lose something, I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some is like planes, umbrella
Where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind stream like Al Green, it stay together
How could a nigga be so scared of change?
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Y'all rich, we could beef curry in the game
Out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go bang
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main
Stream, it all seems mundane in the scope of thangs

All traces of life, in our guts we carry
That's used to dress humanity (it's a new wave, come on!)
All things I yearn for, you need per sanity
That reflex loves reality (it's the new wave, dig it!)
Clean up the choirs, tell me they shouldn't be
The times are reaching to the end (it's a new wave, come on!)
This life is precious, it's goddamn marvelous
Before it likely ever ends (come on, come on!)
From a land of shit talk, porn stars and pitchforks
Didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent off in backyards
Wishing in the air for a black god
Where the people fix cars and clap hard
And look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
That master anger, and ain't afraid to shoot
Through poured liquor, fallen angels they salute
(Whew! Whew!) Feel the wind blow
A new wave, people with they hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This new age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels, who rock heavy metals
And tell them that they pharaoh so let go
Come on!

All traces of life, in our guts we carry
That's used to dress humanity (it's a new wave, come on!)
All things I yearn for, you need per sanity
That reflex loves reality (it's the new wave, dig it!)
Clean up the choirs, tell me they shouldn't be
The times are reaching to the end (it's a new wave, come on!)
This life is precious, it's goddamn marvelous
Before it likely ever ends (it's the new wave, come on!)
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!Embed
