5 ContributorsFNF Army Invades LyricsOnce upon a time
At the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as happy folk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, strange folk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage
Hidden behind dark glasses
And no one noticed them
They only saw shadows
You see
Without the truth of the eyes
The happy folk were blindYou might also likeEmbed
