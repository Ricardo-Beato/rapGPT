Yeah
Come on up to my room, baby
I got a surprise for you
Now you know what the surprise is?

Come on and go with me
Come on up to my room, baby
That's what I mean
Come on and go with me
Ooh, come on up to my room, baby
I'm telling you
Come on and go with me
Oh-oh, come on up to my room, baby
Woah, baby, come on and go with me
I'm waitin' for you, I've been waitin' all night long
I got a big chunk of whole dick, waitin' for you
I want you to grab this dick and rock my world all night
I love you, it's so juicy, internal feel
Come on, baby, oh, let me save you
With this big old juicy piper, man
I wanna pump you, drop my nuts
Make me, make me feel so good
'Cause my nuts is so tender and warm for you
I want you, oh, come on, come on
Let me give you a lift with your hands
Get on the phone and told my friend Taylor
Oh, come on, come on
I got somethin' for you
It's so good, all in your lanes
Get it in your mouth when I put it in your booty-hole, baby
I got to, I got to, oohYou might also likeEmbed
