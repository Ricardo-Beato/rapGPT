9 ContributorsGetting To Tha Money Lyrics
Its a damn shame, all these damn diamonds
Its a damn shame, the way diamonds be shinin’
Its a damn shame, the way the migos stunting’
Young and we up always getting to the money
Young and we getting to the money
You know my team getting to the money
Getting to the money
You know my team getting to the money

Its a damn shame, Its a damn shame
Just copped a foreign now I’m in the fast lane (Skrt, skrt-skrt)
Yes, yes i cash out, pockets on big momma house
I should ride to the club with all my chains out
I should ride up to the club with all my bank out
I should stand on stage and throw the racks out
I’m signing autographs to the fans off in the crowd
I know you see that 100k rose gold in my mouth (Rose gold)
I know you see the swag that yo bitch talking bout
I don’t need to mention, pay yo hoe no attention (No)
Yeah i took yo hoe when you thought she was missing’ (She gone)

Its a damn shame, all these damn diamonds
Its a damn shame, the way diamonds be shinin’
Its a damn shame, the way the migos stunting’
Young and we up always getting to the money
Young and we getting to the money
You know my team getting to the money
Getting to the money
You know my team getting to the money

I’m getting to the money, that M. O. N. E. Y
I never tell no lie, if it don’t got no money, like a crybaby I cry
Tell no lie I’m on fire I’m worldwide like Wi-Fi
I got bands, I got racks, I got cheese, I got mula
I could put a hitman on you and you don’t know who the shooter
Me and my nigga we crazy, me and my nigga retarded
Me and my nigga go hard, yeah we go the hardest, like cali, but I’m not cali
I fuck with louis and Bally, Truey stuff with sally
Me and money we married
I would split your head for the cabbage
If a young nigga don’t have it I’mma get money savage

Its a damn shame, all these damn diamonds
Its a damn shame, the way diamonds be shinin’
Its a damn shame, the way the migos stunting’
Young and we up always getting to the money
Young and we getting to the money
You know my team getting to the money
Getting to the money
You know my team getting to the moneyEmbed
