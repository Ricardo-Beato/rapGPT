I just bought a coupe about a week ago
You know what this is

Look, I just bought a coupe about a week ago (pressure)
See straight through them diamonds, VVS's hoe (pressure)
That pressure had them niggas on some sucker shit (pressure)
That pressure fuck around and make your partner snitch (pressure)

Probably on some shit you niggas never be
Stay the fuck from 'round them, that's what my conscience tellin' me
Better pay attention, best be watchin' where ya goin' bitch
'Cause when ya get in my lane that's when I get to towin' shit
I done been through so much, I seen so much fuck shit
When you talk down on me, I don't give a fuck bitch
I just want some more paper, I just need some more haters
I just bought a new crib, I don't want no neighbors
Guess I'm anti-social, I don't want no new friends
Y'all waitin' for handouts, Y'all niggas ain't men
Pressure make ya dawg straight flip-flop
Pressure have a nigga wanna hit ya for ya wristwatch
Screamin' old scrub ass nigga, fake love ass nigga
Every time I be grindin', you in the club ass nigga
That insane chain in that white Mulsanne
Shit off on my pinky, lookin' like a mood ring
I'm talkin' pressure

Aye, that pressure affect every nigga a different way
How he shoot you in your ass and you still in his face?
I shot up at a nigga feet but I ain't hit his Js
Just tryna scam, if I was him I'd have killed me anyway
Only reason I did the verse, 'cause I fuck with Jeezy
I'm out of jail, last year that nigga flew and see me
Yup, VV gleamin', teeth blingin'
I'm so icy, I'm freezin', no fan ceilin'
She gimme head like a nerdy but she failed at readin'
I'm just hollerin' at my crucifix, yeah, I'ma demon
I'm 'bout to bring these niggas that pressure, forget the pre-nup
Bullets be flying out my desert, eagle

Look, I just bought a coupe about a week ago (pressure)
See straight through them diamonds, VVS's hoe (pressure)
That pressure had them niggas on some sucker shit (pressure)
That pressure fuck around and make your partner snitch (pressure)

Apply that pressure, bust a pipe (aye)
VVS's on my pinky, knots (aye)
That Bentley coupe my favorite ride (aye)
This ain't electric but my niggas slide (aye)
I just pressed a nigga 'bout a week ago
They say he talkin', I'm around, he never speakin' tho
Just pull up on these niggas, that's they weakness, bro
I meet the ho, beat the ho, then need a ho
She pressure, my necklace, is shinin', I'm special
My niggas, get money, no, we can't help you
I'm selfish, I'm greedy, not needy
I'm gangsta, on bloods, this money shit come easy
Lay up, neglect her, eject her
'Cause I don't do Rebeccas
The way you hop in my whip, I don't like your jester
You gotta have class the whole year, not a semester
Think before you speak, I got westside extras

Look, I just bought a coupe about a week ago (pressure)
See straight through them diamonds, VVS's hoe (pressure)
That pressure had them niggas on some sucker shit (pressure)
That pressure fuck around and make your partner snitch (pressure)
Look, I just bought a coupe about a week ago (pressure)
