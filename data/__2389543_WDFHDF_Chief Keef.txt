26 ContributorsWDFHDF Lyrics
What da fuck, how da fuck did you let your friends come, ayy
In between us and what we’ve done
How da fuck, what da fuck your thot thought this shit was, ayy
Nigga dream money, get you big money
How da fuck, what da fuck, Sosa got that good stuff
Since I smoked that good pack, ayy, I won't look back
What da fuck, how da fuck you fit those subs on yo trunk
Baby, I got the tool in it, bitch, I'm the mechanic

I'm the mechanic, one-eyed bandit
Fix this shit with all-white linen
I done got my diamonds dirty now I got to go and clean them
Pulled up, bitch, what's happening
Bitch, she's down to hop in traffic
Walk up in the stores, I'm cashin'
Then I'm walking the fuck up out it
Niggas faggots, bitches maggots
Riding fast, thought it was tragic
Love Ben Franklins, thought it was magic
Uncle Sammy, bitch, I'm taxin'
Bling bling, racks in my jeans
Bling bling, look at my ring
Bling bling, look at my chain
Ring ring with my ring
Smoke K.I, smoke Tooka, K.I was a shooter
And I'm Almighty but I got on fuckin' Buddhas
300 for these this Trueys
500 for the new ones
I riding with my boo thang
Finna pick up my new thang
You might also like
What da fuck, how da fuck did you let your friends come, ayy
In between us and what we’ve done
How da fuck, what da fuck your thot thought this shit was, ayy
Nigga dream money, get you big money
How da fuck, what da fuck, Sosa got that good stuff
Since I smoked that good pack, ayy, I won't look back
What da fuck, how da fuck you fit those subs on yo trunk
Baby, I got the tool in it, bitch, I'm the mechanic

Had to paint my car red, fire red
Pull a hoe like, "Aw shit"
Talk shit, niggas like to talk shit
'Cause they walkin', aw shit
Pull up on them bitches like, "Aw shit"
This dope got me coughin'
Thought I was going up in a coffin
Aw shit, what them niggas say when we pull up sparkin'?
We ain't parkin'
Got a bad ass bitch riding for me

What da fuck, how da fuck did you let your friends come, ayy
In between us and what we’ve done
How da fuck, what da fuck your thot thought this shit was, ayy
Nigga dream money, get you big money
How da fuck, what da fuck, Sosa got that good stuff
Since I smoked that good pack, ayy, I won't look back
What da fuck, how da fuck you fit those subs on yo trunk
Baby, I got the tool in it, bitch, I'm the mechanicEmbed
