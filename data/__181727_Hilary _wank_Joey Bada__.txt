88 ContributorsHilary $wank Lyrics
We don't say swag no more, we say swank
Yo, yo, hip-hop's a jungle

Uh, lost in his time, I'm just tryna get it like a boss in his prime
These fake niggas sublime, light for fine sights
Wishing we'll fortune but the price ain't quite right
The slice ain't quite ripe
Still pulling strings how I fly but I don't like kites
How they gon' treat Brooklyn's finest not as fine as diamonds?
And fine nice, surrounded by hard flow like Icelands
Now we getting icing, finances nice
And I don't like surprises, I like superb prices rising
It's the least I could do, these verses priceless
Rehearse in private, reverse her eyelid until she curse in silent (insolent)
Got a problem solve it, all my Pros solids
We all gon' dine and until then we mobbing
So don't push me, uh, I'm close to the pussy
Even closer to the knowledge, dropped out of college in advance
Then hit the ground running like it's ants in my pants
Honey, Pop was a bumbaclot and had a queen bee Mommy
Uh, I love her to the tissue, disrespect my blood and it's an issue
She like, "This you on the cover for real? Ah, you so official"
Now go ahead and buy you some shoes that really fit you
I know she always think of little me, but now I got big literally
Worldwide and physically
I'm saying I used to take walks around Little Italy
Now I roam 'round Sicily and I'm plotting on a milli
You might also like
Hmmm, another loud pack, another proud cat
Hey, pound that, hip-hop sounds been profound back
Slow down that metronome, nigga
Let it hit home when the specimen showin' gon' glitter
Gold and ices trigger, your true ideology
I can subtract one with the gun, that's true trigonometry
But that won't coincide with the true nigga that I'mma be
He's royal poverty, I kicks philosophies
Not because I rock soccer tees
I ain't gon' beg but I can please
Rock your socks and sockets out your knees
Fulfil your needs with similes non-similar
Spit that unfamiliar, put that on familia
If you love hip-hop, ladies, rub your papillas
And fellas beat they chest like they silverback gorillas
It's the new age, children of the crystal healers
Thinking I butterfly, I try catapult caterpillars

After years of constructing they start assumptions
So I keep my circumference of deep fried friends like dumplings
But fuck that, my nigga, we munching, we hungry
After years of constructing they start assumptions
So I keep my circumference of deep fried friends like dumplings
But fuck that, my nigga, we munching, we hungry
Swanking, Swanking, Swanking
I see you, Jigga! Hilary Swanking
Alright, I'm off this33Embed
