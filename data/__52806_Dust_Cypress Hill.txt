7 ContributorsDust LyricsAs we bust out on the scene like a machine with a team
Looking for theme between cracks searching for cream
Physical energy can never be lost
Never be cleverly read or took on into the search of your own
Suckers are looking for treasures and pleasures endeavors images of plastic
Material whenever you're ready and steady rolling with deadly and friendly
Territorial glorious story I've heard nothing but hate for me
Coming from ghetto the gueros are holding the metal
Settle for gas as we passing you by sticking the pedal
Down to the floor and the horror is starting to pour
Everything I just threatened your blood you can't take it no more
Why did you try to forget it I said it to FUCK OFF!!
Now you'll be headed said I'm making you try to do laws
That's what you get for fronting I'm hunting em all
Giving them suckers a push and they fall

Got what you want got what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assassins we smokin
420 all day we ain't joking
Serving up none less than the hard stuff
Excess of the zes make it sound right
Beat it up all you want it's a damn right
Get up in my way I'll smoke your ass like dust
You might also like???? is loaded with snakes serpents who come and they take
Pieces of those who they break bodies are found in the lake
Only the victim is passed you got what you wanted last
Pockets are loaded with cash now that you're actually grass
Time keeps ticking and slipping away
Look at you tricking I'm sicking its clicking the trigger
And so is your place
Only the strong will survive hoping to keep it alive
I'll never be denied watch in who you confide
People are out on the prowl looking for those
Who obey dying like these killas defy so I keep fucking with y'all
Join fucking with the pace your just a waste in my face
Hit you with bass in your case give you all just a taste
Even the lemo the rebel bringing the metal with treble
So many rebels incredible time we battle
You're looking for answers no chances or victory dances
Don't give me no glances you'er all through in time no advances

Got what you want got what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assassins we smokin
420 all day we ain't joking
Serving up none less than the hard stuff
Excess of the zes make it sound right
Beat it up all you want it's a damn right
Get up in my way I'll smoke your ass like dust
Under the heavens with weapons step in directions of flesh and feeling the heat
The tension now dissin' and stressin'
Life is a battlefield the gat'll kill really die
Think of how that'll feel Sen will gladly build up your high
And going through changes the pages keep turning and burning
The rage is concerning the stage is becoming the sermon
Searching for harmony you wanna be balling me
But you never get no where cause I'm killing your whole philosophy
Rising like temperature a signature flow when we just scavengers
And wait your posse watch I'm truly tipping ya
Must be sipping the liquid to try to get with the sickness
Only the hardest will limp in and only the thrill when we get it?
I'm an assassin of soul out of control when I roll
You better hide in your hole I got your name on my skull
There ain't no running from me assassin are cunning you see
Blasting at those who obey clashing and lashing the weak!

Got what you want got what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assassins we smokin
420 all day we ain't joking
Serving up none less than the hard stuff
Excess of the zes make it sound right
Beat it up all you want it's a damn right
Get up in my way I'll smoke your ass like dust1Embed
