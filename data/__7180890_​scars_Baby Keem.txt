I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart

Yeah, yeah, already livin' my truths
Can't sabotage my love for nothing
'Member I had to choose, "Lord, help me" 'cause I couldn't say nothin'
This remind me of them days before I was buzzin'
Whеn my auntie told me
"Come insidе the house, you make a mess, I'll kick you out"
Don't saturate my love for some respect, I cannot vouch
Judgin' from my shoes and all they seein' is the couch
My moral what I stand on so I got up and I bounced

I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
You might also like
(Mmm-mmm)
In the backseat, holdin' on for dear life, I must
(Mmm-mmm)
Runnin' them streets, thinkin' that I'll never get touched
(Mmm-mmm)
I've hit the point where enough is never enough, yeah
I gotta see my ceiling with those I trust (Ooh-ooh)
I'd rather feed my feelings with those I lust (Ooh-ooh)
You know what it means, I had low self-esteem
We was livin' on the east side
And I had to pack up my things when my mama was 'sleep
Two kisses to the peace sign
That's when life was on the decline
Two bus passes I'll be fine

I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
(Close your mind a little bit)
Can you blame us?
(Random thoughts in my head)
You can blame us
(Can't get the bad out my head)
Can you blame us?
(Is this from the pain I had)
Can you blame us? (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
I need a new fixation (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Open the conversations (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Starting to lose my patience (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Inviting new temptations

I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart23Embed
