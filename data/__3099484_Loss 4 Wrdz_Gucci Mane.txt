Ha
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words

Geeked up, she can't even talk
Damn, it's all my fault
Got me nervous 'cause she took a molly
She can't even walk
High as fuck, we can't even fuck
Throwed up on my Chucks
Just my luck that I caught a slut
Can't even mother
Fell asleep and woke up
With a model when you came
And she shake like a Coke bottle
Baby, what's your name?
Reminiscent, got me thinkin'
Damn, Guwop, I'm off the chain
Fucked so many famous bitches
But I'm scared to name they names
There's so many drugs I lost my mind
But I'm not ashamed
I grew up sellin' cocaine
In love with Mary Jane
Pay attention, this non-fiction
I couldn't even make it up
Drinkin' lean like I'm Pimp
One day, I might not wake up
A description of a young black man
Trappin' with a pistol
Wanna kill just like Tony did
When Manny fucked his sister
Monkey nuts on a Glock .40
I can go gorilla
So I'll point, he said 12 comin'
I done peeped the signal
You might also like
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words

Maybach Music
My Bentley ridin' on Timbalands
Painted mine like cinnamon
Burnin' weed in the Benjamin
Really high on my adrenaline
40 points, 10 assists
Game over, hit or miss
Mary J, they reminisce
Bitch niggas been on the list
One stack and the guns clap
Run the label like I run the trap
All sauce like I'm on the Perc'
Biggest boss with the warmest verse
Ladies stunned when I'm on the scene
Biggest guns, glowin' Bs
Homies had to kill for your charm
I gave the chain back to your mom
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words3Embed
