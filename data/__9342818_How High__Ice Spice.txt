I'm a baddie, but I got feelings too
I remember you had both of us skippin' school
We were so young, had niggas actin' a fool
You was cryin' out for help, I promise, I never knew
When I found out, I was feelin' wocky
You said that you love me 'cause I'm bougie and I'm cocky
Climbin' up the ranks on your own could get rocky
But I keep it pushin' knowin' that they'll never stop me

Yeah, I know he want me, but he rather just lie (Lie)
If I tell him, "Jump," he gon' ask me, "How high?" (High)
And I know his fears, but he never met mine (Mine)
Never mеt mine, never, nеver met mine (Damn)
Yeah, I know he want me, but he rather just lie (Lie)
If I tell him, "Jump," he gon' ask me, "How high?" (High)
And I know his fears, but he never met mine (Mine)
Never met mine, never, never met mine

He like, "Na-na-na-na, I just want us to make up"
He like, "Na-na-na-na, like, how far can we take us?"
On my m-m-m-mind (Grrah), it's already made up
Missin' when we was laid up, I'm busy chasin' the paper (Grrah)
When I wanted Givenchy, remember I couldn't buy it
So then I linked up with RIOT, but first, we prayed to the Highest
And started gettin' them write-ups (Like), and then they crowned me the princess
So, I'm most grateful, your highness, and now we poppin' them ciders (Like)
Let me put you on to how a bad bitch think
And it's all tens when my bad bitch link
Wanna see me fall (Grrah) is a mad bitch kink
Let me get my strap, and I hit her like, "Bink"
She gon' catch what I'm throwin' (Grrah)
I see the snakes when I'm mowin'
And, yeah, they pop up like clonin'
So I just pop it like hoeing
Now, she on the floor (Like) when I'm kickin' the door
How you mad I do less (Damn), 'cause you gotta do more?

If I tell him, "Jump," he gon' ask me, "How high?" (High)
And I know his fears, but he never met mine (Mine)
Never met mine, never, never met mine (Damn)
Yeah, I know he want me, but he rather just lie (Lie)
If I tell him, "Jump," he gon' ask me, "How high?" (High)
And I know his fears, but he never met mine (Mine)
Never met mine, never, never met mine

Mine, met mine
Met mine
Met mine
Met mine
Met mine
Met mine
