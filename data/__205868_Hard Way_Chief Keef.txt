28 ContributorsHard Way Lyrics
Squad
Squad, squad, squad, squad

Smokin' dope, gotta fight out the hard way
Don't make us make you find out the hard way (Bang, bang)
Bitch, we do it the smart way (O'Block)
Bitch, I'm O'Block and I do it the squad way
Bitch, it's the hard way or the squad way (O'Block)
And bitch, we love the hard way (Huh)
Don't make us start sprayin' in broad day (Bang bang)
Leave a opp' brains in they hallway

I put 30 seconds on my beat, and
I be so high, so damn high that you can't see, and
I be chiefin' keef, and these bitches love Chief Keef
'Cause he keep a couples G's, got LV's and double G's
My LV's ain't make believe, double G's a couple G's
Nigga must be drinkin' lean if he think he can fuck with me
I sting like a bumble bee, and this shit ain't nothing to me
And I fucked lotta hoes, man, a bitch ainâ€™t nothing to me

Smokin' dope, gotta fight out the hard way
Don't make us make you find out the hard way
Bitch, we do it the smart way
Bitch, I'm O'Block and I do it the squad way
Bitch, it's the hard way or the squad way
And bitch, we love the hard way
Don't make us start sprayin' in broad day
Leave a opp' brains in they hallwaysYou might also like9Embed
