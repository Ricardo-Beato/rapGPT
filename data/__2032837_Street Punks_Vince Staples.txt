41 ContributorsStreet Punks Lyrics
I ain't worried 'bout the police
I ain't worried 'bout these lil' niggas talking 'bout they hold heat
I ain't stressing going broke
I don't never leave the residence alone, keep it on me
I'm the nigga that you quote (That you quote)
I'm the only conversation if you speaking up on Long Beach
Get to acting like you know (Like you know)
Don't be acting like you bold, get it cracking at a show
Heard the Feds taking pictures—let a motherfucker pose
Tryna be the only Crippin' nigga sitting in the Vogue
Better put me on the cover, undercovers at my home
Tryna catch a nigga slipping, but I'm sticking to the flow
Heard these niggas flipping coke—why the fuck these niggas broke?
If it's shooters in the squad, what's the bodyguard for?
You ain't calling me collect, then I ain't pickin' up the phone
Got some homies from the set who ain't never coming home—
You wouldn't know about it

You a street punk
You a motherfucking street punk
No one know about you
You a street punk
You a motherfucking street punk
Get some dough up out you
Where the cash at? Where the cash at? (Huh?)
Where your pass at? Where your stash at? (Huh?)
Bet my last rack you ain't have that (Huh?)
Why? 'Cause you a motherfucking street punk
You might also like
I don't know if you heard of me
But you heard them shots on the block—it's a murder scene
Go on, call the cops, open heart during surgery
Now his breathing stopped
Stupid nigga, should've knew we tripping
Now he in a box
Winchesters, hundred in the box, Smith-Wesson
Stuff it to the top, and we coming to your spot
Knocking on the door, asking where he at
Playin' games, then we kick it down
Everybody flat on the ground
Kids get kidnapped, go and ask 'bout
You know how we rocking, nigga
You know who we whacking now
You ain't never caught a body
Know it 'cause you talking 'bout it
Catch me off of Coronado
You a motherfucking street punk

You a street punk
You a motherfucking street punk
No one know about you
You a street punk
You a motherfucking street punk
Get some dough up out you
Where the cash at? Where the cash at? (Huh?)
Where your pass at? Where your stash at? (Huh?)
Bet my last rack you ain't have that (Huh?)
Why? 'Cause you a motherfucking street punk
