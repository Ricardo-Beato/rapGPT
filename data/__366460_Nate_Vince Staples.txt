42 ContributorsNate Lyrics
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man
Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan
Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan
Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man
Talking to me monotone, hardly ever coming home
Knew he was the villain never been a fan of Superman
Beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming:
"Bitch you better listen when I speak my mind!"
Used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time
But made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined
Was walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that
Football was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High
But my daddy was the man that would be suicide
Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride
Always told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back

As a kid all I wanted was a hundred grand
Uncle counting money while my daddy cut him grams
Made me promise that this shit would never touch my hands
And it never did said it'd make me be a better man
Smoking in the crib, hiding dip inside of soda cans
Black bandana on his arm, needle in his hand
Momma trying to wake him up, young so I ain't understand
Why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, used to see him stand
Out in the alley through my window
Drinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke
Lights flashing now he running from the Winslows
Hear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor
Sometimes she wouldn't open it, sitting on the couch
Face emotionless, I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it
As a kid all I wanted a hundred grand

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
No, No, No, No
Niggas die everyday don't know how to live, don't know how to make sense
25 to life today just got locked away, all that just to pay rent
Now they're all bound on the slave ship
And they left behind their patience
Thought that'd last them for a little
Pass it down for my kin, ohh

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back61Embed
