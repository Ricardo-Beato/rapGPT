9 ContributorsMy Life Lyrics
Uh!
'Cause it's all (Grrr)
Goin' on, in my life

Earl Simmons AKA The Dawg gettin' down for real and goin' hard
'Cause it's all, goin on, in my life
This is my life and I'mma livin' it how I wanna live it
Motherfuckers won't you fuckin' come and get it, come on
'Cause it's all, goin on, in my life
Check it out yo, give me at least three feet
Or end up stinkin' leakin' in the street (What)
'Cause it's all, goin on, in my life
I wanna be able to teach you Blood
Wanna be able to sit down and eat with you Cuz (Uh)
'Cause it's all, goin on, in my life
I go through what I go through so you don't have to
You should be glad to have the worst statute
'Cause it's all (Get up) goin on, in my life
There it is my dreams my fears
My words that constantly fall on deaf ears (What)
'Cause it's all, goin on, in my life
Forgive me father for I have sinned (Yeah)
Cleanse my soul I'm ready to win let's begin (Please)
'Cause it's all, goin on, in my life
Please give me the strength to rebuke the devil
Give me the speech show the word that's heard on all levels (Alright)
Cause it's all, goin on, in my life
Uh
