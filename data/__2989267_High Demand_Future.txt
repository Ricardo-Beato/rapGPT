Step on the scene, forget about it
I put up racks, forget about it (Yeah, yeah, Pluto, skrrt)

Why you hatin'? Why you hatin'? Oh, I'm fresh (Why you hatin'?)
You must not feel how I feel, oh, I'm fresh (Oh, I'm fresh)
I just popped open a seal, I'm on X (Poppin' a seal)
Lil shawty sittin' at the Blue Flame, sent me a text (Lil shawty, woo)
Future high demand, Future high demand (Super Fu)
I don't walk on land, bitch, I don't ever walk on land (Super Fu)
I float off Earth (Pluto), always float off Earth (Pluto)
Diamonds doin' the Chris Breezy (Wow, wow), oh (Pluto)

She comin' through in the wee wee hours (She comin' through)
Went to the Hawks game in a helicopter (She went to)
Said, "I want me a white bitch" and I copped her
Future high demand, Future high demand (Super Fu)
I don't walk on land, bitch (Bow), I don't ever walk on land (Super Fu)
George Jetson, you can't see me, no (Pluto, Pluto)
Do numbers like Boston (Boston), George on Vimeo (Geez)
I left that bitch 'cause she was sleazy, oh
You can't be sadity and greedy (Yeah, yeah), no (Choose and get it)
I hid some money (Wow), and I got plenty mo' (Stretch hole)
Stashed in the walls (Walls), stashed it in the floors (Stashed it in the floors)
I dig a grave (Yah) and bought a tombstone for the money (Yah)
Stuffed a casket full of faces, got a tombstone for the money (Yah, yah)
Bought a foreign and a spaceship, bought a tombstone for my money (Wow)

She ain't runnin' out of flavor, I went to ice her
My number one bitch with me, it excite her
Let my shit go, blow the bitch, go to the cypher
That type of pussy, it's gon' make you want to wife her (Oh)
We do a whole lotta numbers, yeah
Grab on that pussy like Donald, yeah
Porsche got a lil' bitty trunk
But itâ€™s goin' over 200, yeah
Turtlenecks all on my collar, yeah
Love when a pretty bitch swallow, yeah
I did it up, gravity (I did it up)
Super so radically
Awesome, gnarly, woo! (Woo)
Heavenly, rapidly (Rapidly), got killers on McAfee (Got killers on)
I do it immaculately
I'm all in her mouth like a cavity (I'm all in her mouth like a)
Cold as the polar, I keep it precise
I go to space in the middle of the night
I gotta talk with that pipe in my hand now
It could be a threat or a fan now
I can't get caught with my hands down
I can't be comin', my man's down
I put some bodies up underground
That's a few millions up underground
Murder for money, that's man down
Kill more than police across town
Bet not get caught with your hand down
Bet not get caught with your hand down
Why you hatin'? Why you hatin'? Oh, I'm fresh (Why you hatin'?)
You must not feel how I feel, oh, I'm fresh (Oh, I'm fresh)
I just popped open a seal, I'm on X (Poppin' a seal)
Lil shawty sittin' at the Blue Flame, sent me a text (Lil shawty, woo)
Future high demand, Future high demand (Super Fu)
I don't walk on land, bitch, I don't ever walk on land (Super Fu)
I float off Earth (Pluto), always float off Earth (Pluto)
