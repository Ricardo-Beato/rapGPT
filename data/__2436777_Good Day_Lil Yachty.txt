35 ContributorsGood Day Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Man, today's a good day
(B-B-Big Los on the track, boy)

'Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich, rich
Walking down the street and I just copped a big booty bitch
Man today's a good day, hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Hey, ay-ye-ay
'Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich, rich
And these diamonds on my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Man today's a good day, hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Hey, ay-ye-ay
'Cause I'm rich

Today I don't have any haters
'Cause I could care less what they saying
'Cause I'm having a good day, hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Hey, ay-ye-ay
I just check my bank account and there's so many O's
I could give a motherfuck about any these hoes
'Cause I am rich, rich! Rich, I'm rich
I give a fuck about a bitch! A biatch
Oh, I know, I just sold a show
Park my car in the wrong spot but it still ain't get towed
You might also like
'Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich, rich
Walking down the street and I just copped a big booty bitch
Man today's a good day, hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Hey, ay-ye-ay
'Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich, rich
And these diamonds on my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Man today's a good day, hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Hey, ay-ye-ay
'Cause I'm rich

More money, more problems (Cash!)
But I cherish every moment 'cause I came from the bottom (What else?)
Cop Moms a Coup√© 'cause my bank so colossal (What else?)
Me and Yachty on a yacht, we pop a hunnid bottles (Swear!)
And I'm rich, ya bitch (Rich)
Catch me in the Fisker going crazy as I change the gears to six (Skrt!)
Every day's a good day only if you're living rich (Every day's a)
Holding blue hunnids, a hella good mix (Money!)
I feel good today, I might cop a Stingray (Cop a)
I love to get paid and she watch me Blu Ray
I got five different hustles, so get money five ways
I'm up twenty-four hours and grind seven days
Flippa!
'Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich, rich
Walking down the street and I just copped a big booty bitch
Man today's a good day, hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Hey, ay-ye-ay
'Cause I'm rich, rich, rich, rich, rich
And these diamonds on my wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Man today's a good day, hey, ay-ye-ay-ye-ay-ye-ay
Hey, ay-ye-ay
'Cause I'm rich9Embed
