Changed, changed
Changed the games that I used to play (Play)
Leavin' when I stay (Woo)
Oh (Oh), oh, baby, I've changed
I said that I've changed (I said I've changed)
The games (The games) ain't the same (They ain't the same)
(I've changed) The pressure wasn't greener (Changed)
On the other side (Changed)
Aight, aight, aight, Mo, chill ('Cause I know I've changed)
Yo, Mo (I know I've changed, baby, I swear I'm changed)
Yo, Mo, chill (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yo, chill, you singin' like you (Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah)
You singin' like you in church raisin' money (I've changed, I've changed)
For some new choir robes or somethin (I've changed, I've changed)
You changed? I'm 'bout to change to a new track (Oh, oh)You might also likeEmbed
