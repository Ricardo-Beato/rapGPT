25 ContributorsNo Omega Lyrics
I'm the Alpha with no Omega
Beginnin' without the end, so play the
Ironside, no extended version
Next episode'll be smooth as a Persian
Rhymes everlastin', there'll be no part 2
Knowledge is infinite, once I start to
Draw a better picture for your third eye, if you're blind
You know with a mic, I'm a black Michaelangelo
I'm the brother who ideas are colorful
Givin' 'em insight, but givin' 'em trouble to
Comprehend 'cause their thoughts won't blend in
They're pretendin', while I'm extendin'
You bite like a parasite, static when you attach
But you won't strike 'cause you ain't no match
You need more light 'cause yours got dim
Then you get sparked by the Lord Rakim
What's the matter, G? Check your battery
Go get charged up, then come battle me
You try hard and die hard, you ain't ever ready
When they check your pulse, you'll be dead as Freddie
Shop in Sears for new ideas
Check your engine and ask your engineers
To equalize it, try to disguise it
If that don't work, yo, then Midasize it
You need more power, better bring Battlecat
But this ain't Grayskull, and you ain't rippin', Jack
Don't drop the mic and jet for your tooley
("Bring it to me!")
We can go rhyme for rhyme til the mic stop workin'
Then I'mma leave you behind the Iron Curtain
And you'll remain backstage
Your book is over, I ripped your last page
Changed the endin', at least you went out rappin'
Now, I'mma tell 'em what happened
I filled the mic with explosives and lit it up
It was too heavy to hold, he couldn't pick it up
Pass the mic, let him try to get paid
He hit the stage, it went off like a hand grenade
Now, scrape him off the floor and off my list
I ain't a soloist, I'm an arsonist
Sprayed him, he said he was gonna do what?
Played him, MC Grand Pooh-Butt
Stole his lady, and drove her crazy
You asked me why, 'cause her man tried to play me
I sent her back a nervous wreck
And tried to put her back in check
My specialty is masterin' the female species
I specialize in her, until she sees
Where I come from and why I came
I tame and train til she manifest my name
Fill her with life until she burst with energy
Then leave her restless, 'cause a lot of women be
Tryin' to drain us, and leave us stripped dry
Put holes in our pocket, but you ain't that fly
I clipped your wings and bring you down to Earth
And tell you what life is worth
It ain't rings and things that's materialistic
You wanna pip on, imperialist with
Food for thought, 'cause I'm your shelter
I'll be your clothes, keep you warm and help ya
Not to be hot to trot, why haunt?
And why do y'all got to flaunt?
("We gonna use what we got to get what we want")
Cool, I heat you up like a black mink coat
Hug your neck like a fat gold rope
Words I speak and my DJ's cuts will warm your ears
Like mink earmuffs
So, Eric, show 'em how fast your hands'll go
So the people in the stands'll know
That you don't scratch your cuts engrave
Moves in waves to my rhyme displays
Float, evoke, my tempo jets
Expressions express when you kick steps
Keep 'em energetic, so let it
Pound in your head til what I said is embedded
Don't forget it's copacetic, set it
Anywhere you want, your poetry's pathetic
You gets no credit til you get it straight
Let's motivate
No intermissions 'cause it ain't commercial
If you wanna break, then I'll reimburse you
I won't let go so my mic won't drop, 'cause...
("I can't stop!")
Vocabs is endless, vocals exist
Rhyme goes on, so no one can stop this
Especially when I start to say the
Rhymes with no Omega
