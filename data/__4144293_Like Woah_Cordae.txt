Ha
What they know
(We are anonymous)
What they know about this shit man
Hey, show them boys

I walk up in this thing, like woah
I pull up in the range, like woah
My pockets on lipo
And he just lost his chain, like woah
I bet she give me brain, like woah
I run the game, like woah

Who you mobbing with
Boy, Entendre spit, the hottest shit
Why the fuck I say that flame, bruised their esophagus
Never global, but at least they bump me around Annapolis
Tryna stack us, so I can see how big my pockets get
Just a nigga on a grind, what the fuck the problem is? (they hating)
What they tell you, don't believe it, damn I'm just a college kid
Switch up the style, us niggas and bitches be wilding
Shop and spend about a thousand
If it's the money on it, I'm about it
Pray for it on the game, niggas not childish
Smoking on good gas, it's astounding
Never trust a nigga, whose surrounding
I done seen it all through the late nights
Where your mans make you think you hate life
Just another way to get your face wiped
That banana clip make an eight fight
In the shark water, I'm a Great White
But I come up in all Bape like (Goddamn)
You might also like
I walk up in this thing, like woah
I pull up in the range, like woah
My pockets on lipo
And he just lost his chain, like woah (I bet)
I bet she give me brain, like woah
I run the game, like woah
And walked up in this thing, like woah
I pull up in the range, like woah
My pockets on lipo
And he just lost his chain, like woah (I bet)
I bet she give me brain, like woah
I run the game, like woah

Ok, walking be the death of you
'Cause where I'm from, they execute
I stack my green, my vegetables
So why y'all on my testicles
Girl, she looking edible
I put her on the pedestal
Say she want a better dude
I'm flipping, making clever moves
Pull up in this thing, with a chain in my bessel, huge
If he got a problem, semi auto and baretta shoot
I don't do no shooting
I make music, bet you never knew
But I got my brothers for each other, never scared of you
I walk up in this thing, like woah
I pull up in the range, like woah
My pockets on lipo
And he just lost his chain, like woah (I bet)
I bet she give me brain, like woah
I run the game, like woah
And walked up in this thing, like woah
I pull up in the range, like woah
My pockets on lipo
And he just lost his chain, like woah (I bet)
I bet she give me brain, like woah
I run the game, like woah

Like woah, shorty give me brain like woah
Then I tell her pack her stuff, she gotta go (Bye bye)
Niggas hot like Alpole (Huh)
Smithen on me, call her willow (Bow)
If you make a wrong move, she gon' blow
Haters hating for the low (Damn)
I'm in the mood like an entrepreneur
Rappers be bluffing, they spitting manure
Play with 3oh and you in a funeral (3oh)
Pockets got benjamins, then benjamins got bluer
I'm in Miami, in a gang with the scooter
Shorty so fat, I need to get her a tutor
I'm in California, cooling with Hoovers
Niggas keep Tweeting, they talk to computers
Pull up on an opp, I'm taking his shoes
Come to my city, I'm taking your jewels
Same niggas with me, nobody knew
Police ask questions but nobody knew
Pull up on an opp, I'm taking his shoes
Come to my city, I'm taking your jewels
Same niggas with me, nobody knew
Police ask questions but nobody knew

I walk up in this thing, like woah
I pull up in the range, like woah
My pockets on lipo
And he just lost his chain, like woah (I bet)
I bet she give me brain, like woah
I run the game, like woah
And walked up in this thing, like woah
I pull up in the range, like woah
My pockets on lipo
And he just lost his chain, like woah (I bet)
I bet she give me brain, like woah
I run the game, like woahEmbed
