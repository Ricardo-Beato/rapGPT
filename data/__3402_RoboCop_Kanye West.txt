'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's?
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her there's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh

Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now
Drop it, drop it

'Cause I don't want no RoboCop
You moving like a RoboCop
When did you become a RoboCop?
Now I don't need no RoboCop
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well, let's agree to disagree, ha
Shorty kind of crazy, but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her there's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh
You might also like
Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now
Drop it, drop it

'Cause I don't want no RoboCop
You moving like a RoboCop
When did you become a RoboCop?
Somebody please make her stop
Stop, drop, roll, pop
****, I'm cold
I ain't used to being told, "Stop"
So I could never be your robot
Fast or slow, you can stay or can go
Now, now that you know
Now, now that you know
Yeah, I had her before, but that happened before
You get mad when you know, so just don't ask me no more
Okay, okay, okay
Uh, uh
It ain't okay, okay, okay
Yeah, uh

You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (You need to stop it now)
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (You need to stop it now)
Oh, you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh, oh, you're kidding me
Oh, you're kidding me
Haha, that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
You need to stop it now
Oh, you need to stop it now
