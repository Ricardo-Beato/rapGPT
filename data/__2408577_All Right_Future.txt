All right, all right
Love, love, love, all right

You know I be gettin' that moolah on a daily basis, all right
You said you always be there for me baby, you said "all right"
I know my niggas gon' be there for me always, all right
Hit the club, pop a few bottles, and fuck a few models, all right
We been on molly, yeah, we been on Xans and we been here all night
She says she wanna have a water bath, I told her "all right"

Hermes, Celines, and Chanels, you gon' tote 'em
I spend stacks on my rings, I spend stacks on my Rollies
Called out that bogus, get called out, that bogus
I drop off a head on the Royce, it was loaded
Sittin' in the parkin' lot holdin' the 40
Smokin' this dodie, I'm downin' this Codeine
Diamonds shinin' to infinity
I got 10 rings like it's 10 of me
I got money, fame, I got enemies
I can feel the pain of my enemy
I been downin' Percocets with Hennessy
I can hear the hood sayin' they proud of me
I can hear my bitch say she proud of me (My bitch, my bitch)
Gave her two Xans now she proud of me (Woo, my bitch)
Gave her two Xans now she proud of me (Woo, woo)
I can hear my hood sayin' they proud of me

You know I be gettin' that moolah on a daily basis, all right
You say you always be there for me baby, you say "all right"
I know my niggas gon' be there for me always, all right
Hit the club, pop a few bottles, and fuck a few models, all right
We been on molly, yeah, we been on Xans and we been here all night
She says she wanna have a water bath, I told her "all right"
