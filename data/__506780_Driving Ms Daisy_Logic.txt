118 ContributorsDriving Ms Daisy Lyrics
Somewhere this shit done got crazy
I've just been drivin' Ms. Daisy
With my hands on the steering wheel
And my eyes on the pavement
I give a fuck 'bout where they went
I owe my lawyer a payment
They talkin' 'bout no arraignment
Now I wonder where the rain went
I just been all in my mind, homies tell me I'm stressin'
I been countin' what's on my bucket list
And not on my blessings
I think it's time for a lesson, hold up (Hold up), you better pay attention
I-I-I can't end up like my mama poppin' anti-depressants
My therapist think I'm crazy (Uh, yeah, yeah-yeah)
Well, shit, she probably does (Aw yeah!)
All that stress I'm under, I wonder why I don't do drugs (I don't do drugs, yeah)
Raised in a household full of killers and thugs (Uh, uh, uh)
Shit, I've been in doubt so long, don't know who I was
But I know who I am (Know who I am)
Yes, I know who I is (Know who I is)
Please pardon my grammar, Daisy vibin' with this

I've just been drivin'
Uh-uh, nah-nah, da-da-da, la-da-da-da
I've just been drivin'
Uh-uh, nah-nah, da-da-da, la-da-da-da
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da (Yeah)
I've just been drivin' Miss Daisy
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da (Yeah)
I've just been drivin' Miss Daisy
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

That Bino the realest (Uh)
This beat made me kill it (Uh)
Her feet to the ceiling, she said that she love me
She never said that in college, 3005 is our mileage
I'm in my lane like a Prius, because I'm movin' in silence
You still ain't broke down yet? (Yeah)
All the flashing lights and a couple Crown Vic's
Wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left
Tell your nigga speed up, she don't wanna get left
Relationships look closer in that rear view
Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you
So now you gotta stop (Stop), park (Park)
Put that shit in neutral
Yeah, you really love her, but is she worth yo' future?
Your Ciara, your Beyonc√©, they be sayin' he got money
Think that Kim be wit Kanye if he left drive in the driveway?
Yeah, I know who you are, yeah, I know who you is
We were drivin' together, when we met we were kids
You ain't know 'bout the biz, I ain't know 'bout it either
I see you in that new ride, I flash my lights when I see you

I just be drivin'
Uh-uh, nah-nah, da-da-da, la-da-da-da (Yeah, uh, yeah)
I just been drivin' (Yeah)
Uh-uh, nah-nah, da-da-da, la-da-da-da
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da
I just been drivin' Miss Daisy
Uh-uh, nah-nah, nah-nah, uh, uh, ah-da-da (Yeah-yeah, you)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, da-da
Turn left on West Deer Park
Doing 90 on the highway
We gon' do it my way
I said, 90 on the highway, we gon' do it my way
Uh, I said, 90 on the high, 90 on the high, ah-da-da
90 on the high, 90 on the high, ah-da-da
