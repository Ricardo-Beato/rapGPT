11 Contributors20 Minutes Lyrics
Hey yo Goldie Loc let me hear some dog (puff)
We gotta go some for the hood that's on the real
Yeah, this is a public service anouncement from the mathafuckin LBC
Yeah, check this out cuzz, uhm

Hey yo Goldie Loc
Let's do this for the homies in the hood
The dub, waddup
No disrespect to them other hoods
But this is where I'm from
3-2-1 I can't cum
No other way
No way, no how
You know the bow wow do it Long Beach style
To the fullest young niggero
With my steal I cap home feeling like a O
No he didn't, yes he did
Bank your chin in her crib
This ain't no fed
But now he live
On the other side where the cowboys at
Where the brown blast black
And the black blast right back
That's a fact in the city where I'm from
You betta get ready
Caus here they kitty come cum
Nigga we get dumb on your bitchass
I ain't trippin caus I'm from the oldschool
And I never hesitate to blast
See, when your in it
You gotta be in it to win it
Holla back nigga in 20 minutes
You might also like
Gimme the mic and watch me brake these niggas
How they figga
Bustas get shot tryin to plot
Blew the dice hit them twice hit a seven
Now Snoop watch me trip when I back your eleven
Mix for licks to double my chips
I'm bangin so much I got cheerleaders on the dick
Now back up and watch me stack up my dirt
I sting like bees and when you broke i bet it hurt
Watch me strike matches no need for no practice
Fuck around and get straight stomped with the package
Dogg keep the beat bangin
I'm wit the homies feel
If me and you left here for hangin
I feel like givin it up
Caus I'm a young nigga livin it up
Me and Snoop ain't give a fuck
20 minutes to get your C-walk on
Before I get my ride on I blew about a zone
Check this out dog, you don't know me shit
You know I respresent the eastside Long Beach 20 crip nigga

Two's, O's, fo's and hoes
Nigga only fuckin with the real 2-0's
20 minutes, 20 minutes
Holla at me, 20 minutes
Deuce, fo's, hoes and clothes
Nigga only fuckin with the real 2-0's
20 minutes, 20 minutes
Holla at me, 20 minutes

We ride
Sliding of to the eastside
Hoo-ride, to homicide
Rollin in the G-ride
So what yall bustas gon'do
When the pimps, bangers and hustlaz smash on you
One for the money
And two for the shizzo
I'm lil Goldie Loc that gives a fuck about a hizzo
Three to the fizzo
And five to the sizzix
My nigga snoop dogg gives a fuck about a bi-zitch
Yeah you heard it from me, mmm

Goldie locks the same thang
Smashing for the hood caus I wanted to gangbang
Will I change
Hell nah nigga
Quick to jack that ass to make my bank roll bigga
Trip

I shot em , shot em down
And if the too damn big
Then I cut em , cut em down
Nigga where the pound
Hell yeah I'm from the pound
Nigga how that sound
Dogg pound bounce
I got homies from the dub that bang everyday
I got homies from the hood that do the same all day
I keep my feet real close to the street
And keep my hands real close to the heat
I'm not descreet when it comes to the dogg
I'm a real O like eight-ball
We C no explainin , gangbangin, Crackslangin, entertain us
Sippin silver satin out the container
Askin which one of yall niggas wanna scrap
We can do it G-style
Mathafucker strap
Just like I tought nigga
You got caught
Ol'bitchass nigga droppin all that soul
You see, first thangs first when your a grown man
You gotta get up, get out and get your own man
See, I don't owe you and you don't owe me
It's 1999 I'm the OG
Respect your G'z is what my homies told me
So I show real love to the dubs

(Outro)
