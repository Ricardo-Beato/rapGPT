6 ContributorsGo at It LyricsIt got the summer written all over it
It is time, time for it to happen
What the fuck is it? (Get it)
Some still can't deal with it
Kill fast till they kill it
DJ Lord, Public Enemy
They be killin' it
Still don't get it confused, shit, I be killin' it dude
Elevated, it ain't the shoes
It is what it is, so be it
Ain't just pointed to my fitted
It's what's inside it (Get it, get it, get it)
It's happenin', it's got feelin'
It's got groove, power to the people
It's got nothing to lose
You can bob it, weave it
Some love it, some lеave it
Knowledge is powеr but some keep it a secret
Some really need it
Some say it from the rooftops
It's doorstops and stoops
Till it's living and breathing
Yo, yo, one-two
So be it
And let it be
You might also likeY'all know it, so be it
Then, be it so, so it be
Revolution, then let it be known
Whatever it is, whatever it be
You just go at it
Y'all know it, so be it
Then, be it so, so it be
Revolution, then let it be known
Whatever it is, whatever it be
You just go at it
It can be whatever you believe in
It can't stop, won't stop, not a one size fit
Whatever you want in the world, start by being it
I'll never star it, spangle it, banner it
Some voted it, it is what it is
Hope got choked out, didn't it?
Press secretaries in suits, that just don't fit (Uh)
Chuck, I got it can't stop it, or cock block it
Ignore these false prophets blinded by fake profit
It is a damn shame, it is the same game
It is too late to complain, can't stand in (Get it)
Loud and proud, too strong to ignore it
Either you against it, huh, yeah, or you for it
Lie for it, die for it
Do your damn best at the test
Come on, uh, yeah, try for it
Political landscape morbid
Seen my ancestors forbid it
Jahi and Marcus wrote it
Y'all know it, so be it
Then, be it so, so it be
Revolution, then let it be known
Whatever it is, whatever it be
You just go at it
Y'all know it, so be it
Then, be it so, so it be
Revolution, then let it be known
Whatever it is, whatever it be
You just go at it
But you can quote it if I spoke it
I spray words on the target
Hold my pen the same way they hold an AK
'Cause still can lose your life for it
Some belief in me, is all that I need
I know it, so be it, it be so, so it be
I'll never ask for it, it's just me being me (Come on)
State of the free it
As I see it through world eyes
Not on the demise, global people on the rise
Don't sit!
You pick up the pieces, I'll bring the glue
So be it for me, so you can be you
You pick up the pieces, I'll bring the glue
So be it for me, so you can be you
Whatever it is, whatever it be
You just go at itEmbed
