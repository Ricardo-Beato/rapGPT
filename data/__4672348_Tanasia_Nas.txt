Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Truck jewels, big stacks, mustard boots
Construction on her feet, she eat duck confit
I shoot up the club whenever I hit it raw
If she have a baby by me, I'ma love her more
Brings food to the crib when I'm laying low
And she know how to roll weed, but don't smoke
Chinese massages, wifey, no side-chick
Go sight-seeing with the god
Playing cards with my dad, frying chicken for the mob
Simply Lemonade, raspberry for the wash, gosh
She know who tryin' to rock her to sleep to get to me
Give 'em the side eye when she see 'em in the street
Her brother locked up, he doin' ten up in the beast
He's short, he comin' home and she hyped for his release
Fly her to Hollywood, watch flicks from Nollywood
Like hydraulics, she ride the wood

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

She edu-ma-cated, she said she related to the Asian
Ethic persuasion, the sex is amazin'
Never bought her a Birkin, my night-time nurse
May be more like a surgeon, nice on the eyes, I put that work in
Back when she was on the same block that I would service
Said, "It's straight," we need a place up in Jamaica Estates
And she was like, "Oh no" in a silky Kimono
Said the streets, the snakes, plus Governor Cuomo
Flashes out the window, people takin' my photo
She knew I wasn't gon' be no husband, I be a no-show
Leave her standin' at the altar, bro, I couldn't falter
Plus that Nigerian blood mixed in her culture
Body like she Evel Knievel, on the soul cycle
Lookin' like Janet, dance like Michael
She knew I wasn't cut from the cloth to be a Czar
Now she hit the town with the legal Escobar, she's myâ€”

If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
We fresh outta the Met Gala, express power
Exude the essence of best-dressed for the next hour
Toast glasses, velvet ropes, no trespassin'
Hella smoke, our section has the best fashion
Picture us laughin', how ticklish the money has us
Like little kids, but the difference is we'd much rather
Be ghost, back in the crib, some avocado toast
Laid-back, we choose that over Amalfi Coast
Chillin', startin' to think about children
And bringin' 'em in the world with Kim Jong illin'
But since I'm feelin' what I'm feelin' and she feelin' what she feelin'
I'm willin', she's willin', we buildin'
Every man originated in Asia
One continent, Africa was a part of Asia
Here we are, in this Western Civilization
I believe that we was destined to make it

If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor2Embed
