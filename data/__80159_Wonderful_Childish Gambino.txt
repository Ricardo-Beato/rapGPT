38 ContributorsWonderful Lyrics
We finally made it
And now we sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How'd it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How'd it get so wonderful? (Like we know)
So wonderful (Like we know)

You can call the shots, I’m going to my aunt’s house
What’s it all about? Lookin’ like I’m Millhouse
What’s it all about? I ain’t get my bike back
I ain’t get my bike back, I know where he live at
I know what he look like, I know what I live like
Five to a bed, head to toe, that’s a good night
Five to a bed, head to toe, with the fan on
I don’t think these other niggas know what ya man on
I used to have to sneak just to get my food
Free lunch made it feel like they don’t approve
Sell a card for a dollar used to be the move
I wanna be Jabari man, that nigga cool
I wanna lash out, nigga keep your cool
All my friend did was draw something, now he outta school
‘Cause everything was always “Show me what you made of”
And everybody knew somebody who was laid up
I didn’t need it, mama said it’s a lesson
Some people will never like you
Don’t let ’em catch you stressin’
You know a code’s a code, the world can’t stop ’em
Eating out rat holes and Cheerios boxes
This nigga think he hot shit, he think he good at everything
I just didn’t wanna get left out more
My little sis’ mom got shot, she in the newspaper
Prayers couldn’t save her, she died a day later
Like my cousin got that HIV
When she bust the leg open playing jump rope
Should I tell them kids what the fuck’s up?
They gon' judge her and me
Man fuck them, we livin’, all is forgiven
I fucked up royally
But now that’s who we are man, you gotta use the royal "we"
This is royalty, and this is all I ever wanted ‘cause

We finally made it
And now we're sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
We finally made it
And now we're sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How did it get so wonderful? (Know) So wonderful (Ohh)
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful6Embed
