20 ContributorsKongoz Lyrics
Congo, congo
She twerk it to the congo

Congos, them guns sound like congos
My jits do this for fun, ho
And they love lettin' guns blow
Huh, congos, she twerk it to the congos
God, y'all some broke boys
Should've worked at the carnival
Huh, congos, them guns sound like congos
My jits do this for fun, ho
And they love lettin' guns blow
Huh, congos, she twerk it to the congos
God, y'all some broke boys
Should've worked at the carnival
Huh, carnival, should've worked at the carnival
You ain't getting no bucks, boy
Should've worked at the carnival, huh

I ain't never snitched in my life
Fuck with me, you know you gon' die (Huh)
It's 300 of us and know we gon' ride
Used to tote pistols and you know we don't fight
Why everybody wanna be me?
And all these boys wanna work for Chief Keef (Huh)
In each one of the opps, I see me
I swear each one of the opps wan' be me (Huh)
This shit fucked up at an all-time high
Mouse said, "Don't get smoked," well bitch, don't get fried
Squad, we everywhere and we don't get tried
Sucking my dick, don't talk, give top (Huh)
Opp bitches low-key love Chief Keef
These opp bitches low-key love GB (Huh)
I'm getting tree-tree, getting head by KeKe (Huh)
Thirty in my ning-ding, think it's a drill, bitch, ding ding (Huh)

My jits do this for fun, ho
And they love lettin' guns blow
Huh, congos, she twerk it to the congos
God, y'all some broke boys
Should've worked at the carnival
Huh, congos, them guns sound like congos
My jits do this for fun, ho

Huh, congos, she twerk it to the congos
God, y'all some broke boys

Huh, carnival, should've worked at the carnival
You ain't getting no bucks, boy
Should've worked at the carnival, huh

Gun smoke, you tweak with gang, gun show
All my niggas for none, keep big guns with drums, boom
Get smoked, hit his face, his throat
Got blood over my clothes, body bag zipped, though
All these niggas wanna be me (Be me)
They say I'm in it, I'm on TV (TV)
But I gotta ride with big thirties (Thirties)
The opps think they gonna murk me
Want war, these fuck niggas want war
I catch you at the corner store
I'm one up with the score (Baow)
Red dot, headshot, feds hot
Watchin' his spot 'cause I dropped his ass on the block, boom
Congos, dirty bopper, drumroll
The wild boy jungle
Killin' your parents, where your mom go? Boom
Convo, no time for the convo
We smokin' on jungle, in the condo countin' hunchos (Them racks)
Congos, them guns sound like congos
My jits do this for fun, ho
And they love lettin' guns blow
Huh, congos, she twerk it to the congos
God, y'all some broke boys
Should've worked at the carnival
Huh, congos, them guns sound like congos
My jits do this for fun, ho
And they love lettin' guns blow
Huh, congos, she twerk it to the congos
God, y'all some broke boys
Should've worked at the carnival
Huh, carnival, should've worked at the carnival
You ain't getting no bucks, boy
Should've worked at the carnival, huh1Embed
