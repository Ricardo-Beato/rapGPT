7 ContributorsWhere I Wanna Be Lyrics
In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
Cause I know that this is where I wanna be

Got a lot to say, but don't know who to talk to
Step with a purpose, but don't know where to walk to
Anything I ever said, ever meant something?
I know, because the person I said it to, told me it meant something
My life has a meaning, my life has a purpose
No matter how dark it gets, I knew that it was worth it
Fuck what it looked like on the surface
Seen it all, but not all heard us, like sometimes i was worthless
Can't expect everybody to get what you doing
Can't expect them all to be with what you doing
Don't give a fuck if a motherfucker hate me
What you think it is with me, but whats good with you lately
I hate when i sense this shit, trying to make sense of this shit knowing that its sensitive shit
Niggas so dumb, that they don't even censor shit
You sent the shit, so I know you meant the shit you senseless bitch

Born with addiction with fast living with high stakes
I race down a highway of life with no breaks
Make no apologies for the risks that I take
And manning up to the repercussions that I face
No silver spoon, I was raised in a crowded room
Rarely seen the sun, faced a lot of gloom
I hit the streets too soon before 21
Working on the clock since and on it until I'm done
I'm never clocking out, but always locking in
I had a warm heart, lost a lot of friends
And losing them make me feel like I was drowning
So please forgive the chill I know you feel when you around me
Dreamed of living right, big family, the picket fence
Grandkids I will get to share my story with
But here I am, living vile as I stand ground
Just hope it doesn't end, with shots fired, man down


If I could bottle the inspiration
I'd be a billionaire, straight fuckin villain yeah
X, baby you still in here
I feel the air, I can smell the death in it
We were all left in it, so fuck nigga, step with it
The walk is easy, the journey ain't worth nothing
That's why every day a nigga wanna hurt something
But, I made progress, more or less
If I can avoid the stress, I can avoid the rest
A nigga stay dealing with the bullshit daily
Niggas is worse than the bitches, y'all hear me?
Straight up and fed up (what!), i'll have you sprayed up and wet up (what!)
Now you laid up and won't get up
Now look at what the fuck you got yourself into
All I did was open the curtains and you jumped out the window
That's what suckers do
You just a punk motherfucker you, got a nigga like motherfucker OOH!
