The fiends are knocking at my door
Should I give them what they're asking for?
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Knock Madness
So what the fuck y'all need from me?
I'm here to make these fiends believe
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), gotta have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Knock Madness

Yeah, I promised you niggas a album
You been patiently waiting, now the day is finally present
I took my time with this shit
I put my mind into every line, 'cause when it's out I ain't tryna regret it
Niggas get overhyped and all they hits go stale
Because they shit don't sell, now that's a big ol' fail
But the punch is a lot harder when you clip your nails
Niggas, how you expect to drive when you ain't get your L's?
You was the next big thing while I was last
You was poppin' tags while I was mad chillin' in my pad with my rhyming pad
Tryna record with no door so I hear my mom and dad
Arguing upstairs so I gotta wait 'til the drama pass
'Cause my mic be picking that shit up
But I ain't wanna give up, I'd exhale fast even if I did suck
You want the madness? Then come and get some
I'm takin' the cake, and all that's left for y'all is the pieces I bit from
See I ain't buddy-buddy with rappers because that shit is fake
Most of y'all morals is fucked up, you on a different page
You get no props just 'cause you getting paid
If you garbage we ain't doing business, point blank, I discriminate
And I don't do no bullshit collabs to get my name poppin'
That ain't even considered a safe option
And that just ain't Hopsin, I paid homage, now I'm straight wilin'
Now turn this shit up while the bass knockin', now c'mon

The fiends are knocking at my door
Should I give them what they're asking for?
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Knock Madness
So what the fuck y'all need from me?
I'm here to make these fiends believe
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), gotta have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)

And I be gettin' comments like
"Hop, what's the hold up with your new shit, man? You be taking forever son
Yo I'ma stop waiting, I'm getting my hopes up
With your work ethic it ain't gon' never come
You had the XXL cover in 2012
And I thought you would soon prevail, but homie, you ain't doing well
You hit us with that Ill Mind shit and that was cool as hell
But when it comes to your album, you never got no news to tell
Your whole career is just a train wreck
You toured around the world for 3 years, but you always performed the same set
I been asked you to come to my city, but you ain't came yet
I guess you ain't in it for love, you just want that pay check
If I was you, then I wouldn't be too proud
You signed Dizzy not too long ago when he's bigger than you now
You said you saving hip-hop, well, save this shit
And all I hear is wack niggas and I hate this shit
Homie I stopped being a scrub because of you
I stopped playin' these bitches in the club and fell in love because of you
My dad heard your song and he stopped doin' drugs because of you
I learned to rap and even built a little buzz because of you
But you take it for granted, thinking you have it made
Sittin' back in the shade, Hopsin, there's people that you have to save
This is beyond music
You speak life into these motherfuckers, Hop, you have a gift, so when you gon' use it?"
Damn, I have that much of an impact?
My rhymes did that? Sometimes, I really feel my shit's wack
That's why I kick back, but fuck this shit, yo, where my pen at?
I'm 'bout to kill this shit and make niggas just wanna quit rap
I'm causing havoc, layin' the rappers like a hammock
If I want the fucking planet, I can have it, now try to snatch it
Only God can stop my violent habits
You niggas average, I ain't even in my prime and still I'm twice the savage
C'mon
The fiends are knocking at my door
Should I give them what they're asking for?
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Knock Madness
So what the fuck y'all need from me?
I'm here to make these fiends believe
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), gotta have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
