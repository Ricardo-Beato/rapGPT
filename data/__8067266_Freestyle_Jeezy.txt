10 ContributorsDeath Before Dishonor (B.M.F. Freestyle) Lyrics
One time for Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Real niggas, hallelujah
This for my real niggas, I swear to God
You know it's death before dishonor, it's in my fucking heart

A hundred black Luxe t's like the Taliban
And everybody's jewelry flashing like the ambulance
Self-made? That's a understatement
That nigga self-paid -- that's your honor statement
One time for Big Meech, Jay Beezy, I.P., Throw Beezy
Copped the drop-top 'Rossa, it was baby blue
It's on, Tito, Dash, yeah this one's for Baby Bleu
How you blowing money fast? You don't know the crew
Are you part of the fam? Shit, I never knew
Y'all were supposed to make it hard -- this is easy, ho
Pull up in that triple white -- I think I'm Jeezy, ho


Goddamn ho, you got the massive titties
Might as well roll with me in Magic City
Call it "Magic City" cause my whole city magic
Talking that magic powder -- yeah, my whole city had it
Where you can find a brick before you find a soda, nigga
Buy a spit before you buy a Coca-Cola, nigga
Kept the lights on in Visions, nigga -- Alex know
Made him famous -- fuck you think they call him Alex for?
Ordered 150 bottles like, "okay"
We gonna have to change this bitch to Club Rose
Y'all were supposed to make it hard -- this is easy, ho
Pull up in that '62, me and Meechy, hoYou might also like1Embed
