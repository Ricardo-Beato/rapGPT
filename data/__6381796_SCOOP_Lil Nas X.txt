I been workin' on my body
You ever seen a nigga hit pilates? (Ah)
No, I ain't feelin' sorry
Been in the kitchen bumpin' NASARATI
Shit, I been in the crib goin' crazy
I been movin' work on the daily
Baby, I ain't tryna be your baby
Understand, I'm just tryna be the daily

Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)

Blue stones at the kick back
They lookin' at my wrist, now, watch it hit back
My ex hittin' my phone, tryna get back
Don't you hit me with that, "Miss you," I ain't with that
Now it's, he get flown, then he sit back
And I won't call on the phone if I hit that
And I'm tryna fuck, lil' nigga, fuck the chit-chat
I ain't talkin' guns when I ask where your dick at (Grrr)
You might also like
I been workin' on my body
You ever seen a nigga hit pilates? (Ah)
No, I ain't feelin' sorry
Been in the kitchen bumpin' NASARATI
Shit, I been in the crib goin' crazy
I been movin' work on the daily
Baby, I ain't tryna be your baby
Understand, I'm just tryna be the daily

Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)

Tomorrow is my day off (Okay)
All them rehеarsals got me tight, look at the payoff (Okay)
And now, my body look like somеthing you'd eat cake off
I just got my veneers, now, bitches wanna rip they face up
But you thought you'd have a chance after you wanna disrespect me?
Let him apologize, and eat it in a Bentley
He named my right cheek Jennifer and left one Lopez
Can't call me stupid with this big ol' fuckin' forehead
Motherfucker, let me
Scoop, scoop (Okay, skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Okay, skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
I don't wanna li-i-ie
I really only need you for the ni-i-ight
No, I don't wanna li-i-ie
I really only need you for the ni-i-ight

Can I scoop, scoop? (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop (Skrrt)
Scoop, scoop

Shit, I been workin' on my body, yeah (I been workin' on my body)
Workin' overtime to make sure I'll be the scoop
They gon' know me, scoop
Well, baby (D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)32Embed
