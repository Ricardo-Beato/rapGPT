6 ContributorsPretty Girls Lyrics
(Mike WiLL Made-It)

Her pussy is gettin' so good, it got me scared of it (Huh?)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause once you put that head on me (Lord)
This bitch so bad, she'll make you run your bread up (Huh)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause once you wrap your legs 'round me
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (Huh)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (Yeah)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?

I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (Woah)
Even if they never seen me, then they heard 'bout me (Huh)
Rockstar status, talkin' Bruce Springsteen (Yeah)
Baby, fuck them other niggas, we the new Dream Team
Tell me how you never sucked a king, but think that you the queen, though?
Baby, why you sleepin' on me? This is not a dream, ho (Huh)
I'm gettin' real impatient, I'm in a situation (Yeah)
Just wanna penetrate ya, fuck all them stipulations (What?)
Well, tell him come and get ya, 'cause ya gotta get out (Go)
He best be in a hurry, 'cause you gotta leave now (Ho)
I need that hot, hot mouth that make a nigga cool down (Hot)
Got me searchin' through my phone like who tryna drool now? (Ugh)

Her pussy is gettin' so good, it got me scared of it (Huh?)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause once you put that head on me (Lord)
This bitch so bad, she'll make you run your bread up (Huh)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause once you wrap your legs 'round me
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (Huh)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (Yeah)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?

Don't bring your bitch around me 'less you wanna lose her (Damn)
I took my jewelry off and put it in a cooler (Ice, ice)
I took my bae on a date, me, her, and my shooters (Yeah)
Then took her to the mall to have her way in Gucci, uh (Woo)
For one night, I just landed in town (Like what up, though?)
Now I'm searchin' for the baddest bitch around (Where she at?)
I'm weak for a juicy bitch with an attitude (Damn)
Buy her whatever she think she want, but fall in love, that's somethin' I don't
She so bad, she can't do wrong, she so thick, she hide her thong
Why you bring your friend around me, all that ass sittin' on her back?
Pulled up on her in that Phantom, told her, "Come get in the back"
Her performance was so good, I feel like I owe her a stack

Her pussy is gettin' so good, it got me scared of it (Huh?)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause once you put that head on me (Lord)
This bitch so bad, she'll make you run your bread up (Huh)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause once you wrap your legs 'round me
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (Huh)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?
I've been all around the world, pretty girls 'round me (Yeah)
Is this a set-up? 'Cause why you bring your girl 'round me?Embed
