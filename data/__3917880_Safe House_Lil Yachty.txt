Run that back, Turbo

Paint, chase (yeah), ice-skate (wo-woah)
Fast-paced (wo-woah), gas, no brakes (let's go)
Mansion (mansion), space (space)
Love, then hate (wo-woah)
Plug got weight (wo-woah)
Cash, two safes
Safe house, safe house safe, huh
Mansion with a lake, huh (wo-woah)
Been out since like 8, huh (wo-woah)
8, AM, huh
Flex, no gym
Ball, no rim (wo-woah)
Safe house, safe house safe, huh (wo-woah)
Safe house, safe house safe, huh

Young Gunna
Bands, these 100s and 10s (safe)
VVS all on my chin (safe)
Hella hoes came with my Benz (safe)
Helped your bitch with her rent (hey)
Sent some of this water out to Flint (safe)
Started fuckin' yo ho with the tip (tip)
We was broke but I'll never forget (never forget)
On my sets where I never could switch (switch)
In that penthouse on top of the Ritz (Ritz)
That lil' freaky ho swallowed my kids (swallowed my kids)
Put my hi-tec right in the fridge (fridge)
This extension gon' go to your wig (go to your wig)
Pay attention we really gettin' rich (rich)
Couple thousand just for our outfit (outfit)
She want me and Lil Boat in her pics (her pics)
Aye, aye, aye (ayee), there's a few of us keepin' it real (real)
Safe, safe (safe house), safe house, in Hollywood Hills (aye)
Ghost, Tesla (ghost), I can't stop takin' these pills (takin' these pills)
I won't ever care how you feel (feel)
My family gon' get a mil' (hey)

Hoo-yeah, don't try to buy my place, huh
Nut on her face like paste, huh
Fuckin' every ho, every race
Grab a double cup from the QT, yeah
Thick little bitch she's a cutie, yeah
100 thousand dollars for a new piece
20 thousand dollars for a new fleece
Hoo, aye, I'm in this bitch with the gang
Minute Maid lemonade chain, canary diamonds they bling-blaow
Choppa start speaking like Colin Powell, huh
I'm the golden child, Rolls gold Patek, blue face, wow
And I got a rack for every time you run your mouth
Slap you in your shit 'cause you really act out (whew)
Oh, oh, keep a could hundred in the safe, huh
19 could've bought a wraith, huh
But I bought a Benz in the place, yeah1Embed
