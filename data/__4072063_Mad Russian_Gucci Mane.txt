20 ContributorsMad Russian Lyrics
Wop
M-M-M-Murda

I still fuck her like a mad Russian, she mad crushin'
At least she hit the sad button, she mad blushin'
Diamonds got her head huntin', she head huntin'
Are you scared? 'Cause you ain't saying nothin', we been fuckin'

Yeah they lookin' and they been lookin', they been lurkin' (Wop)
Escortin' down her leg, flirtin', she been flirtin'
I pull up in a four-seater, one person (One)
Fiji diamond bracelet on, they so thirsty
Baby got an ass on her, it's so perfect
She tryna make me glance at her, and it's workin'
Gucci keep them bands on him, he Mr. Perfect
No feeling, no ceiling, he so verted

Ayy, ayy, ayy
Big bands on me, I'ma throw it on the floor
Run it up and hit the mall, I spend it at the Gucci store
Shawty know I'm in designer from my head down to my toes
Oh, you say you wanna cuff me? I ain't trustin' in no ho
Why you say I do too much when you know you do the most
It's a celebration, I might have to make a toast
I just did it for my city, now they calling me the GOAT
Looking for the right direction, I ain't have nowhere to go
You might also like
She a bad girl, she catching mood swings
She wanna stay the night, and drink the D'usse
She said, "I follow you, and do what you say
This can be forever boy, master, you're my sensei, ayy"

I still fuck her like a mad Russian, she mad crushin'
At least she hit the sad button, she mad blushin'
Diamonds got her head huntin', she head huntin'
Are you scared? 'Cause you ain't saying nothin', we been fuckin'

She a bad girl, she catching mood swings
She wanna stay the night, and drink the D'usse
She said, "I follow you, and do what you say
This can be forever boy, master, you're my sensei, ayy"

Fuck her like a mad Russian
Fuck her like a mad Russian
Fuck her like a mad Russian
Fuck her like a mad Russian2Embed
