With four hoes smokin' dro
With my next nine, I'ma bang boogers on my bank, I'm gross
I'm so dope, I'm so gone
This might hurl 'cause the bitch so gross (Uh)
Big boy, but in the room get lost
You ain't gotta speak, let the headboard talk
Two-twenty on the dash on the car I bought
Thinkin' I'm not, but that's just thought (Yoom)
I know I'm gon' do 'cause I really want to
Do you want to? 'Cause I really want to (Mwah)
My flow so sick,  super raw, drag-racing in a super sport
Never see your head before I blow (It's Gucci)
These niggas hoes

Her shoes the mostest
It rains in gross (Bur)
Her nails ferocious (Bur)

My house on oceans
My roof door open (Roof door open)
In a jet
If you ain't real, then hear the check
