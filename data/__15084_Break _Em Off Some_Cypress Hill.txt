14 ContributorsBreak â€™Em Off Some Lyrics
This one goes out to all you punk motherfuckers out there
Yeah, eat a bowl of dick-up, putos
Do you wanna get crazy?
Comin' at ya in '93

Through the crosswinds, the firin' pins
Go click when I duck behind the trash bin
Ran out of ammo, no doubt
My gat is dry like a fuckin' drought
Got to make my way home
Hit the gate and get my chrome, hot damn, it's on
They got me cornered, let me just warn ya
I'll pull this trigger, make your family mourn ya
Boo-hoo
Where ya gonna run to when I pull out the Scooby-Doo?
Run, let me break ya off some
Hit the floor 'cause it ain't no fun
But here they come, they must wanna get done
No frontin', punk, I'll break ya off somethin'

One, two, three, that copper goes down
Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'
You might also like
What the fuck I'm rollin'
In a Mack truck that's stolen, guess what I'm holdin'?
Ammo to bust my load
Still, I'm easin' on down the yellow brick road
What do ya know? A pig in a plain brown
Wrapper, he wanna bring me down
I'll hit that corner, let me just warn ya
I'll run your ass down, make your family mourn ya
Twenty-one gun salute
Trying to take my loot, don't make me shoot
I'll hit my blunt and pass you a lump
And, punk, let me break ya off somethin'

Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'

I got to roll with the self-control
In the green tank when the shit unfolds
Hold up, I got it sewn up
Me and my niggas are about to blow up
Got the pigs on my tail
What they get is the hollow-point shell, caught in the cell
Servin' my sentence, got my apprentice
In the hood, but the nigga is senseless
Out on parole
Now the nigga has turned to my foe, now the punk gotta go
That punk got shady, wouldn't repay me
Let the punk know that ya still can't fade me
Maybe the frontin' would stop
But nothin' would stop me from havin' to break 'em off somethin'
On to the next spot, kid
Break 'em off somethin'
We ain't havin' it, y'all
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm 'bout to break your ass off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'
Comin' from a whammo
Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin'1Embed
