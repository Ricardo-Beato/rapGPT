Hitting corners
Thugging with the blower, barrel louder than the motor
Keep the engine running when a nigga run up on you
Another day in sunny California
The Feds taking pictures, and they tapping Motorolas
Everybody snitching, gotta live with paranoia
A soldier since the stroller—ask my mama if you doubt that
Homie, where your clout at?
You ain't ever push nobody scalp back

Since my granny, Alameda days, robbing ‘cause we need a raise
Fingers do the talking when the C's do the walking
And the seas been polluted, baptism for the shooters
Seventh grade, I went to OCA, hooping up at Lueder's
With my 'Ru from Campanella, we was crashing shit together

Used to the sounds of violence, my neighbors ain't never call police
Call it "following protocols," spark it if you don't know the call
Got this bitch that live off of Market that's down to hold the heat
Turning water and power off, got us impatient, powered up
Evictions notices go unnoticed, the final hours up
Living off of borrowed time, committing crimes, all organized
Fortress wasn't fortified, just tryna build my castle up
Dollar and a dream, at nightime, we masking up
The deadly game of tag the older generations passed to us
I got a clip that's long enough to shoot until the casket come
With it 'til that casket drop, they dropping when that Magnum popYou might also like21Embed
