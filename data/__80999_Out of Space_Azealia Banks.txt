I'll take your brain to another dimension

I'll take your brain on a parallel universe trip, I'm the only no-parallel bitch
Banks runnin' this shit, maneuvered then dipped
Venom'll burn ya 'dulla, then spit, spew spit, get ya' noodle al dente'd, frozen and hid
Auto-weapon, click-click, I'm adjustin' this clip
I'm blastin' off, NASA - you might be stuck on his dick
Look at this bitch (Bitch), tick-tick
Which dude wanna get hit-hit? Four fifth real quick
Four clips in the whip, my dimension is this

I'm gon' send him to outer space
To find another race
I'm gon' send him to outer space
To find another race
I'm gon' send him to outer space
To find another race
I'm gon' send him to outer space
To find another race (Pay close attention)
I'm gon' send him to outer space (I'll take your brain on a parallel universe trip, I'm the only no-parallel bitch)
To find another race (Banks runnin' this shit, maneuvered then dipped)
I'm gon' send him to outer space (Venom'll burn ya 'dulla, then spit, spew spit, get ya' noodle al dente'd, frozen and hid)
To find another race (Auto-weapon, click-click, auto-weapon, click-click, close attention!)

Yo, what's up, neutron? You ain't gettin' money, what planet you flew from?
Crashed on a hard rock, comets and group homes, cosmo's kitchen known as the New York
Outer world witch, birthed as a new born, spaceship Porsche, the roof gone
Platform boots hanging out the Coup door, Harlem world make chips and move on
Nebula Rapunzel, welcome the new star, I'm ahead of your shake and your shoes, Ma
E.T. phone home or fold it like a futon, comparisons no need for the use of
Keep on, the phoenix, the phenom, fuse bolt, fire and speed off
Here to take you higher, the leader, balance off the sign of a Libra

Pay close attention
Pay close attention
Pay close attention
I'll take your brain to another dimension
I'll take your brain to another dimension4Embed
