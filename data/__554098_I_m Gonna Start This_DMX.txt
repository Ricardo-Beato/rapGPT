5 ContributorsIâ€™m Gonna Start This LyricsOh oh, what have they done now?
I want everybody who can see me, to put ya motherfuckin Xs in the air!
Grrr... You Know!
When the dog is on the stage!

(DMX)
Grrr... Grrr... Grrr...
What? What? What?
One two one two, come through run through
Gun who, oh you don't know what the (gun do!)
Some do, those that know are real quiet
Let me think you wanna try it, fuck around and (start a riot!)
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless because I'm the
Hardest rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up for real, get up and feel, my words
I make herbs split up (and squeal)
Ill is all I've been hearin lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late (for that 911 call)
Niggas stay beefin' but a lot of them bluffin'
But not me because I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them tough, just for frotin', when I hit them niggas
Like ('what you want?'), the battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasin' 'em down
We all knew that you was pussy, but I'm (tastin' it now)
And never give a dog blood because raw blood have a dog like
(What?) bitin' whatever all up in ya gut
Give it to them raw like that, and ain't no love I do em
All like that, four right up in they back (clack clack)
Close your eyes baby, it's over, forget it
Happened in front of your buildin' but nobody knows who did itYou might also likeEmbed
