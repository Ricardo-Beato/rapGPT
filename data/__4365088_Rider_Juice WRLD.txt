Wha-
Uh
Let's see if you a rider
Let's see if you a rider
That sounds clean

Hey
Let's see if you a rider for real
I don't know if you a rider for real
I'ma fight for your love, survival for real
Uh-huh

Let's see if you a rider for real
I really wanna see if you a rider for real
Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real
I don't know, I don't know
If I should give you the key to my soul
I don't know, no, I don't know
My paranoia and insecurities hold me close

Lay me down to sleep with my casket closed
Nail it shut, make sure not to leave a thing exposed
I don't know, oh, I don't know
Blonde hair don't care, please don't leave me froze
Stuffed cigarillos and Percs keep me whole
"Should've shot it in the head" — words from my bro
But anything for romance, I'ma risk it all
Oh, oh
You might also like
Let's see if you a rider for real
I really wanna see if you a rider for real
Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real
I don't know, I don't know
If I should give you the key to my soul
I don't know, no, I don't know
My paranoia and insecurities hold me close

I'm codeine Cobain, I'ma pour a four
I don't do cocaine, but it's Perc in my nose
I suffer from excessive road-rage
Take my life and crash it into this ho
It don't matter, you can have my heart
Kill me faster, what's mine is yours
On a platter, I watched you grab that dagger
She's a stabber
But is she a rider?
Or is she poison, a viper?
She gets me high as supplier and I'm on fire
Will she be my firefighter?

Let's see if you a rider for real
I really wanna see if you a rider for real
Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real
I don't know, I don't know
If I should give you the key to my soul
I don't know, no, I don't know
My paranoia and insecurities hold me close18Embed
