76 ContributorsGotta Eat Lyrics
I swear, if I see this nigga, I'mma kill him
I'm, going, to kill, him
So! Make a nigga suffer
You know what I'm saying?

My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy

Hey, he had a whole lot of cheese
Plus he was a mack, had a whole lot of steez
Made a lot of niggas fat, gave a whole lot of Gs
Grams, man, he had a whole lot of these
And he would let you hold, like, a whole lot of ki's
Even if you lose some, he would give you new ones
Twice the bread, it's like he had two buns
And he had a whole lot of seeds
Even his kids had meals for reals
Some rich small fries wrapped in paper since they was lil
Catch up, nigga
You might also like
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy

He was a heart breaker
And a law shaker
If it was about caking, he was a partaker
International, he would take trips
Bon voyage, that's how hard he was fishing for the chips
So greedy, never gave to the needy, that's what some say
The way he shunned all the bums hanging in the subways
He called 'em fruits and laughed at 'em
Delivery man, on the pick-up
Drive through and throw a bag at 'em
And it was hard to understand him sometimes
Making a killing, the way he had 'em standing in line
Like

My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Lovers call him King, haters call him Clown
He would say "Bite me, that's the way it's going down"
He was having thoughts that maybe he should retire
Went to Church on a Sunday and saw a deep Friar
Said he had beef and people want him dead
He loved the hungry ones, was only scared of the Feds
He lived the fast life, couldn't get his path right
The Friar just told him 'bout the Hooters that he had last night
"Turn yourself in to the paddy wagon", said "No"
Bacon wouldn't take him, had the Pigs on the payroll

My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy

To be continued on another menu, ya dig?
Will he give up his life of crime or will he stay?
This and other adventures on Lupe Fiasco's next album, L.U.P.E.N.D.... Yezzir!
(Yo... So stupid)
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
