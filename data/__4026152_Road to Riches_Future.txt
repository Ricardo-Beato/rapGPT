8 ContributorsRoad to Riches Lyrics
You wouldn't believe this shit, baby
Feel like I’m goin' through a crisis, I can't let this shit phase me
I let the streets raise me, my momma tried to save me
I ain’t been asleep in a decade, I'm damn near crazy
I need to see a plug, money is a drug
Tryna stay on it long as I have breath in my lungs
Had a talk with Messiah, everything about to come
Young nigga, become, you got the world in your palm
Call it Future Baby flow, well that's just some shit by accident
I don't rap 'bout spittin' no sympathy
Pull strings, nigga, like symphony
The limit is the sky 
Astrology, I'm a astronaut forever, nigga
I'm ghetto and I’m clever, nigga

On the road to riches
I’m into cars and bitches
Don't let it affect you
Don’t let it affect you
On the road to riches
Took many nights and days
Don't let it affect you
Don't let it affect you
You might also like
I do cocaine, I be drippin' on
I’m sippin' lean, no gasoline
This gon' help my dreams, I'ma clear my thoughts
When I hit the scene I'ma come out clean
I can't fold, bro, this for my soldiers
Can't throw no names, that's a dirty game
Free Lil Boosie, love is pain
Love the game, but can't take the pain
I been the same ever since they unwrapped the whole thang
Fuckin' with my sanity, I did this shit for my family
It wasn't supposed to be this hard, I fucked around, start gamblin'
Shoot outs in the park 'til somebody call up the ambulance
I know some niggas that'll hit your head for a half a gram
Won't fall for anything, sacrificin' who I am
I'm in a cheddar race, 'cause Asgard up in a better place
I'm in outer space, can't feel my face I'm astronaut, whatever, nigga
I'm ghetto and I'm clever, nigga

On the road to riches
I'm into cars and bitches
Don't let it affect you
Don't let it affect you
On the road to riches
Took many nights and days
Don't let it affect you
Don't let it affect youEmbed
