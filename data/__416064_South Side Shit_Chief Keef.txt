16 ContributorsSouth Side Shit Lyrics
Man I'm feeling . Put the gun up em, Tadoe!
Smoking on loud, eyes red like tomato
On the low I gotta problem, call up my cousin Tadoe
I'm on a fuckin' pay roll, tryna get them pesos
I tell 'em talk is cheap, but these hoes they be flexin'
I teach them hoes a lesson, Lamron's what I'm reppin'
The kush is in the air, my nigga Woo he steady blazin'
The life is so amazing, hell, my niggas raising
Wiiic, Brick City, shout out to my 064 niggas
Kick it through ya door nigga, you ain't shit but a ho nigga
Fuck with my 064 niggas, family on the flo' nigga
That choppa burn you up, have you lookin' like so, nigga
I wouldn't take your life if it wasn't such crime-a
Excuse me judge, I can't even see a touch of drama
Let me fuck mama, or suck mama
You think you bad, but you look more like a duck, mama
See I'm tryna get my cash right
She taking mad hype, living in the fast life
I got my cash right, so now I'm in the mood
And that pump had 'em jumpin' like tennis shoes
My flow hot, I think I need a cooler
She wanna measure my dick, she said she need a ruler
I've seen her fool up, fuck her the first night
She call the plumber up, but I get the worst pipe
Do the math, no addition to it
You talkin' faces of paper, yeah I can get to it
This the attitude and I'ma get it miced up
I'm on my con, have your show full of 
Throw your sets up, nigga rep your hood
Wic City and you better respect the hood
And if I make a note, I'll never forget the hood
And if you lookin' for me, yeah I'll be in the hood
You might also like
It's Front Street, we mold niggas like Play-Do
Old school nigga, got the heat up with the potato
Move when I say so, Coke color mayo
Whippin' through the hood and I'm all about my peso
Get up off my pay roll, get paid like the sports pro
Shootin' come easy to me, it's like a free throw
Trappin' come easy to me, so I get real though
Aim for your middle, just like a field goal
The red traffic light crossing gods
I got fifteen jabs at these other guys
When you selling weight, you better watch for problems
I'm on a track with Chief Keef, you niggas got a problem?
Bitch still on my waist, that's the problem solver
And if you going there, then we going farther
And if you going hard, then we going harder
Cannon blow a hole in yo chest, rocket launcher
We prepared for problems, we prepared for mobsters
With everything from a snub nose to a rocket launcher
So prepare your mobsters, hope they prepared for problems
I'm reppin' Dipset and no, we is not in Harlem1Embed
