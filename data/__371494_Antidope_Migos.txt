What-you-want
Mi-go!
No, no, no
Migo!
Go!

Call me what you want but you can't call me broke (money)
Pull up with that choppa and a telescope
Got 50 chickens in with me, runnin' around in my city
Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys
We makin' a motion picture (movie), Michelangelo (movie)
I'm seein' the snakes in the grass - shhh!
I got the antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope
Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope

Yo, Quavo
I got the antidope try to come juuggin' and I'm bustin' your cantaloupe
I'm trappin' out of the bando, still got tools like Rambo (bando)
I'm feelin' like Harry Houdini (Houdini)
The pack was just here did you see it
The plug he be here any second now (plug)
If he didn't then something went down (fuck, what?)
We losing our bags, gotta go to the stash (huh?)
At the age of 19, I was running from the task
Put it on my mama (mama!), no flex, no brag
Young nigga been had cash
Just me and Rel Money got rich off a half a bag
That's why they mad
You might also like
Call me what you want but you can't call me broke (money)
Pull up with that choppa and a telescope
Got 50 chickens in with me, runnin' around in my city
Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys
We makin' a motion picture (movie), Michelangelo (movie)
I'm seein' the snakes in the grass - shhh!
I got the antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope
Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope

I got the antidope
I'm feelin' like Scarface, Al Pacino comin' off a banana boat
And how the fuck 200 Migo touchin' down in Mexico
Fuckin' around with Eduardo, told me that he know Armando
Armando fuckin' with Carlos, Carlos wrappin' em up in the barcodes
Ridin' around with that Scotty in brand new Bugattis
OG Miley Cyrus, snakes tryna give me the virus
But I got that antidope like I know science but I'm no scientist
Fuckin' around with them bombs but I am no terrorist
Piss on your bitch, that R. Kelly shit
I'm on Mount Everest sippin' on medicine

Call me what you want but you can't call me broke (money)
Pull up with that choppa and a telescope
Got 50 chickens in with me, runnin' around in my city
Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys
We makin' a motion picture (movie), Michelangelo (movie)
I'm seein' the snakes in the grass - shhh!
I got the antidope, (*antidope*) antidope, (*antidope*) antidope, (*antidope*) antidope
(*Antidope*) Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope
Austin Powers, you niggas be takin' my mojo (takin' my mojo)
Young nigga I got the antidope
Coke and baking soda minerals (Cocaina)
I got a brick in the figure-four
Young nigga I never made honor roll (no)
But I know how to add up them digits (I do)
Whippin' and cookin' and flippin' chickens (I do)
You say you got money but pussy nigga you don't have a witness 'cause I've never seen it
I'm a rich nigga I mean it (rich nigga)
Keep talkin' bullets go through yo' beanie
I'm in a Phantom Ghost, call that shit Casper
Young nigga plugged in like adapters
Stomp yo' ass out like an Alpha
Ahead of you niggas, you still in the first chapter

Call me what you want but you can't call me broke (money)
Pull up with that choppa and a telescope
Got 50 chickens in with me, runnin' around in my city
Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys
We makin' a motion picture (movie), Michelangelo (movie)
I'm seein' the snakes in the grass - shhh!
I got the antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope
Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope81Embed
