88 ContributorsSuperheroes Lyrics
By myself cause these niggas yes men, ayy
Bitch, I'm Almighty Sosa Batman, ayy
Know I got my Smith & Wesson, ayy
That be my illegal weapon, ayy
I'm off this Earth, I feel like Superman
Cocky like He-Man, cut like Wolverine, ayy
Come through yo' block like Green Goblin, ayy
Wetting shit up, Spiderman

Come through your block, ayy
Like Batman with a Glock, ayy
Red beams on the gun, bitch, Cyclops, ayy
Wonder Woman, I name my watch, ayy
I got my heat, I feel like He-Man
Bought Sandman to the beach, so bitch, I'm Seaman, ayy
I got a cold from all this ice, man, ayy
Don't make me flash my fuckin' pipe, man, ayy
I'm Spiderman, my uncle got killed off white, man
Come through your block, Star Wars with the shots
Daredevil with a cane c'ause I'm shootin' like I'm blind, ayy
Smokin' Liu Kang kush, Sub-Zero, the whole nine, ayy
Now I'm feelin' like I'm Walkin' Dead bitch, Sosa Rick Grimes

By myself cause these niggas yes men, ayy
Bitch, I'm Almighty Sosa Batman, ayy
Know I got my Smith & Wesson, ayy
That be my illegal weapon, ayy
I'm off this Earth, I feel like Superman
Cocky like He-Man, cut like Wolverine, ayy
Come through yo' block like Green Goblin, ayy
Wetting shit up, Spiderman, ayy

Flacko order quarter coke straight from Sosa man
That's that soda, eyes the color of Coca-Cola cans
Green like Cloverland, everyday I'm blowin' grams
Everything is purple, guess I am the Joker then
Life's a game of poker, tell that nigga, "Show your hand"
I'm pullin' cards, I think it's time you niggas fold again
Told you soldiers with the scope I show attack
Told you, blow you, John Doe you then
Now nobody know the man, damn
From rippin' the Benz
Flippin' the rims, flippin' a fifth to a gram
Now I get in advance, I'm rich again
Switchin' more bitches in France
We ain't rapin' hoes, but we we out here cookie stealin'
You Captain Save-A-Hoe, nigga, I'm the pussy villain
Spiderman, Peter Parker, I'm like Peter Pan
Treat my opps like Cyclops if I see the man
Wolverine in skinny jeans, diamonds Billy Jean
They tap dance, the Batman is a black man

By myself cause these niggas yes men, ayy
Bitch, I'm Almighty Sosa Batman, ayy
Know I got my Smith & Wesson, ayy
That be my illegal weapon, ayy
I'm off this Earth, I feel like Superman
Cocky like He-Man, cut like Wolverine, ayy
Come through yo' block like Green Goblin, ayy
Wetting shit up, Spiderman, ayy83Embed
