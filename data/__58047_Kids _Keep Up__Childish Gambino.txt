93 ContributorsKids (Keep Up) Lyrics
If we were kids, I'd want to give
You everything that you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys
But all they wanna do is
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

I guess I'm fuckin' now, I'm gettin' used to it
It's 'cause I shine and I ain't gotta use a crucifix
Fuck the fussin' and fightin' and arguin' to this and that
And, "Why you being mean to me, Donald?"
I never text her back
I know it's comin' quick, wishin' I could fast forward
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to alpha male, because of that dollar bill
When I worked the mail room, I ain't have a shot in hell
I called her ass for two months, ain't heard shit from her
These girls couldn't care less when ya chips under
The chips are up and on my shoulder, you heard me?
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The girls I tried to hit last year, I still might
Karma's a bitch who doesn't suck, but I still like
If we were kids, I'd have the black K-swiss and Reebok
If we were kids, I wouldn't act like this, but we not
You might also like
If we were kids, I'd wanna give you everything
That you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys
But all they wanna do is
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

You made a mistake
These dudes? Man, you bathin' in apes
Findin' you's like findin' Asians I hate
But they say I got a fetish, nah, I’m skippin' all of it
Black and white girls always come wit' a set of politics
That’s all that I was sayin', I’m a proud man
They wanna holler when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes, but she push a brown Focus
And she’s doin' coke in front of me, but act like I don’t notice
There ain't breakage in that Trojan? She see what she wanna see
So I make her take Plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways
They too busy stabbin' hoes like OJ
They too busy trappin' pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before me is "Do, re"
If you had told me the truth, we'd be okay
If we were kids, I'd want to give
You everything that you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys
But all they wanna do is
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

It's alright, it's okay
It's alright, it's okay, girl
It's okay60Embed
