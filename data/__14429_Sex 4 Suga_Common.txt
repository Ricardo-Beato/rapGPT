Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just trying to motivate ya
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just trying to motivate ya
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex

Girl, ooh, you look "uh"
You're the type of thick that I came here for
What's your name? I can't hear ya
Will it be alright if I called you "Suga"?
You could call me "Smokey", I'll be the "Bear"
Your smell is sexy, it's all in the air
Whatcha got girl is so unfair
I like the way you move, so keep it right there
Or you can do what you wanna do
I'm just glad I'm in front of you
But I don't mind being behind
'Cause I'ma touch you where the sun don't shine
Got my hand on my money while you on the grind
In tune with you, cause you so fine
And when you wine, it's genuine
Get on my vine and we can climb
You might also like
Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just trying to motivate ya
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just trying to motivate ya
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex

Heard you used to dance at Magic City
The other girls couldn't have been half as pretty
You look so sexy when you grab them-
Ooooh! Oh yes!
Suga good Lord, you've been blessed
If this is a sin, I must confess
The way you dress, is like burlesque
I guess you don't mind being undressed
I like the way it's going down
Hips are moving all around
Round and round, upside down
I once was lost but now I'm found
Sweetheart, can you give me another round?
Sweating like you losing pounds
Touch the ground, making sounds
Suga, ooh Suga, you wear the crown
Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just trying to motivate ya
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just trying to motivate ya
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex

All that dancing, Suga
Make me want to do ya
The way you move and shake it
Ah-ah, on the dance floor
Wanna touch and feel ya
We can get familiar
The way you move and shake it
Make me want you some more
Ooh, you making my nature rise
We can do more than fantasize
Let's do the do, me and you
We can whoa-oh-whoa and whoopty whoo
Your physique brings out my freak
I like the way your body speaks
I want some of you every day of the week
Suga Suga, you ain't nothin' sweet, uh

Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just trying to motivate ya
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just trying to motivate ya
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex
Sex 4 suga, suga 4 sex1Embed
