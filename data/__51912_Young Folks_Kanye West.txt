17 ContributorsYoung Folks Lyrics
Plain Pat, what up?

I've always been the same since back in the day
Always felt like we should get paid
To be on magazines or we get played
Why did he say it? I don't know, ask Gabe
Now I'm on the magazines where the roses are
Poppin' champagne and that Ros√© Dom
Won a few awards, then we went on tour
And yup, in my bag, a whole bag of porn
Magazines hate him, then they love him
Then they hate him (We hate him)
Fuck it, what to say then? (fuck it)
Cover of The Fader (Yeah)
Now I'm on my way up (Now I'm on my way up!)
Now you want me say what? Huh, you want me say what?
I be talking my shit so I guess I'm an asshole
They be kick and pushin' like Lu Fiasco
And I guess every time I'm just gon' get in that mode
Suck up to the press, I guess I missed that boat
I did an interview with the Rolling Stones
Read the interview, man, the whole shit wrong
Far as this shit go, you know the way I wanna glow
I need Al Gore to recount that vote
You know, you know
You know, you know
You think that you know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but I'm right here
You think you really know, but you have no idea
And I'm gon' be the same my whole career, yeah
I'm gon' stay the same my whole career, you know?You might also like5Embed
