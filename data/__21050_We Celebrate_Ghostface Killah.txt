11 ContributorsWe Celebrate Lyrics
Oh yeah, as we celebrate hip-hop, baby
Oh yeah, as we celebrate hip-hop, baby, whoa
Yeah, it's Ghostface and the man Kid Capri
Let's celebrate New York, around the world
And yo, Ghostface, go in heavy, man, let's do it!

(I just want to celebrate)
Like my squad won the Super Bowl
(I just want to celebrate)
Like we bangin' on New Years Eve, y'all
(I just want to celebrate)
Like we just beat trial
(I just want to celebrate)
We hype for just being here

Stones on every arm, the crib is ten million
The corks from Dom Perignon can't reach my ceiling
Four maids with four grenades
When the sun's in my face, all I do is lower the walls for shade
The pool's a pain in the ass, 50 grand on Windex, kid
They keep it clean, the whole bottom is glass
So you can see the sharks and piranhas, a pair of pajamas
That's my neighbor, the faggot disresepecting my mama
No cars in the garage, it's underground shit
They way the floor open up you think I'm hiding spaceships
French chefs, the best grapes on they breath
Louie aprons on the Yank cats, the puffy cooks the rest
Besides, I got birds that never leave the nest
They fuck with me, I'll watch 'em confess, then I'll go rest
Get back up, deposit them checks
Muthafuckas fuckin' up a good time by snappin' your necks
You might also like
(I just want to celebrate)
Like my baby's first steps, you heard?
(I just want to celebrate)
Like my first time platinum, y'all
(I just want to celebrate)
Like my first piece of nookie, uhh
(I just want to celebrate)
We hype for just being here

Money for everybody, candy to the kids
Catch me on dateline, Starky too big
I'm like a mannequin; I stay jig
Mansion parties for all star weekend in my L.A. crib
We came to party, run out of Goose we got Dollies
Shorty's sweatin' me, check out her body
Throw up your hands like it's your birthday, mami
Let's celebrate, now I got her girlfriends behind me
Now I'm in the middle, watch is all chiseled
I can holla at the birds, like Dr. Dolittle
(What's that in your pocket, Ghost?) A Dill pickle
(Not that) Oh, that's the .45 stainless nickel
I'm pullin' a green, got a G for the biggest ass on the floor who look right in them jeans
If you fat, I might take one for the team
But I gotta get drunk first, know what I mean? Come on!
(I just want to celebrate)
Like we won the Power Ball money
(I just want to celebrate)
Tony Starks won an Oscar, y'all
(I just want to celebrate)
Like all of my goons just came home
(I just want to celebrate)
We 'bout to have a good year

Na-na-na-na-nah, you can't catch me
I'm out like Thomas in a five-fifty
Police be fiending to frisk me
I'm so legit I walk away with the car keys pissy
Back at the labo, shorty wop need a Dutch
He fuckin' wit a Goose dick, tonight I'ma beat it up
Your thing to wet, you sure you ain't seeded up?
(That's how I get, Ghost, especially when you eat it up)
My goodness gracious, ass is flirtatious
Move it around like a snake miss or sexy waitress
Ghost don't have no patience
I like you, I usually change chicks like radio stations
I'm definitely not looking for love
But if you give it to me right now I might say I was
You can chill if you want, I got crazy bud
But before we do, what it do, go jump in the tub; come on!
(I just want to celebrate)
Throw your hands up, nigga
(I just want to celebrate)
Pop the 'pagne, pop the cork
(I just want to celebrate)
Representin' on the streets of New York
(I just want to celebrate)
{Ghostface} We 'bout to have a good year

Yeah, we gets it in, gets it in, gets it in
New York, we been had it, we gets it in
Outta town we fuckin' up but gets it in
Worldwide we doin', we gets it in
The Ghostface, Kid Capri, I gets it in
That's no joke, when we here, we get it in
No kiddin', in the building
Getting it in, all day, getting it in...Embed
