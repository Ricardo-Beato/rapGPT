17 ContributorsRight Now Lyrics
She got a gun in her purse right now
Got a scale in her purse right now
Got some pills in her purse right now
She got a bag in her purse right now
She got a gun in her purse right now
A pocket scale in her purse right now
I brought my weed in her purse right now
I brought my pills in her purse right now, right now

And she cooking up the dope in Louis
Dropping off the work in juicy
Her bag and her shades by Pucci
And she do the money dance in Loubi's
Don’t let a nigga in my house
Don’t let him take food out my mouth
Bet she got a pistol right now
I bet she got a scale right now
I bet she got fishscale now
You can’t get it, she can show you how
Bring that money back, make me proud
And I have that bitch Burberry’d down
You the queen, don’t let her take your crown
Bitch you know that you got to stay down
We gone try to take this shit out of town
I got a team of bitches, they so stout
Every time they walk, they draw crowds
And every time you say my name out loud
A flock of bad bitches gone come around
And I found her in the lost and found
You can’t have her back, she mine now
You too big for this lil bitty town
And it’s a shark filled ocean, don’t drown
You might also like
She got a gun in her purse right now
Got a scale in her purse right now
Got some pills in her purse right now
She got a bag in her purse right now
She got a gun in her purse right now
A pocket scale in her purse right now
I brought my weed in her purse right now
I brought my pills in her purse right now, right now

Got my gun and my work right now
All my other bitches bark right now
I don’t give a fuck, they don’t give a fuck right now
I’m a grown boy, I ain’t immature right now
Riding with the with the ops, get you brought right down
Pull up on your ass like you out of love right now
And when I’m done, trey is what I chug right now
Thot gone give me top, but she in the club right now
Ring ring, man I think that it’s a pull up right now
I’m too quick to send a nigga slug right now
 y’all get the snub and the club right now
Your bitches love the club, she in the tub right now
Just cause I fucked her, think that she in love right now
Blue hundreds, think that I’m in love right now
I’m on that bullshit, just because I’m from Chi-town
Turn the lights off, I'ma still shine right now
Right now
She got a gun in her purse right now
Got a scale in her purse right now
Got some pills in her purse right now
She got a bag in her purse right now
She got a gun in her purse right now
A pocket scale in her purse right now
I brought my weed in her purse right now
I brought my pills in her purse right now, right now

I made it, I’m famous, got a few Mercedes
Smoking on that gas and boy you know I’m faded
G L O, you didn’t know that I’m related
How you know I’m real, just listen how I say it
My black Uber’s out in LA yo
These hoes handle balls like a Pele, pro
Milonaki got eyes on your mommy
Spend a few dimes with some new Versace
We lay back here, so stay back here
Fuck with the gang you get paid back quick
So fall back ho, we getting all that dough
Glass gang but the squad is G L O

She got a gun in her purse right now
Got a scale in her purse right now
Got some pills in her purse right now
She got a bag in her purse right now
She got a gun in her purse right now
A pocket scale in her purse right now
I brought my weed in her purse right now
I brought my pills in her purse right now, right now1Embed
