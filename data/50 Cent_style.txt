Yeah, uhuh, let's take 'em there, yeah

Sonny did ten years in the fed joint, he half way out
He ain't home, his ass in a halfway house
Correctional facilities don't correct shit
Cause the first thing he asked is who gotta get hit
A shoot out in 89' fucked up how he walk
He a grimey ass nigga, you should hear how he talk
Should shoot the shepard in the head and da sheep ill scatter
Let niggas talk cause action is all that matters
I asked about Barnes he sucked his teeth and said he was soft
Said the boys up in Otisville was breakin him off
Can you picture him in the yard, niggas yokin him up
Treatin him like a pin cushion, pokin him up
He came home actin like he hard as fuck
Must want a first class ticket to see god Uh huh
He stick his chest out tellin' niggas he don't back down
Wait until he find out Sonny’s back 'round

Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, that somethin gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Without a strap, and you gon getcha ass layed down

Heard he was outta town ridin round in the pound
Chrome spinnin' 545 I no lie ask how

Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine (Uh-uh)
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the dropout who made more money than his teachers
Roofless like the coupe, but I come with more features

It feels good to blow fifty grand and think nothing of it, fuck it

A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a Batman
What the fuck, are you retarded?
You touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed

This ain't Batman, Robin, Cagney or Lacey
It's 50 Cent and Shady, the worst, baby
Put your hands on my peoples I'll react crazy (Yeah!)
Put a hole through your front and your back, maybe
But go 'head, you try me
I'll have your ass hooked up to an IV
I leave no witnesses when I ride, B
You fuck with me, you'll see
I react like an animal and tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder I'd major in art
Niggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start
But being a little off landed me on top of the charts (Woo!)
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
Hammer cocked back, hollow tip in the chamber, danger
Anger'll change ya, and make you aim that and squeeze

We're walking away from a beef in which clearly you started
I said, "We're walking away,", did you hear me?
You oughta be thankful that we ain't beefin'
We’re still breathing and just leave it at THAT!
'Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that BAT!—mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rap it's gonna be BRAT!
Retaliation, it'll be like them Muslim Shi'a ATTACKS!
Somewhere along the line it's like me and 50 made a PACT!
He's got my back, I got his back (BACK!)
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
'Cause when we beef we pull each other into the bullshit
Like we're conjoined at the hip, this is unavoidable
Some of the shit is squashable; some shit'll never boil over
Some of it will just simmer at best if left alone
But let it be known there will be no sitdowns
With no Daves and 'Zinos
There will be no peace discussions with me
There ain't gonna be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fucking with me and I'll gladly quit fucking with you
Just spit your sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentioning me
Or the machine of Jimmy Iovine or Dre or 50
Or D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be
Or we'll be—*knock-knock*—with a

Nigga, you get it twisted, you gon' get your wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie, I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme, you plot it, you can count me in I'm with it
You cross me, you gon' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta, you know me I talk 'cause I live it
Shell cases drop, when that chopper chop, way up the block
Get hit with copper tops, when the drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run call the cops
This ain't new, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you, I want it
It's not a game, perfect aim
You feel the flame up against your brain
Man it's so hot, I'll make you wish it rained

I got a Gatman, if there's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a Batman

Punks frontin' in they rhymes

I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holler at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holler get 'em, girls, daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's (Yeah)
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny (Yeah)

Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord

Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?

If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now, we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)

If you listen long enough, I'll send some humor, make you smile
Got you outta pocket, now bitch go on choose a pimp
Doc blew me, lost my momma, I've been pimpin' ever since

She'll do anything for me and that drives me crazy
We get our grind on
I let her blow on my dice
Then my luck change, I hit the h right twice

Fuck it, I mean we gotta kill what we eat, right? It's not a problem, it's really not a problem. Southside

Okay, the dope addin' up, the coke addin' up
The smoke addin' up, my pockets are fattened up
I got bitches in my bedroom, nerds on computers
Diamonds 'round my neck, straps for my shooters
I made it, look ma', I made it
I grind so hard to get here I can't be faded
I got lawyers on the line, five different kinds
Five different crimes, same .45
Got client-attorney privilege, so a nigga ain't lyin'
Cause they ain't gon' say I did it and I ain't gon' say I did it
And I might go back and forth to court, but I bet I get acquitted
Can you dig it? Nigga, can you dig it?
Shit changed, a nigga ain't broke
I had a safe size as a shoe box, it felt like a vault
Now I got real money, that "fuck how you feel" money
That "nigga, you look at me wrong, get killed" money

The mollies had a shorty ass trippin' strippin' in my kitchen
Push my thumb in her ass while I was strokin' her kitten
I be in my own zone, still clutchin' the chrome
Talk state of the art, you will see 'nine to foe
My passport need pages, I'm fuckin' round' out in London
Jetlag from jets, wrist lit baguettes
Trippin' in my charm, look bitch, I'm a don
So shit go how I say it go, fuck if I'm right or wrong
My paper long, bomb kush in the bong
It feels like I'm dreamin' cause a nigga on
I'm so far from a hammy down, I'm out in Miami now
My bitch no  speak no ingles, she fresh off the boat
She give me neck, what you expect? I got connects for the dope

I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies

Yeah, niggas send me the wrong message, we gon' fucking kill the messenger
Your whole clique, hollow tips'll tear up the best of ya
This ain't the "Carter" nigga, this is Sparta
It's harder, I die and be a martyr, respect me like your father
Let off a clip or let a case off
I have your pussy ass running like a race horse
Follow orders now, Yay' shoot his face off
You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun
See how when you listen to me all of the cash gone
I was born with the tech, it's a birth defect
I was conceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
This is what happens when have-not's turn into Sasquatch
Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks
It's horrific, nah, it's terrific
I got it if you sniff it, go 'head nigga twist it
Get lifted, goddamn I'm gifted

Now you can watch me, nigga, like the police watch me
I move properly, go ahead catch a shell trying to stop me
F430 Spider, carbon fiber
Hit my targets like Al Qaeda, natural fighter
Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider
The MAC'll fire, the mask like Michael Myers
It's awfully quiet when I get on my bullshit
No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
You can explain to my niggas while they whoop yo' ass
My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
Last time I itched like this, a truckload came in
Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid
Nigga, try me, son, he best have the heat on him
Whip him outta his clothes, get to mopping the street with him
Boy, I'll put your body in a bag

Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see a OG
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must decease existin', little nigga, now listen (Yeah)

Knowing that if you get knocked, you get fucked in the yard (Ah)
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle (Haha)
I eat you for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful 'cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from your hood, you have no history (Uh-huh)

You're never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah or Crack Child
Them niggas there just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back, better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys saying, "50 we feeling you, mane"
Now y'all stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne

I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery, okay?
'Cause, see, they don't know me, Delicious
Do they know me? Okay, I thought so

And I will Jet Li his ass, wa-ta!40Embed
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip frontin', stuntin', it's something you want
745, chrome spinners, haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot, you know I ain't stoppin'

Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What, nigga? Lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling

Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me

Smoking that bong 'cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer, 'cause I'm a stunner
I sit back and wonder when them angels gon' call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion, I ain't lyin'
Bounty hunters got me flying with my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder, Hennessy and soda
Hood on my shoulder, look in the mirror, I see a soldier

This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears (What else?)
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy (What else?)
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies, frontin' (C'mon)
Like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers (C'mon)
There's no way I'ma back down like a goddamn coward, I can't
How would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, woah, yo, ho
Hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole 'nother side I wanted to not show you (C'mon)
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause

You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s
Triplets, quadruplets and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetus is falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl, I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard, still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?

Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no, not a drop

He must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn-burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn-learn
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn-turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many-many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I say I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)

Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)

You niggas gone work for me now, you gone see now

Try to dodge and weave it, end up a paraplegic
Believe me, its easy, I'll hurt you, I'll murk you
I'll pop something, drop something, I ain't going to stop hunting
Run, run, 'til you're spun, one shot, one gun
One 911 emergency, it's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake, I'm hitting you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang, nigga, shit ain't a game
Do the math or get blast, bullets go through the glass
Goes through your ass fast and the leather seat in your Nav
Nigga, its not a war when there's casualties on one side, I ride
Turn it up on you nigga after Jake ride by
I click-clack, that's that, I don't flash, I mash

In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit

It's like it's a race, who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind

She loves me, she loves me not (Yeah)
She loves me not

The fiends need me, I ain't around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H, man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now, you tryna leave me, you never live without me
Girl, I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now, put that needle to your arm princess, stick it in, relapse
I'm back, bitch—don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart, you dirty bitch, I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken

We got a love thing, girl, you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be

After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote "Sexual Healing"
Kurt Cobain—we were good friends; Ozzy Osbourne, too
I be with rock stars—see, you lucky I'm fucking with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See, this is new to you, but to me, this ain't new
I live the lavish life; listen, if the mood is right
Me, you, and your sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong; if you hyper, I make you calm
I'll be your incentive, a reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise me you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell your mama's TV
I love you—love me back; no one said loving me'd be easy

I got you barefooted on glass, chasing a dove
That monkey on your back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me, bitch, you sit there and listen to 'em
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up; when you down, they got nothing to say
But when you call up, I come running, I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down; they crowned you prom queen
They know 'bout me; behind your back, they call you a fucking fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you?
Push me inside you; no other man can love you like I do
Call me Daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean, real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us; it was carved in a tree
Forever, me and you, baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter; what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

We got a love thing, girl, you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be

Aw!
It hurts
The D's trying to pin a murder on me
In the precinct they saying I done murdered homie
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homie
And everybody know my niggas murder for me

You see homo on your crib, it ain't a burglary homey
They finna to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the sticking when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait, I'm getting sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksucking police got it in for me
They flash their lights, they wanna rough me up
Frisk me, find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new Bebo's, who gon' be Eddie Byrne?
Huh, we'll find out when niggas let off the rounds
And his partner's screaming officer down

Police get in the way
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes
I'll murder them, I said I'll murder them
Any motherfucker touch me
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
You don't believe me, wait and see
I'll murder them, you see I told you I'd murder them

And the third one, came from showing niggas my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggas crawling under cars when I start to cappin'
So they don't know what to say to the captain
But they know if word get back, something gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitching where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay, I go first
Cause your baby's momma is my baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

Police get in the way

This is how monsters function
Leave me alone
I ain't fucking with nobody

Keep fucking with me you going turn me back to Boo-Boo
Have me casing out your crib, trying to pop your fucking noodles
She was 20, I was 12, man my Nana said she raped me
I just smiled from ear to ear, saying take me, baby, take me
Since high school, nigga, I ain't got no friends
Got two 380s like the Ying Yang Twins (Haaan)
That's spot clicking till the Ds run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees, you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane
In a ill herringbone, I got them swinging Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run forrest run, retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Ruger, that Pump and that Tec at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shipment, but you had like twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreaming
We just got in the town, we was strapped up scheming
First Country caught a body, then Country caught a body
Then I popped a couple niggas then Country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit, you got to love it
Trey-eight Snub it, and don't think nothing of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it popping when we shopping, niggas hold down the tools

My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fucking stash up
I had 250 grams stashed on the porch
I mean, how much you going to smoke, man?
How much you going to snort?
First the VCR went, then the TV went
He stole out of mommy purse
She thought it was me, kid
I ain't ask her for no money, son
Cause I was out hustling
She was looking at me sideways like I'm a thief or something
That hurt me, come on son that wouldn't hurt you?
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub
The Lord don't have imperfections, baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazing

When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up
I'ma get in the other car
Aight

If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin'
To me, I'll ride by and blow your brains out (Brains out)
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out (Thangs out)
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfuckin' tape in court
I'll kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm sayin', homie, I ain't playin'
Catch you slippin', I'ma kill you, I ain't playin'

And your brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box (Yeah)
In the hood, summertime is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason (Woo)
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying "Lord, Jesus help me" 'cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your little handgun 'til you run out
And you can run for your backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up
God's on your side? Shit, I'm aight with that
'Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me, you're fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck, you're luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood

Behind that twinkle in your eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So there'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride 'til the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up, I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the fifty grand you put in the hood
But your shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol, I define the definition of pain
If you survive, your bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie, this is a whole different type of war game
See, the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains

You can admire me or you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine

I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line, boy, I'ma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad, I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk, but I don't know these niggas

And seen a MAC aiming at your head, man?
Before you know it life is flashing, reminiscing
And your body is dripping and full of lead, mane
I done been there, I done copped that
It ain't never been a question, I'm bout that
Don't go there, you get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that
You'll never catch me riding around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I be long gone like The Ripper so

Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again

You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth

You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers

And homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt?
I smell somethin' fishy, man, it might be a rat
Damn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese
Spray off Suzukis, eleven hundred CC's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the MAC
In the hood, they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I'll send Yayo to dump thirty shots on your block

Point-blank range, I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass (Woo)
Two weeks later, niggas came through with MACs to lay me down
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue, I get a phone call, "50, what up?"
"They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up"
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy

Boy you forgot my style

Flowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sound so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think ''nigga better you than me''
.38 ain't got no safety, that bullet got no name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it
First shot, pop off, everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching
Run, run, hit the gate, D's yelling ''drop it''
Niggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her, he was innocent
She might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby
But he was outside talking to niggas crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came in to get a close look at nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
ROR, trust me nigga I know the law
Release on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste, I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
First law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying
Oh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures
Trying to come up, still eating around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky charms, stay armed, and niggas won't clap you then
We watch the side bitch talking like she his main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches acting up in here
Police they don't fucking care
Homicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us got to lose
Envision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on till niggas started attacking
Acting like he was the only motherfucker packing

Top dollars to discuss this, whole lot of zeros
When it comes to paper, I blow the soul out a hero
I'ma break before I lay in the floor buried, besides
Every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, we're smoking by the big screen
Changing the channel, looks like I'm playing the Game Boy
I know the watch bothering your vision
But reach, and I put a dot on your head
Like it's part of your religion
Why party with a pigeon? I'm blowing a ten
Because Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison
I'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
But it ain't a problem getting dressed
'Cause my closet got more aisles than Pathmark
Run when we starting a raid
Or leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs
I'm a young pimp, pardon my age
I don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids
Niggas find out what club they at, take them with us
And run a trains on 'em, like a subway map
Your advance is a grey Acura; see these record labels
Got most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper
I go to college on the tour
I'm going down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
Keep your ammo clean, TECs polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hampers that monitor the floor
By now, you probably heard of me, fresh out of surgery
Flashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy
White tee burgundy, you match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear
Heavy when I tote, C-notes from different years
Bezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher
You better off with the stupid guys, looking for a coupe to drive
You ain't getting nutting, but you french fries supersized
It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga
You still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere
You going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life
And your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you
Something positive, alright:

Rich as a motherfucker, and ain't much changed
Open my eyes, no surprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I done went legit
I'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget
The true principles of life are supply and demand
Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand
My man got knowledge of self and my back, God
Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off
My temper volatile, grew up a violent child
Fuck a boy scout, I air your ass out
Nigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck
Shoot a couple head cracks, leave while you're up

Split your fucking body up in half if I want to
Bitch, I'm from New Orleans, but I'm going everywhere
And I have a dream to be your worst nightmare
I'm in the king's chair watching Sportcenter
Then I cut on BET—ah, dinner
Throw your L's up 'cause we taking over
And we hungry, so please come with a chip on your soldier
And we got them guns that gotta sit on your shoulder
I rock ice, but my heart colder

Ay, nigga tell 'em where you from
Southside, I'm a Southside nigga what?
Nigga stunt, you know I tear a nigga up

They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtball nigga
Saying I can't wait 'til I get a little bigger
After niggas jumped me bumping my head
Thinking I wish I had a gun, I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife to finna poke me a nigga
Wishing I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the Caddy
Now those were the days, when crime really paid
The nine milli sprayed, I got the fuck out the way
From shootout to shootout, the bricks went fast
Robberies went bad, niggas got blast
Niggas kidnapped Drew grandpa kid
Came through and shot Ms. Leak in the head
You wonder why I got a gun?
So I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time

It was Kangols, Cazelli shades, Pumas and corn braids
Doo-rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades
Ski mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed
Hoodrats to get laid, money to get made
Yeah, yeah I had a dream
I was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand
Saying ''damn, dope cost sixty a gram'
I got to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say "give it up kid, before I put one in your wig"
Picture me thirsty, riding 'round foaming out the mouth
Saying "I don't get on, I'mma lay a nigga out"
Now diamonds are beautiful and pearls are precious
I hit you and your bitch both over your necklace
I'm wreckless, I spray the semi drunk off Henny
Wipe your blood off the shines, run and sell 'em to Benny
Fuck with me, y'all niggas know Boo Boo get busy
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy

Yeah, I gave Just a buck-fifty, ask him if I cut niggas
Shootouts in Bedford, ask them if I bucked niggas
In four-fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby
Hennessy and cocaine helped to grime me and make me
My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child
Got my ass whooped in Spofford, but never that now
When my name in your mouth
You better watch how you talk
I'll send yo' punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk
I bust a clip, I'll hit ya hip, I'm takin your shit
That's how the eses play, for that SSK
You probably heard through the grapevine
I'm good out in Watts
Bulletproof shit, cruising through them Compton blocks
I'm the beast from the East, but I play on the West
In the drop by myself with my nine and my vest
And you niggas best be on yo' best behavior
I was bred for this shit
Front on me I'mma blaze ya

Coke price go up, capsules come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks
They keep 'em on 'em, right there in they ass crack (Yeah)
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrapping your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere, so get used to me
OGs look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice, went broke, then sold soap
The thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind going against me

But they ain't got no fucking golf courses in the hood
I said I'm selling dope, I don't regret shit
I'm selling dope, nigga, that good shit
I was supposed to be an A student, a valedictorian
Instead I'm in special ED trying to fuck, I'm horny
They didn't like my style, they said they didn't like my style

Fuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip

I caught a A1 felony on my last bid
Kept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick, I ain't seen parole in a minute
Truth be told these niggas is hoes
Once the shit set off, man, anything goes
Through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie

And I'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge
And I'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible

But if you hit 'em in the head you get three
Whether they make it or not, a headshot 's a headshot, nigga
That is unless you did it by mistake

Consider this the theme song for victory
The shit you say to yourself when you make history

Mentally on point, sharp as a machete
Hard work, I work hard, I get the job done
There's only one number 1, nigga, I'm number 1
I'm confident, you can call it vain or conceited
Cars, clothes, I need it

I wanna see what life is like from the mountain top
Who says sky's the limit? I'm limitless, I just took the pill
Why you think a nigga slow flow so ill?
Be careful, the shit I got is highly contagious
We hustled 'til it had us all locked up in cages
Time gon' fly when niggas been bidding for ages
War stories and wounds, back and forth, a nigga been trading
For the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan
We from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we making
I guess it's all risk versus rewards
A nigga risk it all for the broads

Nigga, if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money-money-money

You wanna spray at me? Go 'head; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your little sister calling you stupid, reason why?
Her and your mama in the living room now hog-tied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand-new SIG and that old .38
I be scheming to put a little bread on my plate
Watching dreads serve skunk through a hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch, please
This the stash house, jackpot, there go them keys
My black G-Unit hoodie just reek of marijuana
Cocaine coming out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah, nigga, YEAH!

I'm trying to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA—now, that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two MACs
Then I'm back doing me, I'm back out on a spree
Catch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D
Get me a little crew, I'll have 'em pumping for me
The more product I take, the more paper we see
Change my name in NY, they don't know where I be
Yeah, a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low-key

Live my life behind the rules
Running from the cops, smash the rocks up under my shoes
Spit out the eighth that once, hid in my face
Bounce spring over the gate, didn't get caught
I guess my escape, nigga was fate
I love the block and all the dogs that kept me safe

I got a gift, I communicate with the afterlife
Apparently, your bitch ass ain't acting right
Niggas killed your man, you ain't gon' get him back?
What? You is tired out? Why you ain't get around to that?
You wander, I travel, I have a destination
I'll be a street legend new version of Pappy Mason
My style? It'll never die, boy I'm immortal
You shoot me down, I'll get back up and keep coming for you
Man on fire, hitman for hire
Them niggas got happy they thought I was gon' retire

I got that animal, animal ambition

Why give her love and affection, she just want some bread
I ain't talking or texting, I just want some head
She from a Piru set where all them niggas wear red
I ain't flying no flags, but I'm a gangster, bitch
I say ''say no to drugs'' then I do that shit
Got a blue fleet of whips, I'm so hood nigga rich
You don't like the way I do it, nigga, eat a dick
I just call 'em when I want 'em, I don't need a bitch
You see me stunting with my diamonds on, everything proper
Your shit look chrome and your shit look copper
It's turning, homie, that's why you're turning on me
Admit it, I made it, I can't be faded
I roll it up in public, I'm a cancer, man
Smoke it out in the open like I'm in Amsterdam
I do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
See my name around the globe, niggas know who I am


You say you hustle like a hustle, I be moving the shit
Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks
Got them straps and long clips filled up with led
So when we counting the paper it better come back correct
Out in New Orleans, baby, niggas hungry for bread
Come throrugh that 9th ward stuntin' and get shot in your head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me, you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger, I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Yeah, I'm scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit, my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me, I'll be catching a case
New York a concrete jungle where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and you're dead, you'd be very afraid
I don't know how to behave, untamed fresh out the cage

You know I will let it pop
Front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You know, you think you ill, but you not
You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot

I peep what niggas hate through my peripherals
Boy, if I leave this club back to the car I got some shit for you
Wanna party? We can paint the town red
Them bottles ain't shit to me, a nigga got bread
I'm big money, big business, I love it
Put the bad bitches with big asses and the budget
I'm the boss, so you know shit is going how it gotta go
I don't want talk tonight, I might just buy the hoes
My pleasure principle spend no expense
First I'm happy then she happy that she can pay the rent
It's nothing to a nigga when he up
But when they down I bet you he won't give a bitch a buck
Flip and catch an attitude like ''Bitch, what the fuck?"
You want from a nigga, huh? You fucking up a nigga, huh?'
Look, girl, you know you're sitting on a gold mine
Fuck with them other niggas think you so fine

Man, nigga, know some bullshit I'm all for it
Heroin Don seven sixty leaning
Chrome clean, spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick
Them victim niggas thinking ''Damn, why me?''
I'm thinking why these niggas never try me
Maybe they feel the vibe, they know a nigga live

This is shortie from ya dreams with the ass so fat
This is better than blow, it's better to know
50's that nigga fa sho, fuck with the blow, Slow down
This is the last chance to dance, the last chance for romance
The last, This is the last chance for me to get in your pants
Last chance for us to slide down
It's better than Bentleys it's better than Benz'
It's better than exotic cars when I'm up in it
It feels like Heaven, it's better I bet

Roll that, pass that, cock that, blast that
Flip that, flash that, I'm always where the cash at
That's why I'm in a nigga crib screaming where the stash at
Nigga come up with the chips and get hit

Your hoopty hit up, you ain't dead get up
Nigga, one to the git-ut, 'll hurt more than your sit ups

Bang Bang, G-Unit's the gang, man

I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love
To all my Brooklyn
To all my Uptown
To all my Bronx
To all my Queensbridge

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rip it quick
And kicks it quick - you know how black niggas get
With them hoods, fatigues; with the boots with trees
Smoking weed, flipping keys, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm bagging you, huh
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make them wet in their pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga

Yo, we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya'
Get mad do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., because fuck what she say

Get gassed up, to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it: thou shalt not fuck with, nor see Poppa

Niggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly
Or sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me {*Gun cock*} ha! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit {*Gunshot*}

Either I'm trippin' off the ecstasy
Or I could feel the world turnin' (Yea)
I'm havin' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin'
Comin' up, I was taught never back down (Uh huh)
That's why I act the way I act now, hold the mac down
32 shots, squeeze, there ain't a shell left
Come with my gun smokin', you can smell death
They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie (Ha ha ha)
Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em
There's a lot of talk in the streets about me
Niggas know, ain't nothing sweet about me
They keep asking me questions, (Woo) like "50, who shot ya?...
You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah-Tah?"
Nigga, street shit should stay in the street
So, keep it on the low
But everybody who's somebody already know
A few words for any nigga that get hit the fuck up
My advice if you get shot down, is get the fuck up
Lets go!

I told niggas not to fuck with me they still push me
Figured they'd get away with it cause Tone and Poke pussy
I been gone through static, shot at with automatics (Uh huh)
Since 90, when Nas came out with "Illmatic"
If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
'Cause Tommy Mottola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny (Ha ha ha)
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why your bitch like me
Son I'm a heavyweight, how dare these niggas take me lightly?
I ain't come to make friends and niggas ain't gotta like me
My own homie said "50 (Uh huh), you done (Uh huh) lost yo' mind" (Uh huh)
Cause I shootout in a broad day, run and toss my nine

Can't find a nigga in the hood, that say "50 ain't hot"
When I drop, I'm sell like Eminem or Kid Rock
Play the block, with the watch all rocked the fuck up
Jux me, week later you be shot the fuck up
Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy
This ain't how momma raised me, this how the hood made me
The D's call me by my government name
I be dumb and shoot up parks
Have niggas runnin' like "Jesus comin'"
There's wet pillows in prison, niggas cry in the dark
Cause if they did in the day, niggas would question they heart
So when they come home, they come home walking that tough walk
Talking that "Rikers Island Bing Talk" get's you shot in New York - BBBBLLLLATTTTT
Sex, money, murder, I gotta eat
But I ain't tryna do hard time like Pistol Pete

Mama'd turn in her grave if I married a white chick

Then he was thinking I was scared, nah nigga not me
They don’t understand I was raised by the vultures
Kids laughing like hyenas in a crib full of roaches
Call grandmami "mommy" cause mommy already dead
Daddy been missing since I was a little kid
Now who dared go there playing games with the orphan
They know my pedigree, test me I’mma off ‘em

Stop the blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying

Niggas be schemin', fiendin'
To cut your jooks, take off the hook
I come through there, look how they look
I'm ridin' leanin', they dreamin'
They do me dirty if they could
I'm lookin' like I wish you would
Try me, go 'head, try me
Niggas be schemin', dreamin'
Try me have you hooked to I-V
Niggas be schemin', dreamin'

Mad niggas wan' do me dirty, I'm fresh out the tub
You move like a snail you deserve to catch a slug
Man I wake up huggin' my bitch
One with that extended clip, not the one that I'm with
If you all made man, then you know shit real
They got change on Lil Mike, I ain't trynna see him killed
I told 'em that's my cuz, I don't wanna see nothin' happen to him
Cause when I start spittin' at 'em, I ain't rappin to 'em
Now I'm jumpin' in that water like a diver
Six shot survivors, school of hard knock scholars
These niggas ain't riders, they hiders, they cowards
I feel like 50, hold power of a dollar
I told my nigga give me one of them bullet-proof trucks
I want you dumb enough to try and shoot it up
I'm lookin' at the nigga lettin' off
Wait until you finish the clip, laugh then pulled off

It sounds like a nightmare, I graduated from fightin'
Play the projects faster than the 32 man indictment
See my baby blue Ferrari make 'em feel like the virus
In they stomach, I keep it one hundred, I make 'em vomit
I got a code name for straps, sacks in the trumpet
I get to blowin', the ears will ring for days when I dump it
My bullet wounds call 'em beauty marks
And my ho we don't talk to narcs
So the first 48 the clock tickin', the plot thickens
The charge, cocaine possession, I'm creepin' with a firearm
The D's don't even wanna see me, with a firearm
Before I go back again, I'mma let it off
They ain't got to pop first, fuck that I'mma set it off
I need a mental eval, somethin' wrong with my brainwaves
I'm rich as a motherfucker still ridin' with a AK
Picture me comin' through lettin' a nigga play me
When I got all this bread, bitch it's off with ya head, ASAP
Niggas be schemin', fiendin'

I had to be slippin' to let this clown hit me up
Now I gotta walk around with this shit bag for months
Now I don't give a fuck 'bout a bitch or a nigga
Startin' to treat my own brothers like they just another nigga
My clique got smaller and my clips got bigger
Condom on my heart, motherfuck your feelings
They call me Superman see I ain't supposed to walk
Better watch how you talk or get popped like a cork, off

See they ain't real as they seem and they schemin'
They fiendin' and dreamin', they geekin' and creepin'
They hear tires screechin', infrared beamin'
Niggas head leakin', what the fuck was he thinkin'?
Sounds of police, momma signin' new leases
You know you got to relocate her when you beefin'
I guess you're here for a real reason
Rah got hit like you got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'
Niggas be schemin', fiendin'
To cut your jooks, take off the hook

I'm off the chain, I'm all in, mane
I'll hit you up, you think I'm playing, I be strapped
Go 'head fuck around, I be strapped
24/7 I'm back holding, mistake me for a chump
Bite off more than you can chew, more beef than you want
Come through repeatedly, show you what bananas about
I'm a mechanic, find out when the hammers come out

I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down3Embed

You ain't strong enough, nigga, you sweet
You probably go against me, and weep
I oughta kiss you, you'd probably like that
But you don't stand a chance, nigga
Fucking faggot

I do more than talk that, I mu'fuckin walk that
Blue Yankee cap back, fuck around get clapped at
I sleep with the stainless, I walk with the stainless
Man, everybody know about 50, I'm famous
New York, New York, I run New York
Ask Dread at the weed spot, I come through in the mean drop
In different boroughs I have different moments
On different days niggas know how I'm on it
I'm pretty like a Harlem nigga
I'm a shooter like a Brooklyn nigga
I'm a hustler don't get no bigger
Queens, Southside 'til they bury me
BX, two TEC's, flames out the nozzles
R1 One wheel, Christian Dior goggles
Spar with me, start some shit, send the shooters out
Come out the club, we out front with the Ruger's out
Nah, ain't no sense to talking peace, my brother
That beef will probably send your monkey ass to see Allah

I had five hundred grams and fifty in 58 bags
Fo'-hundred Benz, eight thousand in cash
Then the ball dropped, gun popped, Banks got blast
I make it so hot, one shot'll melt yo' ass
Got popped up, cried 'til my eyes turned red
Then told myself in the mirror "nigga, you ain't dead"
I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it
When you see me in the hood motherfucker don't talk to me
'Less you wan' talk about using the hawk for me
When Al blew Black away I had him on some stupid shit
Then my rap shit worked, now I'm super stupid rich
All I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach
There I go fronting again, I meant to say laid back
Go 'head move reckless, get banged for your necklace
I serve him with the semi, feed him a clip for breakfast

You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when I toss my gun
You might see me let it off, you might see me run
But you won't see shit time the police come
Huh? You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when you see my gun
I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
You just bleed and bleed 'til the police come
Huh? You want some?

Getting money is necessary; see me I'm a visionary
And I'm saying that house should be a crack house

Toss my Nina in the sewer, bet nobody find it

Yeah... ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank y'all for comin' out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm

Girl when I go, where we go
I wanna take you 'round the globe with me
I got dough,  plenty baby you can blow with me
And baby I know that money ain't everything
But it's fo' sho' (fo' sho, fo' sho')
And ain't for nothin when you fuck, with, me
Now when I go

Follow my lead
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby, follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fucking crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And have to say, "baby I apologize"
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for telling lies
Like Janet Jackson said, I miss you much
I really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent
Baby, I can pass the day watching you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if it's okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha - I got a great sense of humor
First I make you smile then I woo you
You know I wanna do ya
Or do ya?

What's gon' be the next stop - I told you
I'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurting in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask your fan about me, they say 50 we love him
Without them there's no me, so I love them
Man they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
As my niggas are stressed, I pass the test
Every time I drop I'm burning hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't looking for commitment
We can fuck and be friends
Matter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz
I get it done with speed
Follow my lead
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me

Talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope
You got a smile that only a fool would forget
And a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit
There I was, kickin' my game, pickin' her brain
Buggin' cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
She wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the whip
Uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
But on the sidewalk we ain't play games
We exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' "I know that nigga, he rich"
She think I got six whips cause me and my Man switch
Anyway, her name is CeCe
She said she go to BMCC
Push a '98 328 with chrome BBS
She said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
She liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me

Probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not

And a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
Had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
Would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
Now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
While we on the 900 double R Hondas
Watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
While Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
All these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World
You can find a material Girl
I sip Dom 'till I earl
Take 'em two at a time
Quick I get in they mind
Have 'em thinkin' they mine
Bust off then tell 'em "Bust a Uey, on mo' time"
I'm like the reason ya'll niggas can't eat this year

I told him get them niggas that cash, they murdered that ass
Niggas told 'em slow down, he was movin' too fast
Heard the shot, went through his face after the glass, he crashed
Hit the three on his niggas grass, the cattle said it got low fast
The kid who had it done was a crude fella
Who woulda thought he wile out over that mozzarella
We ain't know them, but now we know better
Not to fuck with his cheddar, his man pack a beretta
He won't hesitate to squeeze that, over that green back
Believe that, now niggas know that he's back

Niggas must be mad at Banks
But there's only one problem
Niggas ain't as bad as Banks
Nigga, youse front, you gon' get shot down
We fend to pump crack at your spot now
G-Unit! Nigga, ain't nothin' change
You move, I'll blow your brains

These niggas don't really want war (nah)
They just walk around frontin' 'cause I walk around stuntin'
Why you think the long pump is in the trunk for? (Yeah)
If you really want something, we can show up at your front door
I know my history—my family tree done said "master" (Uh-huh)
And fuck livin' positive 'cause negativity spreads faster (Yeah)
A celebrity has to bulletproof his car
'Cause big-heads come flyin' through your door like Casper (Woo)
I'm smokin' out the jar (Jar) scopin' out the bar
Distracted—see shorty' breast pokin' out the bra (Uh-huh)
Not the type to go spark metal and—
Start thinkin' you gangsta 'cause you hit a parked yellow van (Yeah)
Act hard but your heart made of marshmallows, man
Talk tough until you get cuffed and start tellin'—damn
Every day, I got a new bitch, and when I'm done with her—
It'll look like she dived headfirst into Cool Whip (Goddamn)
You only gon wind up dead tryna prove shit
I put chalk around your head like a pool stick (Yeah)
I gotta have bucks on the waist
I'm hungry like a South African with flies stuck to his face (Waa)
Catch Banks in a truck full of bass (Uh-huh)
Remember, I'm a bachelor—the four or five ducks gotta space
You could either get bust or get your ass jumped
The only trigger you touch is on the gas pump
I got my own personal slave—she really got a curfew
Cook and clean for the kid like Celie in "Color Purple" (Uh-huh, uh)
I know you wanna pop me, but— (But)
If I hit you first, the exit wound gon' be the size of a hockey puck (Ah)
Fuck, I really hold the rubber
I send sparks at you, and I don't mean Omillio or Bubba
I'm aimin' for a video or cover, huge tour-buses
A pound and a Philly, hold the smuggler
G-Unit's what's up right now
The Gucci cloth is on a Newport sign upside-down
You gotta come a lil' harder—nigga, you wear jerseys?
Well, mine is a throwback, and yours is a Starter (Hahaha)
You still gotta beg a ho (Ho)
And you mad 'cause you blowin' on oregano
You niggas'll never blow
Anyone to step in my ring is brave
I don't know a thing about hairstyling, but I can make a finger weave (Err)
Short stay, leave her butt in the telly
Lace up the beef-and-broccolis, peanut butter-and-jelly
I'm about to get this deal (Uh-huh), and shorty know
Thats why she foamin' out the grill like a Alka-Seltzer pill
I ain't loud around a snitch (Nah), I don't crowd around a bitch (Nah)
The jumpsuit match with the Carolina kicks
I been sick since niggas was on Harold Miner's dick
I could call up a chick and put a child around her lips (Woo)
Niggas can't stand the fact that I'm real (He's off, nigga)
I kidnap the queen from the castle and put her back on the pill
Gimme Barbie at her best (Uh-huh), Bacardi at the chest (Uh-huh)
I'm similar to the young Marcus Garvey at the desk
Used to have to push up; now, I hardly got to press
Got two guns, and both lead to cardiac arrest (Ugh)
My success got suckers salty (Salty)
Blowin' steam like a cup of coffee

Wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my Glock?

Shit, I don' started my own gang
I don't go that funny dance
I don't throw gang signs
But I'm a gangsta to the core so I stay with a nine
Think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good
Have Smurf hangin out the sun roof to light up your hood, man

Milk your crack spot - till the shit be bone dry
You think you pump hard? Nigga I pump harder

Yo, niggas wouldn't rob Frankie if they had the chance
Wasn't cause of him—it was cause of his man Lance
Frankie cut crack (Woo), Lance hold the Mac (Yeah)
If fiends fuck with Frankie's packs, Lance cut the crackheads
He popped up, thought he was locked up
Came thru stuntin' wit his wrist all rocked up
Shoulda seen him smile, missin' the tooth
Coupe missin the roof
He like "What up, 50?" I'm like, "What up with you?"
Lance had a reputation that was well earned
Heard he taught niggas how them shells burn
Out there in Redfern
At the dice game, he rolled a headcrack in a crack
I'm like "Nah, I ain't paying for that! Nigga, shoot it back"
Niggas lookin at me like I'm crazy, they shook
I don't give a fuck who he shot out in Red Hook
Asked about Bone—yeah, Bizzy was my man
'Tilhe beat me for ten grand and sold my Mac for seven grand (Fuckin' crazy)
His man was thirsty, I could tell by his look
Cause he looked the way I look when I look for a juks, bitch

Somebody probably got shot today
I named em pop when niggas surfboard

Only time you left ya hood is on Monopoly boards
You grimey as birds shittin on the top of ya fords
You will, die by the gun if you ain't droppin ya sword
I got tattoos as well as lead marks
To me fucking is kinda like racin and I always get a head start
My opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC
Just yesterday guns is blastin with red darts
Beef, you a target
Cause when we come at yo ass, Aladdin won't be the only one the carpet
Man you wanna play wit a ringer?
I ain't a peoples person

You pay cops to hold you down, I just hold the chrome
Every breath I take, every step I take, every move I make

You ain't gotta like or love me but you gone respect me

They rather see my moms make funeral arangements
I got enough rhymes, to fill 6 notebooks
I been spittin that shit ever since coke crushed
You can hear me on your T.V. and radio at the same time
I never ever say the same rhyme, it's Tony 2 times
Beware of my wraith, I'm gone school you niggas

And come through in a Lex with Claudette Ortiz
With no roof on the top, that's my Sunday car
In the Hummer lookin' hot, that's my Monday car
I got a stable of hoes, now I'm a P-I-M-P
And saw your bitches on a Amtrak with grams of D
We got beams on the gat, we detail our weapons
And the way that I rap, we e-mail assessors
Niggas hear what I spit and wonder how I write it
G-Unit gon' win, we on automatic pilot

You lying your ass off; you know you ain't that tough

You know what I came for, a peace of the game or
Artillery that's 'bout as long as a chainsaw
I'm wide awake, but it still feels like I'm dreamin
40 cal' under my pillow condom feeling my semen
The physical presence of a female's the form of a demon
That's why I, fuck 'em and leave 'em get my nut while I'm breathin (YEAH~!)
Never thought they'd catch me slippin now I'm duckin and drippin
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you grippin
You trippin, no record can get my ass in position
Death waits for no religon whether catholic or christian
Listen; I went through momma bitchin in and out the kitchen
With probable cause as poppa was in and out the prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect the odds

Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
You can put me in the door panels or your stash box
Put me in your Nikes, Timbs and Reeboks

Hold up

The hood talkin man, e'rybody know~! (I know, it's fucked up)
Now I lay thee down to sleep
Niggas try and lay me down wit heat
And if I should die though before I awake
I pray my Lord my soul to take

If dead men could talk in your sleep your homey told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him? (Huh?)
Or would you start switchin up
You thinkin 'bout the penitentiary and bitchin up?
What if he said money ain't everything, the hood raised us wrong
All jux'll get your money long but look here I'm gone
Would that touch your heart? Have you feelin funny inside?
Would that be enough to make your punk-ass ride?
What if he gave you a little list of things to do?
Said he wouldn't have to die, he could live through you
Would you load the gats, and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at yo' crib and hide?
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain
Hit him cause he was your strength, now you in a daze
Your homey turnin over in his grave... cause you PUSSY!

She that Uptown Girl with the cocky persona
Went out her way to let her know that I want her
I told her I - know fo' sho' we belong together
And I wouldn't break her heart, my intentions are better
And I, shared the same dreams she had about cheddar
When the D's came she was down to hold the Beretta
I got a thing for babygirls, me and her against the world

We used to think the same schemes, with the same dreams in mind
10'll bring you back 20 if the crook is on time
And she knows daddy loves to eat
Take a seat and let my baby rub my feet
She was a clear thinker, with a plan to rule the world
But understandin her place is my girl
Talk about hardcore, to win she'd give her life
Or shoot to kill, to protect this life

The world will hear, what's really goin on, in my life - my life

Consistantly missin her touch when she gone, uhh
She smell like Chanel, she feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail
I've been around been up and down my attitude is fuckin ass
She a rider, I'm in heaven when I'm inside her

Swift enough to snatch the Mac and pop that at you

50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and gone niggas gon' remember my name, 50

Black is flashy like Alpo, gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka 'mind me of nigga that clapped me
He ain't the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you tryna get your ass laid out in Gilmore
He had some soldiers, 'mind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like "What up comrade?"
Grimy niggas, they loved to get gully
Summertime, still had on black gloves and skullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggas from Philly woulda called him an old head
But he a OG, 'mind me of Chaz and Bump, real low key
Sounded like they don't know nothin about drama
His money sent many men through trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled down on his S-Class
Heard in DC, he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this, a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit, he got knocked
He on lock still controllin the spot from Comstock
Pop pulled up in the CL5, surprised he came
His man just got fucking murked by some lame
Heard he got it in the Range nigga Caine popped one
On his brain over some-thang, took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there in Richmond mayne
In the black 740 I sat, my hat turned back
"Down down baby," Nelly singin my wrist blingin what?
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise, three loaves for two pies
Son he smokin that shit, I can see it in his eyes
Comin up Wise and locs is close
And locs ride 'round lookin for wires to toast
Benny hopped out the Escalade with a few thorough men
From B-More, they sellin heroin in Maryland
His first batch of diesel, he killed like 4 fiends
His popularity grew, that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother, now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to livin the dream
Seen he pulled up, goddamn, you know his format
Bentley Azure, marble in the door, mink floor mats
Hit the hazards, out the stash box popped two Glocks
Theme song: "All Eyez on Me," 2Pac
Everybody know he a boss he still gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Ty in the blue GS, stuntin like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max, Haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peeped his style son I know his steelo, he on the d-low
He smile at niggas mumblin fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggas tried to merk him, most them got found
Some turned away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out, bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a black Hummer, he blew 90 on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that, let's go

New York City
You are now rockin' with 50 Cent!
Are you ready?!
**Gun clicks**
I said are you ready?!
C, you wit me nigga? Drop that!
Paper for a hooptie, but I wanted a drop

G-Unit!
Sumthin' new
I'm not that nigga in your video
I'm not a trick, I don't love the hoes
And niggas know I be on the low
When I gets my dough and I twist my dro
I'm not that nigga that you think you know
I walk around with a big fo-fo
You front on me I'm gon' get at you dawg
I be right at your crib waiting at your door
(What up 50!)

Coming up I ain't have much, I wanted a lot
I had paper for a hooptie, but I wanted a drop
So you know I had to make something out of nothing
Like turn an empty spot into a crack spot pumping
Hustled hard, at nineteen I bought a Benz, I did
The older niggas really wasn't feeling the kid
Trying to find where I live so they could run in my crib
But you can't hustle a hustler, I peeped it and slid
Back then niggas used to call me Boo
In six months I sold a million gold tops on Guy Brewer
Country came around, he's into clapping and
Country left, same shit started happening
Like, "He shot Rob for some ends, Rob shot Joe over some skins
Cory shot you and we was friends, money turned boys into men"
The cycle never changes, shit just starts again
You might also like
Naw, nigga, ain't nothing changed, nigga
Yeah, I've been gone for a minute, but I'm back

(Damn 50, good to see you back in the hood)
You see my cherry red SL, nigga -- I'm doing good
Sometimes I can't find the words to say how I feel
So I take a quote from Menace -- "look at the wheels"
I'm addicted to stunting now that I'm holding something
I got a trunk full of guns from VA today
(Oh, nigga, let me hold something?)
Nigga you high or something?
I don't play games, I'm bout my money, nigga -- buy something
I got a few 5ths, I got a few 9's
Here nigga take one, catch a jux and bring me mine

Yeah, don't ever say I don't do nothing for you, nigga
You know, don't say I didn't look out for you, knowhatImean?
But make sure, nigga, that you go catch some jux
When you come back you gonna have my paper for that thang thang, knowhatI'msayin?
I don't want it back nigga, don't try to use it then give it back to me
Cause I could see y'all niggas now running around saying
"50 getting all this rap money and he won't help us"
Sit tight, nigga, I'm coming, you know? New shit
All the shit I put out on the mixtapes is for the mixtapes
I got a million
Oh my God -- my shit is so hot right now; I'm in the zone3Embed
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (When it's on that's who you get, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (That's your motherfucking clique, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (You a motherfucking snitch, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD

Niggas wanna shine like me (Me), rhyme like me (Me)
They don't walk around with a .9 like me (Me)
They don't want to do it three-to-nine like me
And ain't strong enough to take nine like me
Ayo, you think about shittin' on 50, save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David's
I teach niggas sign language that ain't deaf, son
(*Click-clack*) You heard that? That mean run
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa
Pull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at your car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face
It's nothing, I can go after Ma$e fan base
A shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doc to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth, I (Huck-too) spit it out
I don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city
Hoes be like "50, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P. Diddy
You got fat while we starved, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn, won't learn

Mama said everything that happened to us was part of God's plan
So at night, when I talk to him, I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy 'cause I don't fear man
'Cause I fear when I kill a man God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?
I been could've killed these niggas, I'm still waitin'
In the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors
Thirty-two karats in the cross, no flaws (Woo)
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock, Tony carry my M-1
Hold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me (Uh-huh)
Ds waiting for my response to lock me (Yeah)
This is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me, I'm the one

See, I done been to the pearly gates, they sent me back
Good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stay in some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me? You wanna know me?
From three-point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my co-D
See a bitch gettin' in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it's special, y'all
A country boy tell ya I'm finna blow
I'm more like a pimp than a trick, you know
You see, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worryin' about mines
Grown-ass men wearing starter kit shines
You know them little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phone
When the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won't you stop it?
Shorty, I've been watching you watching me
Now you tell me what you like more, my watch or me? Haha

But I don't like none of ya'll niggas, you know what I'm saying?
50 cent, 9-9, motherfucking Doo Wop
Volume 3, take it however the fuck you wanna take it
Faggot ass niggas (50 Cent show these niggas how to rock)

Yo, they shot that boy down like a dog in the street
Left him smelly, man fuck that, roll 'em over, take that Pelle Pelle
You ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
Not even Puff and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm saying this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son, I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rapping niggas dying to shine
And I'm tired of fiends asking for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punchline from me may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down before I make change
Yo, the sale went stale, caught 'em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man indictment, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an O.Z
My man brought 'em to me, see he ain't really know, B
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just trying to prop to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him O.Z.'s then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-d's -- damn man, I O.D
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holding the heat
Po-po walking to beat, we burning L's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over, I can't believe it, damn it's over
Feds seized the Six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rolling in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
.380 six-shot Glock top loader
Keep it in my waist, son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga, so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long
But it feel like a motherfucking marathon

Hats off, to da rich ones who flash and floss
Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist
Only wishin' we could bring them back with songs like dis
Old flicks on us chillin' wit da old time clique
Holdin' nines, thoughts of death, not our lives we risk
How it use to be, early morn, pumpin' in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me, they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin' us
The D's in the marked vans and cabs
In our land, hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin' out young lady's and make them make thotties
Got them coked out, the hood is bugged out
Thug babies, famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
It's in the air of New York
So everybody'll pick em up, kissin em up
Treatin' them like they own, in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out

You pay cops to hold you down, I just hold the chrome
Every breath I take, every step I take, every move I make
I got a ruger on my hip
You ain't gotta like or love me but you gone respect me
You need a fifth and 2 clips to try and check me

I donate my heart to them niggas that ran
And, those niggas in the hood don't wanna see me famous
They rather see my moms make funeral arangements
I got enough rhymes, to fill 6 notebooks
I been spittin that shit ever since coke crushed
You can hear me on your T.V. and radio at the same time
I never ever say the same rhyme, it's Tony 2 times

La la la… Yeah!
La la la la la la la la… Uh huh
Ooh I’d lie for you baby
Ooh I’d die for you baby
I like the way that feel

I’ll build you, but if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me, you’ll be around
Hold me down, I’ll build you up

Listen, if you let me, I’ll be the reason you shine
It’s the secret, I want the world to know that you’re mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I’m writing this song instead of a love letter
They gon’ play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you gon’ stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you, and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where I’m from, you know how I get down
When times get tough, tell me that I’m special
Not rap, I mean me, that I’m special
You know they say diamonds are a girl’s best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them?
If so, I’ll see to it they always around
Nothing but the best, now how does that sound?
If I drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time, that’s a secret

Girl, I need to know for sure you’re mine

Or is it just my imagination that get runnin’ away?
If you ready to ride, girl, c’mon, let’s roll
G-5-5 fly, ma, let’s go
It’s hard to measure the pleasure of havin’ you in my presence
Your smile makes me smile, I’ll show you my style
You can shop a little bit, I’ll pick out some shit
One pair at a time ’til your shoe game sick
Now who knows what the future holds we’ll be together probably
For better or worse, like Whitney and Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait, why pretend when you can move in?
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl, it’s more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
Cause I know with you by my side there’s nothing I can’t do, yeah
Baby…
Girl, if I know for sure I have you by my side
I’d build you up
Girl, I need to know for sure you’re mine
Build you up, baby, when you’re down
Girl, if I know for sure I have you by my side
Cuz your smile, like a frown, yes I will
I’d build you up

Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a Hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19.5 a ki
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

The projects too hot
Niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw
(Repeat)

I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Uncured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga

What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Dough stacks
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike
50 Cent with Braveheart-ed, we ride to the grave depart us
You fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go

Sirens flashin' you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin', cross full of diamonds he bought grindin'
His foot slip off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, askin' niggas if they know what happened
Somehow my name end up in anythin' that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a lineup last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, little crack
Figure, I'll push it to the limit, take the shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm's fully loaded firearm
First to let off last to run, every time it's on

I tell niggas to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face
'Cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're, never around, when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'

Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move, or get caught in the crossfire

This shit's crazy, it's just a different day it's the same shit
Hollow-tip partin' yo' head, leave your whole fuckin' brain split
They sick, they see me in that Aston Martin
What's the matter? They can't get that hooptie started
Thought they was grindin', well God damn, where that money at?

Better watch how you talk, better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York, that's how we get down
22's on the jeep, some deep in the seat
When we creep with the heat, that's how we get down

Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the spree
Get caught slipping, then get hit with like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feeling
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villain
I play the bar with eight bottles all night getting right
Teaching the hoodrats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on my wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga scheming, what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hoes confused
On the track ready to choose, like "Daddy, we want you"
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me

You should hear they be saying man "50 be flipping"
"Shot my man over seven grams, that nigga be tripping"
I know death is promised, I don't fear getting murked
It's when a nigga half-way kill ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with the pump
You can have it how you want, but I know you like my style
Uh-huh, you like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how

You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin' through life chasin' my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin' the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell

Ain't no money selling dope? (We gon' sell X)
And if niggas won't buy the X? (Then we gon' sell tech's)

My advice for y'all niggas is stop frontin'
'Cause if 50 say "Pop something," I'm gon pop something, what up?

Don't make me send a nigga to you, 16 shot ruger

Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In the race for the cheese, I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker went in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell
The East Coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists write about me leave me confused
Have me feeling like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere I'm homophobic, shit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now, we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth
TNT around, I can still make blow move

Being broke is against my religion, now I'm caked up, what!

Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice

Bottles of DP, I do it real B-I-G
Bitches break their neck to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstasy, without ecstasy
I'm a chef you need the hit I got the recipe
Doc got the antidote, it's in the drums and the notes
Can you feel it? Em said for me to make you feel it
And remind you that you rockin' with the realest

I do my thang, in the club

A little dose of it, now I want some more
Nobody put that thang on me like that before

Ah-ha man! Ayy you know where them niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em

All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like this shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin' (Uh-huh), straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight

This is not new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old MAC, new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue-kissin' my TEC
Go on, come, test me, pussy boy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' with son
'Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, "Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall," I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit
There's 81 one karat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
Yeah!

Unh, yeah..I like the way this feel right here
Yo...turn me up in the head phones just a lil' bit

There ain't shit in this world deeper than loyalty and love
Except loyalty and love between thugs
For you I pull up in the whip and spray the whole strip
For you, I walk up close and lay a nigga's kid
For you, there ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'm a Thug, this the way I show my love for you
Nigga for you, I get the coke, I'ma turn it into cash
For you, if we go broke, we gon' rob a nigga ass
For you, if we get knocked, I'ma have to take the weight
Cause with a record like yours, doawg, you ain't staying upstate
Nigga for you, I kill a whole goddamn crew (Why?)
Cause I know you'd do the same thing too
I ride for you, you ride for me, my enemies your enemies
How could you not love a thug like me?

Would you ride for me?
You ain't even got to ask
Would you die for me?
Nigga, they blast you, they blast me
Would you cry for me?
Shit, when I die don't cry for me
Just keep repping Southside for me

You can catch me in public housing with bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains bundled up to ski
Since time is money I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You see the ice, you know it's top notch
And when it comes to dice I'm seeing shorty to the shot box
Banks stop, guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind I wear the same shit tomorrow
When you grind it's Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hot sixteen
Well, my flow's like a hoe that's sixteen
I ran through niggas, dismantled niggas
They mad 'cause they see me in Cancun, bitches
But I'm ghetto, straight from the hood, my nigga
If there's no toothbrush I'ma use my finger
I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still living like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice I'm called Jack Frost, man
And while we sipping on Cris' you sipping backwash, man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat - what?1Embed

I gave you your style, Gucci this, Fendi that
Burberry bag, shoes and the hat to match

Now you can reminisce on the times I treated you good

She roll with them G Unit niggas, that's what's up
Disrespect me, I'll have niggas blast ya up
Take my advice, don't let ya peoples grass ya up

20's for the six
Hollows for the clips
Try me, if you think I'm playing bitch
And the police we'll have another crime scene taker
Jim Star crush your head, give your ass a shape-up
Uptown niggas known for the money they make
Everybody ain't shook, you see doing the shake

Or catch me on the dancefloor feeling some tits
Sex sells, so I'mma P-I-M-P

If I don’t get it on this time, I’ll get it on the next flip
Ball blowing them bottles and creep off with the next bitch

Fuck up a hater or two, or send a nigga at you
Gem star will scratch you, you're not on my stature, you’re just a rapper
In fact, you’re a regular rapper
Say the wrong line and I’ll get your ass wrapped up
Bass line bumping, whole spot dumping
Like go on to my niggas, get the mossberg pumping

Ayo Fif, I was thinking
You should go back to doing the shit you used to do

Murder them, murder them, if I let them demonstrate I murder them
Niggas be fronting, word up it's stunting til they heard up
Their semi talk, I let that buck, I had these niggas running hard
I pull a nigga skirt up, and have him kicking dirt up
I get a nigga hit a nigga, back up stupid hard
Silence, it's the return of the tyrants
Seein' through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand close to the homie you wanna die with
Flames come out the muzzle on the shit that I spit
I'm talking like the feds ain't listening
Nigga this a pool of piranhas you fishing in
I get it nigga if you want it
Better ask niggas out me I be on it
I get the drop, blow at your knot, perfect planning
Hit your back with something hot, out the cannon

Why would you pick up the phone when I call to talk to me?

You know you won’t play with a nigga
I fly out to spend the day with a nigga
First flight, first seat and first class
First pair of Giuseppes, first Birkin bag
I’m Street King, so you’ll be fit for a king
When we step out on the scene it’s Alexander McQueen
It’s a ghetto fairy tale, I’ll be your night in shining armor
And retro Jordan’s, Giselle’s and a leather bomber
Bright lights, city life, I’ll show around New York a bit
From hot dogs and pretzels to the expensive shit
Cause we can shop till my nickname Saks Fifth
Madison Ave mindframe, baby I stack chips smile
Me cell phone’ll capture the moment
When your emotions start to shift
I’ma just shoot that over your brown eyes
To chocolate thighs
Make me wanna sing good lord
Is this Adam and Eve happening again?

We could get all day, all night, twisted up, get right
Let me know if you’re with it
That kush in my hood so good, roll it up, back wood
Can’t wait to let you hit it
Now you’re in my world
Now you’re in my world!

Give me brain like I ain't got no sense
I got change, dollars and lil' cents
I got rich, they ain't seen me since
Now it's all startin to make sense
I pull up in that brand new Benz
All of a sudden I’ve got brand new friends
Brand new chopper, bitch go blocka
BRRRRRT, like I just broke wind
(I roll the shit, I smoke the shit)
I forgot she was in my bed
(I roll the shit - I smoke the shit)
Damn! I blew through all my bread
That Lambo ain't got no top
Man, I'm hotter than a stove top
Rider Gang, we on top
And we havin a smoke-out
Eyes low but I'm so high
Don't ask me, I don't know why
I'll roll the shit and I'll smoke the shit
If I don't pass the shit don't ask for shit, HUH!
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit

(Ain’t not a nigga brother come tell me nothin’)

(I’ll make your bitch come smoke with me)
I roll the shit, I roll the shit

Bitch you wanna roll?
Nigga, you must be crazy
I roll the shit, I smoke the shit

While rubbing elbows in the hills of high society
I look back on my life and realized the hood lied to me
Built the bullshit sense of pride inside of me
On a rise to fly car hating on varieties

Look, I don’t need no bitch niggas surrounding me
Get caught, you better stick to the codes that you provided, b
If you don't plead the 5th you get your whole shit split
So called kingpins get real money to snitch

I know it sound hard to believe this bullshit
But sometimes you need money to see who you cool with
See niggas hustle hard and cop them a few whips
They end up popping niggas they used to be cool with

I’m a street entrepreneur, condo, connoisseur
Furs, suede, my car’s the core
Nigga I been a boss I employed my boys
And show em a bunch of shit they never seen before

I got a business mind
That block is mine, that brick and them Glocks is mine
I got a business mind
That drop is mine, these knots and this watch is mine
I got a business mind
You can’t stop my shine
A nigga got a World Guiness book grind
I got a business mind
And I pop my 9, fuck around find out in time

I got a short fuse so if by some chance I get annoyed
The button gets pressed and your life gets destroyed
Got niggas that'll do the shit just cause they bored
Man I ain’t even gotta tell niggas what for

You think you cool but I swat your type of fly
Yeah you crossed your T's but you forgot your I's
That’s why I out-charisma ya, I could out-business ya
Intimidate ya with success, I catch the interest of

Corporate America gangstas we got em tearing up
We only want the money, no reason to be scared of us
We feel the life that we live is unfair to us
America’s an oven, you got to break bread for us

Go hard or die soft is what was said to us
So if it’s gunplay you gon get shot instead of us
Crackers be thinking they one step ahead of us
I say shit like that to let em know that I’m aware of it

We keep accountants to count, I got lawyers to share, kid
Babes to clean up my mess, go make the bed bitch
They said death or jail is what’s ahead of us
So when they ask me what I thought, all I could say is I'm a
Street entrepreneur, condo, connoisseur
Fur or suede, my car’s the core
Nigga I’ve been a boss I employed my boys
Matter fact, I don't even wanna chat no more

Won money when I bet on Floyd, I'm the one that bet on boy
Undefeated, eyes low like I'm weeded
I bet you niggas think I won't bе number one again
I raise thе stakes, you know why I put mo' on the line
It's showtime I'm goin' for my mine, you can bet that
I bet that tech jam before that mac
I bet that dope go before that crack, I bet my money stack
I bet yo bitch wanna roll with 50
I bet if I said I'm going to the hotel she'd go with me
I bet you really love her man you think she wouldn't come
She got your pussy wooped, her head game, it got you sprung
I'm taking all bets, through all sets I be a bookie
That have to be ten percent off the top, fucking rookies

Battery acid, I burn your face off properly
Guns ammo, knife Rambo

I had a five hundred bags, 14 grams of powder
On the phone with my connect, this shit last about an hour
I need work, I repeat, I need work
My niggas go bizzurk, when the drought come get murked'
When no money coming in is when the guns come out
Why the d's wanna sit in front of my momma house
You know it's sort of like some shit you seen in a flick
Black nine extended clip as long as my dick
They say I'm grimmey, yeah fuck it I line niggas
I show them where your shit at before they take mine nigga (Hahaha)
Don't take it personal, it's just how I grind nigga
Figure, this is a dog-eat-dog world, man
Ebony enemy today I'm tryin' to duck, I got that hover
I heard it'll make you kill a motherfucker (don't stop girl)
I mean you gotta feel it man
She bob and weave up and down you'd be like “I could just kill a man”
I don't fuck with them niggas from her projects
They're on section eight but niggas cars are straight
They ain't out in the day time them niggas roaches
I don't stop down there if I ain't got the toaster
I'm in the six four five hard top, not the drop
Leanin', I see them niggas schemin', dream on
Touch me, shit I wish a nigga would

That crack money handsome, your bitch blowin' me kisses
You need to check her if you think she could be the misses, damn

I hold my own strap, they ain't gotta hold that for me
And slide by my baby momma crib with the mac on me
Man since her cousin in a car crash died
She said ‘don't drink and drive', I say ‘just drink, don't drive'
I had a morphine dream, I got heroine ambitions
That's big money cooking in that coffee pot in the kitchen
When I say I'm straight, I mean I'm straight
Once the razor hit the plate I double up the cake (hey)
