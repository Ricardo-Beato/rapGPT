18 ContributorsAll I Want Is You Lyrics
Girl, I don't wanna share you
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you
Girl, I don't wanna share you (Share you)
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you (Leave you)
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by (Haha)
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you

Uh, look
They told me never fall in love, it never works out in your favor
You way too young and right now that's just human nature
You think you love her, but you don't
Think you gon' be with her for the rest of your life, you prolly won't
But on my side, shorty just attacked me from the blindside
Used to be a player now I'm sidelined
Connect like Wi-fi, mixed like tie-dye
She feelin' cute wanna wear a little lingerie, voila
It ain't a sexual thing though
We be stayin' up smokin' weed out her window
In love with me now, she never huntin' me down
I'm tryna have it all, she ain't comin' around
It's like a never-endin' chase, longer than a marathon
See the smile on her face, and I can't help but carry on
Uh, I know you love me don't lie (Don't lie)
Uh, but you just gotta be mine, 'cause
You might also like
Girl, I don't wanna share you (Share you)
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you (Leave you)
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by (Hey)
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you

Hey, hey, haha, look
I know this girl who want the world to call her own
Goin' through these dudes like some minutes on a phone
And once she leave, she ain't comin' back home
Hit the road, forgettin' about everybody she know
Miss Hasn't Called Me In Four Days
But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay
Hey, she try and be a lil' player, think she cute too
But I'ma yank her out the game like a loose tooth
When the boy blow, I know she worried (Know she worried)
About all these girls who approach me actin' flirty (Actin' flirty)
See that's the thing-thing, I don't give a fuck
I want your heart so baby give it up
In this life, girl, all we can do is try
Forget that dumb stuff, it's just you and I
We can travel 'round the world, movin' through the sky
Or we can stay right here and you'll be mine
Girl, I don't wanna share you (Share you)
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you (Leave you)
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by (Hey)
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you11Embed
