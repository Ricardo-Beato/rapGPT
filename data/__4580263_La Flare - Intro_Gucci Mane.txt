4 ContributorsLa Flare - Intro Lyrics
2002 baby
The beginning
Straight Drop Records
Mack ? this bitch
My nigga Gucci Mane
And this is how we are doing it
Straight Drop in this shit

A Rolex watch and a yacht
Nigga I don´t got
But with the rocks and Glocks
I bet you I close shop
I'm in strip spots with knots
Where Moet bottles get popped
I put Straight Drop on top
So niggas giving me props
Back to my block with yay
They getting moved every day
They call me Gucci Mane my nigga
But my kin call me Ray
But what you bitch niggas say
It can´t make me or break me
I´m shooting dice every day
Five-deuce and four-trey
Babies four ways
Izzos, ninos and kilos
The yayo in fat boy pillows tripple zeros
I´m getting to the money
Don´t be no dummy don´t be no fool
Paint change every season
Or else I gotta cop something new
Step up your game another notch
I went from rocks to blocks
And now we stampin SD’s on block
We rockin' straight drop chains
With the diamonds and bezels
You can´t fuck with Gucci Mane
I´m on a whole ´nother levelYou might also likeEmbed
