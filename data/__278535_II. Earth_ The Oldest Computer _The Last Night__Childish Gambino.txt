147 ContributorsII. Earth: The Oldest Computer (The Last Night) Lyrics
See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night

When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day and call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me (Woo)
That "A" on my chest like adultery (Yeah)
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up (Yeah)
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore
Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, never mind
It was time, number nine
L-L-Lies, feline with a death wish
Eatin' right, didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we were destined

See now I don't wanna see an era (No) An era (No) an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night (You and me)
Maybe it’s the last night (Fireworks)
Maybe it’s the last night (Oh, oh, all the stars)
Maybe it’s the last night (Supermoon)
Maybe it's the last night
You might also like
All that I have
All I don't have's the future
Take on my soul
All night

Yeah, break free from all of the insides
The godless denied us
But we don't give a damn 'bout the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the truth, then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long
Live and die by the line, "Never know fear"
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? 'Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress only thing that'll last (Last, last)
3005, the year that we fear only God will survive
To be alone is alive

See now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
See now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
She got that body, oh me, oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
She got that body, oh me, oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
GPOY, GPOY
GPOY, GPOY
GPOY, GPOY
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY

So fly
Girl, you know you're so fly, so fly
Girl, I know I miss you
Girl, you know that I miss you
So fly
Girl, you know you're so fly, so fly
Girl, I know I miss you (I do)
Girl, you know that I miss you (I do, ooh)
You're so fly
Girl, you know you're so fly, so fly (I do, I do)
Girl, I know I miss you (Ah, I do)
Girl, you know that I miss you (I do, I do)
You're so fly
Girl, you know you're so fly, so fly (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, I know I miss you (Ooh)
Girl, you know that I miss you (Ooh, oh)
