60 ContributorsStronger Lyrics
And they say

Opium to the ceiling
All for the love of plugs, squealing "ugh", healing
No more Timberland turf, you're too soft for this
Award-winning awkwardness you walking off into the office with
In the rims with friends' ends like state trials and Paypals
In nondescript homes in Arizona
In sub-divided neighborhoods, with floors made of solid wood
In roofs of clay tiles sits a couple million dollars
Sin I tried but the old me blew it
Exactly how you knew I'd do it
All my brothers, I would love to paint 'em Jewish
Reinfiltrate the movement and assassinate the music
Exaggerate the ass and face then masturbate to it
The constituency brilliant, but the candidates are stupid
I'm too rude to ask for nudes
But way too ruthless not to pursue it

Maybe, maybe you'll feel me when I
(Maybe you can feel me when I)
Feel me when I say (feel me when I say)
Whatever don't kill me (if it don't kill me, don't kill me)
Gets me through the day
You might also like
Chorus to the horses made her body porous
Absorbing up the pork made 'em enormous
Fear of rape made 'em informant
Fully 'shroomed in the motel room waging the torment
Never trust a dope fiend with your hopes and dreams
Let 'em play in museums with the dead bodies and broken things
What happens when the sugar barons meet the coca kings
And they beam it into space
She seem to be in place at the parent teacher conference
With hallucinations screaming in her face
The cleaning lady crazy, she say she got a demon in the safe
But it's eating through the back and soon be leaving through the gates
The hollerer shouts, "Who's bright enough to pay a toddler
To watch a ghoulish Oxycontin gobbler on Hanukkah?"
Maybe a Phoenix-based multi-million dollar launderer
Who fucked the cartels so bad, she attends court on the monitor

Maybe, maybe you'll feel me when I
(Maybe you can feel me when I)
Feel me when I say (feel me when I say)
Whatever don't kill me (if it don't kill me, don't kill me)
Gets me through the day

Bad trippin' through the tenderloin
Slimmer than a slot to enter coins to let a nigga join
A figure skater like Michelle Kwan
Aluminum illuminated to a hail bomb, ice
Then hold onto it like the L. Ron device
Then pass the audition
To the poor hands sided in maelstrom's position
Street sales in comparison pale to the Scottsdale bail bonds commission
It's like trappin' out the pawn shop
Gettin' close to the magic like the wrappin' on the wand box
Third layer from the wave
And grant absurd last prayers and first favors from the grave
To crack the pipes like icy nights and turn mayors into slaves
Politics bring fevers to punish dealers
Adjudicate the Jostens and stop the ring leaders
The Geese Howards and King Ghidorahs
Cook E in the family tree of esteemed Keeblers
Maybe, maybe you'll feel me when I
(Maybe you can feel me when I)
Feel me when I say (feel me when I say)
Whatever don't kill me (if it don't kill me, don't kill me)
Gets me through the dayEmbed
