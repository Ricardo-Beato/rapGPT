Diamonds in my chain make it dumber
Diamonds in these rings make it dumber
Money in my Balmain jeans make it dumber
Bitch I'm swerving in that Range bitch my steering Dumber

Diamonds in my chain make it dumber
Diamonds in my rings make it dumber
Money in these Balmain jeans make it dumber
Nigga swerving in that Range, Dumber

Girl gave me brain now that bitch dumber
I will never save her I won't call her number
And I'm in MIA for the fuckin'  summer
Lookin' at these pics tryna get with Summer
Money coming fast yeah I make it double
I'm the Birdman like my name was Stunna
Mrs. Officer always tryna cuff us
She gone need life alert when a nigga fuckin
Got like 4 chains and like 4 rings
Forgiato rims in that new Range (Skrt skrt)
Got like 4 chains with like 4 rings
Forgiato rims in that new Range
Money like a nigga all of a sudden now
Tell'em body shootin he go bluffin' now

Oh back then they was frontin' now
