154 ContributorsII. Shadows Lyrics
Uh-oh
Oh, no, no, no, no (She said)
No, no, no, no
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more, oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Yeah, no, no, no

Face down in the brown grass
Shame, shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do?
What you gon' do? Like, "I can't remember"
Shots fired, rewind, please, girl, be mine
Email denied, talk to me, baby
Before I go crazy, might do it, maybe
We were so Jay Z, Beyoncé
My aunt say, "Keep the sex game picante"
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds, man, I can't tell her
The fear that I feel, man, it might kill her
Man, it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killer
With the drums and the groove, so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half-ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
But we ain't speaking though
We ain't speaking, we ain't speaking though
You might also like
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you (She said, she said, she said)
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you (She said, she said, she said)
Love me better, kiss me back
Listen more, oh (She said, she said, she said)
Love me better, kiss me back, listen–

The attitude
The attitude
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
We were never friends
And I hope you understand now
But I miss them
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
Oh, no, no, no
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand

(I hope you understand) I hope you understand
'Cause everywhere I go
Everything I see
I just hope you understand
