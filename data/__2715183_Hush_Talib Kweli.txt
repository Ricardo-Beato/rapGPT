Action and words dripping off the tongue
Something like the flash of a 
The glass half empty, let me pour you some
The glass half full cause there's more to come
Jammin' on the 1, ja-jammin' on the 1
Take a deep breath now expand your longues
The breath is the life and it just begun
I thank God for the morning, so, now look here girl
Where you goin'? Come here girl, let me holla holla holla at ya
Yeah, and thrown a couple dollars at you, c'mon
I get paid baby doll I'm a star
You can tell by the make and the model of my car
That's the game these young niggas kicking
Dumb niggas tricking but some niggas listen, look
All that whack shit they spillin' in yo' ear
I don't need none of that, you just feel it in the air

Hush - Cause you're sounding like a lullaby
You're making me tired, so
Hush - Ya' damn game is so weak
It's putting me to sleep, please
Hush - Haven't we heard it all before?
Damn from all of y'all, so
Hush - A motherfucker can only take so much
I wish that you'd just hush
You might also like
They say it's all about your market and the best way
To reach the audience is to target and to profit from
You know I'm used to reach a higher form of consciousness
That still inspire dancers that's working for $20 tips
Rappers ain't pimps bruh, they acting like chimps
Nah, King Kong ain't got shit on me like Denzel Washington
A marijuana cocktail is the drawl mixed with the chocolate
Bubbling like bong hits from white kids at college and
You about to knowledge the strength of street knowledge kid
The fact is  spit for everything I gotta get
You ain't gonna like it if you got problems well honest shit
I don't like to break my promises so I don't fuck with politics
The classes  cause I ain't had no scholarship
Now I come to speak, they give me honorary doctorates
Could it possibly be that I got a degree at rocking this?
Stop it all, born and prosper like Dr. Spock with it

Hush - Cause you're sounding like a lullaby
You're making me tired, so
Hush - Ya' damn game is so weak
It's putting me to sleep, please
Hush - Haven't we heard it all before?
Damn from all of y'all, so
Hush - A motherfucker can only take so much
I wish that you'd just hush
Corporate thugs selling whores and drugs
All up in the clubs get to fall in love
Addicted to the life, high off the buzz
Here now there ain't no ignorin' us
Rawkus, you feel it in the  and 
 pass the  like pass the 
Touching it with words cause a master did
And plus, I ain't on the grabbing shit, it's like this, word
In this life every 'll find the right type
In the mix like Jack and Coke with limelight
Funny how we do wrong things to get the mind right
Vision blurry now but it's 20/20 in hindsight
I don't make the singalong shit, get the rhymes right
I'm nice, I'm sharper than any barber that get the line right
It's in the bag and I'm tagging em, getting markers
It's the shit starter on the hit artists like Chris Parker nigga

Hush - Cause you're sounding like a lullaby
You're making me tired, so
Hush - Ya' damn game is so weak
It's putting me to sleep, please
Hush - Haven't we heard it all before?
Damn from all of y'all, so
Hush - A motherfucker can only take so much
I wish that you'd just hush1Embed
