7 ContributorsStimulus Check Lyrics
The things that keeps a smile on a face
Save the pain that made you feel better every day
That boy Cassius

Evil in the air, I can feel it
This prophecy cookin' in my head like a skillet
Streets saying talk to 'em, hope them niggas listen
Just 'cause you iced out your cross, nah, that don't make you a Christian
The lord be talkin' through me, but that don't make me a prophet
Mind them folks done cut the lights off, the fuck we need a socket
They tryna get a nigga vote, nigga 'bout to sell dope
Another twelve months of quarantine, nigga goin' broke
Can't even lie to ya, I don't fuck with government
They be thinkin' shit sweet, I don't fuck with double mint
Y'all ain't got no evidence, why you at my residence?
Blessings on blessings y'all, plus my lawyer's Heaven sent
Be a quiet nigga, don't get upset
Wait on your stimulus check

One time baby, for your mind baby
Help is coming though, I think they lying baby
Seen it on the news, niggas dyin' baby
They ain't hiring tho, heard they firin' baby
One time baby, for your mind baby
I just seen the mailman, that's a sign baby
I just left the bank, it's a line baby
Don't know the whole truth, we in the blind baby

Elon Musk said we 'bout to be flying
White boys on CNN said we 'bout to be dyin'
Run and get shot, it's like an everyday thing
I'ma need a vice pres', where the fuck is Shaun King
Dear Mr. President, let's talk about the future
Donny still sleep, y'all should buy his ass a rooster
I'm on my Bernie Sanders with a lil' Killer Mike
Know some niggas still in it, Eastside, Jody Ike
Can't even lie to ya, I don't fuck with government
They be thinkin' shit sweet, I don't fuck with double mint
You ain't want it from the get, what the fuck did you expect?
Close your eyes nigga, don't get upset
Here go your stimulus check

One time baby, for your mind baby
Help is coming though, I think they lying baby
Seen it on the news, niggas dyin' baby
They ain't hiring tho, heard they firin' baby
One time baby, for your mind baby
I just seen the mailman, that's a sign baby
I just left the bank, it's a line baby
Don't know the whole truth, we in the blind babyEmbed
