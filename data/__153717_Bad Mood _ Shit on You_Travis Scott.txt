(I just have one question) Fuck outta my business
I did things that most men will ask forgiveness
Broke the code, the commandments from my descendants
Who gives a fuck? New children in the buildin'
We ride with no limits
Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me tryna finish?
I'm in a bad mood

Rob that dude, fuck that couch, burn that house
We the cause of the era, new niggas with new terror
A thousand on the leather, you niggas should know better
We niggas new slaves, I do say (Fuck, fuck)
Twice only on a Tuesday when I'm in a bad mood
Oooh, your skin mahogany (Fuck, Fuck)
Oooh, let's break the monotony
Government threw us in a maze (What?)
Had me trickin' 40k for some grades (What?)
Just to make 40k for the wage
Dropped out and made that in one day
I'm in a bad mood

Ooh, nigga I'm wildin' on 'em, back pilin' on 'em (Pilin' on 'em)
I never feel the pain, only God can make it rain (Make it rain)
So I must be Mary, Joseph, Allah
Kid of a disciple, these thoughts is suicidal
Jumpin' off a buildin', quit thinkin' like a psycho
They tryna find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty
Anxiety, after the meds, Kris Bobbi (Uh)
You might also like
Skinny black bastard ridin' a Casper (Casper)
I tend to lose my thoughts when I walk (Walk)
They say I'm a slave so tell me the master
Now his head on the pendant by the cross (By the cross)
Coke'd it then I fucked her for the theory
You know I'm crazy, I'm straight, no weary (No weary)
I hate when conversates can't relate
You know it be fucking up my groove when I'm in a bad mood

I can't wait... I can't wait... just to shit on you...

This one for the fuck fake niggas
That love to just hate, dog
Always talkin' that wild shit (Wild shit)
See 'em never let them verbs off (Verbs off)
All these fuckin' missed calls
Might delete the whole call log (Call off)
Thousand dollars for the jeans, fam
She grip 'em when a nigga swerve off (Yeah)
Think I need a desert eagle, niggas in my face (My face)
Thinking they know Jacques, niggas don't know me
Grew up on my lonestar, niggas roll that weed
(Niggas roll that, niggas roll that, niggas roll that weed)
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
Just to shit on you
I can't wait, just to shit on you
(But why, Travis?)
Yeah, I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
Just to shit on you
I can't wait, just to shit on you
Yeah
