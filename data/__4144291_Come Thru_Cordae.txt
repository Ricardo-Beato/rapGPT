We are Anonymous

She wanna write out luck, always fall for lames
Say that nigga's dawgs and we all the same
Rather lose sight cuz she saw the pain
Even fucked a nigga in the hall of fame
She woke up looking like a snack for breakfast
Mom from the islands but her dad from Texas
Her smile so arousing, it's a tad infection
Told her wasting time is a bad investment
We done been through some shit that I'm past regretted
Old nigga cold, better not, he mad and stressing
He doing five years for a quiet possession
Gotta show a nigga love cuz I lack affection
Got mad when she seen that I had erection
Stop faking, I just hit it in the back, Alexis
Acting brand new, knew I might snatch your necklace
Gotta teach you some things cuz the class in session

Cuz I been all 'round the globe
Walk 'round the house in my robe, yeah
Don't do drugs while I smoke
We can just roll by the door, yeah
You might also like
I know the way I'm moving is a bit precise
You only sticking with me cuz the dick is nice
And take you out shopping, tell you pick your price
We ain't having babies, no Fisher Price
Ain't no fooling me girl, you can't get this guy
See you tryna chase this stack with a bliss disguise
Can't be on home team if you switching sides
Got some new listeners, like this nigga nice
Ain't no secret to these hoes, how they operate
Man these bitches ain't shit, word to Dr. Dre
Hate to call my sisters bitches, but what not to say
I witness shit first hand, and I'm shocked today

I know you been through a lot today
I'll try my best to stay out your way
But who else gonna treat you real like I do
Five dollar box, drop top, drive thru
Always stood tall and you only 5'2"
Nothing else new, what did I do to surprise you
But it shouldn't though

Gotta keep it real with you
Don't know how to deal with you
Maybe overthinking, possibly it's just the still liquor
Even met your mommy, brother Tommy told me not to Hilfiger
Keep it all concealed, what's the deal, I'm a trill nigga
How I maneuver, hit it right to ya
Last nigga, Nick, ain't shit, he manure
Used to be the same, thank God that I grew up
Feel it in your guts, make you want to throw your food up
Imagine working hours and hours and nobody noticed yet
You shit on your peers, this shit is so clear
But still don't get no respect
I live out my dreams, this shit is serene
So I don't got no regrets
Woke up, feeling down and deadbeat
Then she lift me up, when she telling me
I know you been through a lot today
I'll try my best to stay out your way
But who else gonna treat you real like I do
Five dollar box, drop top, drive thru
Always stood tall and you only 5'2"
Nothing else new, what did I do to surprise you
But it shouldn't though1Embed
