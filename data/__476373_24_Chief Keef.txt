24's
24's
24's
Bang, bang, bang
They like all hail Almighty So
Damn, damn, damn
Almighty So
Bang, bang
All hail Almighty So
They like all hail
That dope...
Bang
Bang

They like all hail Almighty So
These bitches love me, these niggas, they don't like me though
I spend that money, get it back most likely though
I ride that 'Rari fast as fuck, fuck Aiki though
Just bought a pint, poured a 6 up in a 24
Just bought a Beamer, I'ma sit it on some 24's
Swish, Kobe Bryant, 24
For a verse I did want 20, now I want 24

What I'm ridin' in, it cost 124
Just bought a Gucci linen, that bitch cost me 24
I just bought four pints, that cost me 24
And I will take your life with my Glock 24
I smoke 93 but you smoke 24
My lawyer beat the case, it cost 'bout 24
Gotta take down my connect 'cause he want 24
He paid one for 16 but he want 24
Can't show you no 16 if you ain't 24
And when I was 16, my hoes was 24
My wrist cost 33, but I spent 24
My clip hold 33, but I shot 24
I get 24 hours of sleep then Iâ€™m up 24
My niggas gon' ride with me and that's on 24
All hail Almighty So
All hail Almighty So

They like all hail Almighty So
These bitches love me, these niggas, they don't like me though
I spend that money, get it back most likely though
I ride that 'Rari fast as fuck, fuck Aiki though
Just bought a pint, poured a 6 up in a 24
Just bought a Beamer, I'ma sit it on some 24's
Swish, Kobe Bryant, 24
For a verse I did want 20, now I want 24

Just bought a 'Llac, set that bitch on 24's
Flexing on you niggas, feeling like I'm Big Glo
Up in Cali, pounds going for the 24
Big Cuban Link, it cost about 24
Let me catch an opp, he gon' catch 24
Let me see an opp, I'm gon' stomp
I'ma take his life with this Glock 24
Pour a 4 in 20 ounce, call it 24
Doing shows, ain't no security at the show
But the Glo and these Glock 24's
Posted on the block, pulling 24's
Half a book of D, we get it for the 24
Only gun I'm carring is this Glock 24
Shoot him in his head with this Glock 24
It ain't no game, it leave big holes
RIP Zay, RIP Snupe
They like all hail Almighty So
These bitches love me, these niggas, they don't like me though
I spend that money, get it back most likely though
I ride that 'Rari fast as fuck, fuck Aiki though
Just bought a pint, poured a 6 up in a 24
Just bought a Beamer, I'ma sit it on some 24's
Swish, Kobe Bryant, 24
For a verse I did want 20, now I want 247Embed
