Takin' pictures of Q while he's sleepin'
It's a pastime
Uh

Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill (Chill)
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real (Real)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch (Punch)
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck (Fuck)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time (Hey, hey, hey)

The door's open, I might as well just stroll in
Got some Arnie Palmer in my pitcher: call it Nolan
Ryan, try it once and then you go there
I am hopin' that we can kick it, reminiscin' only about the good times
I know there's moments when you probably love me, but you didn't wanna show it
Now I'm all around the globe, with everyone but you
I know you fuckin' miss me, chill and keep it cool
Never gettin' old, mane, grown, no Rogaine
Fill your plate with all that food, you better eat the whole thing
This a family reunion, all the grandmas be movin'
Runnin' in three-legged races, people would cry if they losin'
When I was two, my slide was blue
When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand
When my bike was all I was ridin' on
Jewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it, I was happy still
You might also like
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill (Chill)
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real (Real)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch (Punch)
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck (Fuck)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time (Hey)

Come and step inside the Electric Slide
Sprayin' squirt guns at you like it's pesticide
So why you buggin'? Lil' man, stop buggin'
I gotta spend some time with some friends of mine
Get away from everything, go and rest your mind
It's not nothin', lil' man, it's not nothin'
All my little cousins actin' like some munchkins
Runnin' into trees, end up cryin' out their eyes
Have to rush 'em to the ER, maybe just a Band-Aid will do it
You can sing along, please let the band play the music
Always nice you can come back home
Your friends go off, but then they come back grown
Nice to know that you never alone
Family reunions whenever I'm home
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill (Chill)
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real (Real)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch (Punch)
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck (Fuck)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time (Long time)2Embed
