12 ContributorsBetta Listen Lyrics
Listen all you fellas, give her good lovin'
Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands
Listen all you fellas, then you won't have to worry, no no no
Listen all you fellas (You better listen, you better listen)
Listen all you fellas, give her good lovin'
Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands
Listen all you fellas, then you won't have to worry, no no no
Listen all you fellas (You better listen, you better listen)

Mummy I saw one day (One day), she was on some fume vapors
Givin' me lip so I continued with the caper
Cat litter had me sniffin' since outside the palace
Eyes sicker than AIDS, game harder than the callous
Tried to enter and shit, she had locks on the session
Tellin' me how her last man taught her ass a lesson (Damn)
Well, I'm not the mayor, I take care of my dimes
But I excluded I had nickels addin' up to her kind (Ha!)
Short stacks with a wristful of jewels
Sayin' she didn't need a man to make her out for a fool
"Dig it, miss, my love is credited in Cupid account
And if you need that extra help, I got the extra amounts"
Gigglin, figurin' I had jokes for her humour
Then she broke out with the words about knowin' all the rumours
"See, all you niggas rappin' be like pedigree dogs
Thinkin' that you can have me leashed around your microphone cord" (Ooh)
Somethin' 'bout her lit me up like July
And with them onions in the pants, I couldn't help but cry
Seemed lost in the essence, but i had to find my way to take
Action for the digits just to set up a date
Thought my shinin' was on (I had the skirts in the bag)
Until I took a bit of time to peep the price on the tag
She said "I'm that salt and pepa who like pushin' it to sisters
You need to get to walkin' with it mister, I think you better listen"
You might also like
Listen all you fellas, give her good lovin'
Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands
Listen all you fellas, then you won't have to worry, no no no
Listen all you fellas (You better listen, you better listen)

We was at some outside jam one Saturday night
When this pretty ass girl got locked in my sight
(She was a ghetto philosopher) Yeah, you know the type
Thinkin' Mary J. and Sade understood her strife
Caught me lookin', ("Yo what's cookin?") "Nothin' from around here
So don't approach or hope to be the man of the year"
I said, "Listen, deer or rabbit or whatever the hell you be
I'm not the one to embarrass, but the one to emcee
I've traveled the world's quarters on my relationships
Used and abused by hoes for my royalty stubs
(But above all) I brought my daughter into this earth
So I understand the need of women feeling of worth"
She glanced deep in my eyes and said "Oh shit, you're ill
I like the way your mind moves around at will
Still, let me apologise for soundin' so sassy
But niggas act as if my ass has a sign that says 'harass me'"
Her name was Gail from the Union of Dale
I made her remove the shades so her eyes could tell me the plan
("Yo where's your man?") "Oh, that nigga's past tense
Painted bruises on my face, haven't seen him ever since"
Gave a pinch to my bottom and started rubbing my back
She said, "I bet your ass is darker than a Mobb Deep track"
(Only one way to know it) And I was down to show it
(So we jetted) Back to my crib to set it, she made it known
"I've owned thoughts of you since that song, "meeny-meeny"
Can't believe you're about to be all up in between me"
Man, the flag was lowered, so my wood was raised
Followed by shielding of my building to protect me from the blaze
This granted access to southern parts of her borders
(Did you have her comin'?) Like the new world order
I caught her with the right combination (A good combination)
Keep her in your heart, man, you better listen
Listen all you fellas, give her good lovin'
Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands
Listen all you fellas, then you won't have to worry, no no no
Listen all you fellas (You better listen, you better listen)Embed
