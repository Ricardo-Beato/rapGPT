50 cent:
It's the big 10, its been 10 years since 50 cent is the future
I'm tired as a motherfucker
What you want me to be I've tried to see

Yeah bitch I got my second wind
You could pretend I ain't the shit
I'm guilty, I'm guilty
Yeah I'm filthy fucking rich
I'm strapped your honor
New mac, my armor
Point blank, catch in my bulletproof persona
New version of Dahmer
Pussy eating Piranha
My tongue touch your flesh
Your bitches say I'm the best
The crackers say I'm racial
Wait a cotton-picking minute
Now I'm racial
Cause I done put cotton-picking in it
Put a knot on your fucking head
Yeah that'll happen first
I'll put a dot on your fucking head
You'll end up in a hearse
They say I play mind games
Warrior mind frame
These bitch niggas always forget to say my name
Go ahead, I want you to
You fraud, I'm on to you
I'm so strategic you wouldn't believe it
And they know, everytime I come around
Pit stop and they tend to quiet down
Cause they know about me
