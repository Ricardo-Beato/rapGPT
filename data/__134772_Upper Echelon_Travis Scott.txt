Pull-pull-pull out the Seven, pull out the Rolls (Roll out)
We so high, upper echelon (Straight up)
We so fuckin' high, up-upper echelon (Damn, La Flame, straight up)
Pull-pull out the Seven, pull out the Rolls (Roll out, bando)
We so high, up-upper echelon (That dope, straight up)
We so fuckin' high, up-upper echelon (Straight up, damn)

Dozin' off them Xannies, just popped a bandie
Wave rock like Atlantic, froze like Atlantic
Party at the Sphinx, damn, that's so outlandish (Straight up)
She gon' make it clap, clap, throw them bands up (Up)
Walkin' through the Waldorf, they know my name, yeah (La Flame)
Dropped out, got signed, got mom house all in the same year (Straight up)
Don't you come around me, ain't got the time, B, nah (Straight up)
Watch me do the Randy, touchdown (Bricks)
Knew how much I get, think La Flame the golden child (La Flame)
Ridin' right behind her, pull up beside her (Skrrt)
We poppin' champagne, damn, you apple cider

Pull-pull-pull out the Seven, pull out the Rolls (Roll out)
We so high, upper echelon (Straight up)
We so fuckin' high, up-upper echelon (Damn, aight, Travis, let get it, Hustle Gang, nigga)

You niggas a mess, I swear you best show some respect
Or else I guarantee you'll get wet (Show us)
You fuckin' with us, I suggest you invest in a vest (Ayy)
A choppa no less than a tech (Uh)
You niggas want trouble in that, I'm the best
They just wanna talk, I ain't finna do that (Hey)
I just might pull up wherever you at (At)
Put my foot in your ass and a hole in your hat (Blah)
Okay, hol' up, let me freeze up (Okay)
These niggas must have caught amnesia (Say what?)
My face card in these streets, cuh (Ayy)
A-1 credit, no Visa (Leggo)
Excuse me, shawty, don't get me started
If your shit sick, my shit retarded (Okay)
Motherfucker can't see the tree but before I get wrong
Get shot then leave 'em in the forest
Boom, wait 'til the end of the Earth
Just to get my check, interfere, get hurt
Hey, first thing first, this what I do (Okay)
I'm a king motherfucker, who the hell are you?
Check suckers off top, I bet I do (I do)
Hustle Gang in it, bitch, you better lay down, fool
We crème de la crème, fuck them fuck niggas
Top shelf, upper echelon, can't fuck with us (Ayy)
Pull-pull-pull out the Seven, pull out the Rolls (Roll out, that dope)
We so high, up-upper echelon (That dope, straight up)
We so fuckin' high, up-upper echelon (Bando, damn, 2 Chainz)

Uh, pull up in the 'Rari, my ho beside me (Err)
It's a two seater, your bitch can't ride, ho, I'm sorry (Damn)
Let's get it jumpin', call it center court (Uh)
On the loud, you can smell that scent on me in court (Damn)
Just beat the case, call it Larry Holmes (Larry Holmes)
On the plane with your bitch and a carry on (Bro)
I-I-I do it for my city, then I fly away (Fly away)
I can see tomorrow, I'm so high today (High today)
I told 'em, "Let's pray," I keep killin' verses (Killin' verses, hahaha)
Your bitch with me, she wearin' killer purses
Pull out that Seven (Yeah), Mac-11
Pastor, reverend (Hol' up), Versace heaven (Versace heaven)

Pull-pull-pull out the Seven, pull out the Rolls (Roll out, that dope)
We so high, up-upper echelon (That dope, straight up)
We so fuckin' high, up-upper echelon (Bando, damn)
