35 ContributorsHundreds Lyrics
I got a hunnid in my TEC
I got hunnids in my pants
Got a hunnid on my neck
And a hunnid on my hands
Paid a hunnid for my whip
Hunnid guns up on my strip
Let a nigga try to rob me, get a hunnid hollow tips
Got some shooters in the hunnids, I got some that's not from here
Got a hunnid bitches tryna suck my cock from all the way here
Got a hunnid niggas with me, that's a hunnid volunteers
Countin' hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, get them ones up out of here

Got a hunnid for my AK12, that's a hunnid, hunnid
Rep that block with my niggas yeah, them 3Hunna monkeys
Got a hunnid in my robins, Balenciagas cost 6 hunnid
Give him poles a nigga gon' shoot him, got some shotters on 600
30 hundreds for my bed, thot came over and I fucked her
And she know that she can't trick me
She know it's me and my weapon
Me and my weapons, me and my niggas
Let 100 niggas try me I'll burn 'em, ayy
Put bullets on niggas like a freckle, ayy
Coming real far with a Wesson, ayy
But I like that instrumental, ayy, ayy
Tryna cop me some billions, ayy
Hunnid niggas here, a hunnid niggas there
Hunnid niggas everywhere with their guns in the air
Dududuh, dududuh, karma in the air
Hunnid dead bodies, hunnid damn shells
Got hundred in back pocket, hundred in my front pocket, ayy
I got hunnid in this fat rocket, I'ma let it bombard, ayy
And I be with the Simpsons, been friends with young Bart, ayy
And I got all this green with me, I look like a young tart, ayy
You might also like
I got a hunnid in my TEC
I got hunnids in my pants
Got a hunnid on my neck
And a hunnid on my hands
Paid a hunnid for my whip
Hunnid guns up on my strip
Let a nigga try to rob me, get a hunnid hollow tips
Got some shooters in the hunnids, I got some that's not from here
Got a hunnid bitches tryna suck my cock from all the way here
Got a hunnid niggas with me, that's a hunnid volunteers
Countin' hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, get them ones up out of here37Embed
