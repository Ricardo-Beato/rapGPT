1 ContributorIRS Freestyle LyricsWhat you gon' do when IRS come for you?
Pay that money
What you gon' do when IRS come for you?
Pay that money
I'm in the purple haze porsche dutch colored seats
My young boy blowin dro, and he itchin to reach
I'm the blueprint, already know who the nicest
Without me, they stuck in an identity crisis
These blue stones don't come with no prices
The modern cleopatra but they callin' me isis
It's tax season, time to face the IRS
I've been lenient, but now it's time to pay ya debts
I don't ridе the beat, i make lovе to the mothafucka'
I'm in the booth, with nothin' on but a diamond garter
You see, it's bigger than nino and the carter
How you think you coming off when your boss was my partner
I'm in the choppa, ms. thang, you can have the lane
'Cuz godmomma on to bigger and better things
You see these stripes on my arm, i'm a veteran
The game hurting and bitch, i'm the novocaine
Haters, where you at? i dare you to holla back
I got my foot on they neck like a chiroprac
All that tough talk, what happened to all of that?
I got a siamese twin, they call her copycat
You ain't got to acknowledge that
But you can roger that and you can copy that
I see 'em rocking chanel so i prada that
The doll baby, trendsetter follow that
I heard a fuck boy said i ain't been hot since '97
I beg to differ, turn to Hot 97
They still tryna be me from '97
I'm still eating off my shit from '97
No single, no album, still draw 'em out
I keep a hot sixteen, watch me pour 'em out
This ice freeze him up, the heat thaw him out
And he don't get hard for you 'cuz i wore him out

Y'all already know what it is
It's tax season we coming to collect
What you gon' do when IRS come for you?
Pay that money
What you gon' do when IRS come for you?
Pay that moneyEmbed
