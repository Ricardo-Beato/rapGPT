Turnt down niggas get they bitch shot at
Catch ya baby momma slipping at the laundrymat
Got the whole crowd cheering like Fonzie back
My army strapped, blazed where Bonzi at?
Got em wishing at the well that they see a nigga fail
Rather see me in jail then doing well like the white folk
They ain't even want Mike Jones, still tippin
Leave the tip on the table as I serve you niggas
I still ride around the city like I murder niggas
Bad hoes get Roethlisberger'd
No lies, preserve
Curb That, Enthusiasm just a lil bit
We ain't' fucking round with them rounds, cuh they still equipped
Warfare, Guerrilla clips, hold that, throwback, Darko Milicic
Sons got lojack, find ya babysitter crib, run up in that ho and blow that lil' muhfucka away
Is it wrong if I say, I'm feeling better than anybody's ever been
Herring Bone chain and some skeletons, pelicans
Rap niggas telling fibs, you ain't really selling shit
If you is, lead yo crib up like cheap paint
I tell my niggas C-safe cause the beach ain't
Most the niggas telling you to practice what you preach fake
You never talk about the dirt that you do
Cause in interrogation pigs can say that heard that from, you

And real niggas don't play by the rules, we just go hard
In yo front yard with the tools, let em dump off
Called Matlock, got the case dropped
Riding all around yo city with the safe off (x2)
