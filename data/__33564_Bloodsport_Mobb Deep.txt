38 ContributorsBloodsport Lyrics
Turn them headphones up (Know what I'm sayin'?)
Yeah
To my man Nigga-No, yo
Killa Bee
No doubt

I kick that progress and to that dumb nigga, God bless
I know you can't sleep or rest behind that bullshit
Now you rock a vest, scared to death while you walkin'
Fuck the talkin', we straight up New Yorkin'
We blowin' niggas, heart attack strokin' niggas
Provokin' niggas, shittin' all over niggas
You rollin' thick, but yo, the Mobb rollin' thicker
Get that liquor, turn your back, icepick ya
But fuck that, stickin' with the gat is quicker
Scared to come around my corner, you ass, nigga
Do it your way all day, fake shit
What you gonna do outta town, play bitch?
And run like a faggot, switch, take the whole shit
And show the world, don't sweat it, babygirl
I gotta hem and pull the gat like a stem
You all fucked up like an offbeat blend
I send messages that you couldn't read clear
Try to play the front, but got stuck in the rear
Take it as a letter, but I'm not sincere
You might also like
Yo, this ain't rap, it's bloodsport
Your life cut short,  you fell short
The pressure's on high, full-court
My team form killer instincts and firearms
Dangerous thug minds and brainstorm wars
The life of a wild rebel who run wild, click, blaow (Blaow)
Nigga, lay down, queer, stay down
P'll disappear in hydro cloud
While you runnin' at the mouth a hundred miles, I'm out
Mobb style from the depths of Hempstead, get ninja'd
I creep quiet, keep the live nigga inchin', listen
Who are you to throw your fist in? Hit like a bitch
Run like a faggot and take the whole shit
That's it, I had to pass here with the shit
It's time for showtime, let's see how deep things get
You wanna talk tough and act all delinquent
You find yourself all bloodied up and shamed-ed
Me and my man pioneered this violent nigga rap shit
Bust a gat, kid, me no fear that, I'm laughin'
What's up then? Let's take it there and touch somethin'
I'm a maniac, brainiac, fanatic for that
Capable of combat, P counterattack
In some hot wheels sendin' shots out from the back
It was a foul way to go, Kicko
You know the ropes so (Bloodsport, motherfucker)
Ayo, the rottweiler
Chewin' chihuahua-ass niggas, pull 'em by the collar
And let the lights dim it
And you'll be swimmin' in a puddle of reality juice
Fatality too, this rap shit is the bitch you shouldn't married into
To the set of prenuptial, got paid and too comfortable
It's all good, read 'em on the humble
And while you shinin' in the spotlight
I got this dot right to aim right and stop life
The trife life, ain't no part twos (Hell no)
When it's over, it's over, you hit
Now send your soldierlys through
Yo, chewin' chihuahua-ass niggas, pull 'em by the collar
And let the lights dim it
And you'll be swimmin' in a puddle of reality juice
Fatality too, this rap shit is the bitch you shouldn't married into
To the set of prenuptial, got paid and too comfortable
It's all good, read 'em on the humble
And while you shinin' in the spotlight
I got this dot right to aim right and stop life
The trife life, ain't no part twos (Hell no)
When it's over, it's over, you hit
Now send your soldierlys through (Nigga, bloodsport)4Embed
