2 ContributorsAnother Day Lyrics
Good morning niggas
Good morning, good afternoon, goodnight
Whatever time zone you are listening along to this hot mellow shit
Make sure you get your ass up and go do some shit
Let this music get in your ass and make you move fast
And don’t be late to class with your late ass
This is a hot compilation called The Cathedral
By my main man, my ace, my mellow fellow, Talib Kweli Greene
Ha ha ha, speak on it God
And if you didn’t hear me the first time I said it
Muthafuckin’ speak on it God

Peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like anoth- peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like anoth- peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like anoth- peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like another day
Like yesterday, we take it back to another day

The attribute Kweli, ain’t no acronym involved
It’s a blessing to be alive, God is love
So I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
That we despise because they killas of the vibe
These capitalistic rappers is plastic, obey they masters
Your hustle kill your people then your hustlin’ is backwards
You the maker not the owner of your dream and
Man it hurts the devil couldn’t have planned it better
You couldn’t have planned it worse
Call my son, son, cause he shine when he smile the sun
Distance from the Earth is like 93 millions miles
Beat up the track like a pugilist
I come correct I never sell out on the foolishness, who is tis?
Put the money in my hand, never the grown ass man in the club doin’ the new dance
I keep it grounded, stay true to my sound
They throwin’ rocks but them niggas never comin’ for the crown
Slain of those who fight for what is right
You not owed and you never promised nothin’ in this life
Married to the block but you gotta renew your vows
I see the devil smile as you walkin’ down the aisle
For the dollas now we facin’ extermination
But I have knowledge of my self-determination
Criminalisation of an entire generation
Mass incarceration’s a muthafuckin’ bad situation
The knowledge and the wisdom is your power
I see God in myself
I won’t diss the next rapper you just hafta pay your dues
Fuck a rapper, I compete with James Baldwin and a Lagston Hughes
So my baby’s born to think this is the way of us
They take the babies from the fathers so it ain’t no trust
They say they want the new self-destruction
But ask ‘em what they payin’ and they sayin nothin’
They put they people before us (murderer)
They say this land ain’t ours (murderer)
But when you focus on compassion that’ll lead to your understandin’
(Facts only, facts only)
Know your freedoms (murderer)
Try to live righteous (murderer)
The nigga Kweli been droppin’ knowledge since Washington Square park cyphers
Speak on it GodYou might also likeEmbed
