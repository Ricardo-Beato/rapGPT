1, 2, 1, 2, Yo
Yo 1, 2
Nothing is Quick in the Desert
1, 2
Yo

Not put here to judge between the quick and the dead
I be slick with this nick of time rhyme that I said (Go!)
Digitize the present, download it in a minute
The future is now, cause there ain't no frontin' in it
Steady stayin' chained to that wagon of old ways
That last pass second, we now call the old days
Yesterday slaves, just hangin' to get hung
Oblivious to those slangin' poison with the tongue (Yo!)
Unaware that being everywhere just ain't no lie
Desert MCs those who deserve to die
Or get poor trying, bitch stop lying
Everybody sellin', but ain't nobody buyin' (Uh!)
Adrenaline rushin', like my blood be gold
Like in 1849, rhyme soul is sold
Like all good people could be cowards in the end
And the death comes quick in the desert my friend
Nothing is quick in the desert!

The radio, the TV, the worldwide web
Nothing is quick in the desert!Embed
