Go off (Go off, go off, go off)
Go off (Go off, go off, go off)
Go off (Go off, go off, go off)
Go off (Go off, go off, go off)

Go off (Go off)
If you a bad bitch and you in your bag
Go off (Go off)
Go 'head then with yo' sexy ass
Go off (Go off)
And all my dope boys gettin' plenty cash
Go off (Go off)
Throw some racks as she shakin' that

I go off like a AK, turn ya sidewalk to a runway
Yeah, you know my waist snatched, face beat, hair laid
Gonna heat it up like a souffl√©
Queen Bee gon' reign forever
I'm Mother Nature, I determine the weather
The way I slay, you bitches could never

Go off (Go off)
If you a bad bitch and you in your bag
Go off (Go off)
Go 'head then with yo' sexy ass
Go off (Go off)
And all my dope boys gettin' plenty cash
Go off (Go off)
Throw some racks as she shakin' that
Go off (Go off)

Diamonds dancin' on my AP
Tellin' me it's time to go off
(Go off, then, go off, then)
Go off
(Go off, then, go off, then)
Go off

All my fam in New York
Shooters in Cali, my Zoe's in Miami
Go off like finale
ATL blessin' all the trap niggas that's dope
Galliano, vintage Gaultier
I had more Balmain than Olivier
Over 365 pair
I can attend fashion week for a whole year (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Go off (Go off)
If you a bad bitch and you in your bag
Go off (Go off)
Go 'head then with yo' sexy ass
Go off (Go off)
And all my dope boys gettin' plenty cash
Go off (Go off)
Throw some racks as she shakin' that
Go off (Go off)
Diamonds dancin' on my AP
Tellin' me it's time to go off
(Go off, then, go off, then)
Go off
(Go off, then, go off, then)

I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Don't play with my blood or my money
Gotta whole lotta people dependin' on me
I roll with a pack of wolves so best believe we gon' eat
I think it's time to go off

Go off
If you a bad bitch and you in your bag
Go off (I think it's time, I think it's time)
Go 'head then with yo' sexy ass
Go off (Go off)
And all my dope boys gettin' plenty cash (I think it's time)
Go off
Throw some racks as she shakin' that
Go off

Diamonds dancin' on my AP
Tellin' me it's time to go off
(I think it's time, I think it's time)
(Go off, then, go off, then)
(I think it's time, I think it's time)
Go off
(Go off, then, go off, then, I think it's time)
Go off
(I think it's time, I think it's time)
Go off1Embed
