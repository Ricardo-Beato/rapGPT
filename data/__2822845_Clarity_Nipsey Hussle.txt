20 ContributorsClarity Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

I limo tint the coupe ainâ€™t no clarity in my whip
That Rollie bezzel dazzle, that's clarity on my wrist
That .40 get to dancin', I carry it on my hip
I ain't gon' feel no pressure, don't care how these niggas feel
I ain't gon' keep stressin' on problems, I'm doin' drugs
You can't see it how I see it, you can't keep up
All my enemies defeated, we run it up
All my money go away when I count it up

Used kiss my granny, make my mornin' swerves
Foggy window in my Cutlass was my learning curve
Keep a couple pistols in my furniture
Every time they serve my set, we came to service yours
Tell you somethin' bout my city in case you never heard
All these gangs in competition, who gon' murder more?
We never wave no white flag in this urban war
Head shots so you murder stars
Check out my perfect form
Straight out the eye of this perfect storm
I did my mine with a perfect score
Don't waste time we just work some more
Rolls Royce raps and my tone is Forbes
I'ma take it overboard
Goyard by my .44
Go hard cause this world is yours
I'ma pay that fee
Smoked out with E-40 on
Bossed up like a Corleone
In these Maybach seats
You might also like
I limo tint the coupe, ain't no clarity in my whip
That Rollie bezzel dazzle, that's clarity on my wrist
That .40 get to dancin', I carry it on my hip
I ain't gon' feel no pressure, don't care how these niggas feel
I ain't gon' keep stressin' on problems, I'm doin' drugs
You can't see it how I see it, you can't keep up
All my enemies defeated, we run it up
All my money go away when I count it up

Projects to the condo, thinkin' bout should I decorate?
Only motivation I ever needed was Section 8
Pissy staircases, rats and roaches, wasn't restin' late
Coke and dope we separate
Ain't bagged it yet, they better wait
S600 black Mercedes-Benz, I love the features
Free my cousin, the D's caught him with 100 pieces
Foreign visas, smokin' in Japan, I'm from the cement
One of the homies start tellin', I ain't wanna believe it
Backwoods still burnin' out, Maserati murkin'
This that shit they ain't heard about, certified in person
Real niggas serve a purpose, write my life out in these verses
Clarity in this Rollie, my bitch into Fendi purses
On Slauson with no license, Nipsey told me bring a two liter
20,000 on me, I just made that shit off two features
Cuzzo just came home and all he askin' for is new sneakers
Sun up to sundown I used to trap, I was like who need it?
Dave East nigga
I limo tint the coupe, ain't no clarity in my whip
That Rollie bezzel dazzle, that's clarity on my wrist
That .40 get to dancin', I carry it on my hip
I ain't gon' feel no pressure, don't care how these niggas feel
I ain't gon' keep stressin' on problems, I'm doin' drugs
You can't see it how I see it, you can't keep up
All my enemies defeated, we run it up
All my money go away when I count it up3Embed
