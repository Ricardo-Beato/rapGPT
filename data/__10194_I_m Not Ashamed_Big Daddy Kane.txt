3 ContributorsIâ€™m Not Ashamed Lyrics
I can't hold back any longer
I can't prolong my feelings for you any more
You know all of a sudden I feel this certain need to..
.. express myself to you
You see before I felt kind of funny to say these kind of things
I mean to be all honest, that is, but now.. hmm..
Well let's just say I'm not ashamed
Now in my lifetime I've been all around the world
(Round and around and around)
From city to city, from state to state
And of course, from girl to girl
(Ooooooooooh-eauuuuuuu-ooooooooooooh)
And I believe that I've played every game in the world
That one man could possibly play (don't play with me baby)
And of all those games, you're the only chip on the table
That's made me feel this way (aiy-yi-yahhhhahhhhhhhhh)
Now I realize that love takes time
And trust is somethin that you have to earn
(Oooooooh, you gotta earn it baby) mmm
Well I'm prepared to give you all of me
But, I need the same in return (ooooooohoooo you know you got it)
These are some things that I've been meaning to say
And for my concealed feelings I've come to realize
That I'm to blame (arrrrrrrrre you sure)
So I have to take a little time out to get together
Now baby, I'm not ashamed
You might also like
Let yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)
Express yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)
Try to make me see (I'm not ashamed)
What sparks would start this flame
Take it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)
Never let me go (I'm not ashamed)
I want to let you know (I'm not ashamed)
Don't ever feel ashamed

You know just yesterday I portrayed my life as a player
(mmm-hmmm) Looked at every woman as ahhh..
As ahhh.. as just a one night affair
(One night love affair)
Now all of a sudden I feel this change that makes me lonnnng
For some type of commitment (don't you want it)
Nah, since I said _Ain't No Half-Steppin'_ (talk to me)
Aww yeah, I'm with this (c'mon)
And let's become two of a kind, a perfect pair in which
All feelins are the same (c'mon)
All love and respect
And never ever, feeling ashamed

Let yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)
Express yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)
Try to make me see (I'm not ashamed)
What sparks would start this flame
Take it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)
Never let me go (I'm not ashamed)
I want to let you know (I'm not ashamed)
Don't ever feel ashamed
Let yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)
Express yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)
Try to make me see (I'm not ashamed)
What sparks would start this flame
Take it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)
Never let me go (I'm not ashamed)
I want to let you know (I'm not ashamed)
Don't ever feel ashamed, talk to me baby!
Huhahhhhhhh, ahhohuhhahahhhh
Ahhh just let yourself be free
Ahhh come on and talk to me
Huahahhahhhhh try to make me see
Ooooohoohoooooh, you see I
I know that you played every game..
Ahh but I love you just the same, hooooh
We'll take it nice and slow yeah
We don't ever have to let it goooooooo
Nooooo yeah, don't you ever feel ashamed, no no!
Let yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)
Express yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)
Try to make me see (I'm not ashamed)
What sparks would start this flame
Take it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)
Never let me go (I'm not ashamed)
Wanna let you know (I'm not ashamed)
Don't ever feel ashamed sugar
Let yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)
Express yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)
Try and make me see (I'm not ashamed)
What sparks would start this flame
Take it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)
Never let me go (I'm not ashamed)
I want to let you know (I'm not ashamed)
