27 ContributorsDashing (Reasons) Lyrics
The nigga had a pair of Air Olden Polynice's on
Oh shit, the nigga had a pair of Air Christian Slater's
Rebel I, slay the max, it's really Digital
Rockin' the latest in, every day comin' at niggas
Rockin' the latest in Ben Stiller-wear
Fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as Hollywood niggas
Now that's a money thing
Yo, yo

I was dashing through the hood
Eighteens with the whip smoke gray
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh
Smokin' all the way (Hahaha)
With my all-star team
Bitches see our shine
Yo, son, we gotta make that cream
Whether raps or nicks and dimes
They call me Rollie, watch me poly with the wide body Dinali
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey
I swarm like paparazzi
She popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block me
Sippin' on rum, Bacardi got me toxy
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti
Snatch the cream, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giulianni
Like I'm still coppin' big eighths from papi
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky
Kamikaze, might karate lock ya head
Like a natty dread, then pour myself Calarasi
Professionally trained, I aim for your artery
I give the autographs but charge for photography
Not hardly kid, you awkward Godbody
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wally's
Spark the broccoli, spaz off this ghetto opery
Or catch the hot seat, you're batty bwoy without ya posse
Seen

Come come come, want more
Without, son, give me the reason
Come come come, want more
Without, son, give me the reason
Come come come, want more
Without, son, give me the reason
Come come come, want more
Without, son, give me the reason

They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?
While the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
Tainted the fabric of an empire, was torn apart
Brought to a halt from a front full assault
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results
They say the swordsman sift electrical volts
The audience go nuts with loose screws and bolts
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
It was layin' in the zip drive from chest five
Come come come, want more
Without, son, give me the reason
Come come come, want more
Without, son, give me the reason
Come come come, want more
Without, son, give me the reason
Come come come, want more
Without, son, give me the reason

You blind fool we have our teachings to share
Our joy with the people
And there too suffer for them as well"
