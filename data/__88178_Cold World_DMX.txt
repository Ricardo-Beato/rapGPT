28 ContributorsCold World Lyrics
Does it really get this cold in the summer
Does it really get this dark in the day
Do they really turn they backs when you talkin'
Would they lay somebody's else's head where you lay
Do they find it easy to be hard
And find it even harder to be easy
You know sometimes I close my eyes and I wonder
If I ever left how much you'd miss me
Oh, somebody told me blood was thicker than water
If a man can say that he can recognize his own daughter
And if hell is below would you pay the price to go
Then I can make it to heaven for sure

This is a cold world (what), cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way
This is a cold world (what), cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way

Cats don't know what they say what they talkin'
So I just let a nigga say what he feel
Fuckin' with the kid they gon' end up in the coffin
'Cause I'ma say what I gotta say with the steel
Niggas hatin' 'cause I got a job
I know it's they job to be hatin'
I'm a dog so I don't fuck with cats
'Cause they gon' have me livin' in a state pen
It's about time I reacted
Look what y'all did to this rap shit
Knowin' niggas is wrong, come on with the cat shit
Wack shit, get niggas torn down, slapped quick
Blam, blam, blam, go down that quick
Actin' like the truth was gone
And I'm sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one
It's 2 piece, leave your faggot ass toothless son
I go hard, dog don't do it, too late, it's done
Hold up, I'ma show you why dog is the illest, kill this
You might not catch it, but you'll feel this
The realest nigga to ever do it
The realest nigga to ever go through it and y'all gon' bring me back to it
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Middle name is grime, came from crime
You thought I'ma change with time, niggas don't know me
Let your man hold somethin', you ain't got it, nigga show me
You might also like
This is a cold world, cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way
This is a cold world, cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way

The tunnel looks bright up from behind but you gotta keep movin', movin', movin'
Because if life stops spinnin' in the right direction whose losin', losin', losin', losin'
See in the night, I pray to keep me breathin'
To see another day to give them somethin' to believe in
'Cause I know it won't always be this way
When you tryin' hard to make a change4Embed
