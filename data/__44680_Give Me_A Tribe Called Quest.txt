Ali Shaheed Mohaa-a-a-a-med

Doing our thing in Queens
We had dreams about being emcees
And there was no concern about so and so
And these record companies
But now we all are grown
And the spots is getting blown
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
Nah, we ain't none of them, B
Give me, so give me
Nore, Phife Dawg and Abstract
Give me, to everyone in the world
Nore, Phife Dawg and Abstract

Yo in Iraq, all my niggas love Abstract
Yo, from Far Rock to Flushing, concussion
Every time a nigga rhyme it's like we get our bus' on
I used to ride a dollar van and really get my bus on
Yo, from South Don to El Segundo
All my niggas getting high yo, and still living on the run though
Get a lot of dough so now we have a lot of fun though
Q-U, two E's, N-S
All we really care about is money, cheeba and sex
What what what
You might also like
Niggas get faded, never outdated
Give it to the world cause for long they waited
Shorties online to cop the new CD
So Hip Hop I bust nut in graffiti
We could two-piece it or we could just cease it
Shorty on my shit cause my style wild decent
What's it gonna be, the party or the precinct?
Queens cats rock, keep it rugged and recent
My nigga Nore thug it out (thug it out, no doubt)
Phife Dawg bugging out (bugging out, no doubt)
The Love Movement no doubt (Love Movement, no doubt)
Ali Shaheed get a shout (shout it out, no doubt)

Yo, esperate, hold on, take a time out
Huddle up, yo, Queens niggas won't fuck it up
Keep my Southside niggas just playing the cut
While my Queensbridge people stay roughing you up
East Elmhurst, Corona, Ayatollah
Keep the caller ID on the Motorola
Gotta keep the po-po on the payola
Queens niggas shut it down, now it's all over

192, the Bouley Fran Lew
Merrick, Van Wyck, Hollis Ave, Guy Brew
Head up Jamaica Ave cop a tape by DJ Clue
Move to the Acres, sipping on a guinney brew
Scooping ladies up in ??? makes my day complete
Freestyling over beats for my peoples in the street
This is a place where stars are born
Linden to Laurelton, we keep it hot like porn
Doing our thing in Queens
We had dreams about being emcees
And there was no concern about so and so
And these record companies
But now we all are grown
And the spots is getting blown
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
Nah, we ain't none of them, B
Give me, so give me
Nore, Phife Dawg and Abstract
Give me, to everyone in the world
Nore, Phife Dawg and AbstractEmbed
