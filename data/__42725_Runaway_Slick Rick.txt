6 ContributorsRunaway Lyrics
Well, I waited long time sweatin it
Gettin jerked but yea I'm gettin it
Early mornin, stiff's the dawnin' of
Cuz a brother give the warnin' of
A new we do we and
Paranoid to near silly and
I said meet me in the lobby skip
So one could cut down on the chubby tip
Alright, he flighty scared
To be in fear to show a mighty that
La Di Da Di wanted Gotti and
Although depending on the body and
Who I know was gonna runaway, how am I to live to serve the next day
When I know she's gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God's King


Check it out, even candle light I figure and
Better handle it my nigga and
I think the best thing is to block her out
Cuz she doesn't give a fuck about
Someone change the choony and
You would of cared to wish the u-nion
She's not a phony, turn the Sony off
You better overcome the lonely of
Although a brother leaden bad
Thus don't know where I'm headin at
You see, cause even though we fought a bit
I find that just the very thought of it
When I know she's gonna runaway, how am I to live to serve the next day
When I know she's gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God's King
And I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be wit him, can't believe that this is happenin

Well, I should say fine phoney gone
Although you say that I'm the only one
But, behind my back's thinkin of
Her father not the one I'm thinkin of
I'm distrustful what one done to end
Down wit this burden here I'm wonderin
I know I should say fine fair to ya
And think about all the girls ahead of ya
Though hard for me to just forget her and
Try to follow to the letter end
Although the terrible things we riff about
Her father wise that I can't live without
When I know you're gonna runaway, how am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God King
When I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be wit him, can't believe this is happenin
I know you're gonna runaway, I know you're gonna be wit him
Seems I know you're gonna runaway, I know you're gonna be wit him
Can't believe this is happeninEmbed
