Ooh, I'm startin' over
Stackin' in it, it was the top, now are you alright?
I'm quite alright, damn, my money's right
Yeah, ayy, yeah, it's quite alright
I wake up in the morning, then I'm gettin' back to it (Back to it)
Yeah, yeah, I'm gettin' back to it
You ain't show me no love, so I turned my back to you
Yeah, yeah, I can't give no racks to you (8…)
I don't really care 'cause I'm done
On the real, our love is not fun
There's no emotion on my face 'cause I'm numb
You see me everywhere you look, no, you can't hide or run (Yeah, Lil Uzi, yeah)
Woah, everything I said
Messin' with your head, messin' with your head
I said, everything I said, messin' with your head
Messin' with your head, woah, messin' with your head, woah

I've been textin' her all night (Night), she know I was doin' wrong (Yeah)
She left me right on read now, I'm walkin' with my head down (I love you)
I gotta keep my head high
I got a whole 'nother check, not talkin' verified (Okay)
Rest in peace my dead guys
I am no hater, yeah, we in the same whip
The only difference is that you do not own it (Skrrt, skrrt)
I can just tell by the way that you drivin' it
I pull up in that car just like it's stolen
Yeah, I came a long way, came from the hallway
I can't stop, keep goin'
Yes, my life just feel like one long day, I just live in the moment
Woah, ooh, comin' out just when the sun down
My boys, they ruthless like coupes and they really run down
I got paper cuts from hundred dollar bills covered in bustdowns
Countin' with my thumb now, money make me numb now
You might also like
I don't really care 'cause I'm done
On the real, our love is not fun (Yeah)
There's no emotion on my face 'cause I'm numb
You see me everywhere you look, no, you can't hide or run
Yeah, everything I said
Messin' with your head, messin' with your head
I said, everything I said messin' with your head
Messin' with your head, woah, messin' with your head, woah

I just got richer overseas, yeah
Lookin' at my watch and it's a Richard and it's green, yeah
I'm still smokin' on that good, know I'm blowin' out that steam, yeah
You wouldn't even believe the numbers stuffed up in my jeans, yeah
Tell that girl to back-back, gotta stack racks (Ayy)
No, I can't go out sad, can't go out bad, yeah
I told that girl I'm not no duck, this ain't Aflac, yeah
I don't wanna get older, I'm still livin' in my last year
I hope my life just keep goin', don't worry 'bout that
Just tighten up and keep flowin', cowabunga
She gon' ride me like wakeboard (Yeah)
I'm lickin' on her body until she don't make noise, yeah (Noise)

I don't really care 'cause I'm done
On the real, our love is not fun
There's no emotion on my face 'cause I'm numb
You see me everywhere you look, no, you can't hide or run
Yeah, yeah, everything I said
Messin' with your head, messin' with your head
I said, everything I said, messin' with your head
Messin' with your head, woah, messin' with your head, woah
Woah, I said, messin' with your head, woah
Messin' with your head
Yeah
Thank you
No, really, thank you
You're far too kind
You, and you, and you, an experience of a lifetime
I see all of it (Yeah)
Yeah, I really appreciate you160Embed
