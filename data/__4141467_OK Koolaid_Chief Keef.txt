Okay, cool
Okay, cool
Okay, cool

Money on my mind, okay, cool
Money on my line, okay, cool
If you get money all the time, okay, cool
And if you don't, ayy, okay, cool
Okay, Kool-Aid (Okay, cool)

Okay, okay, okay, Kool-Aid (Ayy)
I don’t fuck with niggas, no it ain't cool (Ayy)
I was eatin' noodles, sippin’ drank, Kool-Aid
World wanna know what's in my drank, Kool-Aid
Take look up in my bank, Kool-Aid
What my dick like? Say it tastes like Kool-Aid
When yo bitch see me, she fiendin' on Kool-Aid
Take 50 out the bank, not Kool-Aid

Okay, cool, bitch, my tool go with my shoes (Ayy)
