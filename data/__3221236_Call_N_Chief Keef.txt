Zaytoven!
(Pour drank on the carpet)
Sosa baby, GBE baby
(The haters, they talk shit)
Bitch, catch up, catch up
(Got your hoe free from an auction)

Had to take one second
To think about all these motherfucking blessings
Yeah, I got a license but I'm driving real reckless
Designer done turned to a fetish
She gon' eat the hot dog 'cause I get the relish
Come and get this work 'cause you know I gotta settle it
Before I get the coupe, yeah, you know I gotta test it
'Cause I cut into this hundred thousand and invest it

In the strip club, throwing money like it's nothing
Smoke that bitch out, now the police fussing
Make the po' man nigga know that we coming
Shorty on X, don't tell me if you see something
And what I'm smoking smelling like I'm eating onions
Remember growing up like I gotta be something
All this fucking cake like I gotta eat something
And I'm tryna quit but the drank keep callin'
You might also like
Had to take one second
To think about all these motherfucking blessings
Yeah, I got a license but I'm driving real reckless
Designer done turned to a fetish
She gon' eat the hot dog 'cause I get the relish
Come and get this work 'cause you know I gotta settle it
Before I get the coupe, yeah, you know I gotta test it
'Cause I cut into this hundred thousand and invest it

Pour drank on the carpet
We on our guap shit
The haters, they talk shit
But later, they walking
Got your hoe free from an auction
She steady talking
I be steady flossing
Organizing boss shit
(Bang, bang-bang)

Had to take one second
To think about all these motherfucking blessings
Yeah, I got a license but I'm driving real reckless
Designer done turned to a fetish
She gon' eat the hot dog 'cause I get the relish
Come and get this work 'cause you know I gotta settle it
Before I get the coupe, yeah, you know I gotta test it
'Cause I cut into this hundred thousand and invest it
At the strip club, throwing money like it's nothing
Smoke that bitch out, now the police fussing
Shorty on X, gon' tell me if he see something
Yeah, what I'm smoking, smelling like I'm eating onions
Remember growing up like I gotta be something
All this fucking cake like I gotta eat something
And I'm tryna quit but the drank keep callin'
Drank keep callin'
Drank keep callin'3Embed
