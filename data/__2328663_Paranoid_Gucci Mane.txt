10 ContributorsParanoid Lyrics
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
Gucci Mane the trap God and I had you paranoid
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
You can run but you can't hide cause I can see you, boy
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
Gucci Mane the trap God and I had you paranoid
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
Gucci Mane, I'm on that ass, I got ya paranoid

I see you, boy, see you, boy, might not wanna be you, boy
Made me pull that heater, boy, I sip on lean, that eastern, boy
Shout-out , boy
My bitch is bad, she get you picture-perfect, Mona Lisa
Don't step on my sneaks
Two chains on like Tity Boi,  you know Clayco my bity, boy
Drop the top, no ceilin', boy, man, get out your feelings, boy
Duct tape a nigga like Alley, four rings on, no Audi
Pulled up in the Audi, all these money problems
There's a drought on Act? I got it, I heard there was an outage
All this money pilin', niggas paranoid around me
I breakdance in the park, they call me Gotti MC Hammer
Free Guwop, Guwop, Guwop, nigga, king of East Atlanta

Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
Gucci Mane the trap God and I had you paranoid
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
You can run but you can't hide cause I can see you, boy
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
Gucci Mane the trap God and I had you paranoid
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
Gucci Mane, I'm on that ass, I got ya paranoid

Lord knows that llama on me, fuck you and your dead homies
Plug dead, juggin' Taylor Swift, pussy shot at me but the nigga missed
Ballin' 09 poppin' cleats, your favorite rapper lame, he just poppin' shit
It's a doggy dogg world, baby girl, better get your money, don't fuck for free
How the fuck you Muslim with a Jesus piece?
I can tell he nervous when he look at me
Murk your lil homie, wipe his house with bleach
Imma teach ya pussy niggas not to reek
Imma teach ya pussy niggas how to beef
Imma teach ya pussy niggas not to talk
Nigga freezed up when he shot the four
Throw the E's up like a GD4

Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
Gucci Mane the trap God and I had you paranoid
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
You can run but you can't hide cause I can see you, boy
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
Gucci Mane the trap God and I had you paranoid
Paranoid, I got ya paranoid
Gucci Mane, I'm on that ass, I got ya paranoid1Embed
