137 ContributorsRabbit Run Lyrics
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel, like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up, I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just put it all into all, I spit
'Stead of always tryna swallow it, instead of starin'
At this wall and shit while I sit, writer's block
Sick of all this shit, can't call it, shit
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
I'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up
Blow this buildin' up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yeah, sit up, I'ma tell you, who I be
I'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you, closed-minded fucks, were too blind to see
Whoever finds me's gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express, how I'm really feelin' at that time
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
It's just  “Sometimes”, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
I'm desperate at my desk
If I could just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck, I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin', nope
It's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit, until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fuckin' boilin' point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed
An MCs worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me, and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'
By the screams of 'em, you would swear, I'm sawin' someone
By the way, they're runnin', you would swear, the law was comin'
It's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'
“Momma, Jimmy keeps leavin' on us
He said, he'd be back, he pinky promised, I don't think he's honest”
I'll be back, baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock! I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back, and rub my shit in your face, bitch!
I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream, 'til I have half a lung
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it—Rabbit, run!You might also like90Embed
