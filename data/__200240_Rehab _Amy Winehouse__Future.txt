Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Uhhh, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Yeah, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab

Codeine in my system, movin' slower than a Screw tape
And I took a Vicodin like I got a tooth ache
Purple in the Sprite, I mix it up, I’m like a scientist
Have you ever took a shroom? then you Miley Cyrus
Started take the MDA and man I think I’m in NBA
Sipping purple, sipping yellow, 24 out today
Smoking on that California, first thing when I awake
Sound of the wife it go, you can call me Future blake
I heard she like to hit the flake, I heard she like to sip the lean
‘Bout to take her to the moon, I’ma fuck her on the bean
Drinking me some dirty Sprite, I won’t drink it if its clean
Welcome to my drugs state, Amy Winehouse R.I.P

Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Uhhh, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Yeah, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab

Uhh, I just tried the Miley Cyrus
Uhh, and I'm feelin very violent
Uhh, Ion know which car I'm driving in
Uhh, you say you sell it then I buy it
Drinking Easter Pink, smoking loud and it stinks
My eyes wide open, I can barely damn blink
I’m rolling like a 18 ruler down the street
Future Hendrix working I ain’t been to sleep in three weeks
Rockstar status, I get higher than a satellite
I gotta blow the strong just so I can have a appetite
Astronaut forever nigga even in my afterlife
Rest in peace to Amy Winehouse I’m bout to take flight

Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Uhhh, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Yeah, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab

Mix the purple with the Sprite – it turn pink
Sprinkle molly in the drink and then you drink
I’m Young Pluto but right now I’m off of Venus
I stay turned up to the max and I be leanin
My girl say I need some help but I can’t see it
I know Scotty and I’m fresh in European
I keep shades over my eyes because they real (cause I'm high)
I would never be sober until I’m dead (ain’t no lie)
I blow kush to clear the stress that’s in my head
I took a percocet, now I can’t feel my legs
I’m in your city and I just jumped off the jet
Rest in peace to Amy Winehouse, I can’t forget ya
Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Uhhh, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Yeah, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab5Embed
