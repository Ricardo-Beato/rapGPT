12 ContributorsBall On Yâ€™all Lyrics
Haha (Yeah, uh)
Okay ('Preciate y'all niggas)
War (Uh)
Thug, what the fuck it do, nigga? (Yeah)
Huh? Baller status

Ayy, I'm a product, you can order me (And what?)
It's Audemar, Gucci and Louis V (Louis V)
Them hoes used to throw up, now them bitches swallow (They swallowin' shit)
I used to drink shots, now it's out the bottle

I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line and I'll call on y'all (Okay)
If I ever fall I'll fall on y'all (War)
It's like the referees with us how we ball on y'all

I bossed up on 'em when I copped the coupe
And opened up they eyes when I dropped the roof
I ain't Rick Ross but I'm a fuckin' boss
I told her she can ride if she give me mouth
But she gotta hurry up 'cause we headed South
And she gotta do Thug if I switch the route
They say I'm bougie 'cause I travel with my Louis bag
But when I reach I take my Gucci out my Louis bag
New boss, y'all out, vetoed
I'm transferrin' money from my EVO
New house, so I'm lookin' through the peephole
'Cause ain't nothin' s'posed to be here but the kilo
You might also like
And I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall I'll fall on y'all
It's like the referees with us how we ball on y'all

No homo but we balls on y'all
I fell to the sky, call it a sky fall
No, we do not fall, we are not y'all
We go the hardest, ROC Crew smartest
New condo, I can see Madison's garden
And I'm in the Four with the green, no Rick Marvin
Now I got to work for the fiends, no more starvin'
No more starvin', Marvin
I'm ridin' this beat like it's takin' me to a million
They gon' take me to prison, 'cause I made a killin'
Ten racks on me, my own money, no rentin'
And if you try to take it you'll get left with no ceilings
Shoot him in the chest several times, that's no feelings
Shoot the fuckboy from the upstairs, no feelings
If he fuck over Thug money, no more dealings
Still fuck with white boy, shouts out to Willie
Your bitch in the condo suckin' on all us (All us)
She be suckin' on all us
She's a anteater, she just suckin' on all us (They swallowin' spit)
So just swallow this dick
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall I'll fall on y'all (Capo)
It's like the referees with us how we ball on y'all (Yeah)

Okay, now hundred thousand dollars in a rubber band
Ayy, fuck them haters, they ain't shit 'cause they ain't got a plan
I got a vision for the paper, y'all just think I'm playin'
Life bigger than what you see but y'all ain't even carin'

I remember when I used to call on y'all (Okay)
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all (Let's go)
If I ever fall I'll fall on y'all (Okay)
It's like the referees with us, how we ball on y'all (Okay, Thug, let me get that)

Yeah, straight off the top I can name niggas that really bitches
But Corey got the beat runnin', so no time for snitches
Now that I'm on I can get you all off like light switches
Now I ain't switchin', I'm just tellin' you how it is
Most of my niggas died but they never got to live
I do this shit for us, let's go
And I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall I'll fall on y'all
It's like the referees with us how we ball on y'all

And I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line and I'll call on y'all
I ever fall I fall on y'all
I'm so straight I'm gonna fall on y'all
Too straight, I'm gon' fall on y'all
I'm so straight, I'm gon' fall on y'all
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now I'm so straight that I fall on y'all
We outEmbed
