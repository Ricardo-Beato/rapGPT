6 ContributorsBuilt to Last Lyrics
I went to sleep with a sweat, woke up poppin' tags
Couple hunnid thousand cash, wipe me down with a rag
Got two hunnid on the dash, put piranas on your ass
Real niggas built to last, this the future, fuck the past
I went to sleep with a sweat, woke up poppin' tags
Couple hunnid thousand cash, wipe me down with a rag
Got two hunnid on the dash, put piranas on your ass
Real niggas built to last, this the future, fuck the past

Went to sleep on Ferragamo
Got a closet for a condo
I might wake up in a penthouse like I'm inside Neiman Marcus
Poppin' tags and I'm heartless
I'm a hustler and a artist
I roll me up a forest
I can freestyle a portrait
A couple hunnid thou' cash, comin' for the fortunes
I'm livin' in the skybox, Louis V, Porches
Purple drink endorsin', horseshoe, no horses
Six gear Porches, y'all niggas extorting
Lesson for a check, Corvette on my neck
Catch me runnin' to the guala, bet I won't break a sweat
Bad bitches, good sex, good bottom, good neck
Give her two thumbs up, real niggas rock baguettes

I went to sleep with a sweat, woke up poppin' tags
Couple hunnid thousand cash, wipe me down with a rag
Got two hunnid on the dash, put piranas on your ass
Real niggas built to last, this the future, fuck the past
I went to sleep with a sweat, woke up poppin' tags
Couple hunnid thousand cash, wipe me down with a rag
Got two hunnid on the dash, put piranas on your ass
Real niggas built to last, this the future, fuck the past

It's like peace up, A down
Rich nigga, cash cow
My ice, bling-blaow
Fuck later, we eatin' now
Stack white boys, Ace Miles
Make it rain like grey clouds
Bad bitch, front seat, ass up, face down
Fear the black cats, I'm superstitious
Swagger right, true to my religion
Glass pot, metal fork, whole block water whippin'
Haters hate every day, wishin' they could play my position
Came up without a pot to piss in
Bent ends we hittin'
Foreign coupes, we whippin'
Playin' around, your ass end up missin'
Dunked out, found by a fisherman
Smoke your ass like a swisher
Rose by the pitcher, got lean by the liter
Treat every day like it's my birthday
Fresh like every day we 
I went to sleep with a sweat, woke up poppin' tags
Couple hunnid thousand cash, wipe me down with a rag
Got two hunnid on the dash, put piranas on your ass
Real niggas built to last, this the future, fuck the past
I went to sleep with a sweat, woke up poppin' tags
Couple hunnid thousand cash, wipe me down with a rag
Got two hunnid on the dash, put piranas on your ass
Real niggas built to last, this the future, fuck the past

You livin' in the past, I'm makin' moves for my kid's kids
New era, no lense, put piranhas on your wig
You will never think again, your whole face sinkin' in
Put your brain in the wig
At the bottom of the lake pussy niggas can't swim
At the top of the fountain, you tryna soak it in
Bangin' on this Columbian chick, I'm prayin' for my sins
Can't fold in the trenches, won't break, won't bend
Future settin' trends
Let him blossom, no kid
Paper tags, wipe me off
Poor nigga, high class
No Pistol, no mask
Future comin' for your stash
Went to sleep countin' cash, woke up in a Jag
I went to sleep with a sweat, woke up poppin' tags
Couple hunnid thousand cash, wipe me down with a rag
Got two hunnid on the dash, put piranas on your ass
Real niggas built to last, this the future, fuck the past
I went to sleep with a sweat, woke up poppin' tags
Couple hunnid thousand cash, wipe me down with a rag
Got two hunnid on the dash, put piranas on your ass
Real niggas built to last, this the future, fuck the pastEmbed
