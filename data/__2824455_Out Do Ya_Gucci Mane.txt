If I ain't a millionaire then my lil' boy can grow a pussy (Same)
If Guwop ain't 'bout his business, then Popeye must be a sissy (Uh)
And if you ain't gettin' money, I don't wanna talk to you (No)
'Cause how you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Ayy, yeah)
I'm not politically correct 'cause, bitch, I ain't no politician
I can't hang 'round none of you niggas 'cause you niggas might be snitchin'
But I ain't gotta deal with you, nigga, I don't eat with you (Fuck you)
But how you bitches let these bogus-ass niggas sleep with you? (Uh)
I can't live with you, lay with you, take that pussy with you (Show)
I can't put up with you, play with you, ain't got free dick to give you (Yo)
They tried to be cool with you, chill with you, take no pictures (Pictures)
What the fuck, I look like standin' by you police-ass niggas? (Woo)

How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Huh?)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Damn)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Woah)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Huh?)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Damn)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Hm?)
Your pockets in the red and I don't wanna talk to you (No)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Guwop)

I'm laughing to myself 'cause these rappers so broke (Yeah)
They sold no dope, they don't want no smoke (Nah)
How they let a nigga in the feds out, do 'em (Huh?)
I ain't got no rap, I let my chopper talk to 'em (Grr, pow)
A nigga need me, I don't need no nigga (No)
I'm the shooter and the boss, I don't need no killer (Huh?)
The money that he make don't make me richer (Richer)
I'm the slickest nigga walkin', I don't need no feature
Sittin' on the hood of my brand new Bentley (Huh?)
Old neighborhood with some brand new jewelry (Woah)
Big diamond rings like an old school preacher (Huh?)
Bitch let a nigga out the feds, come beat you (Yeah)

How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Huh?)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Damn)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Woah)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Huh?)
How you let a nigga in the fedsâ€”? (Damn)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Hm?)
Your pockets in the red and I don't wanna talk to you (No)
How you let a nigga in the feds out, do you? (Guwop)
