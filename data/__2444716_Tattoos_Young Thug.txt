We got London On Da Track

Yeah yeah yeah
I got a feelin', one of these niggas gon' try me
No I'm not fearing, my bitch got tattoos and piercings
Yeah, she got tattoos and piercings, tattoos and piercings, bitch
Tattoos and piercings

Ten racks on shawty too
Ten racks on brothers too
Ten racks on sisters too
Ten racks, on Rollies too
Ten racks, on Bloody too
Ten racks I give you two
Ten racks, I need a few
Ten racks, gon' pay my dues

Don't like your middle man
Boat life like Gilligan
I push the ceiling in
None of you trill as him
I done went brazy
Talk 'bout equations
Penthouse a play pen
Boolin', I'm lazy
I done bought so many mollies, I'm in Michigan
Put my hoe friend out the spot, you know she listening
And I might be in some trouble if she mention it (Sheesh)
I might get a bitch a band, just to look at them (Look at them)
I done iced out my gold rollie
It look better than a trophy
And these bitches conniving, I know all these bitches want me
They gon' fuck my lil' homie, yeah, yeah, they bogus
I'ma pull out screaming hokey pokey okey
You might also like
I got a feelin', one of these niggas gon' try me
No I'm not fearing, my bitch got tattoos and piercings
Yeah, she got tattoos and piercings, tattoos and piercings, bitch
Tattoos and piercings

Ten racks on shawty too (Yeah)
Ten racks on brothers too (Yeah)
Ten racks on sisters too
Ten racks, on Rollies too
Ten racks, on Bloody too
Ten racks I give you two
Ten racks, I need a few
Ten racks, gon' pay my dues

Take out some time and just count it
I don't like old schools, I'm not mounted
YSL, bitch, I'm the founder (Slatt)
Suck dick and get an allowance
What do they know about my swag?
How many bands in my bag?
Bitten and curbing the style
Fifty-six thousand on cabs
Paid for my taxes I did not have to cheat (Nah)
I am no Beyonce but I'm a big B
I got extendos, not talking no tees
You smoking Indo, don't stand next to me
I get my weed from Snoop Dogg, it's OG, yeah
Money still growing on trees, yeah
Rich nigga ride with police, yeah
Won't jeopardize none of these pieces, yeah
I got a feelin', one of these niggas gon' try me
No I'm not fearing, my bitch got tattoos and piercings (Sheesh)
Yeah, she got tattoos and piercings (Tattoos and piercings bitch)
Tattoos and piercings

Ten racks on shawty too
Ten racks on brothers too
Ten racks on sisters too
Ten racks, on Rollies too
Ten racks on Bloody too
Ten racks I give you two
Ten racks, I need a few
Ten racks, gon' pay my dues (Dues)
