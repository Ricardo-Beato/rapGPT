8 ContributorsFeel Good Hit of the Summer Part 2 LyricsThis, this is your... day
Little Pat, the fuck was that?
I won't lie little homie, they opened up doors for me
Still hoping there's a moral to that story
I think about all the time dedicated to getting inebriated
We did it just for the sake of it
Your family physician is a dope man
That new prescription got you open
Came a long way from visions of spirits
Now we getting lifted off the cough syrups
I saw up close how fucked up coke was
So I was always too neurotic for the powder narcotics
Huh, but I'm a pot head, functional alcoholic
I don't binge though, I understand the logic
I like hash but that shit's always hidden
And I've never seen peyote here in my jurisdiction
Never used a needle but I know 'bout the sweats
'Cause I'm addicted to coffee, cigarettes, probably sex
Ecstasy is too damn strong for me
And the intensity lasts too long for me
Plus I figure I don't need any buzz
To make me any more needy than I already was
Huh, and to be real I don't trust them pills
Somebody's mobile home laboratory up in the hills
Or maybe bikers in a basement, dirty and nervous
Tryna measure out the right amount of laundry detergent
You might also likeHallucinogenics, who's tempted
To bend your perception for a few seconds?
Actually it's like a half-day gave away
A deal that you made to do nothing but play and pray
Please dear God, don't want to vomit again
I promise from now on I'll stick to marijuana plants
Mushrooms and me will not be friends
Until the next time that Nate shows up with tops and stems
Gobble 'em, yum, no, tastes like shit
But you'll forget about that once they kick
And for me acid was the same trip
Until the part came where you wonder what it's made with
Think about it, you're so high sitting there
Thinking about thinking about it, so high sitting there
Strychnine sick, vision impaired
Found the meaning of existing on the floor in your kitchen, yeah
I ain't gonna tell you that you better not do it
But master your high, try not to abuse it
Stay away from me if your life's getting stupid
And please stop pretending that it makes better music2Embed
