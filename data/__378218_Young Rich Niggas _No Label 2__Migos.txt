Migo! (Migo we winnin', winnin')
QC! (Migo we winnin', winnin',)
(Migo we did it, did it)

This is, what it is; Young Rich Nigga

Now when everybody see us they say:
Now look at that young nigga pipe down everytime you see him
Now look at that young nigga can't catch him with no new friends
Now look at that young nigga he ain't get many hoes way back in the day
Now look at that young nigga can't keep these hoes up out his face

Just now warming up, might pull up in an armored truck
With a hundred blue million bucks
I told you brah, that we so dangerous, yo niggas ain't the same as us
I gotta thank God for the blessing
Pocket salad, extra dressing
He always got a nigga flexing
Know that I have to get the Smith & Wesson
If you wanted to ball
You gotta run with it and score a touchdown
If you wanna be a rap artist
Gotta take over your town (the city!)
If you wanna be a dope dealer
Gotta be moving a pound (Ew! Gas!)
Young nigga just stay focused
(If you did it) You can be rich right now (rich!)

Now when everybody see us they say:
Now look at that young nigga pipe down everytime you see him
Now look at that young nigga can't catch him with no new friends
Now look at that young nigga he ain't gave me the whole way back in the day
Now look at that young nigga can't keep these hoes up out his face

I'm richer than Richie, now all my bitches they miss me
I was broke I remember
I stashed it away in my memory
I know niggas that envy me, jealousy
Wondering how did I get rich with these felonies
God keep on telling me;
'Please just focus!'
I came from roaches to Lotus
They hung my brother like posters
The Lord he told me I'm chosen
Now all my jewelry is golden
Sipping on purple potion, take away all the emotions (Lean!)
Christian Louboutins, I'm not running from my emotions
This is, what it is; Young Rich Nigga

Now look at that young nigga can't keep these hoes up out his face

Unfortunate, ya'll fuck niggas can't fuck with us
Hundred gas bags in the monster truck
Usain Bolt, I'ma run it up
Real street nigga that love to hustle, came from the gutta
My nigga be flexing, pressing
I'm fucking that bitch that you texting
You stressin? (Haha)
We just sitting in here counting cash, trying not to laugh
All of these presidents, OG gas
Sipping on Actavis out the glass
Hundreds older than the ThunderCats
What would you do, if you found out that your face card wasn't approved
Ain't no money getting extorted
Look at that what these streets will do
This is, what it is; Young Rich Nigga
