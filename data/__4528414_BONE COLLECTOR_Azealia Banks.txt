8 ContributorsBONE COLLECTOR Lyrics*Muffled/ Inaudible/ Messy Vocals*

Sometimes I feel like I wanna go bang, I...
Mm, I see, the creature, in my vision
I, I met someone, somewhere, in this cave
The Fear, I've felt for so long
All of my Contempt, arises from pain
I, I'm screaming, so no one can hear me cry
There ain't no other option Babe
(you're) Here to die!
Sometimes I feel like I wanna set one of these motherfuckers on fire!
*Laughs*
You know?
I just look at these fucking weak..fucking..stupid MEN and I just want to set them on fucking fire!
You look like the kind of guy who would ask me to spit in his mouth..
You want me to spit on you?
You want me to do it?
You want me to destroy you?
Of course that's what you want!
Open your mouth and I'm gonna spit!
Ok...Get ready...You might also likeEmbed
