At ease
I would like to welcome the newest No Limit Soldier
Mr. Snoop D-O Double G, and he brings to the tank
Money, power, respect, leadership, street knowledge and wisdom
AHH YAH...D.P.G., yah D.P.G
Pop the Champaign
Once you break this of you can't get twisted
So pay attention and listen

Welcome to my world nigga, where its V.I.P
And the bitches and the bud for free

Welcome to this world that you never thought existed
And you got to be a soldier to be enlisted (listen)
I'mma take your mind, your body and your soul
On a whole lil' trip, just don't loose your grip
Wait a second (Wait a second), were is the sack
You don't have to ask no questions, just jump in the back
And leave your strap, 'cause ain't none of that
Were we goin', it ain't nuthin' but 808 beats and flowin'
Niggas showin' niggas love, hoes suckin' dicks
That's how we do it, cus everything is in the mix
Doggy Land, Doggy World, Snoop World whatever
It don't matter cus we 'bout it, and homies down to do whatever
Everything is legit, and the bitches the shit
And niggas they give you love, 'cause they down for it
Now that's just how it goes, and all the hoes on me
And everything is V.I.P, and that's on D.P.G
Now nigga creep in, just like a liquor store
Now nigga if you want a ho, nigga just let me know
I'll send a H, and when she gets you (got you)
She with you forever, and a day, that's the D.P. way
You might also like

Wipe your feet before you enter in
Now take a seat and peep dis beat and sip yo' gin
Cus ain't no killin', everybody chillin'
Steady stackin' paper from the floor up to the ceilin'
Now in my world, a bitch is a girl
And mans best friend is his ends, and his mothafuckin' benz
But chall can't get in just cus you all say you chall down wit us
And try to get around wit us, and hang around wit us, and clown wit us
Hold on, this shit here is for the establishment
Niggas that's havin' shit, and if you ain't roll on and stroll on
This is the spot were the bangers at, the slangers at
Were red and blue equals green, and we probably be black
In fact we stack G's for them keys, so when we finished doin' deeds
You all can't believe what we did
Provide an opportunity in the community
Tryin' to spread a lil' unity between you and me
Since IM the mayor, I think I gotta say-ahh a lil' something
Lets keep it jumpin' playa (playa)
Ain't too many places that you know about
So everybody in the world, welcome to the muthafuckin dogg house

UGGHHHH!, picture me ballin' (ballin')
3rd ward hustler out the ghetto of New Orleans
Some say life is like a fairy tail (fairy tail)
Did a song with Snoop Dogg, and it turned into a business deal
But it ain't bout da ends, cus we all got matches and we all got benz's
It's about riddin' with the homies (homies)
Gettin rid of the fake and lookin' through the phonies
And the haters can't stop this, check billboards, number one
The only company with a profit, So say Ughh and How You Do Dat There!
It's No Limit and D.P.G. nigga we don't care!


Yah, Snoop World
Home of the No Limit Soldiers, Beats By the Pound
You know how we do dis, ain't no stoppin' this
We can't be stopped, we run da streets
You feel me, da streets is ours
Ain't no stoppin' this shit nigga
Ain't No Limit neither, your lucky
Yah, it's on for life
Yah, gunna drive this tank overseas
Gunna get these g's, while we smoke on these trees
YAHH !
Welcome to my world nigga, and its V.I.PEmbed
