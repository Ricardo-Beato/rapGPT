Ayo, I'm tired as fuck
That's what we should call this joint, "Tired In Malibu," huh
Yeah, yeah
I'm 'bout to fall asleep, like, shit
I'm 'bout to
Ayo, everything remain raw
Everything remain raw
Everything remain raw
Bussin', bust in the motherfucking house

Ayo, check the steez
Shut the fuck up and get off of these
I spit degrees like a professor, never the lesser
Spit flames like gas, but your wordplay Tesla
Word to Elon, huh, never the lesser
I keep the strap in the top drawer of my baby momma dresser
Throwback like a flux capacitor
Shape-shift like an Animorph
You comin' up short like a dwarf
And my shit never the same
My fire inevitable, your shit never the flame
Fuck the rap game, got you in a headlock, best tap, mane
Super duper looper-type flow, and I'm the Gat', man
Back in the day, Big Lenbo gave me my rap name
Retired for a minute, but I guess I'm back, manYou might also like1Embed
