10 ContributorsNever Coming Back Lyrics
I get money, stacks
I've gotta get that
Niggas they be hating, then they body get wrapped
All these shots hit that, they motherfucking hat
When I hit a bitch, she know I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back, never coming back
Smoking strong, bitch I'm high, I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back, never coming back
If you front me some cash, it ain't never coming back

 ryms, these bitches be sentimental
I lend him some shells we call that rental
Grab my  and God be with him
We win we can't lose, still racks we gotta see
Remember when I first met that money, she took the player out of me
My earrings how I freeze, pussy niggas give me allergies
Man I'm all about them stacks, I'm with it to the max
When I hit a bitch, she know I ain't never coming back
I'm never coming back, and yes ima run with that
Get high with my partner nem, fucking all these bitches too
Like I'm in high school, you lame and I can't sit with you
Me and my niggas bout that money, we down like our ass
I believe I can fly and nobody smoke loud as much as I
You might also like
I get money, stacks
I've gotta get that
Niggas they be hating, then they body get wrapped
All these shots hit that, they motherfucking hat
When I hit a bitch, she know I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back, never coming back
Smoking strong, bitch I'm high, I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back, never coming back
If you front me some cash, it ain't never coming back

See me I dress casually, according to the shopping spree
Yeah you know I'm getting that, got loud bands, I'm cool with that
Got cash can't take me off the map, 40 on me take his 
Tryna run, send shots, don't test me
On cloud 9, ballin hard, knock it out like a golf cart
All my hittas gotta eat, don't trip shit
Drilla got combo, what I been miss
Niggas shooting they ain't really tryna hit shit
Talk shit, bitch up
Poor nigga styles, they act up
Chief Keef, SD, shouts out to Front Street
Picture perfect, painted up
Lames they mad, can't fuck with us
Blackgate, we drill hard, summertime, gotta deal cards
Fuckboys, they won't leave, they acting like they know me
Head shots, no leg shots, nigga trippin, tryna put me in a dead spot
I need money, stacks
I gotta get that
Niggas they be hating, they body get wrapped
All these shots hit that, they motherfucking hat
When I hit a bitch, she know I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back, never coming back
Smoking strong, bitch I'm high, I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back, never coming back
If you front me some cash, it ain't never coming back

Smoking on that loud pack, and I'm never coming back
Bitches like what I'm smoking now, now they smoking that
Shawty telling me she love me, so I tell her "yeah yeah"
Is it then diamonds in my ear, maybe that, hell yeah
Sippin goose, stuntin hard, listen shawty I be 
Talk about life, only started, fucking em light leave they ass in the dark
I go hard, 
Somebody lied, I'm not a star
Bad bitch yellow, sum like 
 but bitch it's hard

I need money, stacks
I gotta get that
Niggas they be hating, they body get wrapped
All these shots hit that, they motherfucking hat
When I hit a bitch, she know I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back, never coming back
Smoking strong, bitch I'm high, I ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back, never coming back
If you front me some cash, it ain't never coming backEmbed
